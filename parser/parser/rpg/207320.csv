												This is my personal favorite game in the Ys series. It has my favorite combat system and Adol is your playable character for this Ys game. I love a good challenge and this is the most challenging game in the Ys series. Many people won't ever complete it on Normal difficulty (you can choose an easier difficulty though). The boss battles in this game are extremely challenging, yet not cheap in the slightest. You need to learn how to dodge all enemy attacks and you will feel great about doing it with this fantastic combat system. Theres nothing special about the storyline or graphics in this game, its obvious that everything was spent on developing the combat system and boss battles. You have a main town that you visit for supplies and forging new equipment, while traveling the world for new dungeons to explore. Theres lots of secrets, upgrades and new abilities to find throughout the game. Theres also some small sidequests you can complete for achievements and other rewards.The game will last you around 15 hours and you unlock a Boss Rush aftering completing the game. If you like action RPGs, this is a must buy.			"

												Best in the series. An excellent game where it's polished for the highest difficulty. Nothing is as satisfying as struggling through this game on Hard, then coming back to play on Inferno and see that everything has become harder (while not being unfair) but so did I, and it was manageable. There are more than a dozen bosses in the game and there's like 1-2 bosses that's actually feel obnoxious. Also the kickass music, great level design and a lot of other things just flow so well together.If you want to choose between this and Ys: Origin, I'd recommend this. Origin has more things (3 characters) and more stuff to do with, but some of its bosses have healing abilities and pretty much you to mash buttons constantly. It's still an excellent game, so buy both.			"

												If you ever needed a game to make you feel like a man, this is that game. If you need hair on your chest, and adventure in your heart, this is that game. If you need a game that will make you moist, this is that game. Like Terranigma or Zelda on steroids, Oath in Felghana grabs you by the plums and squeezes until you cry. Blazing fast sword stabbing action. Perilous platforming. Nightmarish challenge. This is the game you must own, you need to own, you DESERVE to own. And you will, surely. And eventually, you will rise to the challenge. You will conquer Felghana like the righteous man you are. Walls will be destroyed, monsters slain. Will you rest? NAY. For your true love, your precious heart, Adventure, calls. And like Adol, you must move on, seeking that mistress that is always out of reach. You must go to the Origin, and then to the Chronicles. Your hunger will not be satiated, but you will have a further taste of that precious nectar. Adventure awaits. Let her in. You'll be glad you did.			"

												Ys: The Oath in Felghana is a rare beast on the PC... well it is to me. Before I broke down and bought it I stared at its gameplay video in steam. I stalked the title for months on end. I was delighted to see a JRPG on Steam. Would my delight be broken, or would I take the oath and never look back?First off I must say I played this game to completion with a gamepad. I never even once tested out the keyboard ad mouse controls. This type of game just screamed use a controller to me haha. The game controls perfectly with a gamepad. Every little command I used worked, and never were the controls broken. A++ on that.Sound design in Ys is all about the music. The sound effects are very basic and serve the game well, but do not stand out at all. The musical score on the other hand does stand out. Each piece was moving, and the guitar driven battle themes fit perfectly. Never once did I feel like I wanted to put on my own soundtrack while playing the game. If it's any testament to the games music, I would even go into the options menu just to play the games soundtrack a few occasions.The story of the game is its weakest area. The game uses nearly every JRPG trope. I knew of every upcoming plot twist and action. This made me really sad as someone who enjoys a good narrative. I must admit though that not once did the narrative become convoluted. It served its purpous rather well, and that was to transition from dungeon to dungeon and the awesomely addicting gameplay.The gameplay of Ys is where it's at. A simple mixture of semi strategic hack n slash with a dabble of platforming and RPG light elements. Combat is fast, fluid and when you get hit it's ultimately you're fault. The game doesn't offer that much in terms of different combos. You can perform only basic ground and air combos. You can't knock an enemy into the air and combo them further. What you can do is cancel combos to get in more hits. There are 3 magic in the game, but playing on normal I didn't find much use for them. The most useful if magics is the earth dash as it nullifies enemy attacks. Once you get this magic it'll be you're go to magic. This is because the game doesn't feature a shield or dodge roll which some may find annoying, but I understood it as part of the game.Level design is simplistic and yet very well done. That being said, there are a few areas where you can enter a new screen keep holding the same direction, and move yourself back into the previous area. It's a personal annoyance to me. These areas are few and far between so it's not that big of a deal. The platforming segents mainly located towards the end of the game are well thought out. I initially believed I was going to have trouble with them until I realised your character shadow does appear on the ground. This way you could at least tell where you might land. For people who fear platforming there is a mode in options to make it even easier, and even at that there no fall related deaths in the game.The bosses are where the game really shines. Each boss fight presents a new challenge and build upon eachother as the game progresses. You're first time playing the game the bosses will kick your ♥♥♥, unless you're an uber-gamer, don't get discouraged. Their attacks hit hard, and require precise timing to dodge. There is also limited time to hit the bosses. That window becomes less and less as the game goes on forcing you to get better with your attack dodging. This type of progression is saught after by me, because no matter how much someone could power level, you still need the skill to back it up. Speaking of leveling in this game, I didn't have to grind more than one time, and the combat is so fluid and fun it didn't even feel like grinding and lasted all of thirty minutes anyways.Ys: The Oath in Felghana isn't an expierence I'll soon forget. Nearly all elements of the game blend harmoniously into a polished hidden gem just waiting to be stumbled upon. I thought I was risking $15 paying full price for the game, but my apprehension was laid to rest quickly.			"

												Ys games are all action RPGs where you control one character (usually Adol, though Origins has no Adol and I think Seven has multiple character options?) against the world in a story-moderate environment. (moderate compared to Falcom's other RPG series, Legend of Heroes) Grinding is generally expected to some extent, but that'll only ease the pain so far -- especially as you get to the end bosses. They're also known for their amazing rock/metal soundtracks.As for this particular Ys game...one word: Brutal.I've played Origin, I & II, and VI on Steam and this one still annihilates me...on NORMAL. What separates most of the difficulties is simply damage caused by enemies and enemy health, and the enemy patterns can be difficult to make out after your first 10 or so attempts at a particular boss. Just a fair warning -- you need to be in the zone while playing to stand a chance...or you just need to be better than this reviewer.Aside from that, it's a loose remake of Ys III, the one ""platformer"" of the series and as such, this one has a lot of platforming elements. Thanks to the fixed camera, though, the 3d platforming is pretty simple and straightforward.One disappointment worth noting: Some PSP features like New Game+ (which itself was very minor) and refining gear up to level 9 are gone from this port. Seems strange, especially since the achievements beg ""replay"", but it's not anywhere near a deal breaker.			"

												Adol Christin has wandered back into our living rooms with a familiar tale: The Oath in Felghana is a full-fledged remake of Wanderers From Ys. And, when I say ""full-fledged,"" I really mean it. From the storyline, sound, gameplay and graphics, every aspect of the original game has been completely enhanced. The result is an experience far more ambitious than Wanderers From Ys, the most commonly criticized installment of the series, would have ever dreamed of becoming.In terms of storyline, Wanderers From Ys was relatively simple and straight-forward. After the complete liberation of Esteria and Ys (as observed in Ys Books I and II), Adol and Dogi decide to visit the Town of Redmont, Dogi’s hometown. Upon their arrival, they realize that, gasp, the land has been overrun by monsters. The two heroes meet up with Elena Stoddart, a childhood friend, who eagerly explains the recent events. To further complicate the situation, the local mayor has been kidnapped, and Elena’s brother, Chester Stoddart, has abandoned the town. Since becoming knighted in the service of King McGuire and Valestine Castle, his demeanor has changed, and the general public suspects that he’s become involved in something sinister. And, naturally, what could be more sinister than the resurrection of an ancient god of destruction? Thankfully, The Oath in Felghana completely expands upon this old storyline, fleshing out each of the classic characters, adding new ones, and seamlessly weaving each into the tale.As expected, The Oath in Felghana shines in the gameplay department. Those who have played Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim will easily recognize similarities. Adol hacks and slashes a bloody swath through countless monsters, always with speed and precision. Oath, however, introduces a new 'combo meter' which serves as an experience multiplier; for each successful hit, the meter rises and an experience bonus is granted. This bonus can climb as high as 1.99x the original experience granted from defeating an enemy, resulting in nearly double experience. If the chain breaks, however, the bonus is reset to 1.00x. Interestingly, Adol is no longer able to use/stock healing items; rather, enemies drop them in battle and provide instant recovery. In addition to healing items, enemies also drop Strength, Defense, and Magic Potions which provide temporary enhancements to the respective traits. Similar to the combo meter, these have a timer attached, so defeating enemies quickly is the key to maximizing their benefits. Adol also has a ""Boost"" feature at his disposal; after having dispatched a certain number of enemies, he will be granted the ability to Boost, which provides a temporary increase in attack speed. As you can see, speed and accuracy are the keys to success.Aside from combat, Wanderers From Ys' equipment system has been subject to revisions as well. The infamous 'Five Magic Rings' have been replaced with 'Three Magic Bracelets.' Each bracelet grants an elemental power, one of Fire, Wind, or Earth. In addition to being useful in battle, utilizing the power of these bracelets becomes simply indispensable when searching for many of the game’s secrets. The Fire Bracelet allows our hero to light torches and melt ice. The Wind Bracelet allows him to whirlwind over large gaps, and otherwise impossible jumps. The Earth Bracelet allows him to break walls and other natural barriers. You can also switch between these abilities on the fly; it becomes an essential element of success in many of the game’s more challenging boss battles. Aside from bracelets, Adol is also able to purchase new swords, armors, and shields. These can be statistically enhanced by delivering them to Adonis, the town blacksmith, who will customize them using rare crystals known as Ravals. Early in the game, Ravals are fairly hard to come by, but enemies drop them semi-frequently in the last two dungeons.But, does it have replay value? Tons of it. How about two unlockable difficulty modes, Hard and Nightmare? How about Boss Rush? Those who have completed Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim will be quite familiar with this time attack mode, which allows the player to consecutively battle against all of the game's bosses. And how about the countless side quests and hidden items, such as the War God’s Talisman and the Augite Brooch? There’s always something to do, especially for completionists, who will be hard-pressed to unearth every secret on their first time through.Finally, in case it wasn’t obvious: Sound - 100%. That’s right, absolute perfection. Ys: The Oath in Felghana has, quite possibly, the most amazing soundtrack in the history of video games. There are no audio issues or ‘filler tracks’ to speak of. They’ve managed to take an already superb soundtrack and make it even more awesome. Each track, exceptionally remixed from the original compositions in Wanderers From Ys, simply rocks. In particular, ""Valestine Castle"" stands out among the crowd. In true Soundteam JDK fashion, it is exceptionally heavy on the electric guitars and more-than-competently weave in the perfect amount of synth. Speaking directly to fellow fans of their music, I never would have thought that any version of Valestine Castle could overcome/surpass JDK Band 1... I was sorely mistaken. In fact, it’s difficult for me to navigate through the castle at times; when the solo at 2:02 kicks in, I can’t seem to avoid setting the controller down, closing my eyes, and allowing myself to become entranced by the music. It’s that good.Ys: The Oath in Felghana is a remarkable remake which never cuts corners. It’s the best remake ever produced. It’s (debatably) the best installment of the Ys Series ever produced. And it receives my absolute highest recommendation.Highly Recommended "

												No nonsense ARPG. This is what all RPGs should strive to be. No melodrama. No sissy boy main characters. No overly dramatic crap. No desire to be a movie masquerading as a barely playable game. No ""OMG look at these graphics"" to distract you from how much crap the rest of the game is. Here it is the rest of the game that wows you.The plot is simple and I like that. It doesn't take itself seriously. What this game does take seriously is the gameplay. The combat is fun. You can avoid enemies. No random encounters. No crap loot either. Everything has a purpose. You don't need to waste your time doing inventory management. No useless items. No useless spells. It is a finely balanced game. After playing this game, I wonder, why the hell are all other games not like this.Where other games randomly generate crap loot for you to search through. This game has a very very limited inventory, all useful during the time they are available to you. You don't need to manage inventory, wondering if you need to drop X to make room for Y. Where other games randomly generate dungeons for you. This game gives you hand crafted dungeons that require some good platforming to get hidden treasure.Where other games throw a million abilities and spells at you; half of which are useless against the majority of enemies, this game gives you 4 abilities. All of them useful.This game is a masterpiece. You cannot take away anything from it without totally ruining. And if you were to add anything you would probably just ruin the precise balance of it.If you enjoyed Dark Souls/Demon Souls. These games are a level of precision above those.			"

												Oath in Felghana is a phenomenal action RPG. It is the third game in the Ys series, and a remake of the original Ys III. While the original Ys III was a good game in its own right, it was also a flawed game in many ways (don't take that to mean it wasn't a heck of a lot of fun). Oath in Felghana not only rectifies every flaw of the original, it also improves upon Ys III in every way, all while remaining faithful to the core essence of what made Ys III such a fun and memorable game.Pros:- Phenomenal soundtrack- Great battle mechanics- Unique boss fights- One of the best Ys storiesCons:- The beginning feels a bit slow- (No Volcano)- No easy way to access bonus bosses (even if you beat them)A distinguishing feature of all Ys games is outstanding music, and this is true even for the original Ys III. In Oath in Felghana, the music has been upgraded to entirely new levels of awesome. If the soundtrack was the only good thing about this game, I'd still recommend it at full price. Fortunately for us, the music comes with an awesome game as well.The gameplay mechanics of Felghana are some of the best, with controls that are tight and very refined. There are difficulty settings for every kind of player, be they casual or hardcore. Regardless of setting, the game is very encouraging of exploration, but for any difficulty above easy, it's loaded with intense action. Even some strategy comes into play concerning certain enemies and scenarios. Boss fights are varied and unique, and each boss requires a different method in order to defeat them. At higher difficulty levels, boss fights can be very challenging. While there is a random luck factor, for the most part, beating the bosses is a little bit of know-how accompanied by pure mad-skills (and it's very satisfying once you beat them).Oath in Felghana is a bit of an oddball in regards to story. Most Ys games begin with Adol washed ashore after some great struggle. Here, Adol leisurely sails into Felghana with his long-time friend Dogi. Most Ys games feel epic and grand from the get-go. Oath in Felghana feels like a sidestory you could skip over (you’ll regret it if you do though).The story has a pace that is uniquely its own, and VERY different from any other Ys game (that I’ve played at least). It ends on a powerful note, but it takes its time getting there (despite being a surprisingly short game). Even though it feels slow, there is always a driving energy that pushes the story forward; you can always feel the hidden danger, even if you don’t fully understand it. And when the story finally hits the turning point, everything comes together perfectly, leading to one of the most powerful moments in any Ys game.Ys stories have depth, but they go by so fast that you may miss some of the more thought provoking themes and ideas being explored. Oath in Felghana, in particular, is an exploration of human weakness. The theme is explored through several characters, all of them strong individuals. And all of them having fallen to human weakness. That said, it is not just the strengths or failures of these characters that make them, in particular, so interesting.Like the game itself, the story doesn’t give any answers; it shows you what you need to know, and leaves the rest to you.While the slow pace of the game is one of its good points (it matches perfectly with Dogi returning home to family), it has the consequence of making the beginning feel too slow. This is because the beginning isn't interactive enough to offset the slow pace. More interaction means more immersion; experiencing rather than watching.If you've had the opportunity to play the original Ys III, then you might remember the Volcano in the background of the Illburns Ruins. And it was AWESOME! I know this isn't really a 'negative' per say, and the Felghana version of the Illburns Ruins is clearly amazing without it. But... this should have made it into Felghana because it was just that cool.While more of an annoyance than anything, there is no easy way to access the bonus bosses, even if you've beaten them before. It would be nice to have a means by which to easily access the two bosses once you've unlocked them. What makes this more annoying is that the bosses are quite fun and challenging, and not deserving of such obscurity.Oath in Felghana is available for both the PC and the PSP. The PC version is, decidedly, visually superior to the PSP version. However, the PSP version has some exclusive content that should not be overlooked.PSP Exclusives:- Voice Acting: While mediocre (sometimes hilarious), it definitely has its own unique charm. And for the most part, I liked it. Unfortunately, the voice acting choices made for the final boss destroyed the atmosphere; it gave the boss more ‘human’ qualities (made it less monstrous) when it should have done the opposite.- PSP Version is More Forgiving: Double Boost (regenerates health after boost), Room Retry (retry in the room you died in), Retry Boss at a Lower Difficulty.- Selectable Soundtrack: You can choose between the Oath in Felghana Soundtrack or the Original Ys III Soundtrack.- Inferno Time Attack: With double boost, this is probably about the equivalent of Nightmare Time Attack for the PC version. By the way, am I the only one who things Inferno Time Attack should be added to the PC version?- Easier Access to Bonus Bosses: (Random Eye Twitch).- Museum: This is a collection of unlockable art for the game (not unlike the Ys VI Materials Collection).- Prologue Novella: As it turns out, the manuals for the Ys games included a Prologue to the main story. I actually think the Ys prologues should be included with their respective games is all cases (even if it’s as a PDF in the game folder) since they are a part of Ys lore.While the PSP version decidedly has some nice exclusives, I don’t believe it has anything that makes it ‘superior’ to the PC edition. Both is an excellent choice (I might be evil).Oath in Felghana is a phenomenal game. It is so polished and well executed that it is easilly one of the best action RPGs on Steam.			"

												Ys: The Oath in Felghana or also know as a reimagining of Ys III.Players take on the role of Adol Christin as his adventure takes him to the region of Felghana, as he arrives, it gets infested with monsters and its up to him to save the day.The ""bump"" system of the previous 2 games has been replaced with a more hack and slash style of play but it still tough as nails, more so in boss fights. A +1 of stats can make all the difference.

												Ys: The Oath in Felghana is a remake of Ys III with a brand new engine, reworked storyline, and remastered music. You play as Adol Crispin, a badass red-haired silent hero, visiting a new land called Felghana with your friend Dogi. The story is rather simplistic, so don't expect much from it, but it is serviciable. The meat and bone of this game are, as expected, the combat and its multiple bosses. There are multiple standard moves, and as the game progresses, you will gain newer skills to help you out, all those skills will remain useful for all the game.The game's Normal is quite hard for a first timer, but it is actually recommended to start there. This is challenging game, so don't cripple yourself too much, or the game, by playing on Easy mode.This game also includes a Boss Rush mode available after the game, that can be played in many difficulities, some will make you pull your hair, but you will feel amazing while doing them.If you want to get a valid gamer card, you don't play Dark Souls, you play Ys!

												Ys: The Oath in Felghana reminds me of Secret of Mana or The Soul Blazer series. It's a hack and slash rpg where you slay monsters and kill tough bosses to progress through the entire game. I liked Oath in Felghana because after playing Ys Chronicles, the game remains true to the series even if you can't bump into enemies anymore. So what did I think about it? Lets see...Graphics: This game is a port from the PSP version that was released a few years ago. I liked how Oath of Felghana now has 3d backgrounds or monsters but still maintains a 2d layout. The sprites look nice if you set your graphics to the highest, but I personally think they are simple. I still find the game to great, even with it's cutscenes which look decent but could be better.Sound: I really thought the sound department went forth and had fun making the music. There are good songs, but I just don't find myself to play over and over again. Sound effects are pretty basic, but I don't think that matters. There was never a moment where I just wanted to put my own music to the game which is a plus in my own opinion.Gameplay: If you played Ys Chronicles, you realize that you can't bump into enemies like you used to for exp. There's now an attack button which can be used to string combos to gain exp. What I find the most rewarding is the three magics you obtain in the game. My favorite is probably the wind power since you use it to get to treasures and to another section of the level. If there is one thing I really enjoyed the most are the bosses. Playing on past normal is a challenge as it requires you to be quick about your actions and for you to time your attacks. The game is hard if you're not leveled correctly but it doesn't take you long to be strong enough to take on a boss. Overall: I consider Ys: The Oath in Felghana a great purchase if you enjoy J-rpgs that aren't complex, yet easy to play but difficult to master. I think falcom did great with this remake because it adds a new chapter in the Ys storyline for American audiences and it is faithful to the first two Ys games in the series.			"

												Wow, what a game! As much my thirteen year old self would hate to hear this, I'm not the gamer that I used to be. Fifteen years later, now an adult with a full time job, I don't have the devotion for gaming as much as I used to have. This game though allowed me to relive my experience of those days where I would stay up to the early hours of the morning, not at all concerned with sleep or the work that I had to be at in a few hours time.I had recently picked this up on a sale. As it looked intriguing and was 75% off, I figured that I would give it a go. Going from its Metacritic store, I figured that it would be a 'Meh' kind of game. How wrong was I. This was easily the most enjoyment I've gotten out of a game this year.Enough rambling, on with the review.This is an action-RPG with a very satisfying combat system. Within minutes of starting, you're quickly thrown into it. Although the game has a story, a fairly good one at that, you won't be clicking through endless amounts of dull dialogue before you get to the action.It's great fun as you run from screen to screen cutting down the monsters that face you. Although there is no way to heal on demand, when I first started playing, I didn't find this to be very challenging even on the normal difficulty, but it was still very satisfying.When I reached the game's first boss, I got my ♥♥♥♥ handed to me, several times over. Here I initially thought that the game wasn't balanced properly. After a character level and learning the boss's patterns, I was finally able to get pass it, barely.This is where that game's core challenge comes from; boss battles. Difficult but I wouldn't call them unfair. Once you're able to defeat them, you're bound to be able to repeat it. The game doesn't factor in luck much. It's a very rewarding experience to get through them.In terms of playtime, it took me a little under 14.5 hours. I'm a gamer who tries to I try to find everything I can so it could probably be finished a lot quicker. In fact, there's an achievement to finish it in five hours or less. Could be completed over a weekend, or two in my case. To me, the length was just right, not too long nor too short.Once completed, a boss battle mode is unlocked, and the game has five difficulty levels so it has some replayability. There's a number of side quests as well, some of which I somehow had missed so I'll be replaying it.The game has a great soundtrack. Normally I'm not one to even notice this unless it's really good which I'm pleased to state is the case here.I found the story to be better then the average JRPG. This is helped greatly with the range of characters, none of which are nameless or a palette swap of another, which are great contrasts to each other. The weakest would be protagonist who doesn't utter a word, with only a narrator describing his actions.It's worth mentioning that for those who buy this, take a look at the forums as someone was able to extract the voices, which are only found in the PSP version of the game, working on this version which greatly adds to the game's atmosphere. It would be good if they're included by default though. Hopefully they'll be patched in in future.With all the praise, it's not without its flaws though. This may not apply to the easy difficulty levels but I did spend a bit of time grinding. While cutting down monsters is fun, much more then a turn based RPG, when your EXP bar is rising very slowly, it can become repetitive.You're bound to die a number of times on bosses. Mostly while trying to figure out their patterns and then some more after that. At times, I needed to take a break from this as it was becoming frustrating. On the other hand though, once you do get through them, it's very gratifying.It's flaws are minor compared to the overall enjoyment I got from it though. I highly recommend this game.			"

												Ys Felghana plays very similarly to Ys Origin, so if you played and enjoyed that already you're sure to like this one too. If not, you're looking at a solid, fast-paced (but always manageable) 8-12 hour action RPG, perhaps most easily compared to games like Kingdom Hearts. Although Oath is technically the third game in the Ys series, newcomers can feel comfortable jumping at this point- the game barely references the previous games at all, in fact the only carryover are the two protagonists and all you need to know about them is readily apparent. The story won't shake your world but it's serviceable enough to give Adol an excuse to rampage through the world destroying the entire population of monsters in fluid and satisfying melee combat. It's an Ys game, so of course the soundtrack is superb. Lots of noisy high-tempo epic-metal to roll around to, but it never gets obnoxious. Personal favourite is the Valestine Castle theme.Speaking personally I preferred Ys Origin and would recommend that one above this, but the truth is they're both solidly built games and it probably just comes down to which you play first is the one you prefer. Many who played both feel Origin bogs itself down with story while Oath is a lot less story-centric and thus more replayable. It depends what you want from your RPG, but you can't go wrong with any of XSEED's superb localisations of Falcom's Ys titles.			"

												Ys: The Oath in Felghana is a very easy game to jump into storywise, even if you have not played any of the previous games in the series. It has its own epic tale to tell, and knowledge of previous events is not required. A fair warning though: if you have never played a Ys game before, start on Easy or Very Easy. I'm not trying to scare you away, but Oath is without a doubt one of the most challenging games to hit the market in recent times. If you choose normal, prepare to die a LOT during the massive boss encounters. That is not to say that the game is cheap or unbalanced, as often tempering your equipment or simply gaining another level will even the playing field. The reward lies in the challenge, and you WILL feel a great sense of accomplishment each time you finally triumph over your foe.One way to describe the gameplay in Oath would be to imagine an amped-up Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Add blazing speed and the ability to jump into the mix,  and toss with a heavy dash of well-executed platforming, and you have a hearty recipe for gaming success. Don't just go rushing in headfirst hacking away at your foes with reckless abandon however, the combat in Oath requires a fair bit of strategy. You will have at your disposal three elemental rings, and the powers they bestow upon you are necessary to dispatch your foes with efficiency. Always be on the lookout in hard to reach areas, as you can always find hidden chests containing upgrades and new equipment, as well as the Raval ore needed to temper your gear at the smithy in town.Back to the topic of combat. The boss encounters in Oath are epic in scale, and they take a fair bit of thinking to overcome. Simply flailing away with reckless abandon is sure to get you killed. Don't be afraid of failure however, if you die in a boss fight you will be given the option to retry as many times as you wish (though beware, dying 10 times to the same boss and the game will mock you with an ""achievement""). The key to success is to study the bosses patterns, and use the proper attack for the job. If all else fails you can grind a level or two, or temper your gear as I pointed out before.It truly is a grand day for the Steam Community and Ys fans alike now that one of the finest games in the series has hit the platform, and with promises of Ys: Origin on the horizon. Oath will definitely fulfill the wishes of anyone who desires a solid JRPG experience on their PC. With an epic storyline, badass bosses, masterful music, gorgeous graphics, and all around gratuitous gameplay, Ys: The Oath in Felghana does NOT disappoint. With unlockables such as higher difficulties, time attack, and boss rush modes, players will be entertained long after the main story has wrapped up. What are you waiting for? Go get your Ys fix now!			"

												An excellent action-RPG that will grind the meat off your bones make you love every moment of it.This game is a remake and expansion of the Sega Master System's Ys III: Wanderers from Ys.  Combat is fast-paced and difficult, and boss fights are complex and brutally unforgiving -- but in (almost) every case it's readily apparent what you're doing wrong, and you feel like such a badass when you eventually make that one clean run and come out on top.There are a few notable flaws, mostly on the highest difficulties.  Certain boss mechanics (Chester's teleport spam, or Gyalva's tile flipping on Nightmare) can randomly screw you and there's not always any clear difference between a failed run and a flawless one.  These are very rare, however, and a solid battle plan and execution will get you through almost everything all the way through the highest difficulties.For those less adept at the genre, don't be afraid to start out on Easy.  Ys is a series rooted in the 8-bit era of difficulty, and this game's idea of Easy is right about where most other franchises would place Normal.			"

												While the main character quickly falls to the wayside and they focus more on his cute red-haired boyfriend, this game is still a very fun, fast-paced entry in the Magnificent Adventures of Dogi franchise with Falcom's renowned JDK band providing more kickin' rad musical arrangements. We can only hope Dogi gets more screen time in the newer upcoming titles in the series.

												Ys: The Oath in Felghana is a very challenging action-RPG game. While the story and RPG elements are quite basic, everything else is just great. Fast, action oriented gameplay with fluid controls along with epic soundtrack makes you feel like a badass while fighting through numerous monsters and unique boss fights. The bosses are varied and there are lots of them. Learning their patterns and patience is key to success here. After you beat certain difficult boss and your heart is still beating like crazy, you get that same great feeling like beating a boss in Dark Souls. Make sure you also try Time Attack mode after you finish the game!This was my first YS game and I played through it on Normal difficulty and had a tough time in certain parts of the game. If you are newcomer to the series I recommend starting with either Very Easy or Easy difficulty.  Overall I had a blast with this and will definately give other games in the series a try.Highly recommended!			"

												When games are good, but fall short in very obvious ways, it's always a little disappointing. The game is fun! But it takes too long to get started. There's somewhere around 10-15 minutes from pressing New Game to being let out into the world. Around 4-6 hours into the game, you can get an item that lets you regenerate health if you stand still. This is a needed mechanic, since you're going to have to beat up on a lot of enemies to level up for the boss fights, but standing still is not fun. The game has a 'Boost mode', in which you deal extra damage and take less damage for a limited time, after you fill up a gauge that fills up as you take and deal damage. Why not tie the regenerating health to damage done in boost mode? That would set up a dillema for the player: Do I keep fighting since boost mode is almost full, or do I not take the risk and teleport back to town to heal? Instead, if I find myself in danger after clearing a room, I just stand still for 30 seconds. Somewhere in Falcom, a ball lays on the ground, dropped.JRPGs get a lot of flack for grinding, and there's plenty here to go around. It's really not that bad, since only monsters that pose a threat give good experience and gold. I died several times while grinding, since I thought I could go just a little more before having to heal. It's a lot more tense and exciting than beating up Rattata outside Pewter City's gym. The story is cliched and filled to the brim with classic JRPG tropes, which I can sort of forgive for a game released in 2005, but I wouldn't hate the Ys series if it took a less serious tone in it's story department, maybe something like Half Minute Hero.Four out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( )			"

												It's too bad the Ys games aren't more popular, because they're a ton of fun. Although I can understand why this is the case; if you want a deep story with well-developed characters in a rich, vibrant world, you're probably better off looking elsewhere. (Or you could read a book.)However, if your cup of tea happens to be runney-jumpey-hackey-slashey-swing-your-swordey-things-get-deadey gameplay where you mow down swarms of monsters, all building up to fights against gargantuan, screen-filling bosses with heavy rock music playing in the background, then you should totally give the Ys series a try. Like I said, they're a lot of fun.I haven't played all the games in the series, but out of the ones I have played, I feel that The Oath in Felghana is pretty good game to start out with. I & II are fun, but very much showing their age; Seven is a good one also (and was actually my first Ys game), but it's only for PSP. I would actually argue that Origin is better than The Oath in Felghana, but being a prequel, it does have some spoilers for Ys I, and it doesn't have everyone's favorite mute redheaded berserker.Every Ys game also comes with multiple difficulty settings, so if you want to let off steam by making everything that looks at you the wrong way your ♥♥♥♥♥, there's Easy and Very Easy. If you like a really good challenge, there's Nightmare and Inferno. And yes, holding down your jump button (at least I think it's the jump button, off the top of my head) speeds up the text scrolling in the cutscenes.Speaking of buttons, if you have a USB controller, you're definitely going to want to dust it off; in my opinion, Ys games weren't meant to be played with a keyboard.

												Ys: The Oath in Felghana is a re-imagining of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys, originally released on the NEC PC-8801 in 1989, and it is one of the most finely-crafted action RPGs ever made.  Ys III was the sequel to the classic Ancient Ys Vanished duology, and followed the autobiographical story of the world's most famous adventurer, Adol ""The Red"" Christin, albeit in a new setting with a plot mostly unrelated to the previous games.  The Oath in Felghana follows the same overall story as the original, but with many additions.  However, the story is not even remotely the focus of the game and while the characters are charming and the plot is by no means awful or unbearable, it's also very barebones, like its predecessors.  The series is well-known for its fantastic music, and The Oath in Felghana is no exception to this.  It has one of the finest soundtracks in the industry, with calm, soothing melodies, fast-paced frenetic orchestral music, and powerful rock themes for the more intense fights.Ys III's main departure was in the gameplay department, where the top-down ""bumper car"" combat of the previous games was replaced by a side-scrolling platformer.  This new style was poorly received by series fans for being too clunky and slow in comparison to the older combat style.  The Oath in Felghana completely overhauls the combat and gameplay, to the point where the only real similarity to the original are some side-scrolling-styled segments.  The combat in The Oath in Felghana is a drastically improved version of Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim's style.  It's a fully 3D action-based combat system that is extremely fast paced and rewards patience, quick reflexes, timing, and the utmost precision over memorization, button mashing, ""cheesing,"" or trial-and-error.  Unlike Ys VI, there are no consumable healing items in The Oath in Felghana.  The only way to restore your health is by touching a save point, using one-time powerups occasionally dropped by enemies, or by leveling up.  You can also restore health while outside dungeons by standing still for an extended period, but it's usually faster to simply run to a save point.  In addition, enemies will sometimes drop powerups that boost your stats temporarily, and keeping on the offensive keeps your combo counter high, giving you bonus experience.  This combination rewards players for keeping a fast tempo through a dungeon, as staying on the offensive levels you more quickly and nets you more stat and health bonuses.  However, during a boss fight, there are NO powerups available, so you can only defeat the boss with pure skill.  With the exception of a single boss on a specific difficulty setting, every attack that each boss uses can be completely avoided with the right timing and technique, and thus you must be entirely reliant on your skills and reflexes to win.  This doesn't mean that the bosses are easy, however, as some bosses will fill their arena with projectiles and particle effects that can be extremely difficult to avoid effectively while also damaging the boss.  Each boss is also entirely unique, except two recurring boss fights (which are significantly more powerful and more difficult on their second round) and no bosses that might as well just be a really powerful regular enemy. While each level is memorable and each combat skill you obtain is used to traverse dungeons and avoid traps, regular enemies can sometimes be very simple to defeat on lower difficulties, which can lure some players into a false sense of security, leading them into believing they're ready to fight a boss when they may not be.  One thing that is very important to remember in The Oath in Felghana is to ALWAYS ensure that you've explored every level thoroughly and obtained each treasure, and to upgrade your equipment regularly.  If you don't, the game will punish you HARD.  This can be a tempting challenge to skilled veterans, but to players not used to RPG-styled exploration, it can be a very rude awakening.  In addition, the game is very difficult.  The lower difficulties are definitely managable for most players, but they also dull the experience somewhat.  Normal will provide a good challenge to those who don't often play action games.  Hard and Nightmare difficulties will provide a significant challenge even for the most skilled and experienced players and can be extremely frustrating for people unused to the genre.The Oath in Felghana has a Time Attack mode that you can unlock upon completion of the game that allows you to re-fight any boss on any difficulty with pre-set equipment and stats, and while this can provide dozens of hours of entertainment to those looking to challenge themselves at speedrunnin or people who just want to re-visit their favorite boss fights on various difficulties (as well as an opportunity to unlock a secret boss), the game offers little else in terms of replay value other than playing the game again on a higher difficulty (which improves boss' AI and makes many of their attacks more complex and harder to avoid).  However, for $15, The Oath in Felghana is worth the price of entry even if you only complete the game once (which should take between 10 and 20 hours) and then never touch the game again.  Ys: The Oath in Felghana is one of the best action games ever released, and is most definitely worth the low cost.			"

												While this game was released before Ys 6 on Steam, it was actually released after Ys 6 initially. So you can tell there are some refinements.First, instead of 3 different swords, you get the traditional weapon system from Ys 1 and 2, and the elemental attacks are replaced with three different magic rings. Fire Magic works pretty much the same as Ys 2, while the added Earth Magic and Wind Magic add another layer to your combat. Ys 6 lacked distance attacks and good way to mob enemies, while this provides just that. Earth Magic can be used to charge towards or away from enemies, which also provides another layer to combat. Overall, unlike Ys 6 where Brillante was pretty much the only sword you ever used, here, you find yourself using the three magics more or less balanced. There are also a lot of enemies that behave differently, especially the jumpers who make it harder to spam down stab like you always did in Ys 6, and some enemies requiring a specific magic to get through them easily, so the combat is overall an improvement, probably more than it initialy seems. The bosses are pretty fun too, though Ys 6 had good ones as well. As far as the final boss goes, this one trumps Ys 6's big time. Main combo being 6 hits instead of 3 also helps.The dungeon design is, because Ys 3 was originally a sidescroller, flat, but in a good way. This makes the design a lot more comprehensible, and added with MUCH better platforming mechanic (no dash jumps, but also very forgiving gliding technic), it makes the dungeon design just much better. Of course, it's no Zelda, but then again, Zelda is built around dungen puzzles, while this game is about hacking away at your enemies, so it's not a fair comparison.The problem is then the scale. There is only one village, and 32 NPCs. There are 6 dungeons, which I think is actually the same number as Ys 6, but it's overworld (if you can call it that) is pitifully small. As in, smaller than Ys 1. So if you are expecting Ys 2-esque, legit RPG with lots of characters to interact with, you are not going to get it here. Kinda sad, considering Falcom is usually really good at this stuff if you look at Trails series.			"

												After months of wondering if I'd lost interest in video games, this one got me hooked from beginning to end. As a long time gamer, I enjoyed Y's 3 back in the day on the SNES. This is a great example of a re-imagining done right. The people who worked on this game seem to have a deep understanding of good game design and know what keeps a player interested without adding any fluff. There is plenty of new content that wasn't in the original, and all of it improves upon the old foundation.If I had to suggest improvements, I'd ask that the easy mode was a little bit less easy (maybe 2/3rds damage instead of half damage from enemies. There is an included ""Very Easy"" mode after all.) Normal mode required a bit more dying, grinding, or perfect pattern memorization than I'd prefer, and bosses often had a few moves that seemed to be unavoidable. It would have been great if the original soundtrack was included as well, but I wouldn't hold that against the game. I'd love to see more games like this in the future. 9/10.			"

												I will start this by saying that I was introduced to the Ys series via Falcom's other main series ""The Legend of Heroes""; that being said, this is a complete change of pace, so if you are expecting something along similar veins, just know that it's different, good, but different.The next thing to note is that the game's bosses can be balls-to-the-walls difficult. Perhaps I'm just a casual, and I probably am, but some of those fights took a good hour or more to finally beat. I consider Ys to be the ""Dark Souls of JRPGs.""All in all, it's a fun, about 20hr game, but insanely difficult, so if you're not into the challenge, then maybe play on one of the easy difficulties.

												Ys III was a weird game. It was the first in the series to swap from the top-down bump system to a 2D platformer. It was also outsourced to many, many different devs and systems. The series later swapped back to their original system for Ys IV (And presumably V) and then started using a 3D platformer engine for VI and beyond.Yet this is my favorite in the series.Oath in Felghana is a 1st-party remake of the original. With remixed music, completely redone areas, and superior gameplay. I would honestly list this among my top 5 RPGs of all time.GAMEPLAYYs TOiF is an Action RPG/Hack&Slash 3D platformer. You have four main abilities. Obviously: Attack combo, Jump, and Magic. But you also have a boost, which charges over time, gives you a quicker, stronger combo, and halves all damage taken. (In the PSP version you get a second boost which also gives HP Regen.) There are plenty of moves, like plunging attacks, rising blades, and such. The gameplay is generally very fast-paced. Grinding is made easier with a combo system that awards an XP multiplier based on how long you can keep a combo going.This game is VERY hard. You shouldn't have too much trouble beating it on normal, but I'm currently in the midst of an Inferno mode playthrough. Dodging attacks is very necessary, though you get an ability later that negates all damage and serves as a guard.One of the game's strong points is it's boss fights. All challenging, tense, and require a dedication of learning patterns and when to attack (Especially in higher difficulties). You really feel accomplished when you beat them.MUSICOooohhhmygodthisgamehasamazingmusic.Falcom loves putting metal remixes of the original songs in their games. I'm serious when I say that literally every song on this soundtrack is amazing. Please just give it a listen even if you don't want to play the game. It always fits with the area perfectly.STORYThis game picks up a few years after Ys II leaves off. Monsters are still rapant even though demons and magic have been eradicated. And a small trading town is hurt severely by the rule of a tyrant noble. It's a pretty decent story, and the intended emotions towards all of the characters get carried over very well.Overall, I love this game. It's one of my favorites of all time, and likely the best in the series.9.5/10			"

												TL;DR: I wish there was a middle rating for recommendation because I don't think the game is bad enough to be a Thumbs Down but not good enough for a Thumbs Up either. I would recommend this to any Ys fans but personally I was kind of underwhelmed. I'm not even sure what it was that underwhelmed me but I liked Ys Origins a lot more. Maybe it's because it feels like you only need to beat it once and then move on to another game. Save the other Ys games for after you've beaten this one for a more rewarding experience.[Difficulty - good]: As with the other Ys games, you have difficulties for everyone to be able to enjoy the game although there are at least 2 bosses that are annoying no matter what you choose.[Story - average]: Pretty standard stuff but I liked the little touches here and there to make the story more than just a standard issue ""Evil being awakens and you happen to be nearby to slay/seal it for the villagers"" story. I don't know if Ys Ark of Nepishtim would explain why Adol and Dogi are traveling together but not being able to own and play it may explain why I feel so disconnected from Felghana.[Characters - good]: As with all the other Falcom games Steam has, the attention to details about every character's personality and lives is always a pleasure to read about. The merchant trying to get fame and fortune, the hardworking townspeople and a surprisingly kind countess are just a few to name in adding layers to the otherwise cookie-cutter plot.[Graphics - average]: It's a matter of personal tastes on this one. The characters look great to me since I prefer the 2D anime style over full 3D characters. The cinematics are as lovely as I've come to expect from any Falcom game as well.[Music - excellent]: One thing this game has no problems with is the music, my favorites would definitely be the world map and clock tower music. Not to say the rest wasn't memorable though.[Combat - good]: It uses the same combat and magic system as Origins which makes playing one then the other very easy to transition into.[Length - average]: It may be a good length for people who prefer short games but as for someone with tons of spare time and expectations of RPGs to have decent length and content in them...it was disappointing how quickly I chewed through it. That disappointment also leads to my rating for...[Replayability - bad]: Unfortunately there is almost no reason to replay this game except to get Steam achievements. The version we Steam players got is lacking all the extras the PSP version players get for beating the game and time attack mode.			"

												If you like fast paced action games, you'll probably enjoy this. I'd say this game is more action than RPG. It has elements of SHMUPs. It even has some light platforming elements.Pros:+ Very responsive controls and movement. There's no sense of sluggishness when you move, jump, and attack.+ Fast paced action, favoring execution, reaction, and enemy pattern recognition over grinding and slower-paced strategic / tactical decisions. More like a SHMUP than a strategic action RPG.+ aforementioned reaction-based elements are actually possible (at least for me in my late-20s). I've played games that have patterns that require unfeasible reaction speeds. So the patterns end up being, effectively, random amounts of damage because there's no reasonable way to avoid them (like the last boss in YS 1).+ The way you get good at fighting the enemies and bosses in this game is by learning their patterns. As far as I can tell, there are very few situations where your ability to win or lose is based on randomness. There are some games where there's really difficult patterns or challenges that are so difficult that you won't be able to reasonably overcome them without spending a lot of time practicing. Take some of the bosses in the souls series - the process of learning each boss's moves can take quite awhile because they have a varied moveset, and there's often complications like cluttered level design and certain patterns that can't consistently be parried or dodged or predicted. That sort of stuff really frustrates me, especially when it takes awhile to get back to the boss. This game doesn't really have anything like that. You can pretty much learn the correct thing to do in any given situation in a reasonable amount of time, and it's very consistent. And, when you fail a boss, you can restart right at it without having to make your way back from a save point. To sum it up, I think that you can feasibly learn to fight every boss without taking any damage.+ Difficulty options! Easy mode felt fun and not all that challenging for me. If you really want to play more you can replay on harder difficulty modes.+ awesome music. Energetic, electric guitar, drums, + symphonic instruments. I believe the tracks use actual recordings and not samples.+ World building. As you return to town during your adventures, the characters in town always have different things to say. It's nice when games don't have voice acting because it lets writers write a lot more stuff, and they've definitely taken advantage of that fact here.Things I didn't like:- towards the end, it seems there's a bit of an expectation that you grind to get more money and EXP so you can upgrade your gear, increase your max HP, and increase your stats. If you think that's okay, ask yourself if running back and forth between the same rooms doing the same repetitive task just to make some numbers go up is a really meaningful way to spend your life. Ask yourself if you'd go to bed feeling good about how you spent your day, having spent hours of it doing the same stupid task over and over again.- overall, the grinding for EXP, money, and upgrade mats I think needlessly lengthens the game and gets in the way of the action-oriented gameplay. I hardly had to spend much time grinding, but I wonder what including stats and levels and stuff really achieves, from the perspective of just making the game fun. I think it hurts the fun.- Partial controller support. You cannot map the menu button to a button on your controller. You have to have your keyboard there in front of you or you have to use an external tool to map your start button to ESC.In short, there's not much I didn't like about this game. It's a nice, fast-paced action game with some JRPG elements. Although, I can't help but wonder what a game like this has to offer over actual ""action-first"" action games like Bayonetta, DMC, SHMUPs, etc...I feel like the thing that makes this game unique is its inclusion of JRPG elements, but I also feel like the game may have been more fun if it had just focused all on the action. The primary gameplay of this game is action-oriented, but if that's what you really want out of a game you have much better options elsewhere. The action in this game isn't as great as the action in other highly-polished action games. So why not just play those instead?So, if you have no shortage of top-tier action games that you still enjoy (like Platinum games that you haven't yet 100%'d), I don't know that this game is worth getting. But if you're looking for something new and different, definitely check this one out.			"

												Seen an action-RPG lately that features a combo meter for experience points? Welcome to Adol Christin’s world. The long running Ys (“EEEs”) RPG dynasty has not been well-known outside Japan until recent years. Plucky import specialist XSEED is changing that by bringing the original PC games to the west.A remake of the 16-bit era Ys III: Wanderers From Ys, Oath in Felghana is as close to a 16-bit action adventure game in 3D as you’re going to get. While humble in technology, Oath nails the character of a Mega Drive game to the wall. Wandering hero-dude Adol lives only to find new lands, people in trouble, and murder what’s troubling them. It’s pretty much expected of him. Here, he glides through hoards of monsters and demons, leaving a literal shower of fragments in his wake. Experience racks up, multiplied by keeping your kill count up. Dungeons are simplistic until the last third of the game, but offer satisfying platforming action to offset the killing. Bosses are huge, with patterns right out of an old school arcade game.Sharp controls and a driving electronic orchestra finishes off the package. It acts as both nostalgic trip, and introduction to a simply satisfying franchise that’s been pushed by fans for a reason. But a quality gamepad is prerequisite - you are warned.			"

												I never thought I'd ever see a Falcom game here on Steam, let alone an Ys game!I played this game years ago and if you know anything about Falcom games and Ys, then you know this game is going to be good.It's pretty much an awesome remake of the original Ys III, that came out back in 1989 for the NEC PC-8801/9801, MSX2 and X68000, then remade in 1991 for the Famicom, Super Nintendo, SEGA Genesis and the TurboGrafx-16 CD (which was a first to include animated cutscenes and voice dialogue) and remade again in 2005 for the Playstation 2.Ys: Oath in Felghana was released for the PC in 2005 and was the first of the Ys III remakes to have a 3D world. It also has a perfectly remixed soundtrack that does not take the feel away from the epic original.Plus, the addition of Cloud save and Steam achievements is a nice bonus!Highly recommended for fans of Falcom games.

												Oath in Felghana is actually a remake of Ys III: Wanderers of Ys, which was released on many consoles during the 16-bit era. It was a side-scroller, played a lot like Zelda 2. However, it received a lot of backlash from fans, but Falcom took notice and eventually remade Ys III in the style of the previous game (released before Oath in Felghana), Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim, but greatly improved on its' engine. And not just that, but the story was retold in both a different and yet similar way and the music was given a complete overhaul as well. It's easily my favourite game in the series, I highly recommend it for anyone who loves a challenge. And Zelda-like games.			"

												I sometimes have to stop to remember that this game is based on ""Ys III: Wanderers from Ys"", which has probably aged the worst out of all the games in the series. But I digress. Besides, you don't have to be a fan of the series to appreciate the oodles of old-school cool packed into this fast-pased hack-em-up. It's simple yet satisfying, with a rockin' soundtrack and equally hardcore boss battles. Multiple difficulties ensure beginners and experts alike will feel honored to take the oath.

If you grew up on the Ys games, the nostalgia factor alone makes this worth playing.

												Cruel pure action RPG, one of the harderst games I played.Combat is simple in nature but carefully balanced, never unfair, exremely fast and fun. You start with a simple sword combo and jump, but subsequently aquire other abilities, like dash and double jump, as well as elemental spells, that not only do damage, but change the way you move and behave in battle. Wind spell lets you glide in air, useful for making long jumps and avoiding some boss attacks; Earth spell can break some walls to reveal hidden paths and provides you with invincibility frames; Fire spell... just shoots fireballs, that's all.Main gameplay basically consists of two sections.First, you have to traverse the level and reach the next boss. Enemies in level may start as challenging and drive you back to town to heal and upgrade your equipment, but little by little you will be pushing forward, gaining levels and eventually will overcome any obstacle. Exploring levels rewards you with some very useful items as well.Then, when you get to the boss, real fun starts. Game rewards you with an achievement for dying ten times in a single boss fight and I almost got it with the very first boss encountered - reached 9/10. Needless to say, I ""succeeded"" unlocking this achievment with the second boss. Boss attack patterns are varied and tend to change mid-fight, when you think you're adapted to it. The last boss in particular will mercilessly test everything you learned in the game - you have to have lightning reflexes and full control over your character movements to beat it, but when you'll do it you will feel like total badass.Final word about music. It's often praised in reviewes, but I was afraid that it will not fit the fantasy setting. I was wrong - music is very fitting to non-stop hack and slash action and creates epic rock opera feel.

												There are not as many jRPGs for PCs as I would like to see these days  and this one begins with a great  intro (If one is not allergic to anime. But if so, this game should be avoided at all costs), and features a cozy, classic jRPG art style of 3D backgrounds with pre-rendered actors.  The battle system is also quick and enjoyable, if  a bit simple. That said, there are some things not that great concerning this game. First of all, it’s not particularly long for a role-play. Beating the game should take no more than 15 hours (and it is entirely possible to complete the storyline in about 5) which is not all that impressive concerning the fact that some other jRPGs have mini-games that are more time consuming. After completing the campaign, you can try the time attack or replay the story on another difficulty setting. There is no incentive to do so, since perhaps the Oath’s weakest point is its plot. The story told is extremely generic and predictable. Furthermore, the 30-some cast of characters is largely uninteresting. Finally, the extremely pompous  dialogue (and I do say that as a fan of jRPG narration) lines do not help at all. There aren’t  that many items to be collected either –  6 sets of equipment (sword, shield and armor each – all with 3 levels of upgrades ), 3 (also upgradeable 3 times )spells,  24 other items (usable, plot tokens or granting a particular ability). And , which is quite surprising in this genre – no party can be formed at any point of the game – the protagonist is forever alone (in battle) .        What saves the day and, in the end, redeems this otherwise average game, are some of the most brilliant boss- battles I have ever seen in a jRPG game: quick, demanding and almost perfectly balanced to avoid the excessive grind (at least on the medium difficulty setting). Concluding, this is not a greatly memorable title and in the end I feel that it abused my longing for a classic jRPG experience, which  kept me in front of the computer until the end. 6 out of 10, and I recommend it solely due to the awesomeness of  boss battles.

Instead of the old sidescrolling gameplay, this game has updated top down hack and slash gameplay with an updated and expanded story, all new art, and basically just more of everything.

												Nothing else needs to be said about this game. It is a great game and one of the best in the Ys Series. I hope that The PSP and Vita installments will eventually come to Steam as well. This game is one of the most fun I've had with games in a long time. I have fully played this game all the way to the end and repeated playthroughs beating Nightmare mode. This of course is on the PSP version as I have played it to death. It is a fun experience that everyone should try. This is an action RPG that will remind many people of Zelda except with a heavier emphasize on combat. This game excels in the combat. It will appear basic at first but as you progress, you get more moves, magic and other abilities that will effect the way you play and approach fighting certain enemies. Bosses all test your ability to the fullest in memorizing patterns, utilizing your new magic, and waiting for the opportune moment to strike. The music like anything JDK Falcom composes is beyond words. Often times this soundtrack is regarded as the best in the series while I personally feel like Chronicles is the best for me. As for the story, the game is pretty basic with its plot however, it has a lot of world building for both the previous and newer installments. These are nods to those that have played the other games of the series and nothing major is revealed with these events. It is a self contained story like most of the series except Ys I+II Chronicles, so you don't need to play the previous games to understand the story. A few tips for those that will be playing this game for the first time. Note that this game is a lot harder than most entries in the series. Normal mode will be more difficult than you are used to. Do not be discouraged. As I had played other games in the series I thought that I would start in Hard Mode and got my ♥♥♥ kicked. You can beat it through trial and error and grinding until you can beat the boss, Other than that, I highly reccomend the game for its fast pace, fun combat and soundtrack. 10/10			"

												This game is absolutely phenomenal !Not because of a story, which is barebone and extremely cliche, but for the action and gameplay. Ys is of course from a long line of older ARPG, but if you would like to compare it to a modern game, that would be Super Meat Boy or Dark Souls. All 3 of theses games share the same philosophy. They are tough as nails, but they are fair.Ys is all about skill. You discover new enemies, new bosses, and at the beginning it seems completely impossible, all the odds are stacked against you. Then you start noticing the attack patterns of the enemies. Then you start countering them and damaging them. Then you start feeling in control. But suddenly, with the boss at mid health, it is now using new patterns, and killing you fast ! But then you start noticing patterns again...and the circle can continue again...You will die in Ys. You will die a lot in Ys. You will despair, you will rage against the game. But in your heart, you know the game is fair, it is just asking you to hone your skills to prove worthy of victory. And when finally, after countless retries you will manage to defeat that boss you've been stuck on forver, all your previous despair will turn into pure joy, and a feeling of true accomplishment.All of that will also be amplified by the beauty of this game. Even though it's obviously dated, the rich environements and superb boss attacks will make you wonder how modern games can look so boring. There are some attack patterns and bosses that just look fantastic, original, and never before seen. That truely makes the game unique.			"

												I had never played a Ys game before Oath in Felghana, and this was a very pleasant surprise. The best way to describe it would be ""simple yet satisfying.""The combat isn't at all complex, yet with just three attacks and three spells it neither becomes tedious nor devolves into mindless buttonmashing.  Boss fights are fantastic; they're all challenging but fair and focused entirely on recognizing attack patterns and knowing when it's safe to attack.The story is very straightforward, featuring pretty much every 90s JRPG cliche--some may see this as a negative, but it makes me nostalgic for the days when games in the genre weren't just a bunch of incomprehensible anime mush. Childhood friends, surprise antagonists, collecting macguffins, legendary weapons--it's all here.There's some light grinding involved if you're bad at video games (I am bad at video games), and the dearth of save points is a bit of a pain sometimes, but overall it was a very enjoyable and wonderful experience.

												Growing up, I guess I never realized that Wanderers From Ys was kinda...crappy. You don't really think about how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty games were back then when you were a kid, you just thought that taping the attack button down in the first dungeon and coming back later when you're at max level is just a thing you do. Most of the Ys games don't hold up really well, and that's why I'm glad Falcom has continually revisited the series while progressing it over the years.This remake of Wanderers from Ys is completely top shelf. Sure, the story's still about as dry as it ever was, but the game is just a damn joy to play. Fast-paced, breakneck combat cut with (almost always) just the right amount of punishing difficulty and the spectacularly responsive controls make it a joy to play for those of us that like a good bit of twitch reflexes and pattern memorization. There's rarely ever any need to grind like in the original either, given that each dungeon is set to level you up appropriately before each boss encounter.My only real issue is that the game's balance can be a bit wonky and a few boss encounters border on unfair and completely luck based. It's just really weird how a few times simply gaining one level or piece of gear will suddenly cut enemy damage down by 50-75%, and a few bosses can get really cheap in their patterns by either canceling their vulnerable states with attacks you simply can't dodge or unleashing a combination of attacks that trap you in a way that's really unfair. Even with its slight flaws, Oath in Felghana was a treat to roll through and I felt satisfied with my victory in the end in a way modern games don't really strive for anymore.			"

 Note 1: This is currently being played on Nightmare difficulty. That being said, your mileage may vary on how these games compare (how easy is is to make money, gain exp, etc.) Note 2: I will be comparing this to Origin's gameplay. Spoilers for both games will be unmarked, so please read at your discretion.      This is a review of the game from a technical/gameplay standpoint  not  a review regarding the storyline, graphics, etc. I am writing this review for those that wish to play the Ys games in chronological order.      For those of you that didn't know, Origin, Oath in Felghana, and Ark of Napishtim use the same engine. However, OiF and Origin were released after Ark of Napishtim, in that order, and thus were ""tweaked"" or ""improved,"" rather, in terms of combat, stat growth, and money gain. Playing in chronological order means playing Origin, then Oif, then Ark, and getting used to things that might be missing, as you go through the series.      Now, I've played Origin all the way through on all characters on Nightmare difficulty, and the first thing to compare between Origin and Oif, is that Yunica and Adol play similarly to each other, without being exactly the same. For example, while Yunica and Adol's fire spells function identically, Yunica gets her fire magic from a sword, which does slightly more damage than her normal weapon, but swings slower. Other than that, their attack patterns are pretty similar, with Adol doing more thrusting as opposed to Yunica swinging her axe about (which makes sense, considering you don't stab with it).      In Origin, your dash attack has a chance of lowering the enemy's defence, including bosses. This is incredibly helpful as it can be chained into your normal combo. In OiF, you still have a dash attack, however, instead of lowering the enemy's defence, it is a quick 3-hits, that can be chained into your normal combo. That being said, in Origin, it's imperative to learn how to effectively use your dash attack, where as in OiF, you can almost completely disregard it, and get by just fine.      The second thing to note, OiF and Origin have a thing called Boost, which functions similar to a Limit Break, if you will; while it's active, movement and attack speed is increased, while damage is greatly reduced. However, Origin added an additional power to that, called Burst, a special attack that, when activated, will use the remaining time on your Boost. The attack varies for each character, but is nice to have, as it's essentially a panic button, to go along with your Limit Break. You don't  need  it, but it's nice to have, in the situations where you are surrounded by enemies with 3 HP, and no way out.      Regarding the difficulty as a whole, of both games, Nightmare is incredibly hard, even frustrating at times, in both Origin and OiF. The difference, however, is that OiF has boss fights that are much more demanding in terms of snap decisions, timing, and reflexes, whereas the dungeons leading up to said fights, are a fun challange. Not particularly terrifying or anything. The first boss, Ellefale, is both a perfect representation of what to expect later on, as well as being a nice throwback to Ys 2, where everything died by fire. If you try to dodge her attacks too early, they will chace after you, and you'll get hit, and likewise, dodge too late, and you get hit. For a first boss, having to learn the timing right then and there is incredibly demanding, especially when you die in 2 or 3 hits. Boss fights like Gyalva and Gildias very much felt the same way, requiring precise timing, quick thinking, and not using every tool in your arsenal will cost you your life.      On the other hand, Origin had much harder dungeons, yet had less demanding boss fights (not to say that they aren't exactly ""harder""). I found myself dying quite a bit, as trash mobs used their numbers and large attack power to hit for all I'm worth. The Water Prison has you fighting enemies that can only be destroyed with your earth power, while trying to navigate underwater, looking for more oxygen. The Silent Desert has enemies that, when you first get there, can't be permanantly killed, all the while traversing quicksand, while they come from the ground and dance around you. At times, I felt myself traversing these dungeons with a sense of caution, as the next batch of enemies, and a wrong move would be the end of me. While poor planning will also get you killed in dungeons in OiF, it felt a lot more frequent in Origin.      Boss fights, however, were a lot more fair. The dodging you had to do from enemy's attacks would prepare you for this moment, because a lot of the bosses have projectiles, or attacks that reach large sections of the field. Jenocres' attacks feel very much like playing a shoot 'em up, for example. Which leads to one of the more noticible changes between Origin and OiF; You see the entire battlefield, and always have eyes on the boss, at all times. During the course of the fight, lightning strikes will come down in the area where you are standing, indicated by circles on the ground. You have to keep running, until the lightning is finished chasing you. Being able to see where  Jenocres is, as well as the entire arena, while dodging attacks that reach every corner of the screen is keeps you from running into another attack, after dodging the last one.      This, cannot be said for OiF. With the exception of Gildias and Ellefale, you do not normally have constant sight on the boss, the entire arena, and Adol, at the same time, without keeping within a certain distance of the boss. The arena in which you fight is about the same average size as the ones in Origin, however, the camera is focused on Adol, zoomed out for the boss fight. What this means is that to see all of the boss's tells and attacks before they happen, you must keep within a certain proximity. However, the result of that is a smaller margin of error for dodging and reacting to attacks.      To compensate for the lack of traditional shops, Origin has a system implemented where you can buy powers, named Blessings, which allow your character active passives such as boosted ailment resistance, reduced damage from terrain, or things such as increased item drop rate. However, on Nightmare, all SP (the currency of the game) is worth 1 SP. With the occasional treasure chest giving SP, you will have just enough SP throughout the game to increase the defence on your armour, and obtain 1 to 2 extra skills, depending on what you get, and assuming you are leveling normally. The lack of shops also means that you will find all of your weapons and armour, and any items you obtain must either be found, or otherwise obtained from the story. OiF does not suffer from this, as it does use the traditional shop. You do still find weapons and armour during your escapades, however, you can also buy weapons, armour, and expendable items. Thankfully, unlike in Origin, currency in the land of Felghana is a lot easier to come by, so there is no worrying about saving for just the right moment.      Upgrading weapons and armour requires two things: money, and Cleria Ore. In OiF, ore comes in abundance, dropped by enemies, along with gold. Every weapon and piece of armour requires both gold, and ore to level up (stat increase), with better equipment being more expensive. Origin has simplified this process, in accordance with the shop system and/or money drop rates. Weapons are upgraded specifically with Cleria Ore, however, they are scattered throughout the game, and power up your weapon enough to last you until the next upgrade, and armour is upgraded by spending SP.

It's definitely hard but it's even more rewarding/satisfying when you overcome the challenges. EXCELLENT soundtrack featuring rocking songs with electric guitar that pump you up as well as emotional orchestral/violin pieces to mellow down6 difficulty levels to completely drive you crazy-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CONS:Some might find the combat to be repetitive (although the boss fights are very different)I can't think of any others!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TLDR;It's got a rocking soundtrack. The gameplay is a mix of fast-paced hack and slash with a healthy dose of exploration, platforming and puzzle-solving, topped off with INSANE boss fights to really push your skills to the limit.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For only $15USD Ys: The Oath in Felghana is far too good to pass up!

												Arguably the greatest game in the Ys series.Ys takes nearly all the extraneous elements of RPGs and tosses them all out in favour of a super streamlined action battle system with some of the greatest bosses gaming has ever seen. I'm not exagerating here, Ys really does have some of gaming's greatest bosses. There were 3 ys games to use this style of engine. The ark of Napishtim (which was the first), The oath in Felghana and finally Origins.Felghana has the greatest soundtrack of them all and arguably the second strongest soundtrack in the entire series (In a series famous for it's soundtracks (look for a psp or psvita for Ys 7 if you want the best soundtrack)).Felghana, on it's hardest difficulty has some spectacular bosses. However the game doesn't put it's best foot forward at the start. Initial bosses are pretty simple and hardly inspiring, which is unfortunate because the later bosses are absolutely spectacular. Thematically unique bosses all with their own interesting quirks and unique mechanics make each big baddy feel wholly unique and incredibly satisfying to down.In fact Felghana and Origins are spectacular examples of good boss design (with a few very obnoxious exceptions).There's also a bit of exploration and secret discovering involved in Ys, and because a number of your abilities give both combat and traversal options there is some fun platforming to be performed in the game.So this all sounds super positive, are there any negatives then? Actually yeah, quite a few.This game isn't pretty, I mean let's be fair it's old (2005) but that's gonna be a turn off for some people.Then there's the plot, Ys' localization is about as good as it can get (Xseed is really good at that) but this isn't a plot that's likely to do anything for you, and not much time is spent on either it or its characters.The game is also very grind heavy, especially on it's higher difficulties. Levels and weapon upgrades in Ys make a huge difference, to the point where a single level can make your attacks do almost twice the damage and can turn some boss fights from cruel jokes into fun encounters. but there are humungous experience penalties once you start over levelling, and even then you're going to have to farm normal mooks just to avoid being underlevelled, which may have been alright except for the game's final weakness, fights that aren't bosses.Ys's combat is simple, but the way it blends with each bosses unique mechanics make it incredibly satisfying. This doesn't occur with normal enemies though, which means for many, normal combat in Ys isn't very satisfying, which is unfortunate because you'll need to do a fair amount of farming basic enemies to be able to afford upgrades and avoidbeing underleveled.So to sum up:+ Awesome soundtrack+ Awesome bosses after the first couple of dungeons- Not very pretty- Grindy on higher diffculties- Fighting basic enemies isn't that fun- Playing on easier difficulties wont let you appreciate it's great bosses properlyYs will appeal extremely strongly to a certain crowd, and that crowd absolutely SHOULD play it, because it's one of the best examples of it's genre. But most other people will likely find the game to be more trouble than it's worth.			"

Even though the game is pretty linear and can be grindy at some times, the pros outweight these cons.First of all, this game has a phenomenal, captivating and rocking Soundtrack, which energizes you to plow through the game's enemies. In general, the Ys games which I played all had pretty good soundtracks.Secondly, the bosses are challenging. Adol died a thousand deaths until I could beat them all. The resulting satisfaction by even beating only one boss was big for me until I had all the different patterns memorized.Finally, the story is rich and the characters can be stereotypical at times, except Adol, because he is the usual silent protagonist.To conclude, if you seek a challenge, you can pick up this game and have some fun beating it			"

Did it without looking anything up like the good old days and had an absolute blast. There are a couple of story triggers you have to pop or you end up wondering wtf you are supposed to do. Ended up so overleveled on that mountain before I realized I needed to escort Elena that the 'Furies' only hit for a few damage. The combat is simple yet fast and fun. The boss fights were unique and challenging, and that final fight was just plain awesome. I swear I remember playing this as a side scroller. The soundtrack is boss. It's so good I'm going to have to do it all over on hard. And hopefully not cry. Much. Highly recommend this game.			"

												Okay, so,There's this kid, right.I don't know if he's a kid or not but he looks like it, unless it's the rendition of him on that horrible boxart from some localized Ys game where he looks like a poor man's Conan.He runs around and kicks the spines out of his enemies. Crushes them. Devestates them. He can jump like a running African and the world around him is full of giant monsters that sit there and wait, their whole life, for this kid to show up. Then they try to kill him and fail, because he's a badass.Then there's this guy named Chester, right.He's a negative point on the metaphorical IGN review.He spits acid and breathes fire.Adol has to do destroy him and trek all the way across the land, from the hangar, through the nuclear plant and command control, stop at central processing - it's a mess. All with no food. Then, he has to travel on foot to Installation 00 so he can activate the Halo Array.Stop and think about that: that's 262,144 LIGHT YEARS on FOOT. The bosses at the first gas station stop on the way range from mildly amusing. The wolf with the sword is way too easy, the convicts in the humvee are overly difficult considering Adol doesn't obtain a firearm until level 28, they could at least have included a save point so you don't have to spend 37 hours (in real time, not game time) doing it again.Final boss is a pushover. The minigame where you have to hide behind the curtains while his minions look for you at the top of his tower is MORE INTERESTING than the boss himself. After he dies, Great Fox picks you up, Adol returns to the Liberl Kingdom where some white haired jerkass going under the name of Morpheus gives him two handguns named Ebony & Ivory. It's pointless because you cannot use them as there are no more enemies to fight. There you are free to roam about on your Big Wheel obtained after the first third of the game located in Boletaria. This is where a lot of issues start coming in, because NG+ doesn't support vehicle upgrades. This effectively forces you to walk through each area and run into far too many random encounters with wild animals.I mean, look,It's a 6/10 game.But it's a 9/10 EXPERIENCE. Either go with this or Artificial Academy. Crash Bandicoot is another great Falcom game as well, but it lacks the optimization that this does.I'm done now. Too much for one day. Stick upside down.

												I first played this game on SNES back in the day. It was hard then and it's hard now, I love it. Nothing like the feeling of finally beating a boss that has been giving you a hard ♥♥♥ time. Most games nowadays you can beat in one sitting, not the case with Y's : The Oath in Felghana. I put 40 hours in it so far and I'm still not done the game, the story is pretty straight foward like most old titles ( it actually seems to be the very same story that it had on SNES ) but more than makes up for with awesome gameplay. Maybe not as important to some gamers out there but the soundtrack is absolutely amazing too!! Controls are a little frustrating when using mouse//keyboard but once I plugged in my XbaX controller the game played very smoothly, I'd actually recommend using a gamepad for this game over keyb//mouse. I'd give this title a 9/10, a must have for any JRPG fan! ( -1 for pretty much NEEDING a controller. )			"

												I'm not a huge JRPG guy, but I absolutely adore the Ys (pronounced ""ease"") series, of which this is the 3rd entry.  The Ys games are all extremely fast-paced action RPGs with rockin' ADVENTURE METAL soundtracks, and they all star Adol Christin, a dauntless adventurer who makes the ladies melt with his flaming red mane.  The stories the games tell are very simple, sort of like epic fairy tales, and they thankfully lack that chirping, cheap fakeness that hangs over most JRPG narratives like a pall.  There are always archetypes to be sure (the angel-pure but troubled maiden, the grizzled old battlemaster), but Ys possesses a sincerity that appeals on a deep level.Even though this game doesn't have the frenetic ""bump"" combat of the first two entries (a mechanic that really turned me on, gamerwise) Felghana's push-to-slash fighting is every bit as frenzied and quite a bit more strategic.  Also, with the exception of the Azure Statue in Tigray Quarry (the first level), the bosses are spectacular.			"

												Well made port of the PSP version. The controls are excellent seeing as all of the problems I've had were only with me not jumping too great on the platforms.The boss battles are quite challenging (unless you're on very easy) and you'll want to destroy your keyboard & mouse/controller after dying time after time (you do get an achievement for dying 10 times on the same boss, so don't feel too bad!) but it is a rewarding experience that truly tests your skills. While it is just a good 'ol hack & slash, it's a really fun action RPG and as such is a great installment in one my favourite series.			"

												Note: I already beat this game a long time ago. Ys games tend to be very well done action RPGs that are accompanied by a story that isn't nearly as interesting as the gameplay and some of the most bad ♥♥♥ music in gaming. Ys: The Oath in Felghana is no damn exception to this rule.Though it may suffer from a plot that is less deep than a small pond and yet deeper than a puddle, it packs a damn good punch in the gameplay department with its fast-paced hack-and-slash combat. But just because the game is a hack-and-slasher RPG doesn't mean it's an easy game to play, as you will have to use certain abilities and time your attacks in all of the game's boss battles, as well as plan your attacks at the right time in the right place to pull off combo attacks to gain an XP bonus. Yes, the game gives you an XP bonus for your combos. Magic is also important in the game, but unlike other RPGs where you learn magic through training, you gain magic abilities through rings that can be found throughout the game (three in all), and you can find gems that are of the same color of a specific magic ring to improve the strength of that ring. The game also allows you to better your current equipment at the blacksmith's shop in the main town, but it unfortunately does kinda fall flat in terms of scope, although it is still recommended to better your current equipment in order to reduce damage taken. Like most Ys games, Felghana has bad ♥♥♥ music. The tracks range from orchestrated instrumentals to bad ♥♥♥ guitar riffs. The game's graphics are often compared to that of an original PlayStation game, albeit with a better framerate than most PS1 games dream of having. The graphics are mostly okay. They could have been better, but they do their job well enough. The game runs well on PCs that tend to be extremely shity, so those who have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PCs should not worry about this game running horribly on their PCs. Overall, the game is an essential game to play for those who love action RPGs and should be a game that gets more love. The game is also for the PSP, so if you're still worried about your PC not being able to run it, and you own a PSP, you can get it on that.			"

												One of my all time favorites and the game that got me into the Ys series which I criminally ignored until a couple of years ago. Great hack and slash game with tight controls and high replayability. You're definitely going to play this more than once.Be advised though, this game is HARD. As in, don't start it on the hardest difficulty if this is your first time playing as this game is actually an old game, not something that was made in the last 3 years. This means this game was developed back when ""hard mode"" actually meant HARD MODE and not just a slightly harder normal mode where you still pretty much streamroll through the game. I cannot put enough emphasis on this, this game is HARD and you're going to die over and over and over until you finally learn to get good at it.For people who hate JRPGS and whatnot don't worry, this game, much like most of the Ys series games, is anti grind so you'll never be underleveled. You also don't have to fiddle around with a bloated inventory or anything like that as your character's progression is pretty straightforward (You don't get different type of swords with different properties, just better swords with more attack power so you can just ignore your old gear).The soundtrack is easily one of the highlights of this game. It's probably one of the, if not THE game with the best soundtrack in the entire Ys series and a pretty close contender for game with the best soundtrack ever.Getting 100% completion is something only the most hardcore players will be able to achieve due to how insanely hard the last difficulties are, so be ready to invest a huge amount of time on that task dying over and over.Special note: Don't pay attention to the store images, the game actually has full widescreen support which was added shortly after the game came out so it won't look as bad as in those screenshots, don't worry.Bad stuff:* Cutscenes. You can't fully skip them, you have to hold a button to autoskip every bit of dialogue and waste tons of minutes doing nothing. This is especially aggravating when you're on your 3rd playthrough or so.* Xbox 360 controller support: Game has no native xinput support so your left and right triggers wont work. Easily fixable by using joy2key or something but to be honest you don't even need those buttons to begin with.			"

												3rd game in a series of 4. I did not know this so i started with the 3rd one. I hear it's not much of a continuation from the other 2, so it's fine to start on this one. Pro:Hack and Slash with a few rpg elements with armor and upgrading. EnjoyableMusic is pretty good. It just reminds me of the JRPGs i played long ago. Con:-Some frustrating bosses. The game itself is pretty easy to handle if geared. The bosses are tricky though and some compare it to Dark Souls. Once the pattern is figured out, it's pretty awesome beating them. It's a nice acomplishment.-Some grindy elements. If you're underleveled and having issues, you'll have to grind out some levels and then it gets easier. Game length can vary. There's an achievement for under 5 hours and one for over 10 hours. It took me a little over 10.			"

												Ys The Oath in Felghana is a remake of Ys III in the Ys series. It had a massive overhaul from the original that includes gameplay, style, graphics, and music. It's action RPG goodness to say the least. I know veteran fans will blast me, but think of Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past on crack with a lot of enemies, 80's rock and power metal, tough bosses, and leveling, but without the puzzles, exploration and Zelda.If you want to jump in to the series, I recommend you play it on Easy first. Normal isn't that hard but the bosses will punish you for mistakes. The bosses themselves don't look bad and they have set patterns but dodging is harder than it looks and if you can't keep up BOOM! That's a tenth or more of your health gone.There's also a bit of level scaling to the table. Say a boss is level 15, and you're level 12. You are going to get mopped on the floor. It's possible but it's really hard. Climb up to level 15 and you should be okay. Level up to 16. It's almost a joke! For the most part.Lastly, you don't have to play the past series to understand the story because each entry in the series is a new adventure. Ys I and II are the execptions because they're sequels to each other.			"

												This game has the classic SNES feel but with enhanced graphics. The pacing of this game is smooth with minimal to zero amount of grinding. What this game does extremely well are the boss fights and the soundtrack. If you are looking for a few hours of a classic adventure game then Ys: The Oath in Felghana is worth picking up.			"

												If you've enjoyed other Ys games (particularly Ys III / Wanderers of Ys which this is a remake of), this is an absolute must-play.  I was wary of it because I know Ys games tend to have particularly brutal boss battles, but the lowest difficulty is easily doable for a first-timer (though bosses may still be a challenge).  Higher difficulties will give you more of a run for your money, with stronger enemies with more HP.In terms of content, it's no more than a 10-hour game realistically, and maybe doesn't seem like much by today's RPG standards, but especially if you've played the original Ys III you'll enjoy the vast improvements to the story, the reimaginings of the setting, and the rearrangement of the soundtrack.

												Five hours in, and I can't get enough of this game.If you like isometric hack and slash rpgs, and a decent challenge, this is the game for you. The gameplay's tight, and requires a certain level of skill so that you don't get wrecked, even on normal. The visuals are decent for the type of game it is, and for when it came out, but aren't going to win any awards. The main strengths of this game come in the boss fights, which are varied and unique, and will destroy you the first few attempts. The level design is also standout, and makes exploring for equipment and items more interesting.The story's pretty weak, and really just serves to move your character from area to area, but the dialogue is cheesy enough to make up for it. And the music, while mostly being decent, never really does anything spectacular, and can, though rarely, be grating.All in all, for the first game in a long running series to try something new, it really comes together as more than the sum of it's parts, and what it lacks in polish, it makes up for in charm.

												Since The Wanders from Ys 3, I have loved this game in all its variations. It was my first experience with the Ys series, so it's always held a spot in my top ten lists. After playing Ys: TOiF, I was surprised by the some of the changes and the additions of different story-lines, as well as more characters being added in. As for the game play, it is more of a top-down style RPG, having you hack and slash every enemy you come across. It can get a bit repetitive, especially if you are overwhelmed by some enemies in an area, but with the upgrading system for your items, the spell system you could call it, and the musical score, it may just be me, but I find it hard to get bored with the game.This review is probably on the more biased side, but I would just say, if you are curious, give it a try and don't get discouraged if you end up hitting a bit of a roadblock at certain points. The Ys series was never one for much hand holding, just pointing you in one direction with a pat on the back, then going from there.			"

												Ys is a remake of a classic RPG that has been around for for almost three decades. It is one of your more standard JPRGs. There's a lot of grinding involved and a lot of back tracking as well. Ys is one of those RPGs that don't always tell you where you need to go or what to do. Most of the game's story progress is based on in game events, so you may find yourself wandering around and then having to back track in order to actually get anywhere.As a standard JRPG there isn't anything too bad about it, the graphics are good, for it's age, it has a decent sound track and there's some very nice hand drawn animation as well. One of the bigger problems with Ys is the fact that while it's a standard action-rpg, it incorporates platforming elements that can be tedious at best, infuriating at worst. There's been several times I have actually had to quit playing the game due to this issue. If you are a fan of difficult JRPGs, then Ys will do fine by you, if you aren't a huge fan of massive grinding or back tracking, this won't be your cup of tea. People who want to play RPGs ""for the story"" are going to find they are going to have to slog their way through Ys difficulty and BS in order to get to the meat of the story.			"

												Not as good as Ys Origin. The difficulty is uneven. There is a lot of rooms to get through from one checkpoint to another. I had to use some weird strategies, like grinding mobs for a little before returning to the checkpoint, doing it over and over a few times, and then rushing through the level avoiding the fight to get to the next checkpoint. A few tweaks on the checkpoints placement and on mobs strenght would have make the experience far more enjoyable.At least you got some epic boss fights, but navigation is quite painful.			"

It is a rather mindless hack-n-slash (weak story), with old-schoolish graphics, fun fast-paced combat (just like in the video), and some interesting moves, all screwed up by horrendously tedious jumping puzzles. I mean the type that you fail 16 times in a row, falling 2 floors down and having to re-fight your way through multiple rooms only to get back to the beginning of the ""puzzle"" for the 17th time. The boss fights are pretty awesome, but some of the more platformy levels are ridiculously bad, and unforgiveable. Ask yourself: When I finally beat a level I had to repeat 20 times, what do I say? 1) YESSSSS!! *fist-pump*2) Ha, that took a while.3) Blegh, annoying.4) IT'S ABOUT @#$@ING TIME!!If your answer is anything but 1, avoid this game like the herp.

In general, the Ys games which I played all had pretty good soundtracks.Secondly, the bosses are challenging. Adol died a thousand deaths until I could beat them all. The resulting satisfaction by even beating only one boss was big for me until I had all the different patterns memorized.Finally, the story is rich and the characters can be stereotypical at times, except Adol, because he is the usual silent protagonist.To conclude, if you seek a challenge, you can pick up this game and have some fun beating it			"

												Went into this game with extremely high expectations based on the comments on this site.  I should have looked elsewhere.  The controls are clunky for a 3D-ish game - you'll find yourself having to mash jump multiple times when your jumps matter, i.e. crossing platforms, etc., and your character will go off missing constantly due to the horrible control.  There is very little forgiveness when it comes to progression.  You have to grind to get your level to the appropriate point for each different area, and then return to the save at the start of the area incase something stupid happens, or else you waste an hour of your time and have to do it all again.  This game boils down to ""Make sure you are the max level for the area you're in, or you will die, over and over.""  There's no rushing, and no amount of skill of dodging/countering will compensate for being 2 levels shy of what you ""should be"".Imo, skip this one.			"

												I like the interface alot, and the graphics and gameplay are very well done. It's definitely a lot of fun to be able to run around and play. The bosses, however, are a huge drawback. I have no idea what they were thinking when designing them, but they are probably the most anti-fun, redundant and repetitive bosses I've ever played against since the original Nintendo. They aren't difficult to fight against, but they always have some stupid gimick to work around, like having a shield you have to wait out, or literally spending 90% of the fight outside of the map shooting at you from where you can't even fight back. Another massive drawback to the boss fights is how often you can count on getting hit by an attack that has clearly missed, or getting hit by an attack even after its animation has ended. I wish it were as simple as ""git gud"", but you're fighting against the game's design more than you are actual the actual bosses, in battles. Ys Origin is much better, I'd recommend that one over Felghana.			"

												Regular enemies pose no threat whatsoever. Bosses have very simple attack patterns that you must dodge for what feels like hours, then you get hit and die because you practically fell asleep watching their million hp go down so slowly.

												No controller support. No support for widescreen aspect ratios, so it looks funny and stretched out. I loved Ys III on SNES way back when, so I was looking forward to playing this, but couldn't get past the poor controls and lack of video options. To folks who don't mind the stretched out graphics and poor control scheme the game itself may be fine for all I know, but there are just too many great games out there for me to spend time on one that wasn't put together properly for PC release.

												Beware, the game contains a lot extremely frustrating platforming sequences (think of the meat circus in psychonauts): 1) The controls are not sensitive. 2) There are many pixel perfect jumps, doubly jumps, etc. 3) Some of them take place on ice: even with antislippery shoes, you still slip a little. So good luck. 4) You can only save at checkpoints, but the checkpoints are few and far between. Did you just happen to die after that platforming sequence? Do it all over again.			"

												I feel I have played this before. actually I have as the Wanderer from Ys. Well most of it. this is a 3D remake of a classic 8bit rpg. They did a great job with it for the most part. its not exact to the original but there cant be any better remake. Ys is made in the very popular big head ISO 3D style that was very popular this past decade. the combat is great for and the rpg elements are balanced. the story is pretty cliche in points and the engine is fairly solid. 6.5/10			"

												You really need to get this game.  It is a remake/retelling of Ys III and one of the tightest-controlling action RPGs you'll ever play.There's no requirement to know the lore of the Ys series to jump right into the game, so jump on it! Jump on it! Keep it started! Jump on it!  While it is sometimes difficult, at no point will you feel that the game is being cheap - whenever you die, you'll feel like it's your fault.

												I've been a big fan of the Ys series since I played the SNES port of Wanderers From Ys 3. The gameplay is very fast-paced and boss battles are very intense. The music is a joy to listen to, especially for me since I got to listen to the familiar music with a serious steroid injection! While the game itself can be completed in less than 5 hours (A feat that you earn an achievement for!) they had the courtesy to provide us with 6 different difficulties and a time attack mode. I definitely recommend picking this game up if you're looking for a new RPG to run through and have 15 dollars to spare.			"

												This game is one of the best JRPGs on Steam at the moment, but Ys: Origin is slightly better in most ways. This Ys game has more - and better - metal music than Origin does, but Origin really nailed the violin sound, much better than this game. Besides that, this game isn't quite as linear as Origin, but then Origin makes up for it by telling a better story and multiple characters with multiple stories.This game's graphics can be slightly bland with the odd shading style, but in a way it's quite a work of art. The level designs are actually well done. The controls are responsive besides my nit pick with upward slashing. Bosses are EPIC, especially as you progress. The game is literally worth $5 JUST for the boss fights. It's a fun game that will probably take you about 10-15 hours to beat once, but if you want to get all the items and sidequests (there aren't a lot of items, as it's a fairly short game compared to most RPGs), you'll probably spend more than 15 hours. I admit the story could be better, but in the end it's a great game!Rating: 7/10Worth: $5 - $10			"

The game in its self (even on normal mode) is quite hard when it comes to bosses. Precise timing and dodging is required or you'll get rekt. Armor & Weapons are purchasable & upgradable via blacksmith in town. Story is compelling and the characters are well developed.

												This game is really good.It's a remake of an older game which I did rent when I was younger but didn't really care for because the original was a bit too stiff of a challenge, especially when I was only 7 or so. Though the remake is very much a better game, even at the start and even though is a bit dated, the art style is beautiful and it does have great enhancements compared to the original.The story is pretty basic but it was entertaining. It had a pretty good story to it and the characters were interesting. The main antagonist was pretty interesting in his own right even if he wasn't the final boss he still was a good adversary and he was obviously strong through the entire story and had his own motives. The story by todays standards might seem like nothing special but it does tell an old game plot pretty well with enough spice to make it interesting. There are many interesting characters in the narrative and the ending was probably one of the better endings in recent memory. It left an impression.The music is fantastic. Everything is wonderful in the soundtrack and the sound effects are really good. Nothing to complain about here.The gameplay is awesome. It's very fast paced with enough depth to keep someone interested. Though I do love Action RPGs but this game is pretty challenging on Normal. Probably one the hardest Action RPG's with the exception of DarK Souls. It's not as insane as Dark Souls but it does have quite a bit of frustrating moments. At moments it does require the player to grind to get through the tough boss battles. The boss battles are intense but do give a sense of reward after they are defeated. The good thing about the gameplay is that if you die at a boss battle you don't have to go to your last check point but at the boss fight itself. Once you nab the pattern down for the bosses they are much easier but they do require a bit of skill and luck to defeat, including the final boss which when I saw it fall gave a huge sense of satisfaction.If you're not really good at these kinds of games, I would reccomend playing on Easy instead of Normal. I did complete the game on Normal but the challenge was almost to the point where it started to interfiere with how fun the game was. Though it does give a great sense of satisfaction, so if you like challening Action RPG's, this one should fit the bill. Even if Normal is too easy for you there are other difficulities which I will personally never try but they're there for those who are into that.The game doesn't have much replayability but I think that I'll defintly play it again down the road. Doesn't have a new game + that the PSP version has but that's fine, it's fine how it is.Story: 8/10Graphics: 8/10Sound: 10/10Gameplay: 9/10FINAL SCORE: 8.5/10I fully reccomend this game especially for the price point. Can't go wrong. "

												This game is really good.It's a remake of an older game which I did rent when I was younger but didn't really care for because the original was a bit too stiff of a challenge, especially when I was only 7 or so. Though the remake is very much a better game, even at the start and even though is a bit dated, the art style is beautiful and it does have great enhancements compared to the original.The story is pretty basic but it was entertaining. It had a pretty good story to it and the characters were interesting. The main antagonist was pretty interesting in his own right even if he wasn't the final boss he still was a good adversary and he was obviously strong through the entire story and had his own motives. The story by todays standards might seem like nothing special but it does tell an old game plot pretty well with enough spice to make it interesting. There are many interesting characters in the narrative and the ending was probably one of the better endings in recent memory. It left an impression.The music is fantastic. Everything is wonderful in the soundtrack and the sound effects are really good. Nothing to complain about here.The gameplay is awesome. It's very fast paced with enough depth to keep someone interested. Though I do love Action RPGs but this game is pretty challenging on Normal. Probably one the hardest Action RPG's with the exception of DarK Souls. It's not as insane as Dark Souls but it does have quite a bit of frustrating moments. At moments it does require the player to grind to get through the tough boss battles. The boss battles are intense but do give a sense of reward after they are defeated. The good thing about the gameplay is that if you die at a boss battle you don't have to go to your last check point but at the boss fight itself. Once you nab the pattern down for the bosses they are much easier but they do require a bit of skill and luck to defeat, including the final boss which when I saw it fall gave a huge sense of satisfaction.If you're not really good at these kinds of games, I would reccomend playing on Easy instead of Normal. I did complete the game on Normal but the challenge was almost to the point where it started to interfiere with how fun the game was. Though it does give a great sense of satisfaction, so if you like challening Action RPG's, this one should fit the bill. Even if Normal is too easy for you there are other difficulities which I will personally never try but they're there for those who are into that.The game doesn't have much replayability but I think that I'll defintly play it again down the road. Doesn't have a new game + that the PSP version has but that's fine, it's fine how it is.Story: 8/10Graphics: 8/10Sound: 10/10Gameplay: 9/10FINAL SCORE: 8.5/10I fully reccomend this game especially for the price point. Can't go wrong. "

												This game is great for all of those who like hard, fast games.  I would honestly put this thing on par with Dark Souls for difficulty, requiring much trial and error if you refuse to play with a walkthrough (like me).The camera angle is static but is rather comfortable, and the graphics are charming.  The game is also rather light in that it's easy to just pick up, play through a dungeon and advance the story a little, then put down again for another day. The music is also beautiful, making me want to sit in dungeons areas after clearing a room of enemies just so I can listen to it.Obviously if you're looking at JRPG classic like Ys, graphics aren't exactly what you're seeking.  You're searching for a game that fast, challenging, and ultimately rewarding once you finish the task, and Ys: The Oath in Felghana delivers just that.			"

												It's an excellent remake of a weird entry in the Ys series, with fast, blistering fights and an outstanding revamped soundtrack. Buy it already before Dogi busts your damned walls. That said, the one thing that strikes me as weird is the ""rebalance"" of the boss fights; certain fights that I remember as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-hard in the original Ys III are actually manageable now, while some formerly forgettable minibosses got jacked up into diesel-powered ♥♥♥ destroyers (looking at you, Death Fallion).

												If you're looking for a starightforward action RPG with amazing music, tight controls, and satisfying combat (especially bosses), this should be a go-to.There really aren't very many flaws in the game, aside from the game not looking amazing and some weak plot here and there.But this can be pretty easily overlooked with how fun the hack-and slash combat is. The music is some of Falcom's best, so try to play with headphones. Also, this game can be kinda tough, especially on the harder difficulties. The bosses will prove that pretty quickly, since it's likely you'll die the first time or two trying to figure out patterns and weaknesses. But after that it'll either be a cakewalk or a satisfying triumph.Overall, I'd give this an 8/10			"

												Ys Book I&II was keen on glorifying the boss battle. This game, which is actually a reimagined Ys III, starts simple with its combat, but later in the game OiF rivals Darksouls in my opinion in regards to sheer creativity and challenge implemented with its boss battles. As far as 'hard' difficulty goes, I cant say Im up to the task. Just too much grind involved. Though, to eliminate any need for grinding and still enjoy a healthy challenging experiance, just play it on 'Easy' and rush through avoiding grinding completely. The bosses will get tough fairly rapidly.I'd certainly recommend it for 5 bucks.			"

One of the Best ARPG/HacknSlash games there is, FALCOM is really known as a company that goes beyond the tropes and thorws in some hard difficulty on the bosses and on the gameplay that will really grind your gears. (specially on harder difficulties =z) The Original Soundtrack is terrific, the boss battles are insanely fun (and soul crushing), the story is great and the level design is blissfully awesome!

												Having played the original Wanderer from YS3 on the Sega Genesis, this remake is a huge overhaul to the entire game. Previously cleared this remake of YS in 2006 when the original Japanese version was released for PC, but purchased and cleared again for nostalgia when it was re-released on Steam. Gameplay is action-RPG'ish (resembling both Zelda and Diablo), as the player controls the main character from an overhead third person view. Character can level up and acquire a set of sword-skills and magic to demolish enemies that are encountered throughout the game. Storyline is very well-paced, keeping the user focused on the set objectives he must accomplish to get to the next segment. Music is absolutely amazing, setting the tone of each and every stage the character enters. Graphics are outdated by modern standards, but the gameplay and music completely allow the user to forget about it. Highly recommend. 5 out of 5 stars.			"

												Ys:Oath in Felghana is a remake of Ys:III for various platforms like the Megadrive and the PC Engine. The original was a black sheep side-scrolling action rpg with some dodgy hit detection but the remake uses tne engine from Ys: Ark of Napishtim which is sadly not yet on Steam. It becomes a top-down action rpg again and is much better for it. The only problem is that, like most Ys games, it's rather short but with the multiple skill levels to choose from, it does add something to come back for.			"

But that's nbd, cause one can just beam Adol out of the situation. Anyways, fabulous music, really fun to play, the bosses are a bit of a challenge making them hella satifying to beat.

												Ys 3 becomes Zelda 3! While the original Ys 3 was a side-scrolling game, OiF brings the Ys 3 storyline into a ""classic Zelda"" perspective. The story, atmosphere, and gameplay are all solid. The characters are all very likeable, and even the minor characters have enough lines where you actually get to know them quite well. Multiple difficulty levels add to the replay value of this game. A dream come true for fans of the original Ys games who wished for an attack button (as opposed to their classic ""jousting"" style of combat).			"

												The best thing I can say is I simply PLAYED IT from beginning to end. No crashes, no glitches, no stupid game mechanics, no frustrations. This is a simple game. You pick it up, learn it, and your challanges are laid out before you.The game feels a lot like Zelda: LttP. You wander a world, go through dungeons, beat things up. The game holds your hand through the storyline; the challenges are the bosses and dungeons, not figuring out where to go next. There's no major things to miss; most things are in plain sight. It's all about the battles here.I beat it in about 6 hours on Very Easy. Very Easy is stupidly easy. I never died. Inferno is sadistic. No healing items, massive damage from monsters, it's a challenge alright!The story itself is kind of derivative. That said, I came to understand the characters, the authors took time to make them seem human. The music is pretty awesome too; growing more and more epic as you approach the end. The final 5 tracks are so just blew my mind.			"

So I decided to get the steam version and mos def a great purchase. Like others have said it's a great game zelda meets metroidvania and fast paced gameplay, and it's a hard game which is perfect for me the type of games I love.  I can't believe i waited this long to play this game. After I'm done with this game i will start playing catch up with the other Ys: games that i haven't played, including the Ys: games that are on steam and the other Ys: games on the psp that i missed out on. If you are a fan of ARPGs, Zelda, Alundra, Metroid, 2d castlevanias or anything similar you will love this game.			"

												The purchase includes a soundtrack in .ogg format.If you're familiar with the Y's series, that alone should be a sale; these games have some of the most delightfully heart-pumping adventure music ever to so generously grace my ears.On top of that, the gameplay of the remake is actually quite well done; Control is fast and fluid, the magic is quick and flashy, kill-streak systems keep things moving and beating the crap out of monsters is genuinely fun. Concessions to convenience, such as an unrestricted teleport system, keep mid-to-lategame travel times and backtracking relatively painless.If I had to nitpick, I'd pick on a flaw endemic to the Y's series based on its action-RPG makeup, which is that boss difficulty can vary dramatically based on your gear; Especially early on, it can go from very difficult to near-trivial in the span of a single level-up or equipment upgrade.Still, If you're looking for an old-schoolish platformer-slasher action-RPG, head to Felghana.

												This is the third Ys game I have played up to this point and its definitely my favorite one so far. I haven't played Ys origin yet or any of the PSP ones but this one is the best combat of the Ys games IMO. While my knowledge is only from ys 1 and 2, I think oath in felghana has a better combat system due to the fact it has an actual combat system.While it centers around one area only they're still things to do even after you complete a certain dungeon. The main reason for return to each area as you progress through the game is the metroidvania like system that's implemented. As you gain new powers new areas that may have been inaccessible open up (Like a higher platform) and most of them have really cool treasure locked away.Main story features Adol the Red and Doji returning to Doji's homeland and things soon get out of hand for the Duo (Like usual). Adol is seemingly stripped of everything at the start yet again, but from a gameplay perspective I understand why. I would have liked if they featured his last games armor and weapons as the basic starter items though.The combat system is miles ahead of what ys 1 and 2 had with a combo system, magic built in, multiple magic moves that have charging attacks as well, can jump in the air and do air combos and downward slamming attacks.A lot of the enemies in the game have some strong defenses in one category but may be extremely weak to another category (Strong vs attacks, weak vs magic). Once you figure out each enemies weakness they become slighty easier to kill off.Bosses are really awesome in this game and most of them feel bullet-hellish (To a minor degree, nothing insane) and require you to learn the bosses patterns to beat them effectively. Some bosses do become pushovers if you overlevel an area via grinding.Music is badass like usual with electric guitar and electronica sounds mixed into the game for a bunch of memorable tunes. Also another nice feature is no more grinding an enemy over and over again for its bestiary (Only have to beat it once for it information).Positive:Great combat systemInteresting combos both in the air and groundMultiple magic charging attacksReally interesting boss mechanicsNegative:Stripped of everything at the startNo voice over			"

												I would toootally recommend this! I feel a little empty now that it's done, but luckily there are more y's games to play. I did find a little glitch that's probably not even worth mentioning... towards the end of the game when Adol was sent back to Redmont, I decided to try and find the last hidden ore, and got stuck in the chicken coop in Elena's house- jumped through the window onto the beam and got stuck. But that's nbd, cause one can just beam Adol out of the situation. Anyways, fabulous music, really fun to play, the bosses are a bit of a challenge making them hella satifying to beat. And the language is smart but not too juvenile. SPOILER ALERT: Chester punches Elena in the stomache towards the end (in context it's emotional) but being a sister, I laughed.			"

												You really need to get this game.  It is a remake/retelling of Ys III and one of the tightest-controlling action RPGs you'll ever play.There's no requirement to know the lore of the Ys series to jump right into the game, so jump on it! Jump on it! Keep it started! Jump on it!  While it is sometimes difficult, at no point will you feel that the game is being cheap - whenever you die, you'll feel like it's your fault.  Plus, the bad guy in the game is named Chester.  CHESTER.  It doesn't get any better than that.			"

												Following the adventures of the main hero Adol christin each Ys game is episodic aside from Ys 2 so no worries about the order. Game plays Super smooth and looks incredible in motion. Really high quality animations and Sprite work at high resolution and a silky smooth framerate with Great action music and  gameplay. Simple mechenics charming story and characters and super fun gameplay. This game might not look like much but man it plays like Zelda fused with megaman on Roids which is awesome  If you want something that fuses that old school awesome feeling with some newer feel try this out. Its playable with any configureation but a controller is more ideal. Mote normal mode is pretty tough this game wont hesitate to kill you where as the other Ys game`s normal modes are a lot more fair so if your going into this dont expect a walk in the park.Start with rather this or Origin if your intrested 1 and 2 are crazy old school. Also prepare for some epic boss fights. some of the most memerable boss fights on a PC game IMO are found here. Definintly Check this out, Adol is awesome and Ys is awesome ^.^			"

How about brutally difficulty, fast-paced, real time RPG combat? Blend that all together and you have Ys - The Oath in Felghana. I know nothing about the original Ys games, nor have I played the other three on Steam yet. But as an intro to the series, I am very pleased I picked this up. Am I completely terrible at the game?

												This is probably the finest action-rpg (emphasis on action) I have ever played.  The combat is satisfying, the bosses are brutal (in a good way), and the metroidvania-esque exploration elements are a very nice touch.  I also like that the game is difficult (even on Normal), but never unfair.  If you're in the mood for something resembling classic zelda but with far more emphasis on action than puzzles (there are a few, but puzzles are definitely not the focus here), I cannot recommend this game highly enough.  If I could only recommend one game on Steam, this would be it.			"

If you enjoyed games such as Soul Blazer, Star Ocean: Till the End of Time, Tales of Symphonia then you'll be sure to enjoy Ys: The Oath in Felghana. The only downside is that it's not a long game, it's pretty short. If you rushed through it, you can get it done in less than 5 hours... Sadly. :( "

												I would toootally recommend this! I feel a little empty now that it's done, but luckily there are more y's games to play. I did find a little glitch that's probably not even worth mentioning... towards the end of the game when Adol was sent back to Redmont, I decided to try and find the last hidden ore, and got stuck in the chicken coop in Elena's house- jumped through the window onto the beam and got stuck. But that's nbd, cause one can just beam Adol out of the situation. Anyways, fabulous music, really fun to play, the bosses are a bit of a challenge making them hella satifying to beat. And the language is smart but not too juvenile. SPOILER ALERT: Chester punches Elena in the stomache towards the end (in context it's emotional) but being a sister, I laughed.			"

												Did you enjoy the original Ys and YsII? Then get this, no questions or doubts about it. It's a new game, starring the same lovable Adol Christin, in a new world, with a completely revamped combat system, a stellar story which even the worst of grumps will be glad to go through, a rockin OST, and graphics that, though they've shown their age (and some areas have weird missing backdrop issues) they stand the test of time with beautifully crafted sprites and animations. This game lasted me as long as both Ys and YsII combined, and I enjoyed every bit of it. Please, if you have the money and time, don't pass up on this classic.			"

Had never played an Ys title before, but now I'm determined to hunt down as many as I can find.  The design aesthetic, music, gameplay, and even the characters makes for a great little package.  You don't need any prior knowledge of the Ys franchise to get the most out of this game.  Finished in about 20 hrs....Then hunted down Ys III (on which this is based) for the TG-16, and played through that.....and then played through Felghana again.  This game rocks.P.S.

												By far one of the best games I've ever had the pleasure of playing.  And as a big fan of Ys in general, I consider this to be the best of the series.  As with the rest of the Ys series, the world is built wonderfully.  Every area in the game feels very unique and interesting.  Every character in the game also has their own name, portrait, and a bit of personal character to them, no matter how insignificant their role is.  I've always found this to be a wonderful attribute to the Ys series, and makes character interactions feel more intimate and special than what you get in many RPGs.The gameplay is also top notch in Felghana.  Each area is laid out very well and presents a challenge to overcome.  The bosses are also incredibly well designed, and some of the best I've seen in any game.  Boss battles are fast-paced and challenging, and despite the high difficulty, everything feels completely fair.  Every single attack is avoidable through practice, skill, and reflexes, no matter how ridiculous they may seem at first, which is something I absolutely love to see in my games.  While I highly recommend playing on the highest difficulty for Ys games to really get your blood pumping, there are also several easier settings for more casual players who aren't as good at fast paced action games, offering something for everyone.Graphically, the game looks great.  Despite being pretty old (original Japanese PC release in 2005), the visual design and artstyle were done very well.  The colors, lighting, animations, models, and so on all just look fantastic, and I feel they'll hold up well forever.  Falcom just did a great job there.The music is wonderful too.  Falcom games always have top notch music, and Felghana is no different.  They really did a good job with the soundtrack.  Unfortunately, unlike the PSP release, the Steam release doesn't have the option to change to the alternate soundtracks from the PC88 or X68000 versions of Wanderers of Ys, but this is a minor complaint that shouldn't matter much except to enthusiasts of the sound from those old machines.  The Windows soundtrack is phenominal to be sure.This game is just so good and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes fun.			"

												If you're looking for a starightforward action RPG with amazing music, tight controls, and satisfying combat (especially bosses), this should be a go-to.There really aren't very many flaws in the game, aside from the game not looking amazing and some weak plot here and there.But this can be pretty easily overlooked with how fun the hack-and slash combat is. The music is some of Falcom's best, so try to play with headphones. Also, this game can be kinda tough, especially on the harder difficulties. The bosses will prove that pretty quickly, since it's likely you'll die the first time or two trying to figure out patterns and weaknesses. But after that it'll either be a cakewalk or a satisfying triumph.Overall, I'd give this an 8/10			"

This is not a friendly game totally an understatement, but I keep wanting to come back to it after I pick up the controller I threw across the room.

												I've always loved the Ys series since I was a kid playing Ys: Vanished Omen on the Sega Master System, but this title goes above and beyond  what a Ys game should be. Truly a Magnum Opus. The soundtrack is flawless as usual, and the complete overhaul of the 2D sidescroller Ys III into OiF is handled well. The game is fast, but requires you to think on your feet (especially on the higher difficulties) and the bosses are always quite a challenge to work through.			"

												Brilliant little Hack N Slash/RPG hybrid. The gameplay feels fun, fresh and visceral, the story is charming and everything just feels perfectly crafted. Also, the OST is really brilliant, and warrants a listen to even if you don't intend to buy the game. Near perfection for what it is trying to do.			"

												By far one of the best games I've ever had the pleasure of playing.  And as a big fan of Ys in general, I consider this to be the best of the series.  As with the rest of the Ys series, the world is built wonderfully.  Every area in the game feels very unique and interesting.  Every character in the game also has their own name, portrait, and a bit of personal character to them, no matter how insignificant their role is.  I've always found this to be a wonderful attribute to the Ys series, and makes character interactions feel more intimate and special than what you get in many RPGs.The gameplay is also top notch in Felghana.  Each area is laid out very well and presents a challenge to overcome.  The bosses are also incredibly well designed, and some of the best I've seen in any game.  Boss battles are fast-paced and challenging, and despite the high difficulty, everything feels completely fair.  Every single attack is avoidable through practice, skill, and reflexes, no matter how ridiculous they may seem at first, which is something I absolutely love to see in my games.  While I highly recommend playing on the highest difficulty for Ys games to really get your blood pumping, there are also several easier settings for more casual players who aren't as good at fast paced action games, offering something for everyone.Graphically, the game looks great.  Despite being pretty old (original Japanese PC release in 2005), the visual design and artstyle were done very well.  The colors, lighting, animations, models, and so on all just look fantastic, and I feel they'll hold up well forever.  Falcom just did a great job there.The music is wonderful too.  Falcom games always have top notch music, and Felghana is no different.  They really did a good job with the soundtrack.  Unfortunately, unlike the PSP release, the Steam release doesn't have the option to change to the alternate soundtracks from the PC88 or X68000 versions of Wanderers of Ys, but this is a minor complaint that shouldn't matter much except to enthusiasts of the sound from those old machines.  The Windows soundtrack is phenominal to be sure.This game is just so good and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes fun.			"

												STOP LOOKING HERE AND START GRABBING THIS GAME. Well, ok, if you want my two cents about it... One of the Best ARPG/HacknSlash games there is, FALCOM is really known as a company that goes beyond the tropes and thorws in some hard difficulty on the bosses and on the gameplay that will really grind your gears. (specially on harder difficulties =z) The Original Soundtrack is terrific, the boss battles are insanely fun (and soul crushing), the story is great and the level design is blissfully awesome! Seriously, Ys is an excellent series and Oath In Felghana is definently one of the best of the series!			"

												Ys has always been a classic to many fans of the JRPG genre, you have an unforgettable tale of adventure with the main hero, Adol Christian and his pal, Dogi and this game being a reimaging of the classic, Wanderers From Ys just with a bit of a twist.  With new magic spells, added skills and extra challenges, it gives the player many a replay to look forward to.  Now mind you, if you're not into ARPGs, or JRPGs this might not be for you but if you ARE or looking for a challenge, well this game suits you with one.			"

												I never knew how much I missed old school Japanese games until I loaded this baby up.  Strikes the perfect balance of challenge and playability.  Had never played an Ys title before, but now I'm determined to hunt down as many as I can find.  The design aesthetic, music, gameplay, and even the characters makes for a great little package.  You don't need any prior knowledge of the Ys franchise to get the most out of this game.  Finished in about 20 hrs....Then hunted down Ys III (on which this is based) for the TG-16, and played through that.....and then played through Felghana again.  This game rocks.P.S.  Look through the steam forums for instructions on how to patch in the voice dubbing.			"

												Very nice game. Combat is fluid and challenging, boss fights tough and engaging, story is adequate, and NPCs have personality and react to plot developments. If you've played Ys 1 and 2 and enjoyed them as I did, know that this third entry in the series is actually better in every way. Newcomers can feel free to start here because it's a standalone adventure.The hero, Adol, is a swordsman who lives for the thrill of exploring new lands. In each game, he arrives at a new place, meets lots of people, earns their admiration for solving their problems and saving their lives, gets a girl to fall in love with him, and then leaves it all behind at the end to travel somewhere else. In terms of gameplay, Felghana has you platforming and hacking and slashing your way through varied environments (dungeons) filled with monsters, while trying to find treasure chests on your way to the next save point, after which there is a boss fight. It follows this formula all throughout -- simple and it works. You also have to keep an eye out for a few secret passages and a couple side quests if you want to get all the unique items in this game, some of which are incredibly useful in avoiding headaches later on. The soundtrack, as always in this series, is very good.The main draw here is definitely the hectic combat, and the satisfying difficulty of the bosses is the height of what the game has to offer. The dungeon chests add an enjoyable exploration element, the story does a good job giving meaning to what you're doing, and the personable and reactive NPCs make you care about what's happening. Overall, Felghana is a very well put together package and a polished experience. Easy recommendation for anyone who likes what they see in the gameplay videos. "

												This game is one of the best JRPGs on Steam at the moment, but Ys: Origin is slightly better in most ways. This Ys game has more - and better - metal music than Origin does, but Origin really nailed the violin sound, much better than this game. Besides that, this game isn't quite as linear as Origin, but then Origin makes up for it by telling a better story and multiple characters with multiple stories.This game's graphics can be slightly bland with the odd shading style, but in a way it's quite a work of art. The level designs are actually well done. The controls are responsive besides my nit pick with upward slashing. Bosses are EPIC, especially as you progress. The game is literally worth $5 JUST for the boss fights. It's a fun game that will probably take you about 10-15 hours to beat once, but if you want to get all the items and sidequests (there aren't a lot of items, as it's a fairly short game compared to most RPGs), you'll probably spend more than 15 hours. I admit the story could be better, but in the end it's a great game!Rating: 7/10Worth: $5 - $10			"

												Ys Book I&II was keen on glorifying the boss battle. This game, which is actually a reimagined Ys III, starts simple with its combat, but later in the game OiF rivals Darksouls in my opinion in regards to sheer creativity and challenge implemented with its boss battles. As far as 'hard' difficulty goes, I cant say Im up to the task. Just too much grind involved. Though, to eliminate any need for grinding and still enjoy a healthy challenging experiance, just play it on 'Easy' and rush through avoiding grinding completely. The bosses will get tough fairly rapidly.I'd certainly recommend it for 5 bucks.			"
