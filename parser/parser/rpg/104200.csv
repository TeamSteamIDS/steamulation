												This is a really charming game, I only found this game because I won it during the Winter 2014 Auction, and i'm surprised that i've never seen it before because it's fantastic.I like the art style of the game, The game has quite a lot of attention to detail, such as a ""level select"" area where you can pilot a space shuttle and you can mess around with it for a few minutes and crash into space rocks.  I've only played through two levels so far but they've both been quite atmospheric as well and i love the underground areas as they feel like they add even more to the levels. I really like the physics of the game too as the physics add to the experience and add another element to the gameplay rather than how physics are incorporated into most games now, and just ""being there"" rather than actually adding anything to the game.So far it's quite simple and i'm not sure if it will manage to stay captivating for the entire game but right now i'm having a lot of fun with the game.Only had a quick play of this game so far but definitely looking forward to playing more.

												Worth every cent of the $0.21 I paid for it.Best game made with MS Paint ever.Okay, a more serious review.Beep has some good ideas, and with the recent sub-$1 sale it's was a good value, but this game was tossed out to customers before it was done.Game play concepts are good and the game is fun, but it starts too slow and the early levels are somewhat boring. Later levels get better, but it doesn't seem like this title was in development for a long time. It seems a little rushed.Every time something like a bomb explodes, I see black blocks on the screen where I suspect smoke would be, but instead I am getting some kind of graphical glitch.The user interface, especially the main menu and options, were slapped together at the last minute by an unpaid intern.Barriers and puzzles are unfortunately a bit weak. I was hoping for a better challenge.And finally, I think some players give up in the first few minutes to game play when they have trouble figuring out how to deploy for the first time. It took me a few minutes to figure out what I was supposed to do, and it was unnecessarily frustrating.Beep is kinda fun, but be sure to get it on sale. It's not a value at full price.			"

												Now THIS is a fun little platformer, adding little quirks to it that makes it just that little bit more unique.Now I'm not a big fan of platformers (except for the good old original mario games and a few rayman games) but I absolutely loved this one. I like how you can fly your ship around and choose where you want to do. Just everything about it feels fresh, like a whole new spin on how platforming games are made.You play as a robot with a variety of abilities, you can jump around, grab items, drag them around and do all sorts of things with them. You can even shoot if you want. But I like defeating enemies with gravity, it's amusing.It's hard to describe the game without showing it, so definitely check out video footage of the game and see if it's for you.If you're a fan of platformers, you won't be disappointed with this game. If you're like me and you're not too much of a fan, give it a go if you can get this on the cheap, I was pleasantly surprised and you may be too.I recommend this game.			"

												Considering how cheap this game is, I'd definitely say it's worth a go. The graphics (and art style in general, as well as some of the programming) seem to be pretty sloppy at times, but it has a unique charm to it! The level design is consistently ""pretty good,"" with occasional memorable moments.You play as a BEEP robot, exploring a system to collect antimatter. Gameplay consists of mostly platforming puzzles utilizing moving, jumping, shooting, and, more often than not, the Zero Point Energy Field manipulator (read: gravity gun) which you control with the right mouse button. The game takes place in an unnamed star system with three planets. Each of the two hemispheres on each planet has its own environments, music, and introduces one or two game mechanics that for the most part are used exclusively for that hemisphere. Each hemisphere has 4 levels, which each have 3 anti-matter nuggets to find, as well as a bonus fourth one which is rewarded upon collecting ~20 smaller pellets scattered around the level. This leaves 96 antimatter parts to collect. In order to unlock the next hemisphere, you must find a minimum amount of antimatter nuggets in the previous levels, as well as getting to the end of all the previous levels.While this game is certainly charming, it's not without its flaws. It is very possible to use the antimatter to grab an item and use it to propel yourself upwards before grabbing it and using it again, and, if you're good enough at it, can be used to get over almost any obstacle. While the game never requires you to do this, it is tempting to do it to get just a little more air to climb a wall. On quite a few walls, it is possible to simply drive straight up them by moving towards them, as one of BEEP's wheels seems to clip into the wall. The difficulty curve is somewhat predictable up until the last planet, where both hemispheres present environmental hazards that make the game much more difficult (though not frustratingly so). Completing levels honestly felt a little unrewarding, and I was consistently able to 100% complete levels my first time visiting, never having to backtrack. Additionally, there is no reward for collecting all 96 nuggets of anti-matter. This may be an issue for people who invest more time to collect everything. I managed to beat the game and collect everything without backtracking in under 4 hours.As a snobby musician, I thought the music was pretty forgettable, However, it had themes that appeared multiple times in the game, which is always interesting to discover, and the music never feels out of place. The art style feels very much like that of a decent flash game, using basic shapes and characters with cartoony eyes and solid colors. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it feels hastily done to me.At the time that I'm writing this, it's on sale for $0.49. I can definitely recommend it at that price, at least. It's a cute little game, but don't expect hardcore gameplay or mindblowing game design.			"

												Beep is a sweet casual side-scrolling platformer. Would I tried to dismantle it, I'd saw the pieces of many other good games: World of Goo, Mario, StuntMania, with the addition of gravity beam from Half Life 2... whatever. Really I don't want do dig that deep.You've got a rocket, you fly from planet to planet, to disembark a little robot there, which then goes from the left part of the screen to the right side, jumping, climbing, diving, shooting the bad robots, and moving objects with the gravity force... As easy as it sounds, after some time given, the puzzles getting more and more complex and challenging.As of downsides, I really can think only of one. It is cartoon-styled and not-that-much-rewarding. Obviously, I'm a bit too old for this type of gameplay, but I'll easily pass Beep to my kids.My mark is 7.1/10. Not the brightest star on the sky of game design, but the one made clear and thorough. Well-fit for little casual play sessions.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  BEEPDeveloper:  Big Fat AlienPublisher:  Sunken Treasure Games, Big Fat AlienGenre:  Physics-based platformerGeneral ImpressionBEEP is a 2D platformer that features some very interesting physics-based gameplay mechanics via a gravity gun of sorts. The art style and stage diversity have made a good impression upon myself, since I’m already used to so many bland platfoming games out there. BEEP stands out from the crowd with the use of clever mechanics and pleasant 2D graphics. It contains a decent number of puzzles that encourage different approaches. The sounds are also without major complaint and the game’s only flaws remain the bane of many similar platformers: relative short experience and no multiplayer support.Strong Points+ Interesting gameplay and level design.+ Steam Trading Cards.Weak Points- Short experience even if there is some replay value.- No Steam Achievements.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												5.1/10 - Platformer: Disney's Wall-E with a Grav Gun!I was fonder of playing this platformer than I thought; maybe it's that I have played so many bad ones... but this one delivered for the most part. The typical platformer template is combined with beautiful graphics and some unique gameplay. You mostly rely on your propulsion rockets and a gravity gun that can help you achieve your objectives. Platformers can be difficult in general; and this one will cause you to struggle, but this game is more on the enjoyable and achievable side of things. There is quite a bit of content and plethora of maps to explore for the meager price of $2; caution though this game can be found on sale more often than not!Worth the $2; I'd only pay $0.50 though since it's always on sale for that!

												I played this with my son, so I may have a bias here.  This is a simple platforming action game.  You are a robot in search of gold in different worlds.  Your robot can fly temporarily and you must go through a few different worlds ranging from ice worlds, to desert worlds.  The game doesn't necessarily stand out, however the tight controls and the cartonny graphics and animation make it a good play for young children.  Definitely gets a thumbs up for its accessibility for my son.			"

												BEEP is very well balanced and just plain fun to play. You know these games where you feel the dedication of the developers? BEEP is just that! Instead of playing clones and remakes of old 2D platformers why not play a modern game that brings new things to the table? Well, i wouldn't say BEEP is very innovative with it's features but it feels polished from the beginning and will surprise you here and there. For some reason, it's easy to fall in love with this game.""BEEP"" is a simple but interesting game with some cute graphics and good physics and awesome music. Nice example of how to create an indie game without being pretentious. Nothing less, nothing more.			"

												A fun little platformer. Took me a little over 6 hours to complete the whole game and I'm usually not very good at these games. The later levels were quite challenging.Aside from some graphics glitches (black boxes sometimes randomly appear when you kill an enemy) this game was a lot of fun. Too bad certain game elements were restricted to specific worlds, like flying and grappling. Some sort of Expert levels with all of these elements at your disposal, mixed with hordes of enemies, would have made a great and more challenging addition.Well worth the price tag, but I reckon most of it will be too easy for fans of the platformer genre.

												You know what? This is a good game. I didn't really expect to like it...I'm not much of a platformer guy, and I originally only had a license because I bought a bundle. But the graphics were interesting enough in a oddly appealing way, and it looked as if it wasn't just constant Mario moments with a bunch of hidden crap that you had to memorize, so I decided to add it to my library instead of trading or gifting it. And man, am I glad that I did.What I got was a thinking man's platformer that includes some really interesting mechanics (especially the many variable ways that your gravity beam can be applied). As the environments change, so do many of the challenges for those levels, so the environments aren't merely eye candy. Everything was achieveable, even if getting to 100% completion on some levels required some pretty diabolical thinking.The controls are tight, graphics are original, and gameplay is solid. I ended up playing every level, and hanging in there to the very end (many platformers make me rage quit 20% of the way through the game, and I have enough other stuff in my library to play that I will often just dump the platform game to play a FPS/RPG/adventure game, which are my primary genres).The only downside to this game? You're left with a bit of a cliffhanger at the end -- an obvious set-up for the next game -- but, to the best of my knowledge, no sequel was ever produced (this game was released in 2011, so it doesn't seem very likely that will ever happen). That's too bad, because I would gladly pay to play the sequel as well.At two bucks, if you like platformers at all, you'd be kind of dumb to pass this one up. This is a really solid game from an independent developer, and I'm happy to hand him my $2 all day long. Great game, Big Fat Alien, and I hope that you decide to follow up BEEP  some day with a sequel. I'd pre-order just to support you. Nice work.			"

												I got BEEP in a puzzle-related game bundle so hard to assess the value vs fair price for me. However, I think I got what I paid for. I love a good platform puzzle game and while BEEP is such a game, I only like it. To start, I had to play in windows-mode only (alt-enter to exit fullscreen) because the fullscreen mode would not cooperate. I spent a good amount of time trying to make it work in fullscreen that I should've just played it in windows-mode the whole time. The graphics are indeed nothing to boast, but cute to a degree. The micro-expressions the beep does when underfire, firing, jumping/etc is amusing (if noted during gameplay). You are given a mini-background story as to why the BEEPs exist and then you appear in a galactic map. It isn't clear where you supposed to go as I ended up flying the ship around the 'galaxy' wondering what to do. It's also funny to me how the ship comes to an abrupt stop when you stop clicking a direction for it to fly to (unrealistic, but in a game were Wall-E's cousin has a better job than him, it doesn't matter).  While the design is fairly easy (WASD/Arrow in combination with the mouse),  the game can be both unforgiving and lenient. If you over-jump even a slightly bit, you are most likely falling to your death. However, if you are jumping and your wheels are able to touch a surface (along the side of the walls or where-ever), you are allowed another chance to jump again to make it (granted, you have to be pretty quick with your reactions to do so). The goal to collect the anti-matter and little gems (25) to get another anti-matter makes it more than just a puzzle platform. Especially so since you do need to collect them to progress the game. Some of the puzzles are very simplistic at the beginning and I believe it'll be so throughout the game since there isn't much combination the game can do with the gravity gun besides just moving the objects around freely/around a pivot piece. Overall, it's a decent game and if you get it in a bundle or stand-alone, you will have some fun time with it. Not a game to finish immediately, but I suggest on the side. 7.5/10.			"

												Very good!Genuinely puzzling yet fun levels, at least 4 hours of gameplay. Remarkable physics for an indie game, though totally exploitable to glitch through some of the obstabcles, though that part just adds fun.I would buy this even if it costed more.The graphics are a bit cartoon-ish, more appealing to children, but that's fine.The only downside is - I could not find a settings menu, so I guess you can't change controls and volume.10/10			"

												BEEP is a simple physics based puzzle platformer. No controller support that I could detect, but the WASD keyboard and mouse controls provide a good degree of control and feel right. You maneuver a little robot that is equipped with a cannon and a tractor beam which allows you to shoot enemies and manipulate objects in the environment in an effort to collect energy crystals. The game also has some fitting sound effects and music for the game's theme. Kind of average--nothing that hasn't been done before.			"

												It's a game where you play a little robot who I imagined is the love child of Wall-e and Eve. The game has puzzles that range from easy to agonizingly easy. It did however play on my love of throwing crap at other crap. If you are going to play it I recommend playing it carelessly (John Rambo style) otherwise there is no challenge, except for the last level which the horrible swinging physics will kill you. There's a hint that there will be a sequel, so hopefully they will ramp up the difficulty and give us a proper ending. Alright, could've been better.			"

												BEEP is the first title out of BigFatAlien, and judging from the quality of this litle gem, BFA is someone to watch.The core gameplay is always accessible. It is a physics enabled 2D platformer that harkens back to the days of Super Mario and the ilk. It feaures a nice overworld to let you choose levels, and has a simplicity about it that is charming.The BEEP itself is a darned cute character that certainly has my vote for President when he decides to run.Music is top notch, sound design is great, and visuals are styled well and look awesome.Easily worth the money. Stop reading & go get it.			"

Product received for free
												To be honest, for a five hours to complete game its not that bad for a 2$ game, or 50 cents if you get this on sale.Unfortunately, the description is kind of a lie.I was not thinking at all about Yoshi's Island while playing this, granted there might be some similarities due to it being a 2D platformer, and the fact that you have to go through all the levels of the game.The reason is because yoshi's Island was at best a platformer to anything else, and was loved by gamers because of its classic artstyle and the challenge that was always looming around.Also, there were boss stages, which unlike in this game, where while it seemed to have built up to a boss it actually wasn't, and it just add more to how there is a lack of any tension to your journey.Really you're just strolling about and at best nobody would ever need to even check a walkthrough because the game is too simple with how you collect items, as secrets are pretty obvious.That being said I'll give to the devs credit that the physics are definetly impressive and at times I was  genuinely impressed with the possiblities they made with them. Sadly, the said potential is kind of locked for the current stage, and the mechanics are different for each of the four stages, basically giving you something new to work with only to be quickly abandoned. It's quite pointless if you ask me.As for the ""hardcore"", the only part that was a challenge was the last stage, only because there are no checkpoints where it feels like there should be, and I'm pretty sure its where you'd probably quit the game by that point, especially since up to this point the game was fair enough in its challenge, only to bombard you with tiny careful jumps along with deadly fall right at the end.In addition, the only other difficult part is that sometimes puzzles become unbeatable because you might end up accidently throwing the blocks you essentialy need out of your reach, which I feel like they haven't thought it through, and it shows.That being said, the story is not entirely bad (but sure as heck disappointing)  and the graphics are fairly decent for an indie game...Too bad the game already crashed to me once (I think) and at some points did in fact got some major lag for such a minium req. game, and my PC isn't even high-end at best but can still run much bigger games which is why I assume the lag is on the dev's end, plus whenever a  certain enemy explodes it seems to almost tear space and time as it glitches into black boxes everywhere...But hey, if you want to waste 5 hours and dont mind wasting less than a dollar on sale go for it, although if you want to at least seem like you have a decent library of games on your steam account, then you should probably skip this, it's not really worth it.On a quick note I checked one of the dev's blog. If you absolutely hate clifhangers then yeah stay away from this game. These guys ain't making a sequel, and sure as heck don't deserve any positive review just for that.			"

												I loved playing it, unfortunately due to a mistake of steam it got refunded.It's great for any platform gamer, it's got this magnety carry system with which you can carry your enemies corpses and throw them into pits or into other enemies.But on to steam's mistakes.I bought the bundle of bundles with beep in it, but one of the games was crap and it said if I would refund that game it would also take down a marble game and a ball shooting game and I would get 4 cents.I was fine with that.But them steam without a warning refunded the whole collection and took beep away from me. unfortunately the bundle is also gone from the sales so I can't get the games that I did want all back together.I guess I'll have to wait to the next sale :( Steam isn't being helpful supportwise either.Never in the entire process of refunding did it mention it would take down the other three bundles in the bundle of bundles. I have now lost a game I loved dearly due to their miscommunication.			"

												BEEP is just not vey interesting and feels very much like a flash game. I didn't find it too bad at first considering the 19 cents I paid, but after an hour or so I was already bored. The gravity gun is not very fun to use and a lot of the game seems to be just stacking stuff so that you can get up. I wouldn't compare it to Yoshi's Island at all.The most annoyng thing about this game is the very robot you play as. It babbles and screeches in a high, annoying voice, and you get to hear gems like ""♥♥♥♥ you"" over and over again when you shoot enemies. But unlike some reviews claim you can disable the sounds and music.			"

												Got it with Developer Alliance Bundle for something like 0.99 $ on summer sale. Died about 100 times and got about 13 hours of gameplay on completion (ok i suck at it). + The controls are tight (keyboard + mouse combination) and platforming action is decent. + Physics is unassailable. You could try all kinds of weird stuff in game without the engine complaining or acting out.+ Initially the gameplay seemed too easy, but eventually the difficulty ramps up(especially towards the end). Challenges are not very hard though.+ There may be more than one way to get past an obstacle.+ Enemies are nice, and each have their own unique strengths, quirks, and weakness, which is not immediately apparent. It may be a while before you figure out how to kill an enemy. Again several approaches are possible. + Some twist  or break in gameplay on different levels, maybe a new weapon, power,  enemy, new kind of environmental  hazard. Doesn't get monotonous.+ Music is ok. I liked the weird arab/oriental/fusion track in the ice planet.- Graphics are meh. Simple, cartoony, flash-like. I don't mind those things. Its not poorly done or anything like that but overall it doesn't come together to build a suitable feel or atmosphere. Each planet (of which there are 3) has it's own climate/environment. The last planet is the better of the three. The world, ominous music, come together nicely to give good atmosphere. The creepy firebreathing monster in that planet is a nice touch.- No real story or setting. This could have made the game more interesting or provided reward for progression.Overall. This puzzle platformer was competant if forgetable. Passing a stage while collecting all the lums - or whatever it is we are supposed to collect- is a good way to while away 10-15 minutes. Definitely worth the price and not unworthy of your time either. Get it if it comes on sale.			"

												I don't know where to start with this review. I started playing smaller indiegames not that long ago and I'm totally addicted to it. BEEP is one of that little games that just is totally worth it's small price. The only reason that I write this review is that this game really deserves to be bought.Pro's Great straightforward platformer, with easy controls The game is divided in several planets, each with his own colourful setting that creates great div With the easy controls, every planet still manages to bring new possibilities with that controls. The game has enough savepoints in the levels to make it a casual game, not so much that there is no difficulty anymore. The story of the game is great for such a small game.Con's This platformer does never require very quick, skilled actions. If you are really into difficult games, just let this pass. I myself do think this game is really well balanced. I just finished the game (7,4 hours) and I would still like to play more levels. Can't wait to see what the developers will come up with next.This game is really worth it's price. If it's on sale, really, everyone should just buy and try it. "

												I didn't expect to like this game. The graphics looked too simplistic, and I mistook it for a half-baked effort. It isn't.If you've ever liked platform games that ask you to stop and think up your movement beforehand rather than have lightning reflexes, you are probably going to like this game. It is a light-hearted puzzle platformer,There is not much frustration to be had, at least up until the part I've reached so far. You casually bounce around platforms, collecting thingies and shooting badies. When they either kill you, or you fall to your death, you respawn on one of the rather frequent checkpoints. You have infinite lives as far as I can discern, so no pressure there either.I've said that on the review of another game too: I'm in a phase in my life that sometimes I just need to squeeze a stress ball to unwind from my day, I need my off time to be relaxing, not stressful. Taking gaming way too seriously is in the past for me. This game suits me just fine. It's one of the anti-stress squeeze balls of gaming. If this sounds like something you'd like, give it a try.

												HELP I'M STUCK!!!http://i.imgur.com/ijtcKNp.pngThis game is some puzzle game you see in floating around somewhere in a vast desert. You enter it and try to play it in some unintended way and now you're stuck inside it so completely and the only thing that can advance you forwards or back out is to glitch the physics in some hilarious way. And the whole damn maze keeps spinning and you use your jetpack and it just keeps spinning even harder. You use your anti-gravity to hold it in place and try to turn it someway so you'd fit through the next tight crevice you're stuck in. And it continues.I feel both the gun and the enemies are a bit unnecessary for this game, unless you could fight them using your anti-gravity to fling objects at them. I have yet to know if there are bosses, but I haven't seen one in the first level yet. This game would benefit from physics based combat.And the best part about this game is the physics, whether it gets clever or wonky. It's the kinda game you can make your own humor with. Something funny is bound to happen.This is an amazing game for its price. Buy it! If you get this for 20 cents, the trading cards you sell even pays back this game's price, making it essentially free.Hint: To reach a high place, stand on an object, jump, fling that object up at your feet, then jump on it to do a 2nd jump in the air.

												Note: I'm trying to play all the games on my Steam library and give a quick review. This is based on aprox 30 min gameplay. Despite looking like that Flash game your dad played one night that gave your computer a virus, BEEP is kind of ok. It's certainly not as tight as Yoshi's Island, and how dare anyone mention this glorified browser game in the same sentence as Half Life? The cheek, the very cheek of it! Despite being slightly overated, and over priced, BEEP has got some substance to it. The hub world in which you select your stage by navigating a rocket ship around planets is kind of cool. Shooting enemies and throwing them around with the gravity gun is also pretty neat. There are better games out there that are more polished and cost less that the 5 bucks asked for BEEP. However I will say I can recommend BEEP if you have little kids , or are looking for something kind of relaxing and easy to play. Pick it up on sale like I did (paid .21 cents) and you shouldn't be dissapointed.			"

												Overall: BEEP is a cute little puzzle platformer that I'm sure can run on even the most rotten of potatoes, and while you maybe run into technical issues with monitors or odd frame dips. if you don't run into any of the previous stated issues, this game seems great for kids.Platformer: BEEP as a puzzle platformer is decent, from what I played, it's nothing too challanging, but I'm sure it gets more difficult as you go from world to world as stated by other reviews.Performance: BEEP despite seeming simple does not come without its flaws, technical issues haunt this game like odd frame dips, holding around the 30's, to monitors issues like the game going to stretched full screen with multi-monitor setups. I'm not saying you will for sure run into these issues, nor am I saying there are not solutions to them, just know before buying, you are not safe from them.Appeal: While I can not say to a grown adult ""hey, go buy this game"", I can say this game is great for kids with the simple, ultra cute art style, easy controls and low spec requirements.

												Amazing game that presents a unique twist on the platformer genre. You can grab different objects and manipulate with them and environment with the help of anti-gravity gun. This device help you to clear obstacles, solve different puzzles. Also your robot have a weapon to fight enemies (angry robots from different planets). The game is very funny, with nice music and very well-balanced.			"

												In this game you’ll control the eponymous Beep bot in search for energy blobs around the galaxy, a simple setup for a platform game. While you might take this as a small budget indie game, this is actually much better polished than any flash game you’ll find flooding the net. The animation is smooth and the stages are smartly designed, not only will you find it a challenge to complete each stage perfectly, you’ll have to devise your own strategies in doing so as well.The protagonist is essentially a clone of Wall-E given Gordon’s gravity gun, but the mechanics used is perhaps the most innovative aspect of the entire game. You’ll use rocks to block incoming projectiles and you’ll use your enemies’ miniature carcasses to activate switches. When all else fails, you can always jet pack your way out while gunning down bots with your machine gun; like a boss.Another twist came from Beep’s partial immortality, since the mothership can churn out any number of bots as it wished and beam it down to the last checkpoint. Beep is by and large, expendable. This means you can be free to explore the stages as you wish, completing areas via some bizarre manners manipulating the physics engine.If you can’t tell by now I’m totally recommending this game, with its low price tag and the aforementioned features, there is no reason why you shouldn’t give this a chance.

												So, before you start thinking ""cheap game like this couldn't get any better"", hear me out. There are a couple reasons why you should buy this game:1) this game is cheap, it's guarantee 100% boring, BUT, game like this is suit for your lil brothers/ sister or your son to play. Great isn't it?2) Earn budget by selling trading cards, I bought this game with 0.10$, I sold the trading cards for 0.60$, worth buying.3) Level up achievement by collecting games, so this is one of the cheapest game you can get and use it to level up your badge, worth it.So yeah, with this cheap game you can get so much profits, buy it now before it's too late. :)			"

												If there is one word that I would use to describe this game, it would be adorable. Everything about this game is adorable. The world design, the level selection, the characters, the hints, even the death screen. Also, this game has the most satisfying mechanic of picking up your fallen enemies and doing as you please. Wheather that be throwing them away or stacking them up to get to higher places, the gravity gun is one of the most genius things ever and it works so smoothly. The platforms are super fun to jump onto and move around with the gravity gun and the world is just overall fun to move around despite being linear. There is so much detail in this game that dirt specs fly when you ride over grass, but they aren't at all distracting. I love this game so much, and if you do not have it yet, get it. Now.			"

												Side scrolling & Rage inducing, two of the most addictive things about games today.It has several planets, each planet containing different levels. In the game you play as BEEP, BEEP is a small robot which has a Zero Point Energy Manipulator and a cannonball launcher, you are up against several different enemies, these include; a Robot, Zappy fish, Allhau Akbar robot, and many more! There are several types of levels including; Desert Levels, grassland Levels, Ice Levels and Lava Levels! Flying through space in your little rocket ship, choosing from the levels, gradually getting more and more difficult, enemies aim getting better and a less defined goal. The soundtrack belonging to this game is also calming, it is space age music, but relaxing.As if 2001: A space oddesy & Wall:E had a child, this would be it! This is a great game for children aged 7-11, I give it a 6.5/10			"

												BEEP is a good little platformer that would be awesome if it had controller support. It also lacks a menu, meaning no settings of any kind. These 2 things really keep BEEP from being a great platformer. Platformers are meant to be played with a controller, imo and  settings(windowed mode, sound) are nice options to have too. As is 5/10, would be 8/10 if it was complete.  "

												BEEP is a decent indie platformer with an interesting physics engine. Use your cannon, gravity gun and a number of other tools to defeat enemies, solve puzzles and unlock new areas.The graphics are vibrant and the music is quite good. The level design requires the player to come up with different approaches to solving puzzles.For the negatives, the game is quite short with little replay value. And while it offers Steam Trading Cards, it lacks Steam Achievements.Overall, I'd recommend BEEP mainly to platformer enthusiasts who are looking for a new challenge.			"

												The biggest problem with this game is that it's unpolished. The main feature, the physics beam, is awkward to control, and it lets go at the most inconvinient times. The art is inconsistent and underwhelming. I'm not sure, but I think I could have done most of the art assets in MS Paint. And the semi-realistic gold nugget looking things are supposed to be antimatter? Please, just do a Google search and find a better asset. The same few enemies and bits of terrain are also resued over and over, which results in a boring, static experience. There is very little challenge and no penalty for failure. If you die, the only thing you lose is time off your life as you respawn at the latest checkpoint with no golden antimatter nuggets missing and the enemies respawned.This obviously makes it very easily to cheese some antigold nuggets by suicide-jumping them. The reload feature is instant - just press ""R"" - and you never stop shooting. It may as well not be there at all for how much it impacts gameplay. There are some good bits, of course, but not enough to justify the full $5 price. Honestly, I've seen better games written in Flash for my browser.			"

Got it for a massive discount and finished it already.  If you've played Yoshi's Island and/or Trine, the gameplay will seem VERY familiar.   It's like being locked in Amadeus (wizard) mode on Trine, which isn't a bad thing.My only problem include the puzzles and platforming areas in the last few levels along with a dreadful framerate lag which made some areas hard to play until the framerate stablized.  The game is also fairly short.  5-6 hours will lead to the game's completion.Not a bad game.   If you find it on sale, I'd recommend trying it out.8/10			"

It's like being locked in Amadeus (wizard) mode on Trine, which isn't a bad thing.My only problem include the puzzles and platforming areas in the last few levels along with a dreadful framerate lag which made some areas hard to play until the framerate stablized.  The game is also fairly short.  5-6 hours will lead to the game's completion.Not a bad game.   If you find it on sale, I'd recommend trying it out.8/10			"

The Brave Little Toaster Rebooted - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Among all of the reeking filth of Steam's bargain bins, full of poorly designed garbage purely there to rake in a steady stream of nickels and dimes from unsuspecting customers, there is the occasional game that's not too bad. Some of them are decent. Sure, for a little more you could afford a real game and play something a lot nicer. But sometimes a brother gotta eat off the dollar menu a little.Out of all the ♥♥♥♥ I've carelessly spent precious coins on that I could've been whipping at unsuspecting homeless people, one game sticks out as pretty alright.Beep.Beep is alright.According to the developers, who are apparently ex-Bioware and Lucasarts employees, Beep is ""Inspired by games such as Cave Story, Yoshi’s Island, Trine and Half-Life 2"". Some pretty big names you're throwing around there, man. You sure your little dollar game can hold up?Well, okay there buddy.Let's get some things straight here now.Beep is a basic, although charming puzzle platformer. You roll around as a little robot, collecting nuggets of moon ♥♥♥♥ to ground up and snort off the cheapest space hooker's ♥♥♥ you can. Your purpose is to collect, but every stage will have an end zone to reach as well.Now, let's be real here. What were you guys doing at Bioware and Lucasarts? Not knocking your game here, it's very nice. But something tells me you're not the brains behind things like Mass Effect or the original Star Wars Battlefront. You sure you guys worked AT Bioware and Lucasarts? You weren't like, washing windows outside? You sure you didn't just look in the window one day, make eye contact with an uncomfortable game programmer, and feel a special little connection or something? You weren't the unpaid intern picking up wank napkins while they were doing the motion capture for the alien strip club dancers in Mass Effect were you?Just checking, bud.Because something tells me that this isn't really something up the usual Bioware or Lucasarts fan's alley. Yeah, sure, I love me some Bioware games or some Star Wars games. But this is a toaster with wheels that rolls around with a gravity gun, yelling ""♥♥♥♥ you"" in a chipmunk voice whenever it blows up an enemy. This isn't an epic RPG or an immersive shooter. I think you're just kinda throwing names around to make it seem like you're a big deal.Beep is a great game, for its price. It's really kinda hard to see where it's getting a lot of its inspiration from, aside from the gravity gun mechanics which are pretty much directly ripped from Trine and Half-Life.You'll be tasked with finding three big space turds and many smaller space turdlets floating around each level. Collecting up all of the small ones will equal a big one. So you just need to collect a lot of things. I can see how this is mildly inspired by Yoshi's Island, seeing as how there's an emphasis on collecting. But it kinda misses the greater beauty of Yoshi's Island. Once you grab a rock in Beep, you have it. If you die right after, you still have it. If you leave the level, you still have it. You don't need to collect it again.It doesn't really feel much like it was building on what Yoshi had so much as it is copying a small part of a greater concept. The same with all of its other inspirations, like Cave Story and the rest. It feels like they just borrowed some fun concepts from other games without really considering what made them great in the first place, and cobbling them together to make a simple little platformer.It's not a bad game. I had a lot of fun with it, actually. It's a simple little platformer, but it's put together pretty well.While it might be rather unremarkable and bland compared to many other platformers, it's still designed very well. It has a gentle difficulty curve, and makes great use of multiple gimmicks that each world is based off of. New hazards are introduced and built on very well, and the action never gets particularly stale.While it is obviously clear why the game is so cheap once you start playing it, the amount of content packed in for the price is also fair. The game's incredibly basic, geometric art style is simple, but it's not off-putting. It looks like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Flash game, yeah. Fair point. But it doesn't look BAD. It just looks, you know, cheap and kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥. There's some decent ambient effects in later levels to fancy things up a bit. So it's not like it's all bad. Everything else kinda follows that same pattern. Kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but not bad. Most of the game's mechanics are borrowed, and they're nowhere near executed on par with or better than where they originated. But it's not an unpleasant experience.It's not a long game, but it's better that way. Stretching its material thinner would have made the game an unbearable chore. But as a short, simple game that one could knock out in a couple hours, it's really a fun little thing. It's satisfying to use the gravity to throw enemies around, and puzzles are usually require some mild figuring. Nothing grand or elaborate, but you're not paying for grand and elaborate here.It's clearly cheaply made, but it's also made well. There's some craftsmanship in there. Somewhere. Like a dollar menu sandwich that a greasy teen took the trouble of jacking off into, because he wanted you to eat ♥♥♥♥ that bad. He risked his job for you. He put his minimum wage job on the line. Can you imagine if he got fired? He wouldn't be able to afford those Beats headphones he wants so bad. They're the headphones all the real rappers use, like him. He grew up on the streets of the suburbs. But he would throw it all away for you.Beep is alright. I wouldn't say it's perfect. I wouldn't say it's great. Maybe it's good. But if there's something I can say with 100% certainty, it's that this game is alright.If you ate at home for once instead of wasting all of your money on fast food, you could use those extra couple bucks to buy this game you fat ♥♥♥♥. It could be a nice change of pace, and unlike fast food it probably won't hasten the inevitable onset of erectile dysfunction.Probably.			"

												Beep is a very fun game considering the price, it has good controls the level design is pretty decent in the way it works with the controls and what beep can do although this game is less than a pound and it can show at some points other than that beep is a fun game and is worth the money  7/10p.s i just realised I said I got this for free I read the box wrong sorry about that			"

												A cool platformer with some puzzle elements. It controls well for most of the time, has a good progression through 24 levels divided into 6 ""worlds"", and it's fun to play. It's not difficult, although some parts can be a bit frustrating. But most collectibles are mandatory, so they feel a little pointless. They should be just collectables to unlock extra stuff. But what's here is worth 5-6 hours of good content. Some achievements would also be appreciated.			"

												I do recommend this game, but play it at your own risk. It's ♥♥♥♥ing impossible. The third level from World 6 is the hardest level from a video game I have ever played (I know World 6 is the last world meaning that level is technically the second last level, but still). And yes, that includes COCKING DARK SOULS AND HOTLINE MIAMI!If I gave this game a difficulty score between 1-10, this game would be 12. DS would be 11 and HM would be 10.Even world 2 was stupidly hard.			"

												BEEP, is a funny Plattformer, Puzzle and Brain game.It´s was fun playing it even if i do not personally like that Art of game. (i´m a Fast Paced Action lover)Still BEEP was so far one of rare games that i would play some hour´s (until i get frustrated because i somehow being very bad on such games)It doesnt really has Story. It´s more like short explains about BEEP´s Skills in the levels (There are those ""info plattform"")Controls were good i do not had any problem´s with my Mouse and keyboard playing it!Graphics are good. Emeny´s make you think about how to get not killed or get the Tresure´s you can collect.In overall i would say play it and make your own opinion about this game!Here is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:Gameplay: 8/10 (Well made)Graphics: 6/10 (serve´s the meaning for the game and it fits good with the effects etc)Support: ?/10 (never had to go support)Price: 7/10 (5€ seems fine to me)Story: 3/10 (There isn´t really much about to say)Sound: 7/10 (like the Graphic´s it serve´s the Gameplay as well in a good way! like having a Jet to Fly with it´s effects)Performance: 10/10 (no problem´s @ all) FAZIT: 6.8/10 (well made game, but it could contain more Story in it for better gameplay and more Addiction for the game, as it really has good gameplay!)

												An annoying platformer, some will say this is fun because it's difficult, and I'm sure for some that is fine and good, but for me this doesn't do anything special or fun enough for me to want to spend the extra effort it takes.In the fourth level I started running into physics issues and that sealed the deal for me.  When my character just starts flying around the screen not because of anything I did (I think) and falling into a pit, I can't recomend it.			"

												In BEEP, you are in control of a small robot that is used to explore other planets. It is mostly a platform game with slight action and puzzle elements. There are basically zero options provided to the player as far as graphics are concerned, and the game engine seems to have serious problems with frame drops and performance on a modern computer. The general presentation is basic, upbeat, lighthearted, adorable, and for all ages. The world map is amusing, as you are allowed to navigate through space with your ship and bounce off asteroids or space debris. Each planet looks different than the other, and the levels appear to have been designed well. The controls are implemented adequately, and are quite responsive even in the more dire platforming situations mixed in with some shooting or the tricky anti-gravity device. The robot's wheels also have an excellent grasp on terrain, which makes for some forgiving moments if you are new to the genre. All of this is not without some major problems related to performance. The game runs terribly on a modern computer that more than meets the minimum requirements. The massive frame drops, excessive lag, terrible slowdowns, and extreme choppiness make it unplayable. Others have experienced similar problems, and proof of it can be found in the game's Steam forum. This is actually quite unfortunate, as BEEP seems to be a good game at its core, if it weren't for the performance issues that break it. Perhaps with some developer tweaks and patches, BEEP will live up to its full potential and be enjoyable.BEEP is mediocre.			"

												BEEP has very little going for it. The overworld serves little purpose in the hour that I've played other than to make it take slightly longer to select levels and is overall awful. Once you get into a level the aesthetics are unappealing to say the least. The background and characters are cartoonish, but don't have any particular thing that grabs you about them, but the pickups (antimatter nuggets and cores or something) look like bad gif files of 3D modeling done by high school students.The music and sound I can't comment on as I turned them off within 3 minutes of getting in to the game. As far as the mechanics go the controls are sluggish and sometimes not responsive and the camera is attached to the cursor but not smoothly and you can easily get motion sick from the jitteriness of it.It isn't a terrible game but there are so many other better examples of interesting platformers that I cannot recommend this one.

												Just another unpolished, probably unfinished platformer. It felt like one of the games I would play for 5 minutes on AddictingGames as a kid. The art style is inconsistent throughout the game, and sometimes it feels like they didn’t even try. The gameplay isn’t anything special and the only redeeming feature, aside from it’s somewhat ok lighting and physics engine, is the anti-gravity beam, which only seems to work when it wants to and likes to drop things a lot.I would never pay a full $5 for this, but it might be worth it to someone else to sell a couple cards when it’s on sale for $0.19. In the end, I’d just recommend you go and play some free flash games or something instead.			"

												And yet another platformer which I'd love except for the controls. Come on, devs, if you expect me to do a skill jump while waving a robot around on a grabber beam (2-2, 2nd ""supergrain""), the least you could do is to make sure that:- Movement and grabber can be fine-controlled, separately- The grabber doesn't accidentally release the robot (in like 50% of the cases)- Once held in an orientation, the robot doesn't randomly revolve, exposing me to the big bad laser beamI like challenging setups, but the challenge shouldn't be hoping for the lucky situation where all controls work properly at the same time. Also, on a multi-try challenge, spending one minute to get back again from the last checkpoint tends to grate after a while.It may be harsh, but I'll keep giving non-recommendations to any game which frustrates the player by control inadequacies - no matter how good the other aspects are.

												I typically don't like hard video games, so this review might be biased. And, my definition of hard might be easy for someone else, so there's that too. I bought this game for the full price in India (55 Rupees). If you get it on an offer on the bundle (was on sale for 23 Rupees with three other games), then you can make your money back just with trading cards (and that's how this game got so many positive reviews). With the above in mind, here's my review:The game, as such, was too hard for me. The story was not a story, just mere reasons on why you had to go out and control the bots. The monsters/enemy robots/whatever they're called are way too powerful. Many of them can't be destroyed and fire at you a lot. The game has a demo on the game's website for three levels. The fourth one was OK, but the fifth was down-right impossible in my opinion. The first three levels, on the other hand, were extremely easy. The difficulty curve is not a curve at all. it went from easy to impossible in no time flat. Also, the game introduces new mechanics at an alarming pace, with little to no explanation on how they work. No training wheels, nothing (Portal: First Slice was far better). The graphics are OK, but by no means good. To be honest, even the game ""Thomas was Alone"" looks better (or at least I think so). The ""Bonk"" engine is not so good at physics either. In my opinion, the developer could've easily used Unity or even a tool like Stencyl. The controls are non-remappable, so you're stuck with WASD/Arrow Keys. Also, right-clicking to reload is a bad idea. Why can't we just use the E key? All-in-all, the game could use a lot of work and in it's current stage, don't recommend it to anyone who wants a game to play.Want to make money? Buy it on a sale and sell your cards. Want to play? Look into something else.			"

It's a lot like Super Mario Bros., but you're a robot that shoots rocks instead of a short, fat, Italian dude with a handlebar mustache.

												Pros:- Makes you want to do speedruns.- Has the platform feel you look for.- Grabbing thing and throwing them around is fun!Cons:- Gets you easily bored because of too many repeated objectives.- Aim-lock sometimes may end up aim-locking you away from your target. (Considered moving around)- Doesn't have a speed option for doing speed runs.- Graphics could really use an upgrade.There's room for improvement for this game. But overall it didn't appeal me as much to keep me going with playing (Played until 4th level).			"

												Although cheap at the price of $1.00, this game gives very little  even for the small price tag. The game has nothing to offer, it's bland and holds no real cards, and if it does it doesn't play them when it should (I.E to grab my intrest). It's  ""My first game"" should go on newgrounds not on steam. Don't buy, not worth your time.			"

												This game was surprisingly awesome! I got it free cause it was on sale for .19 and gave cards for .21. Still, I thought it would be another freebie game to get cards from but this game was really fun. A bit on the short side, but totally worth it. It basically is Mario mixed with WALL E. Its a great mixture of platforming and puzzling. I like how its challenging enough to keep me engaged but not too hard to make me pull my hair out. The puzzles were a bit straightforward but took thinking to complete. Plus the environment, music and ambiance were very soothing. Totally worth the 2 cents I earned to play it and I think you should play it too. I hope they make a sequel. They should be proud of what they accomplished.			"

												This game is a GREAT platformer. Different than the stereotypical one because you can use/alter/destroy a portion of your surroundings and there are lots of puzzles to solve. The only thing that could possibly make this game better would be steam achievements, since some of the puzzles are quite difficult, and it would feel good to get an achievement for some of them, or general accomplishments.

												Beep is a Steamified flashgame. It's hard, but not to hard and worth the 1$. Why do I say this? Well, what's 1$ to support a developer that creates a game for young and old.I really enjoyed playing the game, hence I created a video out of it:

												How many times can one game crash?If the game is Beep, let's just say my playtime may read 8 minutes, but I've been at it for 20.At $0.19 I feel I got a bad deal.MY THRILLING INDIE EXPERIENCE:- Launch game- Reach main menu- Set it to windowed- It crashes immediately- Relaunch game- Set it to windowed at splash screen- It works. Amazing! What a time to be alive.- Game proceeds to crash at any provocation from dying to hitting the escape key to just because it feels like it- Have to re-window the game every launch because it never remembers- Decide it's just not worth the hassle to try to wring $0.19 cents worth of fun out of this basic ♥♥♥ flash gameJust go on the marketplace and buy a baller emote instead like a mouse with a hat or a sleeping goat.

												Well I was expecting BEEP to be a lot worse that it looks like at first glance - yet another 2D platformer. Still, the controls aren't insultingly clunky, and the artwork, while really low effort, isn't the worst I've seen either.Should you buy BEEP, then?  No, not really.  It's got fewer flaws than most 2D platformers, but neither is it the king of the genre. Also, technical problems prevent the game from being run under Windows 10 if you have a high res display and use DPI (required if your PPI is at or near retina level).   Overscan means you can only access 1/4 of the screen with your mousepointer in full screen mode - you have to run it windowed. So, while not worth buying, it's worth acknowledging the game is polished enough to be tolerable, meaning at least some of the developers on the project could achieve greater things in future.			"

												Aces joc este ceva nemaintalnit in care toate puterile din viata reala care le-ai dorit se pot intampla ♥♥♥ ar fi : invizibilitate(jhon cena),puterea lui MIrel (te pisi unde vrei si iti marchezi teritoriul,frumusete,pietre,Marcelo Cercel ,tele jurnal,protv,tvr1,etno,sex,left4dead2,flegma la borcan.Povestea acestui joc este aceia de a fi cel mai chipes robot si sa ii bati pe negri robotii chiar sunt negri is cam rasisti developarii.Este un joc porno facut de Dani Mocanu.Vali in acest joc are rol ca o meduza care te elecrocuteaza si faci buba,ianis are rolul robotelului rasist pentru ca e frumos si e alb si nu e jegos,Marisu este robotelul negru penrtu ca asa e si in realirate cas si negru si are doar o rotita care nu functioneaza,Razvan e cerul pentru ca e pur ca el si curat ,Mavrichi e jegul de pe pamant ca asa e si in realitate daca sunteti romani intrati pe facebookul lui Mavrichi andrei e ala cu capul patrat si ochelari de scons si scrietii comentarii urate ca lui ii place,Mihai este florile si gramaticile este grele,razvan cacat de manz e praf are silver 4,andrei micu este punctul ala special care trebe sa il iei penrtu scor,andrei ochelaristu este soarele neluminos de afara,Mixi e cel ce nu face nimic,Filip e mechanicul navetei care este foarte importanta,capul lui Narcis este planeta cea mai mare de acolo .In acest Friscant joc trebbuie sa explorezi toate planetele si sa iti cunosti babele.Dacă ați combina platforming de jocuri Mario, si se amesteca cu arma gravitațională de înjumătățire și fizica, ai BEEP.BEEP este un joc de colorat despre fizica și platforming.Pro:Grafica plina de culoare și luminoase.Puzzle-uri și fizică uimitor.Ridicarea rahat aleatoriu și a aruncat-o pentru a ucide dușmani este cel mai amuzant lucru vreodată.Multe nivele și lumi diferite, fiecare cu propriile lor mediu.Contra:Fizica poate fi spart foarte usor.Nu este o poveste foarte bună.Câteva bug-uri le-am întâlnit cu, dar nu foarte multe.Ar trebui să existe un al doilea întârziere de 1-2 dintre reîncărcare arma ta.Mi-ar recomanda cumpararea acest joc pe o vânzare (l-am luat pentru aproximativ 0.20 $ pe o vânzare) deoarece jocul merge la vânzare de multe ori.Acum, pentru rating: Eu dau acest joc o recomandat 6,0 rating, dar asta e doar opinia mea personală. Îmi place aceste tipuri de jocuri platformer, deci, dacă nu vă place platformers, nu iau acest rating la inimă.

												This is just one of those games where you can tell games journalists, the so called ""professionals"" are full of it, likely full of the money they're stuffed with to write their reviews, something that indie developers can't do. Look at those reviews, just look at them, now compare those with reviews from the same sources of puzzle games with AAA puzzle games that are markedly worse. - This is a fantastic little game, it has character, and it has charm, the developers clearly cared about what they were creating and the puzzles are a lot of fun. What we need to realise is that we don't need a commercially branded character to enjoy a game or find a cute little game hero charismatic. It's just kind of sad that this game is getting 70%s instead of 90%s because the character is an unknown rather than, say, Mario or Pokemon. What a sad state of affairs.			"

												Usually, I try to finish a game before I review it because it might add new features and gameplay elements or because I want to see the story. However, this game had none of that. Beep is a 2d puzzle platformer where you control a little robot which has the power to shoot bullets, ability to ""fly"" with fuel, and move objects around with what is basically a gravity gun. This game has no story. There is a little blurb at the beginning about you being dropped off to visit various planets but it doesn't come up during gameplay. The game is dull. The levels feel repetitive  to the point where I just want to get to the ending. That wouldn't be a problem except... You have to find 3 'stars' on each level. It doesn't say it outright but mathwise, you have to. The first world has 8 levels with 3 stars each. The next world needs 24 stars to unlock (for some reason). You can technically get an extra star on every level by collecting all the mini stars but they are a pain to find because there are so many of them The music is just not good. I was going to play to the end just to get through the puzzles but the game is just way too boring to let any of that happen. Additionally, It put up arbitrary walls in front of me which just annoyed me until I stopped. You might like it but I did not.			"

												Really simple little platformer with some easy shooting and physics puzzles (you can move blocks around, opening paths that were blocked or out of reach).  Controls well and generally feels fun to play.One negative is that the visuals aren't always completely clear.  Sometimes it's not obvious whether or not something is ground you can stand on or just the background.I got this game for just a couple cents on sale (the trading cards sold for about as much as the game cost) and have been pleasantly surprised.  It does what it does well, and has more content than I expected.			"

												BEEP has great promise in every aspect of it's game, even to the point where I was expecting it to have hairline accuracy with it's controls.That is however one thing that you must not assume. When you aim at an enemy it auto-locks, great for shooting under cover, bad for tracking moving enemies. In this case every enemy killable, moves. Sometimes it locks at an angle where the bullets you shoot will miss regardless of where you stand, making some scenarios only passable if you lose one block of your health.But onto the good part! I never found any puzzle that were the same. Some made me feel stupid, whereas some made me feel like a genius in the making, but no two puzzles were the same. Every obsticle you encounter is one you must figure out by yourself, whether you do it by stacking the mangled scraps of your enemies, or by propelling yourself upwards by using the tracer beam to slam the corpses up onto the underside of your BEEP.Every ""Planet"" biome has their own theme and puzzle styles that never borrow from the previous planets, allowing a fresh experience every time you move from one biome to the next. Definite plus.This is a puzzle gameIt also feels like a rage game at times.no.It's a rage game.Also I hate the insufferable flying mines that chase you....			"

The art style, which was said in other reviews isn't consistant, it has decent looking 3D orbs (you collect these every level to unlock new ones) but then the background to the hills look like something out of a flash game.The most annoying thing about this game is wonky controls, you have to right click on the bot to reload, which is counter-intuitive when you're shooting at an enemy. This game is decent, should entertain you for an hour or two. I'd recommend it on sale but otherwise it's not worth the full price.			"

NOTE: In my experience of playing this game, I have found it to be quite childish.  Though I say that, I do recommend anyone interested in the genre should purchase & play it.It's a pretty cute little game from what I saw in my total of six minutes and having only completed the first level.  It was well executed and quite charming.  It also seems very expansive from the level selection screen and the amount of content already offered on a 5-minute, tutorial first level.It appeared too childish for my taste, but there don't seem to be any problems with it, so I am suggesting it.  I hope that if you buy it, you enjoy it, or apply for a refund before it's too late.  Good luck.			"

												BEEP is a simple platformer. At a glance, this looks like a run-of-the-mill Mario or Sonic knockoff. However, BEEP is an entirely different type of platformer than others. I personally despise the genre, but I picked up the title for $0.19 regardless. I thought I'd try it for a couple minutes, hate it, and return it. However, I was laughing hard for a good hour. BEEP is extremely fun, the jet-propulsion is an amazing concept to introduce to a platformer. One of the best parts about this game is the gravity gun. You can swing enemies back in forth hilariously with it. The best part about this small game is the soundtrack. The music this game is set to is soothing and intriguing. And the sound effects are ever great. Typical robot sound effects sound annoying, but BEEP's sounds are simple and not too high pitched. This makes the game so inviting. I wouldn't buy this game at $5, because it goes on sale for $0.19 so often. The game takes a few days to complete even if you play diligently, so it's not like you play it for an hour or so and the game is complete. If you have a dollar in your Steam account, there's no reason to pick this title up when it's on sale.			"

												BEEP is a nice, simple diddy and I would recommend it - it looks nice, handles well and is just frustrating enough to make you keep playing it (I only ragequitted twice!). The question is - who can I recommend it to?The design, as I mentioned, is nice, but it gives off a kinda ""babby's first platformer"" feel. But then again, I think it might be too hard for the kids who'd appreciate it, and I'm not sure if the ones old enough to figure out the puzzles would want to be seen playing it.Of course, if you're an adult with nothing to prove to anyone, you'll enjoy it yourself.But unless you've got money to burn or really want to support the devs, maybe wait till it's on sale.

												I SAY THIS IS NOT A CHILDRENS GAME ITS HARD AS HELL Now on to my review of BEEP it is a amzing work of gamege but its is like imposable to beat like crazy hard it looks like i kids game but nooooooooooooooooo its not. now for a pie its amazing and trust this random stranger on the internet Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing But i love this game :) "

												BEEP is a fun game including simple and more advanced puzzles, a cute story, cute world, cute characters, cute cute cute etc.. The price is also very nice (1$ or so); everyone can afford it. Depending on your skill, the game will take aprox. 3-4 hours to complete. There are 3 planets, with 2 worlds on each planet. Individually, there are 4 levels on each world. That's a total of 24 levels, with 6 different worlds (backgrounds). The music is quite nice, never being distracting unless you spend way too much time ♥♥♥♥ing around in one level. I wish there were more enemies and variety of weapons and puzzles.However, you should beware of some things within the game. For example, the game can't be played in full screen mode nor can the buttons be switched. The first issue can be fixed simply by pressing Alt+Enter to make it windowed mode. Another thing is an annoying bug on lava level 4 (last level). On the second checkpoint, there's a chance that the game will instantly crash on impact. This is kind of tricky to get past. The way I did it was to kill the robot previous to that area, and carry him to the second platform from the laser beam. From there, jump on the robot, pull the robot towards you and jump again so you get high enough to jump over it and past that checkpoint. There is also a chance the game with crash if you're hit by any other laser beams on the same level.Other than this, it's really worth the money. It's fun and mostly relaxing (unless you struggle or get stuck somewhere).Final rating: 7.5/10  "

												I disliked this game very much, not for any of the aesthetics, that doesnt' really phase me. I dislike it because it handles very poorly. Every object is as light as a feather, flying any which way at the slightest lateral movement. However, your gravity gun is extremely weak and makes it hard to manuever and it doesn't really get easier with time. It gets very frustrating very easily after a few levels and the respawn time (about 5 seconds) is way too much between deaths for a platformer like this where dying and restarting are necessary to explore the levels and how to deal with them. For the price (especially on sale) it's not awful, may as well be free, but I still with I could get my money back. Oh well, interesting concept, wish it had been done better.			"

												Considering I only paid 19 cents for this game, it's going to stay.TL/DR: BEEP is a OK game, but not worth $5. If you REALLY have to have it, wait for a sale,Graphics: 4/10. Looks/feels rushed, can sometimes be hard to tell what is a wall or not. Each menu looks like a 30 second project. (Or a last-minute thing.)Gameplay: 6/10. Good ideas, but not the most straightforward sometimes. The Gravity Gun would sometimes not latch on properly and disconnect at random. The game itself also assumes that you know what you can or cannot shoot. I had spent about 6 lives trying to pass a set of lasers using a defeated enemy, only to find that I could shoot them. One level in particular drove me nuts with having to build a set of platforms, and then giving you a Rocket system once completed. Needless to say, I somewhat lost hope in it after that.Sound: 4/10 Not really worth writing about, although some of the effects do get annoying rather quickly. Overall: 3/10 At full price. 4/10 discounted. Utter confusion, odd/cheap looking graphics, and an overall rushed feel put down some rather great ideas.			"

												For this price it provides a lot of fun. It can also get a bit tricky at times, especially at the end, but for the most part it just feels too easy.What I really don't like, is the lack of options in the main menu. There is also no way to rebind your controls or change resolution, but overall it is still a good game.			"

												This is by far one of the most value packed games I have played. For such a small price why not just grab it and try it?It was gifted to me by a viewer and so I thought I'd give it a try and I was impressed. For an indie game there are some challenging puzzles, hours of playtime(~10 if 100% completion) and tons of infuriating moments. I can only hope that with the sale that recently featured the game that the developer will make a sequel.			"

												At first I truly enjoyed the game but after a bunch of levels, it became mundane. BEEP eventually felt like an unpolished platformer due to its flash-like graphics and exploitable physics. It was also baffling for me that there was no option menu especially for those times when the game glitches in choosing the correct resolution. The ideas were whole but the cohesion of all the elements weren't quite there; it looked complete but slowly fell apart as I progressed through.			"

												This game is literally the definition of weird. You play as a robot, fight other robots, can partially fly, and as a little side-note it is a platformer. This game has only one shortcoming, one that every platformer has... every time you fall off the damn edge.			"

BEEP is charming action plaftormer with not-so-complicated puzzels and great physics engine.The story is almost non-existent. In the distant future, people created BEEP-ships that create BEEP-bots and send them to explore the universe. One of the ship find something and goes to see what it is. That's it.The game have two problems. First one: lack of any kind of options. The game graphically won't blow your mind, music and sound fx are fine, but still it would be nice to have some options. The second problem: you jump with W. It's just not intuitive at first. But those two problems are not a big deal.I like art style. It's simple, but so charming, vibrant and colorful, especially the locations you visit. Swamps, volcano, ice and desert places, forests and caves. They are diverse and full of obstacles to shoot and puzzles to tease your brain. There is one strange bug. When you kill a little flying kamikadze robot , a black square appear for a few seconds and then disappear. It's bizzare, but other than that I didn't notice any other bugs.The main star here is the gameplay. It consist of platforming, puzzle solving and shooting. Even the level selection screen is great. With the mouse you move the rocket and after hitting enough asteroids it's time to deploy the BEEP-bot. The next level unlocks after beating the previous one. The BEEP-bot have three things available for handling the dangers – a single weapon, anti-gravity ray or Anti-Grav and he can float for a breif period of time, that way he can jump larger distances. The first thing I notice is the physics engine. It's great. A lot of thing can be move, stacked and even used as a weapon. Physics are the core of the game and anti-grav will be your best friend. At some places you have to rotate platform to step on it or put few stones on top of each other to reach higher place and so on. For a few levels, you will even get jet pack, which keeps the gameplay fresh.Through the hole game you will search, if you want, for antimatter and when you find it, most times puzzle awaits you. Some require just to move out something, others test your reflexes and so on. Anti-grav is required for the puzzels. Level after level they get little bit complicated, but not too much. Some of them have to be solved to continue the game, others, like those for the antimater, are not. But if you not look for her, you are missing half the fun here. It's satisfying to solve puzzle, that seems at first glance difficult. They are not too easy or too hard, they are just right, fun and diverse.For all the things I said about the gameplay, you need perfect controls. They are. When you die, it's entirely the players fault. But like I said in the beginning, W is kind of not intuitive. It took me few level to get use to it. I think Space bar is more appropriate. There is even counter for the deaths. Enemy design is okay, they won't blow your mind. Several types of robots with various attack and movement patterns. But few enemies require different approach, like one that first you need to remove his helmet-thingy from his head and then shoot. They may look mean, but at the same time they are cute.Sound design is good. The music is great, not too loud, diffrerent tracks for every world you visit and they fits really well . Few levels don't have music and I wonder if this is deliberate or the game bug out. Sound fx are nice. When you kill enemies they make cute noise and I kinda feel guilty for shooting them.I was quite surprise by BEEP. I didn't expect to have so much fun. I bought it impulsively on sale. It took me little more than 7 h to beat it and i was never bored. Great and cute world, lengthy, nice mechanics, great soundtrack, but lack any kind of options. The game ended with open door for sequel and I hope some day to see the light of day. I highly recommened it.			"

												BEEP is a fun adventure type platformerThe levels are nicely designed, and can be completed somewhat easily. If you are trying to obtain all the antimatter particles, it becomes quite a bit harder.While the graphics are not realistic, they fit in with the games design very well. The visuals are unique and fun.Solid platforming engine, no bugs glitches or clips that I could find.Overall, it is very well done. I highly recommend picking this game up, and for less than the cost of a move, you will get hours and hours of enjoyment.			"

												Pretty awesome so far! One  bug i have noticed that is a little annoying, is when youre in windowed mode and not full screen if you click escape to enter the pause menu, the game crashes. Well it does on my laptop anyway- which is not that much of a potato. Lol. But anyway! new game! low cost! I'm sure it'll get fixed and improved. In the mean time, i'm having a lot of fun just playing in full screen, but it is handy to play in windowed mode when multitasking etc. THANKS! :D			"

												I am not 100% sure I can recommend this game.  I don't even know where I got it from.If it's free or under $1, then maybe.  If not, then no.It's like someone ported a flash game to Steam.  It's pretty bad, but that's what also makes it funny.Fly into the sun?  No problem.  Turn around and fly away.The main bulk of the game seems to be a Super-Mario type of platformer with guns and a gravity arm.  Or somethi-HNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG "

												Really simple little platformer with some easy shooting and physics puzzles (you can move blocks around, opening paths that were blocked or out of reach).  Controls well and generally feels fun to play.One negative is that the visuals aren't always completely clear.  Sometimes it's not obvious whether or not something is ground you can stand on or just the background.I got this game for just a couple cents on sale (the trading cards sold for about as much as the game cost) and have been pleasantly surprised.  It does what it does well, and has more content than I expected.			"

												There's nothing particularly wrong with BEEP, but I think that's at least partly because the developers weren't innovating or taking risks with it, and ultimately, it just feels too generic and simple to hook me.  The gravity gun, touted as a unique mechanic and the game's main attraction, really isn't unique at all: it's functionally identical to, and used for puzzle-solving in exactly the same way as the wizard's telekinesis in Trine, which is a much more highly recommended game.

												Pretty good physics platformer. You control a robot on wheels that can shoot enemies and move things around with its gravity gun. The goal is to get to the end of each level while collecting enough pieces of antimatter to unlock the next one. The puzzles are very easy, but stacking blocks (and dead enemies) to get to a high place requires some patience.You have infinitely many robots (lives) and you keep your progress within the level when you die, which is pretty good.The game never gets very hard. Still took me 8 hours and 100 robots though.			"

												This is a fairly charming and playable platforming and puzzle game, with a satisfying difficulty curve and a decent variety of puzzles. The controls are simple to master and the platforming is mostly forgiving, due to Beep's high degree of mid-air manoeuvrability and tendency to stick to platforms with its treads. Deaths were infrequent and usually fair, so frustration never really crept in.There are often a number of ways to deal with enemies and solve puzzles, mostly due to the games somewhat wonky but effective physics engine and the gravity gun. This tool allows you to sling objects (and enemies) all over the place and is the basis for most of the puzzles.Ultimately, its not the most polished game you will find, but its a steal for $2 and I enjoyed it to the end.

												At first I truly enjoyed the game but after a bunch of levels, it became mundane. BEEP eventually felt like an unpolished platformer due to its flash-like graphics and exploitable physics. It was also baffling for me that there was no option menu especially for those times when the game glitches in choosing the correct resolution. The ideas were whole but the cohesion of all the elements weren't quite there; it looked complete but slowly fell apart as I progressed through.			"

												BEEP is a simple platformer. At a glance, this looks like a run-of-the-mill Mario or Sonic knockoff. However, BEEP is an entirely different type of platformer than others. I personally despise the genre, but I picked up the title for $0.19 regardless. I thought I'd try it for a couple minutes, hate it, and return it. However, I was laughing hard for a good hour. BEEP is extremely fun, the jet-propulsion is an amazing concept to introduce to a platformer. One of the best parts about this game is the gravity gun. You can swing enemies back in forth hilariously with it. The best part about this small game is the soundtrack. The music this game is set to is soothing and intriguing. And the sound effects are ever great. Typical robot sound effects sound annoying, but BEEP's sounds are simple and not too high pitched. This makes the game so inviting. I wouldn't buy this game at $5, because it goes on sale for $0.19 so often. The game takes a few days to complete even if you play diligently, so it's not like you play it for an hour or so and the game is complete. If you have a dollar in your Steam account, there's no reason to pick this title up when it's on sale.			"

												I owned this game for a while but only recently got around to actually playing it. I'm honestly sorry that I waited so long because this game is a real treat. The controls are simple and effective. The design of the levels and characters is very cutesy and fun to play. So far the puzzles are not especially challenging but I haven't gotten very far. Despite this, I think the game is a lot of fun to play.			"

												BEEP is a nice, simple diddy and I would recommend it - it looks nice, handles well and is just frustrating enough to make you keep playing it (I only ragequitted twice!). The question is - who can I recommend it to?The design, as I mentioned, is nice, but it gives off a kinda ""babby's first platformer"" feel. But then again, I think it might be too hard for the kids who'd appreciate it, and I'm not sure if the ones old enough to figure out the puzzles would want to be seen playing it.Of course, if you're an adult with nothing to prove to anyone, you'll enjoy it yourself.But unless you've got money to burn or really want to support the devs, maybe wait till it's on sale.

												Well I think I got pretty close to the end but the last ice level is way hard.. If you are a fan of platformers and want something different, I definitely recommend this game. The devs did a great job, and with the sale it was around 2 dollars. The content is pretty high, and the only thing I could find against the mechanics is stacking.. It's not that bad but when you get to the ice levels and you have to stack 4 or 5 ice cubes it can get a bit tedious. Give it a shot if you have a few extra lying around in the dusty wallet, I think its worth it for all skill levels.			"

												I SAY THIS IS NOT A CHILDRENS GAME ITS HARD AS HELL Now on to my review of BEEP it is a amzing work of gamege but its is like imposable to beat like crazy hard it looks like i kids game but nooooooooooooooooo its not. now for a pie its amazing and trust this random stranger on the internet Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing But i love this game :) "

												At first i believed this game to be for young kids, well, it is but not in the way I thought it was. First of all this game was extremely cheap, 0.20$ to be exact, (as it was on sale). I opened up the game, found the title screen to be very basic, but hey what do you expect from a 0.20$ game? I played about 20 minutes and got a bit bored, i told my self, 'Hey i could keep it for when my younger cousins come over' and left it for a while. About 1 month later I had litle to do and I thought i might as well try it again. I found that i quite enjoyed the game's simple yet cute art style and decent controls. The most fun i had was actually discovering the different enemies and seeing how they react to my presence (eg.firing lasers or an electric body). I perhaps spent to much time flying/ floating around with the robot's booster and dying because of it but hey, you would to. The most disapointing aspect in my opinion are the puzles, I am quite early into the game but I can't seeing the puzles getting any more complex, they mainly consist of busy work and could be easily completed by a young child, to be fair this game is targeted to that audience so who am i to blame. Overall the game is no AAA title but it is extremely possible to lose yourself in the adorable art style, wacky controls and some interesting game mechanics for many hours. It is sure to be lots of fun for a young child (and even adults). It offers a degree of complexity and simpleness often requiring you to do precise jumps, conserving fuel and timing your movementsAnd with a price like that? you know this is a steal.B-P.S Is it just me or is it just really fun to fling the corpses of fallen enemies across the map? Just me? OK			"

												Pretty good physics platformer. You control a robot on wheels that can shoot enemies and move things around with its gravity gun. The goal is to get to the end of each level while collecting enough pieces of antimatter to unlock the next one. The puzzles are very easy, but stacking blocks (and dead enemies) to get to a high place requires some patience.You have infinitely many robots (lives) and you keep your progress within the level when you die, which is pretty good.The game never gets very hard. Still took me 8 hours and 100 robots though.			"

It would often make it hard to see the platforms and sometimes result in my death.It's a good thing it's cheap, but I feel like it could be free.4/10			"

But you can solf that by using alt + enter en elarging the screen to the size you see fit.so in shorts, buy this !			"

												The charm of BEEP is that your antigravity beam is not just a puzzle-solving tool; it often trumps the gun as a tactical element. Why bulls-eye when you can block, bury, and bash away?			"

												BEEP is a nice, simple diddy and I would recommend it - it looks nice, handles well and is just frustrating enough to make you keep playing it (I only ragequitted twice!). The question is - who can I recommend it to?The design, as I mentioned, is nice, but it gives off a kinda ""babby's first platformer"" feel. But then again, I think it might be too hard for the kids who'd appreciate it, and I'm not sure if the ones old enough to figure out the puzzles would want to be seen playing it.Of course, if you're an adult with nothing to prove to anyone, you'll enjoy it yourself.But unless you've got money to burn or really want to support the devs, maybe wait till it's on sale.

												I bought it for a few cents just do sell cards. However, the game is good. it kept me interested for longer than I imagined, but it got a little repetitive too soon. In the end I was just happy it was finished. I can't say it worths its full price, but if it is on sale, buy it.			"

												I SAY THIS IS NOT A CHILDRENS GAME ITS HARD AS HELL Now on to my review of BEEP it is a amzing work of gamege but its is like imposable to beat like crazy hard it looks like i kids game but nooooooooooooooooo its not. now for a pie its amazing and trust this random stranger on the internet Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing But i love this game :) "
