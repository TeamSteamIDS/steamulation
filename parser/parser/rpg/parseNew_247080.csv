												I've been playing this game obsessively for a couple months now, and still can't get enough of it.  Learning the patterns of all the enemies is one of the most satisfying things I've ever done in any game.  When you start out, you're just fumbling around, faceplanting into enemies and getting torn apart.  If you practice enough, though, you'll be able to take on any situation without suffering so much as a scratch.  Every part of the game is very doable with the default equipment, so you're never just screwed because the right items didn't drop for you.  The weapons and spells that you can find all work differently and cause you to change your method of attack, but they're all pretty balanced.  There are a ton of different weapons types with their own unique advantages and drawbacks, rather than traditional ""tiers"" of weapons (1 damage, 2 damage, 3 damage, etc.)  And there's an instant replay feature upon death, where you can look and see what you could have done differently to save yourself (there's always SOMETHING).  This is quite possibly the most well-balanced game I've ever played, and I adore it.  Pick this game up right now if you can.Edit: If you have any doubts, just look at how many hours I've logged on it ;)Edited again, after launch day: Early access is over!  The game is complete and it's AMAZING.  I cannot believe how much better the game has gotten with time!  The final area and extra bosses have been added, and they really went all-out with the monster designs for the last zone.  And suddenly there are two entire new soundtracks to choose from?  Yes, please!  I cannot tell you how happy I am with how the final product came out.  I still play this all the time :)			"

												Hard as balls, fantastic music, great gameplay, and a great premise in the story.  It also has the side benefit of being completely unique, nothing else like it out there at the moment.A game I keep cursing at, rage quiting, and yet keep coming back to.  Truly rewarding, as the game gets better as you get better.Can't recommend it enough.			"

Early Access Review
""Kick! Punch! It's all in the mind.""These words were spoken by the great Tamanegi Sensei (better known as Chop Chop Master Onion) over 15 years ago when music-based games were first making a name, and they ring even truer today as the rhythm genre takes an evolutionary step into the dungeon crawling arena.NecroDancer is the holy matrimony between addictive rhythm game grooviness and challenging roguelike complexity, and I'll be damned if it doesn't hit the spot. It's amazing that a concept this unique took as long as it did to come to fruition, but it's been more than worth the wait.Not only is the concept unique but it's done right, something we hardly ever see when a new mechanic or gimmick is introduced to the gaming world for the first time. We see so many ""new"" ideas that are merely just a melting pot of previously established genres. Lo and behold, these developers have obviously set out to refine and perfect their concoction of varied gameplay elements on their first attempt and that is highly admirable. Necrodancer stands not only as a magnificently well-realized combination of genres but as a completely new experience of it's own and the start of what is hopefully a new trend of taking fun and risky chances in game development.The in-game music is dark, fantastic and quite danceable itself lending to the blissful feeling of hitting each beat of the song with perfect timing. The precision of the music-based movement has lead lots of early adopters of the game to swear by playing with DDR dancepads which apparently add a lot to the fun and engaging nature of exploring the Crypt. This shows a serious level of dedication from the rhythm game community and has already garnered enough attention to spawn it's own design of custom NecroDancer dancepads[necrodancer.com].And if you somehow are crazy enough to get tired of renowned composer Danny Baranowsky's heavy electronic horror jams, the game features an intuitive beat detection function for usage of songs from your own library. The detection of beats in your songs is generally spot on, and makes trying and discovering those perfect tunes for the game infinitely explorable and replayable for audiophiles in the same way games like Audiosurf and Beat Hazard Ultra provide endless entertainment. Even for those songs that might be a bit too fast or slow for manageable NecroDancing, there's a feature to alter the speed of in-game beats to give more accessibility for a wider range of genres. No form of music shall go undanced in the heart of these Crypts.There are four main floors to the game with three levels and a boss-type enemy each, but beating any single one of them won't be an easy task. You will retry many times being forced to scour every diamond, buy up all the upgrades, and loot your way through multiple plays before you succeed, but what makes this so much more of a pleasure to replay than any other games which borrow rogue elements is the musical nature of the game. NecroDancer replaces the repetitive and stale turn-based combat of traditional roguelikes with the fun and engaging audio interaction of the best rhythm games made to date.With a touch of the strategic approach of traditional tactics games, the enemies each have a very distinct pattern to their movements and attacks that the player must learn through multiple failures and awareness. Starting out you encounter the easier monsters such as slimes that move passively back and forth as well as skeletons that follow behind in a predictable way that is easy to counter. Protecting the exit of each floor are the harder and more complex mini-bosses, ranging from hulking Minotaurs that charge towards you in a straight path or determined Dragons that you must outsmart and keep just out of harm's way in order to retain your doomed life just a little longer.Throughout your journeys into the crypt you'll have two different forms of currency, first being gold coins that you can spend within the levels at merchants on equipment and items to help you on your current run. Second, and most importantly are the much harder to find Diamonds which are the only thing that carry over into the lobby after death, allowing you to purchase upgrades to the gear and loot you come across during your runs. This adds an insanely addictive level of persistence in the same way that the character growth in Rogue Legacy or shortcut system of Spelunky do.The shops you purchase these upgrades from won't be made available to you that easily, however, as each of the different merchants and trainers you need will be imprisoned and strewn about the various dungeons forcing you to dance deeper and deeper to rescue the people you will rely on in the future. The game is hard and you'll die many times, but the deeper you go the more you discover, and the more you discover the easier your respective trips will become. This adds a ridiculous amount of replayability and persistence to an already engaging and genre defying new formula.Here I am hopping and slashing away to the beat of Castlevania's 'Vampire Killer', and I come across a Blood Whip. Things could not be more perfect. Necrodancer isn't just a gimmick, it's the start of something beautiful, it's a new kind of entertainment that can be enjoyed from the hardecore-est of dungeon delving roguelite aficionados to the most casual of rhythm game fans, but there is one thing that all of these demographics must have in common; a dedication to the sound of music.

Crypt of the NecroDancer is quietly genius.It's exactly what you would imagine a game to be like if you were told it's a roguelike, but in real time, with the turns lasting as long as the beat of a soundtrack — because they are, in fact, set to a soundtrack. This kind of ""X meets Y"" high concept game (roguelike meets rhythm game, in this case) is easy to think up, but not as easy to turn into a good game, if the failed examples littering Steam are any indication. NecroDancer not only works, but works well — it's an astounding feat of game design, and it's likely you won't even notice that while you're playing because it just feels natural.This is one of the few roguelikes that deserves the description ""easy to pick up, hard to master"", as most roguelikes are not even all that easy to pick up. NecroDancer has a tutorial that lasts all of 90 seconds, and contains everything you need to get started. Getting through the first set of levels will take a little more time, but can still be done in an hour or two. But make no mistake, the difficulty ramps up over a total of four zones (each with three levels and a boss level, for a total of 16 levels). And if you think that's the end of it, you're wrong — there's a separate story mode to play through all the zones in sequence rather than separately, and to unlock all the characters (each with their own gimmicks that change the way you play) you have to complete the game multiple times. This is a true roguelike in that the peak difficulty is insane and completing the game with every character is a challenge restricted to only a handful of demigods, but it's also a true roguelike in that it's fair and rewards strategic play and perseverance. And all that to a great beat!I haven't even completed the third zone yet and I can already tell it will be many hours more before I chip my teeth on the really difficult parts, but I felt like I needed to get this review out before the current sale is over, even if my experience is incomplete. This game is almost certainly worth it at full price if you're into roguelikes, but at sale price it's a no-brainer. If it looks like anything you might like, buy it. Even if you can't make your way through it, you'll still get your money's worth for the time you're playing it.			"

												I've played this game for last 4 months of its Early Access. It already looked very promising and awesome. With the release it took me only a few hours of playtime to confirm everything I was ready to write about.This is a rogue-like rhythm dungeon crawler, as you've probably read on the store page. The genre is quite unique - its gameplay is a blend of turn-based combat but it's constrained by the boundaries of the ""beats"" of the music of the level (unlike a lot of rhythm games it's very forgiving on beat accuracy and there's a reason for that: it's quite action-packed, so when you have a few skeletons, fiery dogs and a dragon converging on you - you can't really follow the beats within 20% margin what is usual for rhythm games).First things first: this is a rhythm game and its soundtrack wirtten by Danny Baranowsky is just pure essence of awesomeness. Randomly generated levels are extremely well done. When I say extremely I mean it. This game doesn't have unbeatable generations. It may be easier or harder, but it's a fair rogue-like, if you die - it's your fault. It's not like rogue's tale when you can be killed on first turn the moment you spawn. So you won't really be stomped by something you can't beat.With the release the game has been augmented with some kind of plot which makes it a bit more beautiful than a rogue-like w/o a plot. Also this game even during Early Access didn't have any gamebreaking bugs. In 80h I never had a single crash or anything else that'd ruin my gaming experience, since technically this is kind of a day1 for this game - it's exremely polished, which is a good example what Early Access system should be used for and how.With cutscenes you are being rewarded with when you complete ""zones"" with different characters, with easier and harder characters themselves, with a big variety of items, leaderboards, daily challenges - delivering beatdowns to the beat in this game is guaranteed to be one your best rogue-like experiences ever.

Early Access Review
								SO MUCH FUN.I've spent far too much time in a single night playing this game. It's unfinished right now, still having some placeholder art and more things being added, but the core is there and it's a blast.There are two main components to the game - rhythm and pattern recognition. You'll need both to survive this game. The first is simple, just stay on the beat and you'll be fine. The second is the trickier one and more important one in my opinion. Each enemy has a defined movement and attack pattern, and you need to slip in at the right time and attack when you won't be hurt. Sometimes it's easy, like with slims that only move up and down, or skeletons who raise their hands before attacking.Sometimes, it's trickier. Mushroom people who throw out AoE attacks. Dragons who move every second turn, or bats who I have yet to figure out the pattern for. Of course, if you get bit by a bat, it's likely not such a big deal, but missing the dragon could get you clawed or charred, a one turn death.There's no ""gotcha!"" kills to this roguelike, though plenty of dying to do as things get frantic and you fail to keep up, misjudge the enemy attack pattern, and suddenly find yourself cornered, and you'll do more than a little dying as you learn the patterns of some of the more dangerous enemies.Rarely frustraing, lots of fun, occasionally repetitive due to the single assigned song per level - hopefully this increases. The rest is headed in the exact right direction.			"

Early Access Review
								Over the past several months, I've had the pleasure of testing an alpha of Crypt of the NecroDancer[necrodancer.com], a retro styled rhythm based roguelike.A what?Crypt of the NecroDancer is a procedural dungeon crawler where the player and enemies movie on the beats of the game's music tracks. That may sound like an eclectic mix, but it works. It works really well.You play as Cadence, a firey young woman who, against the better judgement of her elders, descends into the NecoDancer's crypt in search of answers. The intro cinematic shows Cadence prone, her head against a blood smeared rock whilst her narration says, ""I don't know how I survived that fall.""Cadence is resurrected by the NecroDancer, who makes her heart beat to the rhythm of his music. Armed only with what she learned about the undead from her uncle Eli and the equipment she discovers along the way, Cadence must descent farther to find her answers and hopefully free her heart in the process.Inspired in part by Spelunky, developer Ryan Clark has pointed out that they've tried to create something more accessible than typical roguelike, focusing on making the player feel like any deaths are their own fault rather than the game being unforgiving. To help convey this, each enemy has its own behaviours which players can anticipate and respond to after learning their movement patterns. For example, skeletons move on every second beat, whilst ghosts move on every beat, but only when the player is facing away from them. The game's complexity is emergent and comes from the combinations of enemies which make each encounter feel unique and challenging. Each of the game's four zones is populated with its own enemy types, which become more varied as the game progresses.As you play, Cadence comes across many weapons and items, each with their own behaviours that lend themselves towards different styles of gameplay. The properties of each item seems to be something you're expected to learn as you play, discovering that a broadsword will let you hit enemies on any of the three adjacent tiles, or that a karati gi will enable Cadence to move past traps without setting them off.In addition to buying and finding items whilst playing, the game's lobby features a number of shopkeepers from whom items which impact on the game can be brought. Some items will be permanent buffs, such as health increases, whilst others will be more subtle like giving a particular weapon the chance to spawn in a chest within the game. Items from these shopkeepers are purchased with diamonds rather than the gold you buy items with in-game, and provide a way for players to feel a sense of progression as they complete the game's zones.Rather than progressing onto the next zone when completing one, you are returned to the lobby area to find a staircase leading down to the next zone unlocked. In this ""normal"" mode, players are encouraged to explore and master each zone before moving onto Crypt of the NecroDancer's Hardcore and Daily Challenge modes which allow players to forego any items bought from the lobby shoopkeepers and play through the entire game with one life.Beyond Hardcore mode and Daily Challenge mode, the game also offers some additional challenges and characters for varied gameplay.The game ships with an absolutely rocking soundtrack from Danny Baranowsky (Canabalt, Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac and Drifter, amongst others), but also features the ability to load custom tracks.Currently, testers run a utility which generates beat definition files that the game uses to track whether your movements are done in time with the music. A Linux build of the utility isn't yet available, and there's some path/case issues which haven't been resolved yet, but the developers seem to be attentive and I expect these to be resolved soon. Eventually this functionality will be built into the game, but for now, there's a little bit of manual handling.The game also offers game pad and dance mat support (if that's exciting, you can keep an eye out for some NecroDancer themed dance mats[necrodancer.com]) in addition to keybaord controls. I found that I had to configure custom bindings for my Logitech F310 gamepad and a ""Dance UK"" dance mat (which overrides the keyboard bindings), but after doing that, both were usable.Crypt of the NecroDancer feels rich with atmosphere. Small things, like the subtle screen shake when striking a successful blow, or the shopkeeper's voice as he sings along to whatever music is currently playing really show the kind of attention to detail that is going into this game, and I find myself eager to see what each update brings.Crypt of the NecroDancer will be launching on Steam Early Access on July the 30th (which is just over a week away right now).There's no solid release date at this point, but it's expected to be released this year. You can find a few bits and pieces on the Brace Yourself Games dev blog[blog.braceyourselfgames.com] (recently, they've been showing off some enemy art) and Ryan is quite active on the Brace Yourself Games forum[braceyourselfgames.com].I've been streaming the game a couple of times a week on HitBox[www.hitbox.tv]. People are welcome to subscribe and watch the game in action when I play.			"

Crypt of the NecrodancerDeveloper: Brace Yourself GamesPublisher: Brace Yourself Games, Klei Entertainment	Introduction==========Crypt of the Necrodancer is a rhythm rogue-like dungeon crawler. You navigate your character through randomly generated dungeons divided into zones, while avoiding traps, defeating enemies, and collecting treasure, weapons, and armor. The game encourages you to move to the beat of the tracks played in each zone, offering you a coin multiplayer as long as you stick to moving with the beat. The longer you stay in rhythm with the beat, the higher your multiplayer goes. The multiplier affects how many coins you earn from defeating enemies, as well as providing boosts to some of the items you find. So it's really in your best interests to try and keep a good rhythm going as you explore!Gameplay==========As said above, you move your character in-time with the beat of the song being played on each floor. The starter character, Cadence, has the perk of having an assistive tool at the bottom of the screen, which helps you to time your button presses with the beat. The game is divided into 4 zones, each consisting of a few floors and a boss floor. Each floor has a different tune playing, which in turn has a different beat that allows you to move at a certain pace. Some floors have a slower beat, some have a faster beat. Also important to note are how monsters move with the beat. Certain monster types have specific patterns, and learning these patterns will help you greatly in navigating the dungeon safely. Some move every beat, some move every other beat. If you happen to move onto a square at the same time as a monster, you take damage, which further emphasizes how important it is to learn monster movements.You are also able to utilize several tools, including a shovel, bombs, and various charms that have different effects. Also scattered about are shrines, which offer several different effects depending on it's type. Some are positive effects, while others are negative. Smart use of every tool at your disposal is crucial to survival. One tool I really like to utilize are bombs, as they have several exploratory and combat uses. The shovel is used to dig through walls, which can lead to lots of hidden rooms with secret items! Some walls cannot be dug if your shovel isn't good enough, and there are several tiers of shovels, as well as weapons and armor. Gold, Blood, Titanium, and Obsidian are a few examples, each providing different modifiers for the items. The game also features a level editor, with which you can create and upload your own dungeons to the Steam Workshop for others to play and enjoy. The only downside is that you need to clear Zone 4 with a character to unlock it initially. It's also a bit odd in that it's very difficult to use until you learn how to navigate the menus and how to place items. Despite this, it's a powerful tool that works. One thing I'd like for them to add in the level editor is the ability to have specific enemies drop specific items when defeated...such as keys!Graphics==========Boasting a pixel art style, everything is surprisingly detailed. The sprites are amazingly rich and colorful, and often times you are able to tell where monsters will move and what they are about to do, as well as spot secrets hidden in the walls...like the glinting tip of a diamond in a stone pillar! Such small details are what make this game great. Armor also shows up on your character, so it's easy to tell what they are wearing. Some weapons have battle animations, such as the whips, but most you don't actually see the weapon. Instead, you see a sort of ""slash"" animation depending on the weapon type. Needless to say, these are minor graphical grievances that are more than made up for by the rest of the game's details. Traps are easy to spot, and items laying around are easily identified as well.Sound and Music==========The music of this game is where the game shines. Catchy tunes accompany every zone and floor, offering a variety of beats and toe-tapping goodness. Danny Baranowsky is the one responsible for most of the songs in the game, and he has done a fantastic job in really giving this game life. Sound effects are basic and they work, signalling damage, movement, and enemy presence. There really isn't much to say here, other than the soundtarck is amazing. You can check it out or buy it here[dbsoundworks.bandcamp.com]. It's 100% worth a listen, and even a buy if you like it! There is even an extended soundtrack available for you to further customize each zone. The game also allows you to use your own MP3's in-game for endless fun.Performance==========This isn't really a very-demanding game, so most people should have no issues running it. If you have any doubts, make sure to check the minimum and recommended specs for the game on the Store Page. During my playtime I did not run into any bugs or glitches. I expected to run into at least 1 bug during my several playthroughs, but surprisingly not a single one appeared. Bravo! There are options for several resolutions, as well as Windowed and Fullscreen modes.Final Thoughts==========Crypt of the Necrodancer is a worthy additional to the library of anyone who is a fan of rogue-likes, music-based games, dungeons crawlers, or people who just love fun unique games. There hasn't been a game like this before, so it's worth diving into if you are looking for a new experience. Gameplay Demo==========

												Crypt of the NecroDancer is a roguelike rhythm game, developed by Brace Yourself Games. Releasing in April 2015 on Steam and then later released on PS4 and Vita in February 2016. NecroDancer is a really unique gaming experience. Every action you take must be in line with the beat of the soundtrack. This includes moving and attacking the enemies. The reward for hitting the beat each time is getting a higher coin multiplier, failing to hit the beat resets your multiplier. Not hitting the beat does not deal any damage to your character, it is just a pain as sometimes your multiplier can often be the thing between successfully completing a level and not. There are a handful of different enemies in the game, which you can learn their pattern of movements if you pay close attention. They all have a predefined path which you should learn to do damage to them or avoid them completely. Throughout the dungeons, you will find loot; these can be weapons, armour, and useable items such as bombs or potions. The coins you earn can also be used in the dungeon’s shops to let you purchase upgrades on the fly.  The game also has a central hub; this is where you can purchase upgrades that will stay active throughout your play through, such as unlocking an extra chest to spawn on each level for example. One of the ways in which the game forces you to keep moving, is the hidden time limit on each level. Once the song ends you will be forced to move onto the next zone, which may result in you missing out on the reward of more coins or upgrades. I think this is a nice addition as it stops people from using a slow and methodical method and force you to keep up with the tempo and beat of the song. Graphically, NecroDancer uses the 8bit pixel theme very well. It looks really pretty and very vibrant with colours the majority of the time. The UI is clean and clear with all of the relevant information, especially the Heartbeat sensor at the bottom, which after an hour or two, you won’t need to pay any attention to as you will be so in tune with the soundtracks that you can move on your own. Of course a game that revolves around rhythm needs a half decent soundtrack, NecroDancer certainly delivers there thankfully. With some original music composed by Danny Baranowsky.As with most roguelike games, the more you play the easier they get. Since NecroDancer requires more skill than anything else, this is more so the case than ever before. Once you get the beat down, you can conquer pretty much anything the game throws at you. Throw in a few permanent upgrades and you really won’t have any problems. The game has a handful of really unique boss fights too. The end one is probably the most memorable of them all though as it adds some very unique game play mechanics in which I thoroughly enjoyed. All of the levels and stages across the game are randomly generated, so you will never run into the same dungeon layout twice. This of course adds to the replay ability of the game already; but NecroDancer doesn’t stop there. In the main game hub, you will also have access to a daily challenge, in which every player who plays the challenge will face the same map, and your aim is to get the best score possible at the end. This definitely makes the game have plenty of longevity and gives you a reason to load the game up every few days to take part in this daily event even after finishing the story mode.  The main story took me seven hours to complete which I think is a decent amount of time; where you will get the most content is from re-running the stages unlocking new characters, playing the daily challenges and working your way up the leader boards. I really wanted to play the game using a controller, but I couldn’t get my 360 pad to work sadly. Whilst the keyboard controls are fine, I feel the controller would have been that little bit better to use. Everything else works as intended in the game. A neat little feature is that you can import your own music collection to the game too, having you match the beat of your favourite tunes! Crypt of the NecroDancer is an absolute god send a roguelike game. The originality of the gameplay is something which every other developer should take note of. The gorgeous pixel graphics art style is really well done too. This game just screams of character and pure fun. I cannot recommend this game enough for roguelike fans, and fans of the indie scene.

												Keep in mind that I've been dreaming of a proper top-down rhythm game for years. Quite a lot of what I have to say is based on the fact that I think with a bit of work this game could have potentially been my favorite game of all time.It's excellent concept, straight-to-the-point presentation, great use of color, more than functional randomization, a very nice shrine mechanic, the ability to dig through walls, fully functional and easy to to understand beat counter, some interesting boss fights, speed/scorerun support and a huge number of different ways to play the game all do a very good job of distracting the player from realizing that the core rhythm/roguelike concept is actually used in quite a uniform and unimaginative way.The way the game works is that you have a beat counter that multiplies your gold the more you move and attack in accordance with the beat. This is a really interesting mechanic and doesn't require any outside knowledge or athleticism to get good with (like some dancepad games do) but it's actual implementation leaves me thinking it was not realized properly. First off, the only punishment that you get for missing a beat with Cadence (the standard character) is that you cannot move for about a half-second and you lose your gold multiplier. This is ok, I suppose (certainly instant death on missed beat would be far too cruel, though there's a character for exactly that purpose) but it doesn't really hinder you in anyway. The most blatant example of how little the beat mechanic matters are the Blademaster enemies in Zone 4, which parry your attacks on reaction and then lunge forward,  then becoming vulnerable. If you are constantly moving along with the beat these ""range-proof"" enemies can group up with time and become a real nuisance, but if you stand still killing them is almost effortless. You can bait out their parry, step backward, and then strike immediately to kill them.  Of course, you can do this along with the beat if your footing is good enough, but doing it without beat sync completely removes any risk in this case.The amount of enemies and gold in Zone 4 is excessive, to say the least, so even if you were to walk around with a gold multiplier of 1.0 you would have more than enough gold for the shops.Second, absolutely none of the levels seem to have been designed with the rhythm mechanic in mind, behind the simple concept of allowing the player to dig through walls if they get trapped behind a wall. All four zones are fairly entertaining, but really, none of them would be out of place in a pure roguelike. The source of difficulty in all four zones comes not from keeping the beat or engaging a ""dance routine"" with specific enemy, but something totally irrelevant to rhythm. Zone 1 is difficult because the areas are cramped, Zone 2 is difficult because the areas are too wide open and the enemies are nimble, Zone 3 is difficult because of the ice/fire hazards, Zone 4 is difficult because it forces the player to edge along walls which are full of traps. Zone 4 is the only zone where I would actually say the player is free to engage in rythmic pattern without beng forced to go along a very distinct path, which is overshadowed by the zone's overwhelming number of brutal enemies and traps.Lastly--and this is runnng FAR against the grain here, I have not found a single person besides me that has this opinion: the music isn't actually that good. As far as it's intended purpose goes, anyway. Surpisingly, few of the tracks are particularly fast or even energetic. This leads to a lot of levels where, if you even care about the beat at all, you are stuck moving at a clumsy and slow rate. There is only one track in the game that has players move more than once per beat, and only one track in the game which has rests--both of which are the same track, King Konga. King Konga is by far the best boss in the game because he is not only the only boss which has irregular rhythm elements, but the only boss where your accordance with the rhythm actually matters. Death Metal has one of the fastest tracks in the game but it ends up being practically meaningless because the boss is so easy you could beat him without stepping in time even once.All in all this is quite a fun game but not really the ultimate rhythm/action hybrid I've been waiting for. Ironically the people I would reccomend this game most to are people that have don't have much interest in roguelikes or rhythm games, but like the ""idea"" of both. If there's some sort of update to the degree of randomization I think the game would be a tremendous platform for fangames--without actually touching the level editor, I actually think I could make levels far more interesting than some of the less fortunate randomizations I've seen. Some sort of compilation of levels made by hundreds of modders would be excellent.			"

								As a fan of both rhythm games and dungeon crawlers, I find Crypt of the NecroDancer as quite the diamond in the rough.  The rhythm component adds a dimension of gameplay that I find captivating.  It helps that the soundtrack rocks even if it is a bit synth-ey.Pros:* Replayability.  LOTS of replayability.* Challenge.  You MUST be able to think and plan quickly.* Soundtrack.  It rocks on its own, but the ability to use your own MP3s is brilliant.* Local co-op.  Player 1 uses the arrow keys, player 2 uses WASD. (I look forward to trying this mode.)Cons:* Challenge.  This game gets difficult quickly and can easily frustrate.* Graphics.  The graphics are pixel art.  Very well made pixel art, but it is a deterrent for some.			"

								I absolutely love this game: from the way the skeletons dance to the singing shopkeeper and amazing soundtrack! I would absolutely recommend it to anyone. I was hooked on this from the first moment I saw it, and 120+ hours later I'm still playing. If the rhythm aspect of it worries you, don't worry - the way the game is set up, the beat detection is forgiving and there is even a mode where rhythm is *not* a factor. This game is, as someone put it, ""easy to pick up but difficult to master."" You can learn how the game works fairly quickly, it takes a bit of time to get through all the Zones normally and unlock the items - but wait, there's more!! - there is a Daily Challenge, speedrun mode, Hardcore mode (requiring you to play through all levels with no upgrades and get to the last level without dying), and other challenge modes (Aria: 1 hit or miss a beat and you die; Bolt: everything is 2x speed). There is a huge amount of replay value, as the dungeon maps in this are randomly-generated and there is a wide variety of items (weapons, equipment, items, etc.) with a variety of effects. It's a different playthrough every single time. If that wasn't enough, you can even put your own MP3s into the game and play by just about any track you want, as long as it has a beat. I can't say enough good things about this game; if you are thinking about picking it up, you will not regret it! :)			"

												I'm so excited to finally be able to review this game post-launch!I pre-ordered Crypt of the NecroDancer back in 2013 when they started allowing people to do so, and I've been playing the alpha since it became available in April of 2014.It's a rhythm-based roguelike with some small measure of cross-play achievements (you unlock things as you progress in the game for future playthroughs in other modes), and while all items start identified (i.e., you always know what a scroll or weapon is, unlike a 'true' roguelike), their placements and whether or not they even show up is randomized.The dungeon randomization is great, and you can specify specific seeds if you want to share levels with other players or work on one specific layout, but where the game really shines -- and its purpose, really -- is the music.You can only move, attack, use items, cast spells, and anything else *on the beat*. Monsters also move on the beat, and they move in routinely predictable patterns so that over time you learn how to anticipate them and counter them, and in fact some monsters require you to learn these patterns and match the beat in order to even damage them. The skill cap is pretty high, the amount of replayability is immense (there are 9 playable characters and a 10th 'challenge' character, all of whom greatly alter the gameplay in different and interesting ways), and there's even a 'beatless' character that allows you to play the game like a traditional roguelike (monsters move when you do, and you're not forced to stick to the rhythm). And if you want a real challenge, you can even play on a dancepad...As someone who has been playing roguelikes ever since actually growing up playing Rogue, and who used to religiously follow rec.games.roguelike, I am so delighted to see an injection of 'newness' into the genre like NecroDancer. It's sorely needed, and while I doubt we'll ever see it emulated, I hope it inspires another developer to merge *their* love of two genres into something as incredibly engaging, challenging, and outright *fun* as this. I am so happy for Brace Yourself Games, and I'm so incredibly excited that this game has finally surfaced for others to experience and play. It's VERY good.			"

												Crypt of the NecroDancer is a roguelite game based on the ""bump to kill"" mechanic. Games based on it (e.g. Desktop Dungeons) are usually turn-based, focusing on the strategy and effective enemy killing. But necrodancing is different, everything is done in microturns - All actions (both yours and enemies's) have to be correlating with the soundtrack's rhythm. Each beat is a single action for every character.That makes the game pretty hard, especially in later levels - but it's definitely a pro for the game since I'm talking about roguelite game. This genre only deserves hard but fair difficulty. You have to deal with the press that requires you to feel the rhythm and remember specific dances of your enemies; you need to train proper dodges for each enemy and keep yourself concentrated (and if you don't, you'll can consider yourself dead in less than a minute).As I already mentioned, all attacking is done just by moving to enemy's place in the grid (to ""bump"" them). If you do that at the beat the enemy's ready to fight, you lose your health instead and you have to quickly reconsider your (necro)dancing. There are many pickups through all levels, you can find both melee or ranged weapons, spells, armor pieces, or other passive and consumable items. There're also two resources: Gold, used to buy items for your current run, and diamonds, which are used to unlock more items for your runs (in the game's menu). You might be scared about the controls for dancing, but they actually couldn't be more simple. All you need is arrow keys (or a dance pad), since you can only move in basic four directions on a grid. All spell casts and item uses are done by combinations of those keys, e.g. arrow up + arrow right to cast a fire spell.All levels have procedurally generated groups of enemies and rooms, that's nothing unique for roguelites, but I am really happy for secrets in Crypt of the NecroDancer. In most roguelite games I've played, secrets were mostly placed somewhere in level's corners but this game does something completely different - secrets are always somewhere near the level's center, that means you don't have to explore borders in each level to get an advantage. On the other hand, secrets can have many deadly enemies and traps, you have to be wary. Also, you can dig through all walls in every level (besides the border blocks), making your own way through the level!Talking about graphics, there's nothing to criticize. I love the precise pixelart design with sweet animation the game has! Since it's all about dancing, seeing every NPC to dance with the rhythm is truly satisfying. Soundtrack is amazingly well made, each level has its own song that has even more variations: There is a shopkeeper in every level, and when you'll be near him, you'll hear him sing to the current song. Also, there's a level that perfectly uses genre variations for a song - in hot parts full of lava you'll hear heavy metal, and in icy parts you'll hear electronic version of the same song. In the later levels (zone 4) the soundtrack isn't that good (for being more on the hard electronic genre, so it may be just my personal issue) and it's hard to move with the rhythm of the song properly. Considering everything about the game, I think it's rather another feature to bring the difficulty even higher near the end of the game.Conclusion:Crypt of the NecroDancer comes with an unique idea for a roguelike game; to change casual turn-based strategy into rhythm driven game. This change may seem small, but it makes the game distinct, harder and much more entertaining! The game also have a lot of replayability for all achievements (which are hard to unlock), so don't expect getting just few hours of gameplay from it if you want to get everything. Add great pixelart graphics and perfect soundtrack (mandatory for a rhythm game) and there's nothing to stop me from recommending it to you. It's great! Now let me go ""necrodance"" a bit more, I haven't got enough yet.			"

								Crypt is a dungeon crawler, but with a twist. That twist being moving to the beat of awesome electronic music by the amazing Danny Brananowsky (Who also worked on Binding of Issac's and Super Meat Boy's music, so have high expectations.)...No literally, you MOVE to the beat. So do the monsters. That's what I like about this game, you got to keep with the rhythm of the game while you're simultaniously exploring the cave and seeing what you can get. It's two genres I couldn't think be combined, but it works beautifully. You have entities like health, and item slots for armor and weapon and magic, etc. However, the whole gameplay is composed of moving around to the soundtrack. It's exciting keeping your mind on two things at once, and mastering it in the end. Enemies all have their own movement patterns according to the music, so you're not the only one that has to deal with the beat. I must admit it's very exhilirating to learn every little bit of enemy movement, and gracefully going through the dungeon with the head bopping tunes in your head.However, if you wanna add your own music to the mix, you can! Any MP3 file you have can be implimented in the game. Experiment, and see what you get.Overall, this game is tons of fun, and is looking to be one of my favorite indie games out there. I'm not even that big a fan of dungeon crawlers, but I'm a sucker for rhythm games. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a good, repetitive time.			"

								I've been holding off on getting this game, because of the Early Access issues.But it was on my wishlist and a friend gifted it to me.I'm very glad they did!  I've sunk... just over 7 hours into it the last couple of days.  I'm not great at rhythm, but it is very forgiving (don't spam directions and you will be fine).All you need is the arrow keys, I don't think I've used anything else (well, WASD for multiplayer).the music is great, the sprites are cute and easy to differentiate.  Each enemy has a different pattern you have to learn.  RNG dungeons, with Rogue-like difficulty.  You find/buy different hardware in the dungeons, but those reset; note there are some permabuffs you can buy outside of the dungeon with gems.  No microtransaction busslhit though, those are all bought with stuff found in-game.Multiple characters to use with different attributes (one you don't need to have a beat to use), daily challenge, hardcore run mode... lots of stuff to do.  I keep replaying the first three dungeon types (because I can't beat the third one, derp!).Anyways... yes.  This game is in a good state, most other devs would have officially released it by now.

The soundtrack from Danny B. is exceptionally great and you can even switch between it, a more rousing electronic cover soundtrack and a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome metal one! And if you have no taste in great music, simply use your own stuff.The game is easy to learn but freaking hard to master, using only 4 keys. If you like to move it, move it, just grab a Dancepad and get it on!There are so many characters with unique bits of story and a complete different gameplay, many enemies, bosses, unlockable items, EVERYTHING!You haven't hit the purchase button yet?

Early Access Review
								Originally posted on KaboomShark. I was almost instantly intrigued by Crypt of the NecroDancer. It’s a roguelike that’s played to the rhythm of whatever song is currently playing in the level. Being a fan of dungeon crawlers in general, this rather ingenious spin on the genre got me interested. On the bottom of the screen is a heart with animated bars getting closer and closer. It’s like a simpler Guitar Hero; jump to the beat of the heart to keep your coin multiplier from depleting. If you’re attacked, you’ll lost the multiplier. Aside from things trying to kill you, traps in the environment will also try to ruin this multiplier. If you fall in a puddle your multiplier will be lost. Spike traps will injure you, trapdoors will send you to different areas in the level, sometimes surrounded by monsters, other times you are greeted by a singing merchant who will sell you armor, food to heal, weapons, anything useful. You’ll earn money by killing monsters such as skeletons, bats, ghosts, even monkeys.You start every playthrough with a dagger, shovel, and a bomb. Chests will drop larger blades, crossbows, armor, and more items once you’ve unlocked them with diamonds. Diamonds are scattered throughout the map, sometimes hidden in walls that can be dug up using a shovel. Items found in chests can also be purchased from the aforementioned singing merchant.Levels are divided into four zones. At the end of every zone, there will be a mini-boss (often a dragon) that needs to be killed in order for the stairs to the next level to unlock. However, if you wait around in a level for too long, the song that’s playing will end and you’ll be dropped to the next level. This is similar to the ghost that is sent after you in Spelunky when you’ve spent a long time in one level. Or like the music that’s used to cut actors off during their acceptance speeches when they’re boring. Whatever floats your boat. I mean, the game allows you to use your own MP3 files, so you could totally kill monsters to the Oscars’ “get off the stage” music.Characters can sometimes be found locked in cages. If you haven’t found the key in a chest prior, there’s a good chance the merchant will have one on sale. Once these characters are unlocked, a new room will unlock in the lobby. These rooms contain practice courses and shops. You can use the diamonds you collected in your last playthrough to purchase upgrades and new items that will show up in chests. Also in the lobby is where you’ll find the entrances to zones, different game modes like Hardcore or an easier mode with fewer enemies, local co-op, character select, and more. Unlockable characters carry different abilities, such as Bard, who can move freely and not to the rhythm of a song. He’s a great character to use to take a break from the rhythm-based combat of Cadence, the story’s frontliner. Though there isn’t much of a story; it’s all set up in the opening cutscene, featuring Cadence falling into a dungeon and being taken over by the NecroDancer. Which would explain why she’s tasked to move to the beat of a song.The VerdictThere isn’t much I could dislike about this game. I would totally understand your feelings if you dislike dungeon crawlers; it’s a love it or hate it situation. Crypt of the NecroDancer is available now for $14.99 on Steam. It can be played with a controller, keyboard, and even a DDR pad. If you dislike the genre, it’s likely you’ll dislike this rhythmic take on it. If you’re like me and enjoy roguelikes that put your persistence to the test, chances are you’ll enjoy it, maybe even love it. Hell I’m already addicted.			"

								Every move is on the beat, every move is a tiny puzzle!  You gotta know each enemy's pattern, know where they will move next beat, and make lighting quick decisions in order to survive.  This game gets bonus points for solving the traditional turn-based roguelike conundrum of how to implement local multiplayer.  Co-op FTW!So many game modes, but I play this game everyday for the procedurally generated daily challenges.  So addictive!			"

Early Access Review
								Crypt of the NecroDancer is the most unique and replayable rogue-like I've ever played. For years, people have been mixing rogue-like with many different genres. 2D platformers, Real-time strategy, dungeon-crawling, there's been all kinds of hybrids. But this mixture really blows the rest away. A rogue-like, with rhythm? At first, it might sound ridiculous. It might sound like it would never work. But, Brace Yourself Games made it work. And boy, did they make it work. Think of Crypt as a Mystery Dungeon game. A turn-based over the head dungeon crawler. That is basically what it is. The turns are every beat in the music, and both you and the enemies move each beat. The soundtrack was specifically made to have an easy to keep beat, and the visuals at the bottom of the screen guide you as well. If you've had any kind of experience with rhythm, from playing Osu on insane to tapping your foot to your favorite song, you should have no problem easing yourself in. Don't let that make you think the game is easy, though. The rhythm is just the tip of the iceberg. Learning how the enemies move and attack is what really makes this game lovingly abuse you like other rogue-likes.So, I'm sure there's a couple of people reading this who just can't keep a beat. Hey, I'm not judging. I'm sure you have your reasons. But, if that is the case, good news! There is a character unlocked from the beginning that doesn't use the rhythm mechanic. Everything just moves when you do, and you can experience everything the game has to offer with that character. So, really, if you're a fan of the rogue-like genre, there is no reason not to give this game a try.+ Nicely done pixel art, characters are colorful and easy to identify+ Tons of unique items and enemies that keep every run fresh+ There's a boss that's literally a chess board+ Rhythm is a simple and fun mechanic, not an annoying gimmick+ Special character unlocked from the start for those who can't keep a beat+ Very active devs, big updates come out every few weeks+++ An amazing soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky, composer for Super Meat Boy and the original Binding of Isaac+ Add in your own MP3s if you're a weirdo who doesn't like the soundtrack+/- Simple, four button controls. Activating items usually means pressing two buttons at once, which can be a bit weird sometimes. These controls can be changed in the options, however.- Bit of a high learning curve. Playing individual zones with upgrades is far easier than playing through the entire game starting with only three hearts and a dagger.- Still in early access. You'll probably find some minor bugs, (nothing gamebreaking) some items/characters are still being added, and the final level is yet to be released.Overall, Crypt of the NecroDancer in an amazing game and I recommend that you buy it. Yeah, yeah, it's in Early Access, but the game is already enjoyable. I mean, just look at my play time. If Early Access really bothers you THAT much, then just wait. They're planning on getting the game out sometime in the next few months.			"

IntroductionThe Crypt of the NecroDancer is a very unique addition to the genre of rogue-like games. Never before a game like this has been seen in the gaming industry which combines the elements of a dungeon crawler and rhythm-based gameplay that is produced with such quality and immersiveness.GameplayIn this game, you are forced to move to the beat of the soundtracks (except for one character) where the tempo of each beat is shown by the meter on the bottom part of the screen and will vary depending on the track being played. Violating this rule will reduce your multiplier to the lowest set value (though the permanent upgrade addition will still persist), and is also the same if you were to take damage. Players are able to build this up by landing successful hits to an enemy and is kept level by staying on the beat.After every session on any mode (either by clearing the zone or by dying), the items and coins you gained will be removed and reset back to your default equipment except for ""diamonds"", which is used for certain upgrades/locks/unlocks to various NPCs in the game lobby.  The game modes are basically divided into two, separate zones and all-zones mode. The only difference with either mode is that the upgrades that you have bought are only present on separate zones and that the player is required to play through zone 1 to 4 on all-zones mode for it to be cleared.The ProsExcellent Audio - As a rhythm game, the audio should be flawless and on-spot to the theme as it is the genre's main attribute, and this is a perfect example to it. The soundtracks may vary depending on the stage the player is in or by the character they are using (which are remixed tracks of the original version, for example, playing as Aria will play the metal version of the tracks).Large Array of Playable Characters and Game Modes - This standard element of every session-based game is also present, in which it gives longevity and versatility to the game play. These new characters can be unlocked by clearing zones, and each and everyone of them have their own perks as well as rules and restrictions (aside from the default unlocked characters) to follow. Violating these rules will result in immediate death if you don't have an item that could save you.   High Replay Value - A sign of a great game is that it will always have you longing for another round even if you failed miserably or even rage-quitted. May it be from the satisfaction of clearing a difficult zone or unlocking achievements or revisiting your favorite tracks, a game with a high replay value makes the money you spent on it worthwhile.Steam Integration - From the very helpful Steam Cloud feature up to the Steamworks' additional mods that you can add, this is great for those people who wants to spice the game up more and modify it to match their taste.The ConsRepetitive Audio - Given the nature of rogue-likes, you will die and restart the levels more than you would like to and this means that you will be forced the hear the soundtracks of each floor again and again. Supposedly, this is only minus if the soundtracks of the game are bad (which is not the case in here), but still I would like to cover all bases for those who are interested in buying the game.Immense Difficulty Levels - By no means that this is a BAD thing, BUT if you are a casual player who enjoys more of a relaxing game play or just aren't good at playing the game or has bad body coordination, then this game MIGHT not be for you (though it doesn't mean that you shouldn't give it a try). Honestly, I am bad at this game that I could only clear levels with Bard (which is easy-mode) and barely with the other characters.Final ThoughtsThis game is the fruit of undeniable passion and love of the developers, and indeed is a masterpiece of its own genre to be said at the very least. Also, if you are a fan of games with great soundtracks, you won't make a mistake buying this!

								I'll likely update this review as I go, but I want to post my first thoughts about the game: AWESOME!It's done right in every way that you can think about mixing a rhythm and rogue-like game. Using your own songs adds a lot to the already great gameplay. It's not easy, but you learn about enemy patterns pretty quickly and unlocking more loot makes it much easier. Already a really interesting and fun to play game and it's still in alpha.Fully recommended to support it by buying it now :)			"

The good+Amazing gameplay concept: a real-time combat dungeon crawler ruled by music beats+Superb soundtrack. Danny Baranowsky produces yet another gem - you might find yourself head bobbing +Great artistic direction - all monsters are easily identifiable, readable, and just plain nice to look at. Bosses' designs are musical themed, which is a nice touch+Numerous playable characters with diferent playstyles. Several of the unlockables play quite differently from the main character, which adds to both gameplay variety and replay value+Superbly balanced difficulty. It's entirely possible to play the game without picking any items nor taking damage, and the game does not feel draggy while at it there's even a character built around these characteristics. +Practice modes, and beginner help. These are small details but they are quite handy and they make the game better+Really cheap considering it's replay valueThe bad-The game itself feels lighthearted and fun, while in contrast the cutscenes try to add a dramatic storyline. They seem like an afterthought (you can disable them - that's a +!)-Some inconsistencies at the highest difficultiesThe bottom lineA finely crafted rhythm-based dungeon crawler with great soundtrack, uncommon gameplay and good challenge and replay value			"

												This is the most impressive rogue-like I have ever played.  CoND beautifully integrates tile based combat with music.  Each turn lasts for a beat of the current level's song, leading to fun, fast paced action.  Even during early access it felt like a complete game, and the full release is a masterpiece.The controls are easy and straighforward, requiring only the arrow keys to play.  The graphics are simple but well made.  The music is great.  The soundtrack was composed by Danny B, and each song is edited masterfully into the game.  CoND lets you use your own music for the levels, but I have never done it because I love the core soundtrack so much.  Despite hearing the songs hundreds of times, I never get tired of them.The various weapons and equipment provide a wide variety of play styles and item interactions.  The enemies are well designed, each with varying movement and attack mechanics.  The boss fights are unique and wonderful experiences.  Each one is musically themed, and the varying musical styles reinforces the awesomeness of the game's music.There is a very large amount of content and replayability.  Between items, enemies, and floor layouts, there is a lot of variation between runs.  There are high score and fastest time leaderboards which are very competitive, and people frequently race the game live.  CoND can be very difficult at first because you have to learn each weapon's mechanics and each enemy's attack patterns, but there are many tutorial and training mechanisms built into the game.  Practicing is well worth the time, and mastering the game is very rewarding.I recommend this game to anyone.  It is an absolute must play if you like rogue-likes or music based games.			"

												By far my favorite Early Access title thus far. Crypt of the Necrodancer (CotN) should be given a ton of credit for pitching a title that perfectly melds rouge-lites and rhythm-based gameplay.The main mechanic revolves around moving and attacking to the beat of the music and failing to even miss one beat results in a multiplier reset, which altogether works very well. CotN also deserves points in the style department; enemies dance, the floor lights up when the multiplier is up, and the shopkeeper sings along during the high points of the songs. Even though the game retains many rogue-like tropes, it truly separates itself from others with the way it was designed. Music is absolutely stellar (composer of the original Super Meat Boy). Controls are intuitive (you only need the four-directional arrows!).Like in Rogue Legacy, you can unlock equipment after each subsequent run if you have enough crystals (which you can find after each level). The lobby serves as a way to access this content. Here you can also find individual monster training rooms and various other modes like Hardcore or Daily Challenges. For the price, it's definitely worthy of the admission. If you're either a fan of rhythm or rogue-like games, this is without a doubt a must-have.			"

												Arguably the best rhythm game of the decade. This game is incredibly hard, but the difficulty comes from the pace it demands you make decisions, not from complicated mechanics. As a result, it's nearly always your fault when you die, and there's a huge amount of room for you to get better.Once you beat the game, you can replay it with other characters, which have different gameplay styles which requires you to remaster the game with their play style.And, of course, it has great music, which is mandatory for an excellent rhythm game. And it comes in several remixed flavors, which keeps it from getting stale.			"

												There are some games where you think to yourself ""I could have thought of that"" and other games where you think ""Wow, why didn't I think of that?"".  Crypt of the NecroDancer is none of those.  I don't think anyone would have thought to put a rogue-like rpg into a rhythm based game.  But it works, oh does it work so wonderfully well.The first level you will be trying your damndest to get a rhythm going but once you spend enough time you will be slashing up enemies while setting up others for a nicely timed fireball blast from afar.  And all the while it feels so satisfying when you progress.The controls are near flawless as well.  As you die multiple times, over and over and over, you never feel the need to blame the game for being cheap or unresponsive control but instead you know its your fault.  I always felt this was a sign of a great designed game, such as in Rogue Legacy or Super Meat boy.Don't even wait for this game to go on sale, buy it and, hell, buy it for a friend.  It's that good.			"

												Everything about this game is just perfection. Two Genres that would never have worked together, and yet it does, and beautifully at that. For a game like this, the music will play a huge part of the quality of the game, and I think Danny B really outdid himself with this. I just can't stop listening to the soundtrack, and then on top of that, we now have 2 alternative albums to listen to!Gameplay is equally fantastic. Every enemy has their own movements to the beat. And it's down to you to figure out how to beat each enemy. Every Zone has a different set of enemies, and the difficulty increases nicely with each zone. The bosses are some of the most clever and innovative bosses I have ever seen in a game. They fit so well with the game, and they still function in fun and unique ways. I mean one of the bosses is basically an entire chess set! Best part is, every single piece moves just like they do in real chess. This game is definitely a contender to be a GOTY for me. It's addictive, it's fun, and the fact you have the choice to have your own music, the mod support, the variety of characters and the ease of changing soundtracks just shows how much effort and detail these guys have put in to the game. I just can't recommend this enough. Take note all you aspiring devs, this is Early Access done right.			"

Early Access Review
								My god, this game is great. You would never expect a rhythm-dungeon crawler combo to ever work, but boy does it. I like to put games into two categories: Games with ""Behind the scenes"" devs, who make a great game but stay in the background; and active devs, who update their game frequently, respond to reviews, etc. Necrodancer falls into the second category. The premise of this game is a dungeon crawler roguelike where you move to the beat. All enemies move to the beat of the Danny B. music (who also wrote music for Super Meat Boy and Binding of Isaac), and learning the enemy patterns (which include moving every beat, or moving up and down every other beat) is vital to your survival. You find items to improve your survivability in shops and chests, with items including rings that add effects or better weapons like longswords. You start with a dagger, which you want to try to replace as fast as possible, because it sucks for combat. All weapons also come in better qualities, like blood, which heals you for a half heart after you kill 10 enemies, or titanium which does 2 damage as opposed to the one damage most weapons do. The game has three bosses, which each come with their own great song and are actually quite challenging. Necrodancer is being updated VERY frequently, and it's really a blast, even in early access.This game has freaking singing shopkeepers. Just buy it. PS: Check out one of the boss songs here "

												This entire game is just a pure joy to play, over and over and over again.  Even incomplete, the available game is extremely satisfying to go for increasingly flawless runs with the beautiful music and very fair randomization.  Even if you have a ""poor"" run (being a ""roguelike"") it's all dependent on your skill, as there is absolutely no guaranteed damage done to your character - the only time you may get hurt if is you make a wrong move.The enemies are varied enough, the random generation is -usually- never rediculous, the item choices are unique and feel very meaningful and dramatic, you can set your own difficulty with different characters (from the no-rhythm-required Bard to the insanely hardcore Aria that is limited to the starting dagger and half a heart and losing rhythm kills you instantly), your own music can be uploaded and danced to, the pixelated aesthetic is very well-done and doesn't come off as tacky...Worth every dollar, and I even got it on sale.  I'd pay full price for this, easily.  Also, as a warning, the songs are -extremely- infectious and I will find myself humming a random song throughout the day and I often wake up each day with one of the songs running through my head.EDIT:  Just wanted to say the release version of this game is beyond legendary.  The 4th zone absolutely blew my mind, some of the music got noticably polished up, the cutscenes are cool, there's actually a damn transition between levels now, the escape menu got a border... there's a lot of love in this game and I appreciate every ounce of it.

												As strange as overview of this game sounds, it is actually one of the best games in 3 categories: Roguelike, Rhythm Games and games that were in Early Access.Pros:Even with typical roguelike RNG involved, every battle is winnable. It can be walk in the park, or run on a thin edge of a blade, but still, there's always a way to win.Every playthrough is different in terms of enemies you meet, map and items.Most of the items have both good and bad side - what saves you in one situation can lead you to death in another.Soundtrack - if you know Danny, there's nothing else to add, all of his works are brilliant, and this one isn't an exception.Characters - each of them is actually unique, and will totally change the way you play.Rhythm - you don't actually need to always follow it(with SOME secretly secret exception), but following the rhythm is rewarded in many different ways.Cons:Some characters are incredibly hard(think Blue Baby/Lost from BoI:Rebirth), but you knew it wasn't an easy game,right?Learning enemies movesets is necessary for winning, and takes trial and error. Luckily, you can unlock special training grounds that let you kill them until you are sure you mastered all the ways of eliminating them.Overall, the game is fantastic. Strongly recommended for people who are even barely interested in music games or roguelikes.			"

												There are quite a few things to like about Crypt of the NecroDancer, and there's no question that it is the result of having an interesting crazy idea and running with it - and I love seeing game writers taking risks and doing crazy interesting stuff.But.  This just doesn't work for me.  I'm probably not really the target audience - I have never gotten into the rhythm/dance games at all, and am now probably a bit old and just not generally able to slip into the ""zone"" when playing.Playing the game 'properly', with the beat (not as Bard) is frequently just too chaotic and confusing - particularly when starting out with this constant time pressure (not just the urgency of keeping to the beat, but also knowing there's only a limited amount of time until the song ends and you get forcibly moved on).  I frequently couldn't work out what items were - reading the text was problematic at times, and if I'd picked something up that I didn't already know I found it quite difficult to work out what I had picked up and what to do with it.Playing as Bard (not the default for a Newbie, and I understand why because it doesn't really represent the 'core experience' of the game) sort of solved a lot of this - the time pressure is removed so you can spend as long as you need to look at items and play around with them and learn the enemy behaviour.  But playing as Bard is just dull for the most part.  Removing that core mechanic does drain the game of any particular interest.  I thought it would make sense to play as Bard enough to learn what I needed to learn and then go back in with the beat to enjoy the game, but frankly it just didn't hold enough appeal to do this.The music is great.  The graphics are ok.  The roguelike stuff is ok, although the upgrade system is a bit thin, a bit poorly implemented and a bit ... I don't know, just patchy.  Not enough richness to make it feel worth crawling through the dungeon again and again like a good dungeon crawler does.And there are bugs.  Playing on Windows it just dumped me out of the game every other hour or so.  Not such a big deal, but not great.  And a few possibly deliberate gameplay choices that seem like bugs - the mimics that reveal themselves when you stand next to them, but are still counted as ""fail"" moves to attack until you take a step and get them to move off their square.  It's sitting right there pulsating, I know I need to kill it, but you just fail me for swinging at it?  Minor, but annoying nonetheless.I think there are people who will enjoy this, but it frustrated me too often for too little reward and too little motivation to keep playing.			"

												-Insert obvious positive points on the graphic and soundtrack--Insert good recommendation for the majority that probably played this game and are looking for validation that the game is good--Insert remarks on how sloppy the structure of this review is and how it's painted in darkness-Ultimately, the question that matters most is:Is Crypt of the necrodancer enjoyable for me?As with all games, not everyone will enjoy this. In fact, even a rouge-like lover might not like this due to it's vastly different playstyle.The biggest turnoff that could ruin one's enjoyment is that the game is largely trial and error. There is almost zero chance of recovering from a mistake in a boss fight and this will end your run. While common in rougelikes, the bosses in this game are unforgiving. Any new enemy you encounter is and will (probably) kill you. It is nigh impossible to complete the game without knowing how to deal with them.Fortunately, there is a practice dungeon that allows you to figure out how to deal with these obstacles. That said, (your experience) how frustrating this game gets depend whether or not you choose and have the patience to use this feature.Spend an hour or two practising against all mini-boss/bosses should you get this game. There are other minor qualms about the game but overall, it was a great experience and the design of certain enemies are ingenious.Note: There is a character (Bard) that would make the game much easier due to the removal of time pressure imposed by the rhythms and changes the game into a turn-based strategic one but the point above stands firm. Because this removes a core element of the game (the rhythimic pressure), it becomes just another rouge adventure and you will not be playing the same game that is advertised.The game itself is fairly short and is broken into four (4x4) zones and there is a notable difficulty spike in the latter zones. The approach to beating each level is vastly different. The upside? You are allowed to skip zones after beating them once.Zone 1 and 2 allows you to take things slow. -Kiting-Zone 3 forces you to manage and balance the different skill sets the enemies have and take the pre-emptive strike before you are swarmed. (Bad RNG can happen in this zone so be prepared for frustration.)Zone 4 requires fast planning and twitchy reflexes.-------------TL:DR-------------Shuffle and boogie to da beat like your bootie in da heat dancing cha-cha  in the crypt. And here we go! Forward backward rock-step, side together side rock-step~ ConclusionGreat game, not for everyone. If you have twitchy reflexes, patience practising, like strategy (more so chess as opposed to RTS) and rouge-like games, this is the game for you!Otherwise, grab the game on sale for a taste of this unique masochistic hybrid.

								Dont let the Early Access tag scare you. Game has a great amount of content to keep you occupied right now and with hardcore mode, which you can liken to doing a full run in Spelunky without taking shortcuts, will keep you satiated for a good long time. A few high points that are worth mentioning, you can play with your own music tracks, the controls are fully rebindable, the game is all about skill which makes it very satisfying to pull off combos properly, there is no gear checks or artificial barriers to gameplay. SImply put if you are able to perfectly execute it, you can go through the entire game with the weakest weapon without any problems.			"

								I loved this game! It's really challenging, but not to the point of frustration. The graphics are beautiful with vibrant colors, and the soundtrack is so great that I didn't even wanted to change to my own songs to play (which is one of the features of the game).It can be a little bit unfair sometimes, though. There were times where I would appear in a level already surrounded by enemies with no room to fight them. Maybe it's common in rogue-like games, I'm not really used to the genre, but I think maybe there would be some more room since defeating enemies depend on the space you have to make the moves. Is not something that disturbs the game experience, though, and it gave me some more hours trying to finish the dungeons.I really recommend it!			"

Hope to play to the rhythm of my playlists in this game soon.Expect to die quite a bit/a lot because the dance moves of the enemies are just so... enchanting~ (haha!)

								Do not be fooled or alarmed by the Early-Access tag. This game is worth getting as it is. The developers dish out updates constantly, even if it's just a little bug fix.Crypt of the NecroDancer combines Rogue-Like Elements with Rythm-Based gameplay to make up for one hell of a game. It's an 'easy to learn, hard to master' type of game that promises many hours of entertainment. The game consists as of this moment of 3 Zones (with 3 floors or levels each), a Hardcore Mode (in which you have to beat all 3 zones in a row), a Level Editor, 5 playable characters (each of which has a different trait!) and even a Steam-Workshop for User-Created content. The music is simply amazing (as expected of Danny B.). And the best part: You can play to your own music!Like in every good Rogue-Like game, every run is randomized, but thanks to the way the game is played, even a hardcore run can be completed with the most basic equipment if you have enough practice. A run usually doesn't take that long, so it's good for a bit of fun in between as much as it is to play the game to death. Just give your brain a moment of rest from time to time.What are you still reading this for?! Get in there and start to deliver some beatdowns to the beat!			"

								Crypt Of The NecroDancer is my ultimately favorite rogue-like. You have to move to the beat while killing various enemies which can be very hard. If you make one stupid mistake, then you are screwed. The good thing is, ALL the deaths are YOUR fault-I still haven't had any crashes whatsoever. This game is infinitely replayable, with daily challenges and hardcore mode. This game does NOT hold your hand, you will be fighting and fighting for days to complete just zone 1. There is basically no tutorial but to figure out the patterns of the enemies you can unlock the ( I don't remember who he is called ). I rate this game 8/8 because it's great			"

												Basically, this game is a pretty standard dungeon crawler - you open doors, buy or find items, genociding all on your way to save your father. The only major difference is - you doing it in rhythm.And all the sudden it's not so easy anymore. You need to always move (and keep moving in rhythm, because this time the world won't wait for you to stand and think), which make this a hella lot more dynamic game that any other crawlers. While you move, you need to analyse you opponents to catch them when they can't attack you. And when there are more, than 3 different enemies after your rebellious teenager proantagonist's behinds - thats when your brain thingy is starting to work like it's a math exam.The design is great, the stylistics are creative and really using the theme of music (even if it's leading to the most obnoxious pun-born creatures), and the music...Well, you can't make a game about music without a good music? And Danny Baranowsky definitely did his best here. It's versatile and complements the overall atmosphere of the levels. Yeah, some of the music is more dull than the other (I'm not a big fan of 2 stage, for example), but when it kicks♥♥♥♥♥- it kicks it really hard. Definitely go check it out, even if you not going to buy the game. You just might find something you like. At least this is how I found out about this game and what caused me to buy it.The only real downside is - there are not that much replayability, at least for me. It has a lot of characters with different playstyles, some of which require as much time to beat the game, as the main campaing itself, but the varity of rougelike elements within the game is not that big. Sooo... be aware? Also the story is kinda cheesy, but it's not the game about telling a good story.And so you have it - it's a fast, engaging and pretty hard game, where you throw out all you dungeon crawlers knowlege and dance around the mecriant, trying to deside, do you want that glass spear or not.

								Before I say anything else, I'd like to point you towards this 7-minute review of Crypt of the NecroDancer on my channel. It condenses everything you need to know into what I hope is a very concise and informative video, so do give it a quick view if you're thinking of buying the game.


YouTube™ Video: 7-Minute Review :: Crypt of the NecroDancer! 

			Views: 149		

			Crypt of the NecroDancer Website: http://necrodancer.com/ ~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~ Welcome to OddyC's series of 7-minute reviews, where he attempts with all his might to condense everything he knows...		

For those to whom it appeals, rest assured that Crypt of the NecroDancer is something unique, beautiful and hilarious. I've never found such a good substitute for sleep in all my life. It's made me laugh many times since I bought it, and it's more than lived up to my expectations. It's a seriously great game that seems confident in its own abilities and rightly so.Studying and countering the attack patterns of each enemy you encounter is unbelievably rewarding. For most people, you'll start the game throwing yourself into a roomful of monsters and watching with fascination as you get utterly demolished. But the game relies on its own addictive nature to keep you playing, because the more you play, and the more you die, the more you learn how to stay alive for the next time.Rather than just repeating what I say in the video, I urge you to watch it and leave you with these remarks in summary:There is very little in this game that is not a reason to buy it. The gameplay, the variation, the creativity, the music - oh, god, the music - all of it is just astoundingly well-done.The game doesn't feel like it's in Early Access. Aside from the couple of features not yet programmed in, such as the full selection of characters to play as, everything is as polished as you'd hope the finished game would be.Despite dying more times than I care to count, I have yet to feel frustrated with the game. And I can get quite easily frustrated with games that kill me a lot. But with NecroDancer, I'm only ever frustrated with myself, for not quite moving fast enough, or panicking at a crucial moment. In a world of unfair gaming experiences, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a beacon of light that invites to you blame yourself, rather than the game!Yes, the game is challenging. Despite having played it long enough to know the attack patterns of most monsters in the game, the monsters frequently - shockingly often, in fact - get the better of me. It's not just a matter of learning the game. Thanks to the fast-paced rhythm aspect, it's instead a matter of calling upon your knowledge at a moment's notice, and staying calm even at the sight of a minotaur charging towards you, or a red dragon preparing to unleash fiery chaos upon you in the next half a second.The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in a game.There is simply nothing to criticise - at least, nothing apart from the most minor issues, such as monsters occasionally getting in each other's ways and forcing each other to remain stationary until you kill them. But that rarely happens, and it's certainly nothing even close to a game-breaking issue - it's just a quirk of the game. And seeing as it's still in Early Access, I'm surprised that's the only one I can think of!Closing remarks: Crypt of the NecroDancer is amazing. One of the most flawless games I've ever played. If it appeals to you then buy it. You will not be disappointed, I guarantee it. "

Early Access Review
[early access - review]As an avid musician and part time gamer, Crypt of the NecroDancer was a ""have to"" buy for me. The idea of incorporating music as the mode for a metronomic gameplay system was intriguing. After finally getting this loaded up, I thought for sure that I had an advantage in this game given that I've honed my own internal metronome for nearly a quarter century and my gaming skills for nearly 3 decades but little did I know that this game puts a whole new meaning into the expression ""beat down."" To elaborate on that further frankly, I got beat down to the down beat.With NecroDancer, it takes more than just timing and gaming experience to survive, as this is a calculated, quick-witted, speed chess match and really is not a game you are going to get far in if you are distracted or not all in to it. The sound track is great and is one of the biggest reasons (for me anyways) to play this game. Being that I am a musician, my rig is setup with an audio controller and studio monitors, so that I can pump out some decibels and at high volumes this game sounds even better! If you don't have a decent sound setup, a good pair of headphones is crucial. The sound track has a wide range musical styles from the trancey-technoish electronic, chillin mellow reggae-ish, flowing hip hop beats, beatnik jazzy swing, to the grinding heavy metal; all of which is synthesized and composed sequencing. This is understandable considering the game play is tempo driven, though from a musicians point of view, some music wasn't meant to be synthesized and even though musically it is written well, the metal doesn't feel right. A minor gripe. Regardless, every style has a lot of energy with a beat that really delivers the tempo when playing. My last gripe, though petty, I think a little more could be done with the sound effects during gameplay to incorporate them into the music a little cleaner, being that attacks and movement must be done on beat. It is still early access, so we'll see.   There are 2 things that bothered me about this game. One I can look past and most people do not mind the uncontemporized 8-bit graphics but I'm hoping there is a little bit more updating to set it aside from the rest (again, early access). My other issue I had was perplexing and that was the controls. After calibrating to compensate for the latencies, I went to the options to personalize my joystick controls. The devs offer a lot of options in this screen, which is nice, but they have controls labeled 'Combo: Up + Down', 'Combo: Left + Right', 'Combo: Up + left', etc... that you assign to a button. What? This was confusing at first. Well, turns out that these are for using items and using some menu functions. It gives the controls an additional method by using both the movement combinations as well as assigning it to a button. This gives a huge advantage for using a keyboard over a joystick. I also found that when using the keyboard, it was much easier to keep the timing, as though it felt more ""instrumenty' than the joystick. My last gripe about the controls is that they are not actually ""full controller supported"" as stated on the store page. Stick 2 on my 360 controller could not be assigned controls during setup. Oh well, I like the keyboard more for this game anyways! The gameplay is simple. Using the directionals, you move and attack on beat. The enemies will too, though they all do not move the same manner or count and as I mentioned earlier, this really makes it more of a speed chess match. If you are in the wrong square, miss a beat, or move incorrectly, it could mean game over. This adds a whole new dimension of difficult and for those of you that cannot keep a beat there are additional modes, like turn based, so even the musically challenged can enjoy this game. There are a lot of power ups and items available, though at the moment doesn't exactly feel ""rouge-like"" just yet but I'm sure that'll change. There are also a multitude of in game mutations that ramp the difficulty level up significantly. Even without them, this game is hard, which should appeal to anyone who likes a challenge in gaming.*Also note: do not expect a huge amount of content out of the box, at this stage in early access there are few levels offered in Crypt of the NecroDancer. At the moment 4 levels consisting of 3 stages and a boss level. (I'll update this review as the developers do... can't get enough of this game) There is also a daily challenge, though I'm not sure why these resources are not allocated to coding, sprites, music, sound, etc... OverviewGameplay: Music Driven Rogue-Like.
Graphics: 8-bit. They are okay but would like to see them a little more contemporized.
Sound: Sound Track is Phenomenal (by gaming standards)! Sound effects are good but again, I'd like to hear them mixed in on tempo with the music, making them one and the same.
Controls: Great with a keyboard. Though, as of now it’s a little disappointing with a controller but still decent. 
Replayability: Yes. The addition of seeding gives this game a ton of potential. 
Overall: 8/10 – Though it is nothing to scoff at, once new features, updates, and fixes are implemented; I'm sure this rating will be much higher in Crypt of the NecroDancer's fully released state. 
The element of music and gameplay make this a great game and one that I truly enjoy. I recommend this to everyone and is a must buy for anyone who likes musically driven games.			"

												Wow all I can say is Wow...Crypt of the Necrodancer is one of those gems where you can tell the guys and gals creating this had tons of fun, with original gameplay, an amazing soundtrack ( if you don't like a dance mix, then put in your own MP3's) and bright colourful graphics that give this game flair. This game is not easy, especially in the beginning, but it intergrates rouge-lite mechanics and an upgrade system that never feels overpowered, when a player dies, you know its your own fault the player must learn the patterns to enemies to be able to succeed and cannot rely on items, for those crazy enough there is a hardcore mode in which the player cannot use any of the upgrades they obtained in running through the game.

Early Access Review
								NecroDancer is an instant classic, and one of few games where Early Access is ABSOLUTELY worth it. The game is addicting and pretty much complete, and the updates keep coming hard and fast, bringing more and more variety and fun to the table.The gameplay feels complete, looks, sounds and feels great and is immediately addicting. Replayability is available aplenty via custom music, roguelike-characteristic difficulty, replays, leaderboards (for gold score and speedrun time, respectively), unlockables and a hardcore mode with optional seeds input.The only missing feature is a zone; there's 3 zones à 3 levels right now, which are plenty to bite your nails out already. Other than that, all that's left to be added are simply optional bonuses; more variety and options, of which there already exist a lot. This is legitimately the only Early Access game I can recommend and say ""get this right now"". The amazing music won't let you go for a while, you'll find yourself doing other stuff to the NecroDancer beat... that's how addictive it is.			"

												This game is exactly what it says it is, a mash between the roguelike genre and rhythm games. But it is more than that. The first guideline is fairness : It is one of the only fair roguelikes. When you die, you will be able to watch the replay of your last few moves so you can understand what killed you and why. I have played this game for almost 100 hours, and never have I felt like my death was unfair. It was always my own fault, so I couldn't blame the game for anything. And that takes the frustration out of the experience. The second one is mastery : while you will have to learn a few patterns and item effects, they are pretty straightforward, and the game has a training room where you can learn at your own pace everything you want to learn. But the real difficulty comes in when you have to adapt to those patterns, dance with the enemies without making a mistake, and when there are multiple enemies, you'll have to keep track of what each of them is doing and adapt to the situation. This would be easy to do if it wasn't for the time restriction : you can't stay here and think, you have to keep moving to the beat. That is why you need mastery : the ability to master the patterns to a point where they become second nature, for you won't have time to think, only react.Put these two wors together, and you get Crypt of the Necrodancer : difficult but fair.You won't need luck or knowledge, you won't need any wiki to remember what every item does, the only thing you'll need is yourself, your brain, your reflexes, your skill. Are you up to the task ? Can you manage to defeat the Necrodancer and escape from the Crypt ? You are the ony one able to answer that question.			"

			Crypt of the Necrodancer: Early Impressions Crypt of the Necrodancer video created on version: v.0.370 Alpha Crypt of the Necrodancer genre blends rhythm based mechanics with rogue like/lite much...		

Crypt of the Necrodancer genre blends rhythm based mechanics with rogue like/lite much more successfully than Limp Bitzkit's attempt at blending rap and rock. Think traditional turn based rogue like/lites but each beat of the game's music is it's own turn. It's a simple, but very well executed catch that adds a lot of flavor to the game. The pixel art is gorgeous, with detailed textures and animations, the up beat electronic music, though seemingly off themed from the game's more fantastical setting, is catchy and works well with the designed mechanics. If you're not a fan of the music (because you are probably insane), you can always play your own music which the game will build stages out of. Crypt of the Necrodancer also comes with a variety of different modes and features for you to explore, including hardcore, training, and a pile of items and upgrades to unlock. Even as an early access (or perhaps, especially because), it feels very complete. Further improvements from this point will feel more like free DLC than the game subsidizing for missing content. Overall, Crypt of the Nectrodancer is a very unique take on the rogue like/lite genre. It executes it's genre blending perfectly, offering easy to understand, but challenging mechanics, catering to the hardcore and beginners.Pros:- Excellent music- Great pixel art- Unique genre blending- Lots of features and promotes replayCons:- Those unfamiliar with rogue-like/lites could find this repetitive- Custom music could use some tweaking			"

Early Access Review
								One of the most unique games I have played in a long time.  As Cadence, you move through dungeons, dig through walls, use spells and items, attack enemies and bosses, all while staying in tune with the music.  You can not do these things if you do not match the music.  The longer you go without messing up, the greater the gold multiplier you have.  Which means more gold to buy an awesome variety of weapons, armor, and other items from the shopkeeper.  You can also find items hidden behind walls and in chests.  There are plenty of different maps, different songs, and different game modes, along with a bunch other special things you will unlock in the game.  There is also a large enemy variety, and each one behaves very differently from the next.  If you die, you are dead.  You start over completely.  This game is awesome, and definitely worth every penny.""They told me I was too young.  They told me I needed more training.  I told them to drop dead.  How ironic...I don't know how I survived that fall.  Something strange must have happened.  My pulse is beating like a drum, but my blood is running cold.  I'm not sure what's going on but I came here with a question, and I'm gonna find the answer if it kills me."" -Cadence			"

												Wow. Just woow! What a great game.Imagine a chess endgame-like gameplay (like working out tempos with your king, you know) with a rougelike setting somewhat drawing from Spelunky, in a RHYTHM game.  BEAT it!There's great educational value to it, no kidding. I just recently covered a rhytmic guitar handbook and the very first exercise there was quite exactly what you practice throughout CotND: record yourself tapping to the metronome, then listen to the recording and ponder how much offbeat you get despite you try hard. As my friend who was a strong jazz drummer used to say: ""Anyone can play any instrument, there's no big deal to it. But it takes a musician to play to the beat.""Oh, and you can import your own music for even more fun...  I want ""Swing Eights"" DLC now! :)			"

												[Minor spoilers about end game gameplay].I had been in the Crypt for almost 20 hours before I first encountered the Necrodancer.I'd like to talk of that experience:The identity of the Dead Ringer revealed, I felt a pang of confusion, only to hear him guide me, and then to realize I had to juggle two heroes terrified me. How many runs had I failed this far? And another boss after what already seemed like an impossible ordeal. It only took me a few moments to realize the new mechanic I had to juggle in the last fight, and it was an amazing surprise which immediately filled the dancer floor with new energy. I spent the first minute of the encounter with the Necrodancer keeping my heroes side by side, getting used to the beat. The easy beginning really affords those fighting Necrodancer for the first time the time they need to get ready. And then, one by one I begin aligning my heroes, triggering bombs to the stage--not too difficult. When the Necrodancer took to the dance floor, indeed was my heart beating at the  120bpm step, in sync with the Necrodancer himself.  I begrudgingly set aside my Obsidian Crossbow and equipped the Golden Lute, determined to do this right. At first, I ran from his reanimated fiends and explosive spells, trying to realign myself and regroup with my ally, but as soon as I understood his rhythm I slided in for a hit. The Necrodancer skips away only losing a single heart from my note, summoning more monsters between us.Black Knights began to flank me on all sides and it's a challenge to keep them off with my ally's Flail. At one point I realize the Golden Lute can only sing its music if Cadence has a empty tile to move to, so being surrounded by shield bearing skeletons on two sides and a wall and ally covering the other two, I struggle to make any movements at all, all while rapidly losing health. For an instant I fear the worst, but in the next beat does my ally bash his Flail fowards, knocking back one skeleton--I immediately pounce on the next beat, allowing my Lute to sound the minions to dust. The fight continues with me piercing again and again with my Lute, bringing the Necrodancer to a third of his health, while monsters continue to scratch my ally and I. In the fight I've lost four of my nine hearts, leaving both my ally and I at one and a half hearts left, and as I continue to hit the Necrodancer do increasingly powerful monsters seem to appear.Eventually, there are too many skeletons in erratic formations I can't easily line up to attack, their pursuit herding me to one side of the dance floor where an Ogre has just joined. I've died many times to Ogres in the fourth zone, but I know the brute, slow, can be defeated if I merely kite around it. However, I worry that in the process, the new ally by my side would then get smashed in the ensuing blow. I move in, hitting him again and again as I circle to his back.It was at that time, checking the hearts of my ally and I, going over the directional combinations to use bombs, switching to my holstered weapon or beating my war drum, as well as predicting the path of the many dancers of the Necrodancer did I make my fatal error. My attention split, I panic and move one tile away from the Ogre, immediately attracting his singularly directed club. My obsidian armor, then powered down and thin as paper from the onslaught of reanimations is cleaved in two, Cadence immediately perishing under the mighty blow. I will now begin talking about my opinion of the game:I spent 20 hours trying to get farther and farther than before.  Being able to dance with the Necrodancer was an incredible experience, despite dying, my body is still flowing with music high. Please try this game. There are very smart design choices evident throughout every aspect. The music, the level design, the enemies and items all progress so well. Timing each act to the length of a song, having enemies which all have simple but broad ranges of dance moves to overcome make them easy to approach but brilliantly challenging in hoards. You feel extremely rewarded for your experienced-earned dexterity the roguelike demands--the game is a fantastic challenge that's never too easy.   A great example is in certain circumstances (secret vendors and trapdoors) do you find yourself in an incredibly confined space with two minibossess and two small minions. The first time you see this your fear and greenness lead to your immediate demise, but after enough of dancing do you begin to, not only feel comfortable with these, but even actively seek them out for the item and gold reward from defeating them.   Once you can beat bosses, your greed begins to demand you defeat them without a single misstep, for the glorious Flawless Victory that rewards your ego as well as giving you an additional chest to bolster your hero. I thought being an indie game this would be a quick fun change of pace but it's so much more. I've only played twenty hours but I don't intend to stop any time soon. It's a game I would recommend to any friend who comes over, it's a game I would play when I have a short break or if I have a few hours. Sometimes it can be tough if you keep dying but the rewards essentially beg you to succeed.  I keep coming back for more Crypt of the Necrodancer! "

												I waited way too long to pick this one up. On one hand, I love rhythm games and was huge into Rock Band's drums back in the day. On the other hand, roguelikes are a bit overdone at this point and even a game with a huge amount of depth can be a turnoff when you play for 30 hours and only see less than 10% of the content, often because RNGesus hates you.I'm going to assume that you enjoy rhythm games if you're considering this one, Crypt of the NecroDancer does three things that roguelikes in general can learn from.The first is that everything is predictable, even when it's random. The majority of enemies follow a strict algorithmic pattern and the better you are at discerning these patterns and reacting to them quickly, the better you will do. Red Bats' random movements are countered by paying attention to what tiles they are on and what tiles you're on. Bosses have reliable strategies that allow them to be taken out with zero damage suffered, even the ones like Death Metal who have aspects of randomness included. Item drops are random, but this matters less as you unlock higher and higher difficulties that are designed to deprive you of gear and demand perfection.The second thing is that the majority of things are unlocked within a relatively short span of play for a roguelike, about 10 hours. Furthermore, competitive modes such as the Daily Challenge and All Zones/Seeded put everyone on a completely level playing field from the start. No system of unlocks that favors 300+ hour players over the new installs, which is frankly a very good thing. It's not just even popular roguelikes, competitive has become a joke across a wide array of genres due to the industry's addiction to progression systems. It's used as an artificial longevity tactic and even though the store page isn't all 100+ hour reviewers, you know those reviewers' time wasn't wasted by grinding either. This trait gives Crypt of the Necrodancer more of an arcade feel, which is appropriate as all zone runs generally last under an hour. (with the world record seeded speedrun being under 2 minutes)The last kudos goes to the fact that you can enable an option (off by default) to make item names/descriptions visible. I love this feature -- a certain other mega-popular roguelike lacks this feature and as a result it feels like a Mediawiki simulator, constantly disrupting the flow of play. There are a few items without descriptions but these are clearly cursed or ""double-edged sword"" type items, so that's fine.Although not tagged as such, it's worth mentioning that this game is very difficult. You have a lot more information to process than other rhythm games, especially as enemies start becoming more numerous. The difficulty spikes drastically once you unlock the final story mode character, who can only survive two hits or missed beats. Needless to say the YouTube rendition of all the cutscenes is very popular as a result, but just looking at the global achievement stats (and the lack of achievers) will tell you that this game isn't messing around. This isn't a huge problem due to customization options being robust enough to suit any difficulty level, though the one thing they got wrong was hiding the ""double time"" character behind the ""gold one-shots you"" character. It's probably justifiable by difficulty scaling, but it's not all that justifiable by locking what many would consider to be the ""fun hard"" character behind ""tedious hard"" one. But this is a small nitpick honestly.There are plenty of ways to customize the game. The options menu supports a wide range of preferences, always important for letting people feel ""in the zone"" in a rhythm game. There's a modding system, though I haven't used it much yet. The song importer is pretty good, and it accurately timed songs that I ripped from my CD's as WMA and then turned into OGG with Audacity. (only mp3 and ogg are supported) Digital purchases will probably fare just as well. PC rips will require manual timing, which works well enough. It also gives you options to play songs at half or double time, which you might want with higher BPM genres like Metal. Necrodancer seems to have a range for where BPM should be, and halves any that exceed that range -- so you'll want to either play your Dragonforce CD as Bolt, or manually set it to 2x speed.One final positive to mention, and also advice for new players -- it's playable with a dance pad, but you probably need to be superhuman to have a chance in the more difficult modes. Keyboard is also supported, and if you're playing on keyboard, remap the spell/item/misc keys right away and disable the default combos. This seems to make the input more responsive...or maybe I expected it to and it just seems more responsive. It's also good to get used to your own layout right away as the inprecision of two key input will eventually end up biting you the more the game demands perfection.All in all, this is an amazing game...and I'll be there on day 1 if an expansion or sequel comes out.

												I was initially turned off by this game because I couldn't keep to the beat and kept dying to the minibosses, but after initially refunding it I picked it up again in the Halloween sale and I'm loving it.Despite the obvious differences in gameplay and graphics, I find myself comparing it favourably to Dark Souls. It's hard but fair - like every roguelike, you'll be dying a lot, but it's usually due to your own mistakes. Every enemy has a pattern (except bats; screw them), and once you learn it you can breeze past enemies that used to mean a speedy end to your run.There's a huge variety of enemies which require varied tactics to beat. The equipment is similarly varied; weapons range from the basic dagger to longswords, whips, crossbows and even the coveted blunderbuss. Magic rings, spells, boots, helmets, torches and armour (randomly dropped from chests and stocked in shops) also contribute to making every run feel unique, as you'd expect from a roguelike. There's a great deal of progression, too - you amass diamonds from repeated runs of levels which allow you to add more types of gear to the item pool. You can also play as a bunch of different characters which are unlocked throughout the game. Each brings a new way to play, although I find the game hard enough without dying instantly when I miss a beat (as happens when you're playing Aria or Coda). I would have liked to see more characters like Eli, who shakes up the gameplay by only being able to use bombs as weapons, rather than insane challenge-run characters that only a tiny percentage of players will even complete a run with.The soundtrack is phenomenal. Made by Danny Baranowsky, of Super Meat Boy and original Binding of Isaac fame, it's undeniably catchy and covers a wide range of genres. Unlike most games, it's actually a significant part of gameplay - the tempo of the music determines how fast you have to move, and one particular boss (King Conga) switches things up by missing every eighth beat.The story is fairly bare-bones - you get a cutscene when you finish one of the four zones with Cadence, Melody and Aria, and that's about it. I don't mind, really - this game is all about the excellent gameplay.I'd highly recommend this game if you enjoy rhythm games or dungeon-crawling roguelikes.			"

 Summary: My 4th best game of 2015, and for good reason. One of the best mashups of genres that I've seen over the last several years, Crypt of the Necrodancer has that addictive quality that will keep you playing the game over and over again, and enjoying every moment of it.  Strong internal game design revolving around the movement, not the rhythm, and yet the rhythm enhances every moment of gameplay. Dancing in between enemies and getting in the first hit while protecting your precious little health does keep you super aware of your surroundings, and enemy pattern movements force you to think outside the box, digging into the environment to escape or just give yourself a breather. A great solid soundtrack that's designed with the gameplay in mind, and yet importing songs works rather nicely too in a majority of cases. Look, I could go on and on about Crypt of the Necrodancer's design, it's smart gameplay, it's hours of re-playability, but I'm just going to get down to the chase. Everyone who even remotely likes roguelike/roguelite elements will have a fantastic time with this game, and those looking for something out of the rhythm genre will find something fresh and new here. Well worth the full price of admission, no questions asked.    Video Review: 


YouTube™ Video: Heart of the Game: Crypt of the Necrodancer 

			Views: 247		

			Heart of the Game presents a games strength or weaknesses in a CCG like format. The starting inspiration for the series is Crypt of the Necrodancer, a rougelike/roguelite rhythm game that shows how...		

 Lists: +: Strong base gameplay that doesn't need the rhythm to succeed, because the base roguelike gameplay works on so many levels. And yet the rhythm enhances things on multiple levels, forcing quick decisions on the part of the player, forcing mistakes for those not ready for what's to come..  Great variety in weapons and characters, forcing different play styles that still all work on basically the same principles, but you may not realize it. The different characters in particular add some clever elements into the game, forcing you to think about things that you may not have before, like using the walls wisely or avoiding enemies rather then confronting them.  Enemy movement patterns are very smartly done, force you to change up your expectations and react to the situation at hand.  Great soundtrack that is designed for the beat to be consistent, so players get adjusted to the game, but hits a variety of genres, and the remixes are something you'll want to put in your collection. Never get old, and I STILL wanna get up and dance at the opening theme. This coming from a person who has two left feet. Visuals work surprisingly, and you never get lost in the smart selection of color scheme versus background. Everything is clear and up front.  After first hating it, like the final duel they set up, as it takes the gameplay more to a completely new place I wasn't expecting. In fact, would love to see a mode entirely centered around it.  Importing songs works in a lot more cases then I thought it would. Good open source library used to detect the base beat, and is able to detect even if those really odd cases. Some good mods out there, even if half of them are only visual. I personally recommend the Mega Man mod. Because ITS THE GOD DAMN MEGA MAN.-: Minor bugs here and there. For example, it'll exit on the second time you go into import song after playing a round with the new one, and can't handle accented letters.In terms of importing songs, The dog song from undertale doesn't work well with it =(. Honestly, I'd love some DLC just for the fact that well, I just want more. Granted, what's there works, but I still love it to this day. Honestly I'm literally coming up with flaws out of nothing. That's how fun this game is. That it took me this long to do a steam review on this game.  "

I've been sucked into this game for hours, intending to sit down for a short play session, only to end up trying again and again to improve my skills, and progress. In the age of depressing, gritty, gaming-realism, this game is ridiculously fun and quirky, and I hope the creators know what a gem of a game they've got here. And the music? I don't even know where to start. I only wish there was more of this boogie based dungeoncrawler...Did I mention lots of female protagonists?			"

								Crypt of the NecroDancer is a extremely fun rhythm roguelike with custom music game with difficulty for everyone.The game is still on Early Access so there's not much to say. You can play as various characters, some are easy, some are extremely difficult (i'm looking at you, Aria). The easiest character in the game is Cadence in my opinion. You walk as the hearbeats go, and the enemies move if you don't. If you don't like the whole heartbeats stuff, you can play as Bard and be free of all that crap. Other characters are a variation of Cadence, like not killing enemies or not picking up gold.Right now, there are 3 zones and 4 bosses, Mines, Underground Forest (?), Icy Hot place (???).Not going to spoil any of the bosses, but there's an extremely easy one, easy one, medium one (probably my favorite), and hard as balls one.You pretty much always are carrying a sword and a shovel. You can upgrade it the sword to a broadsword, spear, longsword, whip, and even a bow and arrow which all have glass, obsidian, blood, gold, platinum, etc... variations. Same for the shovel.You will also get Headpieces, Shoes, Armor, Potions, Maps, Scrolls, Food, Magic, and other stuff.One complaint that i have with this game is that it recycles the enemies way too much. Want a example?""Oh look, it's a green smile""""Wow, it's a blue slime""""Watch out, it's a yellow slime!""""Please don't kill me mr. lava slime!""""This is getting repetitive, right ice slime?""And then there are white skeleton, white skeleton with shield, white skeleton with horse, yellow skeleton, yellow skeleton with shield, etc...They are all different but they're pretty much the same thing with different colors/health.8.5/10 "

								Note: I've only played the alpha build, so some of this may be subject to change.Crypt of the NecroDancer is an incredibly fun take on the Rogue-like genre.At its core, NecroDancer follows the same tenants that most Rogue-likes do. You enter a procedurally generated dungeon with basic equipment and attempt to reach the exit. Along the way you defeat enemies, avoid traps, buy items, and make generally strategic decisions before you take each step.NecroDancer throws an unusual wrench in the works, however. You're no longer allowed to move or attack unless you do so in sync with the rhythm of the current song. Doing well increases the number of coins you get from enemies, and missing a beat resets this bonus. Additionally, if you miss, the enemies essentially get a free turn. No longer can you sit and ponder your next move, you have to keep moving with the song. Additionally, enemies follow a generally fixed pattern and will only manage to deal damage to you if you neglect to keep this pattern in mind.The result is a highly skill-based Rogue-like where decisions need to be made quickly, and mistakes are punished harshly. The game is definitely balanced around this mantra, as it's very possible to win without ever purchasing an upgrade for your character. In order to cater to a variety of player-types, the game includes both a ""standard"" mode and a ""hardcore"" mode. In the standard mode you're able to purchase upgrades that permanently boost your character, and there are essentially checkpoints that allow you to start from later levels. In contrast, ""hardcore"" puts you on the first floor with no upgrades and requires you to clear the game in one go. There are time and score leaderboards for hardcore, along with character unlocks that serve to boost the difficulty even more. The terrifying ""Aria mode"" is unlocked at the end of hardcore, and features a new mechanic where any hit or any failure to match the beat of the song results in immediate death.The end result is a very fun and refreshing game. Even in the alpha build the mechanics feel very polished, the enemies are varied and interesting, and the strategic gameplay is downright engaging. Much like Spelunky, you'll find yourself excited to die repeatedly as you learn to conquer the game's increasingly difficult floors. The less hardcore players will also likely find enjoyment in collecting new upgrades and unlocking new features as they slowly make their way to the end.The music is also incredible, featuring the composer from Super Meat Boy. If you want additional variety or don't like a particular track, you can replace any level's soundtrack with an MP3 of your choosing. I haven't played around with this much yet, but it likely adds a considerable amount of depth to an already deep game.Sadly, the Alpha Build doesn't have the 4th (and final) zone yet. However, if it is anything like what I've seen so far, it will be both devious and incredibly fun to play.If you enjoy Rogue-likes or music games, this is a great purchase.			"

												Don't get me wrong, I personally LOVE this game. The music is incredible to listen to; the gameplay mechanics are engaging and fun; and the overarching theme is creative and original. The concept is amazing, and initially I thought it was executed well too.The reason why I don't recommend this game is because of the absurd and arbitrary roller coaster of a difficulty curve that this game is.Playing Cadence was a fun and invigorating challenge. I banged my head a bit trying to beat the boss, but was able to eventually overcome it. The difficulty curve was fair and steady.Playing Melody was easy - a cakewalk compared to Cadence. I beat all 4 zones in 1-2 tries, no sweat. The difficulty curve was abnormally low here, especially after beating the 4th zone with Cadence.Then we have Aria... never have I played a videogame that it so unforgiving and punishing.There are several major disagreements I have with this:The cliff-like difficulty spike: especially going from Melody to Aria, this was a stark negative experience for me.That this ridiculous difficulty spike is included in the main storyline: This effectively locks out everyone but hardcore players from even the base storyline (Yes I'm saying that if you clear all Aria's zones I consider you a hardcore player!). I have nothing against the existence of Aria's gameplay; I can appreciate the level of difficulty that she offers. But I do take issue that the storyline cannot progress unless you play through all 4 zones with her.She has no advantages to other characters: Playing Melody was a new and interesting experience because of the lute and having to adjust my strategy to dance around the enemies. Aria doesn't bring anything new to the table; in fact, she takes things off the tableIf Aria's gameplay was adjusted to be more reasonable by giving her a unique gameplay advantage, I would not hesitate to recommend this game to everyone I know. However, the difficulty curve (i.e. roller coaster) is not something I would want those I know to experience.			"

												A fantastic game where every single move must be calculated by the player. Do you use the whip to try and reach around corners or do you bring along the bow so that you can reach far off enemies, believe me, these are vital things to consider because the wrong decision can cost you the run. This game was definitely worth every single cent.			"

Early Access Review
								Edit: As of December 25, 2014 (Merry Christmas)I really love this game. Danny Baranowsky does a beautiful job at making the music catchy and fit the theme of the levels. The game is incredibly hard, split into 4 zones (4th zone is locked as of the early access). Once you beat one zone (each zone is made up of 3 normal levels and a final boss, all of which are amazing and the music to the bosses are amazing as well) the next zone opens up. I've unlocked Zone 3 and it's nearly impossible for me. I mean, come on, there's a chess boss where the pieces move exactly like in chess, it's absolutely badass.There's a daily challenge much like Spelunky and SpiderMod for Isaac, and I've seen scores of people who have beaten the game, so it IS possible, it's just really hard. Don't let the challenge discourage you from getting it. Enemies have a distinct pattern (except bats, ♥♥♥♥ those guys), and you have to attack the enemy between their attack pattern to hit them unharmed, however if you stay in a square or attempt to move into a square that an enemy moves onto at the same time, you get hit. There is some knowledge you gain only by playing the game, such as attack prioritization. For example, the game prioritizes your attack over all enemies', so if you attack a 1 health enemy that's going to attack you at the same time, your attack is registered first and the enemy dies without you getting hit, but if the enemy has more than 1 health, you get hit because you didn't kill the enemy on that beat.When you get hurt or die it's ALWAYS because you messed up the enemy pattern, I've never felt the game cheated me on damage or death. And don't think the game is trial and error on knowing the enemy patterns, they nearly always have a tell when they're about to attack so you can attack them in between.There are very, very minor bugs in the game, sure a good amount of them are userend, meaning you might mess up thinking how something works and try to use it incorrectly only to have it mess you up (such as learning how the Cat of Nine Tails works, I hate this weapon), but the actual bugs in the game are barely noticeable and the creator does an absolutely fantastic job of updating the game and squashing bugs, he's very very active on the /r/necrodancer subreddit as well as the Brace Yourself Games forums where there's a bug database that you can add to or search through to see if a bug you found has already been seen.The visual style is nice, the pixelated art works fine, the level art is looks good. Most enemies groove out to the music so it's pretty cool.There's also a feature where you can use your own music and the game will process it and determine the beat of the music, so far it's pretty accurate though it does seem to have very minor issues with certain songs. But I really like the original music so I'm probably not going to change it.The more I play this game, the more I'm loving it. I fell in love with the Binding of Isaac and have about 230 hours in it, I can EASILY see myself outplaying that game in this one. Seriously, the music is some of the best I've heard in a game, the gameplay is fresh and the creator is constantly updating and improving the experience. Is it worth $15? ABSOLUTELY. I would not skip a beat even if this game was $30 dollars or even full retail at $60. The replay value is immense and if I get 200 hours in this game, even if the game was prices at $60, I payed $3.33 per hour, and I say that's an amazing deal. What makes this hypothetical even better is the game is FIFTEEN DOLLARS, NOT SIXTY. Come on, do yourself a favor and pick this game up. If the game is on sale (which it is for the Winter Sale), I say with 100% certainty that it is worth your time to buy it.At first I said this game is an 8.5/10. ♥♥♥♥ that♥♥♥♥♥♥ this gets 10000/10.

												Just becuase your game is hard, doesn't mean it's good. Great concept here, total lack of content hidden behind frustrating layers of difficulty.Edit: To clarify since people seem to think I'm ""just doing it wrong"". I love a lot of the ideas in this game... a unique rhythm based dungeon crawler is right up my alley; but when you strip it all back what we have here is a shallow rougelike experience wrapped behind some incredibly charming art / style and a great soundtrack. There are 4 levels and a handful of enemy types, and no matter what the folks in the comments say you're going to die... a lot. The soundtrack is good, which is nice because you're going to be listening to the same 3 songs over and over as you attempt to master the enemy movements. I don't personally recommend it because I found the experience frustrating and unrewarding. Judging by the fact the current store shows the ratings as 98% positive I'm obviously the minority here. There are folks with hundreds of hours sunk into this game, so take my negative opinion with a grain of salt obviously.			"

TL;DR: Buy this game even if you don't enjoy rougelikesHmmmmmm, where do I even begin with this kind of game? The concept behind this game made this almost an instabuy. A roguelike where the turns are locked to the beats? Yes please. I haven't seen a concept like this before, and I haven't heard about another one if it existed.Unlike traditional roguelikes, there is no leveling system. You don't get ""stronger"" by defeating enemies or bosses. No, instead, you learn from them. Killed by a blue slime? Don't stand above it or below it. Out of 80+ hours of play, I have had zero unfair deaths. I could look at the replay and see exactly where and how I screwed up. You get better after every death.The music in this game is fantastic. Seriously. I have (mostly) had nothing but Necrodancer tunes stuck in my head ever since I started playing. My only complaint is that Jules' soundtrack isn't the best for playing the character it is assigned to. I've had little problems importing music as well, but it isn't 100% perfect. Instead of manually tpping out beats, I just use a program that generates the file for me.Make no mistake, this game is hard. It took me quite some time to clear the first character, and I am still working on the next two main ones. All zones mode is the main one for this game, and most of your character achievements will come from that mode. Play single zones until you're used to the game, then go for all zones. Do you think that being locked to the beat is too hard? Play as the bard. No beats and all the time in the world to make your decisions. Since you'll be dying a lot, it may or may not become repetitive. I haven't gotten bored in the amount of hours I put into it. This game is hard but replayable. Some characters are harder/more annoying than others. Experiment and see who you like best.Like roguelikes? Get this. Like rhythm games? Get this. Want to be challenged? Get this. Want to get angry that you went to an endboss and died? Get. This.9/10			"

 tl;dr: Buy this game NOW if you enjoy dungeon-crawlers and/or roguelikes of any kind, innovation, and kickass music. At its core, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a rouge-like dungeon crawler. However, as you become more invested in the game's unique on-the-beat movement system, you'll begin to realize that NecroDancer is much more than that! Strategy comes into play when dealing with enemies with increasingly complex movement systems, especially when you get the urge to compete for a top spot on the speedrun and gold high school leaderboards in each Daily Challenge. DannyB's soundtrack for this game is fantastic and somehow hasn't gotten boring to me even after hours and hours playing the game. There are now 5 soundtracks to play with, and there's also always the option to enchant the Crypt with your own MP3s with ease! The story is surprisingly deep and well thought out - cutscenes are quick but pack a lot of meaning. They flesh out the lore of the NecroDancer very well, and offer a very satisfying resolution that ties up all loose ends.Brace Yourself Games handled Early Access like champs - there was and still is a huge amount of community involvement, and I've seen many community suggested features be implemented! Crypt of the NecroDancer WELL WELL WELL worth the cost. Buy it NOW if you have any interest! It's easy to pick up, but hard to master!P.S.: for any musicians out there, I can say that this game has definitely improved my rhythm-keeping skills!P.S.S.: In reference to my hours played: it's ok.

												I should stop playing this before I break something.Edit: Okay, time for an actual review. It's also my first, so excuse me if it's a little useless.Crypt of the NecroDancer is built on a fairly simple concept: it's a turn based dungeon crawler, except each turn is restricted to the beat of the music, so if you don't think quickly enough or mistime your move, you miss your turn (and your gold multiplier, which can be crippling with certain items).As you might expect, enemies become tougher as you move through each stage of the game, with their movements becoming more complex as well. You can find new tools and weapons as you progress to give yourself a better chance, but ultimately, you have to learn how each enemy behaves to succeed.There are a total of ten playable characters, two of which are unlocked from the start (one using the  default gameplay and the other allowing you to move off the beat, effectively removing the time pressure). The unlockable characters offer more challenging scenarios such as: Instant gameover if you touch any gold dropped by defeated monsters Instant gameover (yet again) if you miss a single beat or take a single hit Elapsing turns two times faster than usual A ludicrous horror that combines everything above Not being able to deal any damage, and instead having to dodge enemies while going for the exitThere's plenty of replay value thanks to the different characters, and the game also generates daily challenges similar to those from Spelunky: everyone gets one try at the same dungeon each day, and your final score is uploaded to the leaderboard for that day only.You can import your own soundtracks and play along to them, provided you have them stored locally. There's also modding support, which is always nice.			"

												The thing is: I really like rythm games but I usually get bored quickly by them because they have nothing more to offer than just doing the same songs over and over again to get a better accuracy score.So here comes Crypt of the NecroDancer taking what I love about rythm games and combining it with another genre I've come to love over the last year: roguelike.There are various permanent options to unlock for your rounds, be it better and differently working weapons, armor, spells or other miscellaneous equipment. You don't just buy equipment to start with though, there are randomly generated chests in each level, you unlock better items to be found in those and/or more spawned chests. Which is an awesome way to keep the procedural feeling alive and not just making the game considerably easy to blast through.Each enemy has a certain pattern and rythm of moving and attacking, so due to the many different types of enemies there's a lot to learn and adapt to, which I love. If you don't quite have rythm in your blood, doing the constant moving to the beat and concentrating on visual patterns at the same time might get frustrating. Don't fret though! The game offers a training mode for both the basic monsters and minibosses - only ones you encountered yet, no spoilers.The music is fantastic and the artstyle just nails the whole serious yet not serious mood of the game. I'm totally in love with Crypt of the NecroDancer! <3			"

YouTube™ Video: Crypt of the NecroDancer: Gameplay First Look 

			Views: 1,622		

			Crypt of the NecroDancer is a hardcore roguelike rhythm PC game. Crypt of the NecroDancer makes you move on the beat to navigate ever changing dungeons. Coming for Steam Early Access.		

I have no idea how I missed Crypt of the NecroDancer for such a long time. What simple, yet AWESOME game. You only need four keys, or your feet if you play on a dance pad. Move at the right time to the right place. It sounds simple but it becomes hardcore with so much going on the screen. With a game that uses rhythm you expect to have a great soundtrack and the game doesn't disappoint there. Ingenious, simple but deep. Fantastic.Pros- Great soundtrack- Simple to pick up, hard to master- In depth item system, a lot of replay valueCons- Because I really can't find anything else, I would like a description on the items before buying them			"

								At its core, Crypt of the NecroDancer consists of one simple premise: move to the rhythm. The action unfolds according to the unholy beat of the Necrodancer - you must move with it, attack with it, dodge the enemy onslaught with it. The literal pulse of Cadence's heart drives a deadly crypt and the twisted monsters within.But underneath it is something more. Dig deeper, and the player uncovers a surprisingly deep gameplay experience, especially for one still in Early Access. Each weapon type sports a unique attack pattern. A cavalcade of items and equipment provides benefits ranging from immediate health recovery to phasing through walls or limiting the number of enemies. Spells can give you an upper hand against the thralls, freezing them in place or blasting them to ashes with a fiery bolt. Shrines, hidden shops, secret enemies, multiple playable characters... they all contribute to an experience unlike most other rhythm games you've played.Crypt of the NecroDancer falls into the ""roguelike"" genre and as such you'll see many of its usual trappings: procedural dungeons, high difficulty, an emphasis on discovery, bombs and consumables, etc. What sets this apart from other similar games, aside from the rhythm aspect, is that luck only plays a minimal factor in your success. Every level and every enemy is balanced in a way that completing a run from start to finish without ever upgrading from the starting dagger is entirely possible, and in fact has been done multiple times. If you're into other roguelike games there is a lot here for you to love and be familiar with. I, for one, never cared much for the genre. Games like Spelunky and The Binding of Isaac I've played a few times, but ultimately I grew tired of them. 120+ hours later, Crypt of the NecroDancer has me completely hooked.One of its biggest strengths is its absolutely stellar soundtrack composed by the well-known Danny Baranowsky. It was a smart move to focus the gameplay around this music - it provides just the right atmosphere and you'll find yourself bobbing your head to the beat as you play without even noticing it. One of the other aspects that really drew me in was that the game feels completely fair. You don't need one specific item to get a good run, and you don't need lucky shops or good spawns to make it to the end. Skill and familiarity with the enemies can carry you 99% of the way. Learning enemy behaviors and discovering new items become fun exercises. If you die, you know exactly what mistake you made and learn to avoid that for the next run. You can play with a keyboard, a controller, or even a dance pad, and you can even add your own music into the levels! The game also has a welcoming community and great forums you can visit to seek advice or share your latest victory.There's even still more to come! One more ""zone"" will be added to the game, there will be more boss fights, as well as the possibility for more items, equipment, mechanics, etc. Even in its ""alpha"" state Crypt of the NecroDancer is a deep and rewarding experience, and I personally can't wait to see more!

Early Access Review
								Yep, it's a roguelike played via DDR. Dance pads compatible but not required. It may technically be in Early Access but I'd never know, the game seems pretty complete as is and I keep getting my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me before I can even clear Zone 2 (there being 4 zones at present).The gameplay is pretty self-explanatory once you've gone through the quick tutorial, but is ever a matter of reflexes and quick thinking to keep yourself in one piece. Enemies are deviously varied to give you all manner of headaches to fight in conjunction with one another. Diamonds acquired through play are spent in the hub to unlock new equipment to appear in chests (as well as some passive upgrades like health). Rooms are available to help you practice fighting against specific enemies and bosses, and one character is available to let you just play the game as a regular turn-based roguelike. There's a local co-op mode of some sort too, hell if I know how that works. Hardcore mode is available for a no-upgrades run, and there's a daily one-shot hardcore challenge available, ala Spelunky.There are a few minor sticking points.1) You can import your own music for any of the levels you like, which is fantastic, except when the automatic beat detection--which, granted, is impressively accurate on the whole--doesn't work quite right and there's no way to attempt a manual fix.2) The game doesn't require you to keep on the beat perfectly, there's a fair leeway in the timing and you can miss beats if you don't mind losing your current cash multiplier (that is, unless you've invoked a risk shrine); this is open to some strategizing with skipping a beat to ready yourself for an enemy, but there's no actual control function for 'skip beat' and so you're left waiting for the input grace period between beats for enemies to make their move, after which it's hard to get right back into the rhythm.3) There's no ""count in"" between levels at all, so to keep your multiplier up you have to start moving again before you've even processed what's immediately around you or what the new rhythm actually is.4) Practice rooms for monsters are great, but having to defeat a monster or boss once during normal play to unlock them seems a bit counterintuitive.Minor gripes. Very solid soundtrack, very solid gameplay. Would probably be a HELL of a party game, with big picture running on a nice TV and a DDR mat set up.			"

Early Access Review
								While the game is still in Beta, what has been completed is worthwhile. Necrodancer is a rhythm, turn-based, roguelike. It can be played with just directional keys, so dancepad friendly.  You move your character  to the beats of Danny Baranowsky (Super Meat Boy, Binding of Isaac) as you make your way through 3 (4 upon release) zones, each containing 3 levels and a boss fight. There are currently 7 playable characters offering various challenges with a variety of weapons and items to utilize. Floors are randomly generated and you can race for better times or complete to get the highest score. The game is challenging, but fair so when you die, it was probably your fault. The game provides a training feature so you can practice against any enemy and hone your strategies. Other features include a daily challenge, seeded runs, and creating your own levels. You can even customize the music that plays as well as mod in game sprites. "

								Basically a feature-complete game, if you didn't tell me it was early access I never would have known.  Balls-hard roguelike with an amazing soundtrack as expected from Danny Baranowsky, with a unique and frantic playstyle based around the beats of music.  I highly recommend this game as-is and any extra stuff they add to it over time is just gravy!			"

								Even if rhythm games aren't your thing this game gets strangely addicting. Each time you replay you get a little bit more out of and even if you're a ""pro"" player you're just as likely to die on the first map as somebody who is absolutely new with the game. The music is absolutely amazing, so even if you don't think you'll play it at all the money is worth it for the soundtrack alone!			"

Early Access Review
								First off, I have to admit, I fell in love with the opening sequence. It's the perfect blend of music, plot, voice acting and a beat to get me hyped all the hell when I start it up. DROP DEAD!The game is really enjoyable. It's a Roguelike, but it feels less dependent on luck, and more on skill and planning then most others. I don't generally feel like I was screwed too hard when I die; As far as I can see it, you should be able to clear the game without getting hit, or at least close, if you're god-like at pattern recognition.Every enemy has it's own pattern, which, I can't believe the game didn't refer to as it's unique Dance. Maybe it's too corny. As Cadence (oh, there's the corniness. Works, though.) remarks, 'learn that, and they'll never harm you.' (something like that.)I think the one negative I've had in dealing with the game is in using items and spells. It's not impossible, but it takes a good deal getting used to. You only have 4 keys, the 4 directions. To use items, you combine them. Ex, an apple is Up+Left, or whatnot. Keeping your combo going while using them very rarely works out for me in the heat of a battle.But, even then, you can bind those combinations to other keys, if you like. Up+Left could be bound to Ctrl, or Shift, or Left trigger. Yes, it works with gamepads. Personally, I bound XBAY and the Dpad to all directions applicable. If your one hand gets tired, switch to the other! Or, if you have a Left+Right item, it works well using both hands, I find, so it's Left+B instead. Aaaaanyway. Graphics are fine. Gameplay is fun (first level's tempo is a liiitle slow for my taste), and the feeling on beating a boss is rewarding. King Conga and his Zombie Conga Lines (yes) confused the hell out of me the first time, but when you learn it, it's just plain fun.In short, I love installing large screen televisions in doghouses, and Crypt of the NecroDancer is a good game.

PROS+It's in early access but you should probably get it, does an excellent job at combining the rythm / dungeon crawler / roguelike genres.+The game isnt easy and requires some practice and time investment to beat all the zones (learning monsters patterns, items, shrines) but all in all its a very rewarding process.+Has Steam Workshop support and a lot of interesting items / equipment you'll have to learn. Also they do daily challenges and the devs donate some money to charities and top players.+Gets you humming to its great OST and moving to the beatThings I would improve-Some improvements to the custom music-to-beats process, using your own songs doesn't always work as expected-Adding some kind of end-game content (After beating zone 3 you are like ""what do I do now""). Yes, you have hardcore mode, but I would add some minor and faster reachable achievements / milestones. Like ""kill X red ragons"" , ""kill 3 enemies with a bomb"", ""kill Conga King with a glass shard"". Maybe even add some more hidden collectibles or trophys which can be viewed in a room in the lobby.-Cloud save would be a nice feature, also multiplayer in the future would be something nice but it's ok as it is, I know it would be too much trouble.VeredictThis game is worth the money, some minor things could be improved, but even if it's in early access the developers are really active and care about the game!

1-sentence review:this game is a well crafted rhythm-based roguelike, which is fun and addicting enough, even for a player with average dexterity like myself, which is in addition not especially fan of hardcore roguelikes ; although the game is not without (small) shortcomings.Pros:- Well crafted roguelike, even without the rhythm component- Varied monsters- Relatively varied environments- Training room to beat each enemy individually- Boss fights are not too hard nor too easy- Playing with the Bard character makes the game turn-based (ie: no rhythm anymore), which allowed me to see the final zone ;-)Cons:- Having to play on the rhythm of the music can get really frustrating when it feels too slow- RNG is as usually in a roguelike too important ; getting a good weapon early or late in the run makes all the difference ; sometimes, the spawning point is next of the exit with a big dragon that burns you through walls before you can get an idea of your surroundings, etc... >_<- No difficulty settings, except for the separate easier 1st Zone & the Bard, but it's really not enough (eg: I wish I could have played with some bonus Hearts and more efficient healing from food)- Lacks a bit of content ; I played 12 hours and I feel I got all I could get from the game ; it is totally ok for me as I don't like to spend too much time on the same game, and if you get badly addicted, you probably can play a lot more than thatBonus Notes:- Unlike 99% of the other players, I'm not a big fan of the musics ; they don't hold up to the 80's & 90's scores I still have in mind ; I haven't played the game for 2 days and can't remember a tune right now... >_<   They do their jobs though and are alright.- the extra characters bring different gameplay, but exception of the Bard one, they'll be doable only by the most hardcore fans			"

												This game makes me want to dance, too bad when I try I get killed after 5 seconds because I have no rhythm.Anyway, this rogue-like game mixed with a rhythm game is pretty nice, It's your standard rogue-like adventure except you have to move with the music (you can use custom songs but the OST is great too). These kind of games tend to be pretty hard so expect to die constantly, but don't worry, you get to upgrade your character little by little as you play.As of writing this review I haven't finished the game (I'm on Zone 4), but that doesn't matter, I feel like what I paid for the game was worth it. If you enjoy rhythm games even a little you have to try this one out.			"

												I have a lot of good things I can say about this game.Out of every game I played, I can say this one take's the cake for:Most fair game. EVERY time I die, I can think ""man, I know what I did wrong,"" as opposed to other games where you lose and feel cheated.Best difficulty curve. Starting out, I couldn't tap keys to a beat, but I was able to work my way up to fast reactions and even double-speed (a certain character). No matter how long you play this game, you can ALWAYS get better and notice the improvement.The music is FANTASTIC. Danny B's music has such strong composition. It really fits the game, the groove, and does a great job at letting the player 'feel the beat' of the game. The other soundtracks are also great. I'm not a big fan of EDM or Metal, but I still enjoy Jules and A-Rival. Girlfriend also has some great tracks, but I personally am not a fan of Virt.There are so many unique things about this game. This is the first music-based dungeon crawler I've ever seen. The shopkeeper sings! The characters, voices, sounds, they make you feel so good to play. You can compete against other players for fastest times, or highest scores.woopsirantedthisgameisreallygoodbuyit			"

This game has it. The devs of this game are awsome. Oh did you know they have necrodancer themed DDR pads? well they do infact they are being sold at the regular price and the devs aren't even taking a cut.Seriously this may sound like i'm joking but you need this game.Edit:this game has multiple modes     Normal mode where unlocks you purcahse with gems (found while playing the game)  and beating a zone brings you to the menu     hardcore mode which means you get none of the upgrades and start with only 2 HP. you must beat all zones to complete it.     Other variants that involve characters that augment the game such as making the game in double time or miss a beat and you die.     Daily challenge like spelunky. A seeded run that you get one chance per day.You are able to use your own music if you so choose but the soundtrack itself is amazing.This game is very difficult but rewarding and it's continually improving.

												This is probably the best roguelike (or roguelite) I've ever played. :-)Why? Let's see...-the theming: it mixes classic dungeon crawling with rhythm (or at least: sets you on a beat), and it maintains that position to the smallest details. From singing shopkeepers to music-themed bosses, it's neither too corny nor not flavourful enough.-as far as variety in procedurally generated levels are concerned, things are pretty decent. There's a good amount of enemy variety and items, and all the systems seem to work together well (will you trade hearts for a better weapon? Will you fight extra monsters for gold to buy better gear? Will you risk stuff for diamonds to easy future runs?).-the whole nine yards: in the lobby, you can practice fighting enemies, there are other characters to chose from, lots of unlocks, and so on. I even had problems finding the actual story mode. ;-)-difficulty: as many roguelikes go, this follows the standard ""extremely hard to complete"" pattern, requiring many playthroughs from your end (reason why the variety is important). However, since enemies move to the beat in predictable patterns, all errors are technically your own fault. Still, even when playing as the bard (I'll get to that), it's pretty hard to actually make a good run.-music: as you should expect, the music is great. And I may be underestimating it when I say that.I've gotta say that Crypt of the Necrodancer feels like it has done its homework on the genre. It's like every plus point I find in spelunky, don't starve or nuclear throne is also somehow included here (though the beat-following is something of its own). The result is a very well polished and fun to play game.As said, the bard deserves special mentioning. Where other characters have slight variations on the main character, the bard doesn't follow the beat. While this makes the game less hard (it's still in no way easy), it does change the entire gameplay. It also removes the only gripe I have with the game: that the constant moving in a beat can get pretty annoying if you just want to backtrack to another part of the dungeon. The bard changes the game so much it's an entirely different game (rather akin to Nova-111, btw). A better one, some might argue, though it misses a bit of the magic that makes the game special.But whatever character you pick, this game has this addiction that when you die you immediately go ""again! again!"". So beware: your social life might suffer because of this game. ;-)			"

												Oh that shopkeeper really knows how to sing!A game of rhythm, where you move/attack at the pace of the song.You can even put your own songs but care, the fastest the songs, the bigger is the pace of the game.10/10 (Shopkeeper singing alone gave 2 points)			"

Early Access Review
								Really good arcade-style dungeon crawler game!! Soundtrack is amazing (of course it would be!!) It feels a little bit clunky at first but a few short runs from brutally quick deaths will have you feelin' it pretty quickly. At the very least there's definitely nothing comparable out right nowIt's not even finished apparently but it's already well worth 15$?? It's one of the better games I've played on Steam recently for sure			"

												Beatgames (or rhythm games) tend to be very hard at first, but when you practice, you can literally see your improvement. Although this game is not a pure beatgame, it has the full characteristics of one. The concept of two different game genres put into one is incredible, but it is just EPIC when the execution of it is perfect.The soundtrack of this game is simply amazing. I've never really had a taste for electronic music or jazz, but the stuff they put into this game definitely made me change my mind. The way they've designed everything, I think, was so you, the player, could jam to any music that would hit you. Every moving object in the game has an animation that moves to the rhythm of the BPM (beats per minute; determines how fast a song is) of the song, the shopkeepers' singing is just perfect, and the rest of the sound effects (voices, attacks, monsters) flow so astoundingly. Sometimes I play this game just because I want to listen to the soundtrack. Custom music is a plus, and I have not found any errors working with it so far. It has it's own BPM detection that works fine. Randomly generated-ness (well that's rogue-like, isn't it?) makes this game never get old. The story mode is of moderate length, and surprisingly, or at least, for me, I have gotten tied to the characters and I have grown to have sympathy for them! If you don't have a thing for rogue-like games, this will surely change your mind (That's what had happened to me). The pixel art is adorable, and the character concept art for those monsters are.. dark and horrifying. Think you have a slow/old computer and can't run this game? This game ran at 60 fps on mine, so you're fine. (In case you didn't get it, my computer is very bad.)When you first start playing, the thing that you need to remember is to never give up. If you die five times in a row, you should either take a break for a while and come back to the game later or keep playing. You will  see that improvement and it will just feel amazing. You actually feel accomplished about something, which is what very few games are able to do.As for going into more depth about the gameplay, no need for that. It is all for you to discover yourself. But here's something to remember: although the content of this game doesn't seem that abundant, trust me. It was way more stuff than you think. They also have a level editor after you complete the game (or should I say, a fraction of the game [Note what I said to remember]), so you can upload your creations to the Steam Workshop that is connected to the game or just play them alone. Nothing wrong with that.To sum it up, this game deserves every one of those awards that you see to the right. If not, more than that. This review cannot express how much I enjoy this game. It is one of the most unique and unforgettable gaming experiences ever. Get this game if you're looking for something new to enjoy. Highly RecommendedAlso, sorry if I have any grammar/typing errors. I did not read this over.			"

								NecroDancer is a great rhythm-based Rogue-like where you take turns to the beat of the music.  Miss a beat, everything around you takes a turn anyway.  At first it sounds weird to not have all the time in the world to plan a move in an RL, but NecroDancer makes it work with basic patterns to all creatures.  The main challenge is balancing keeping the beat up with putting yourself in a good position to deal with whatever comes at you.  You need either quick decision-making or good muscle memory from repeated plays to deal with complex situations.Unreservedly recommend it once the game is completed.  $15 for early access is alright, but you'll probably have to be interested in the concept beforehand to feel fully happy about your $15.

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is a unique take on the Rogue-like genre - in that it also doubles as a rhythm game! Bounce to the beat as you read enemy movements and dispatch them; collect better items, weaponry, or scrolls; and defeat hilarious bosses from a moving chess board to a zombie conga line - and of course there are the final bosses in the game as well.The game features a multitude of different characters you can play with to win the game - starting with the default character and bard with several more unlocked as you go along. Speaking of unlocks, you will unlock new items, weapons, and other npcs that can grant services for you as you proceed through the game.While it is overall quite a neat take on playing rogue-likes, there is certainly something to say about lack of 'game' to play. There are essentially 4 different zones to play it with a multitude of enemies to encounter - but eventually it will quickly come across as same-ish and old hat. There is also a limited amount of items to unlock and eventually you'll unlock everything fairly quickly.This is a game I recommend - though I do encourage getting it at a discounted price.			"

												This game combines rhythm and roguelike like fried chicken and waffles. If you haven't experienced them together, you think it's a bizarre combo that won't mesh well. Then you try it and you wonder why you haven't had the two together before. Where has this magical combo been your entire life?Gimmick aside, the game is still beautifully designed. The enemies all have tells and literally have choreographed attacks. Everything gives signs before the action takes place, much like many roguelikes. It's just that this game took that dance and set it to a kickin' soundtrack. You can even practice against enemies without needing to throw yourself into the deep end to figure out their tells. Even the characters are more upbeat and lively than your average roguelike. The little things, like how they greet NPCs (shyly VS boldly VS force of habit) and their surprised reactions to teleportation make them seem less like digital avatars and more like humans. A little detail that adds a lot of magic to the game.[edit] THE STORY. Add the story to another fantastic bit of this game. Only frustrating bit is how hard it is to complete story mode, but hey, it's a roguelike. That's to be expected from the genre.TL;DR - A wonderfully charming game that blends two very different genres in a lovingly-designed piece. I strongly recommend you pick up the game and the soundtrack!			"

												Honestly, if you're not already interested by the description ""rhythm dungeon-crawler"" I don't know what else to tell you.I can say every single thing about it stylish as hell, it has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard from any video game in my life, and the two genres blend together shockingly well. It's not a hugely innovative roguelike, you just explore a randomly assembled network of rooms and tunnels full of monsters and gear. And it's not a hugely complex rhythm game either, you just take every step in beat with the music. But putting them together REALLY transforms the experience of both. Having to work out your own ""dance"" to outmaneauver enemies and traps as you come to them makes the rhythm game feel clever and engaging in a way they're usually not. Putting that dance into every little thing makes the busywork of a roguelike feel satisfying and just GOOD in a way I've never felt before.This is one of those mashups that sounds pointless when it's described to you, and after actually trying it, you don't understand why there haven't been games like this since 20 years ago.

								Crypt of the NecroDancer is a very fun game. It's also very challenging. The game is far more difficult than it actually appears to be. Having to first learn how to not look at the beat meter and then learning enemy patterns takes time. I still make awful mistakes a couple hours in.This is an excellent early access game and I'm glad to have a copy of it before the release. Perhaps having a mechanical keyboard would be easier than membrane since it's easier to notice when you press the buttons versus membrane where you just feel the press down.The controller part could use some work I feel, but it's not impossible, you just have to remember which buttons you assigned for what.10/10			"

								Crypt of the NecroDancer is half turn-based dungeon crawler with randomly-generated dungeons. The other half of the game is rhythm: each dungeon floor has a unique music track with a visually emphasized steady beat. Your moves are (ideally) made to that beat. Enemies also move to the beat, so the pace at which things happen is determined by the music. Having a steady rhythm locks the participant into a timeframe in which to act, not unlike speed chess or the rate at which a block lowers in Tetris. By removing the infinite time in which a player could decide which move is most optimal in your traditional turn-based dungeon excursions, the game becomes instead one of relying almost wholly on experience. After a while, experience becomes instinct, leading to creative leaps of strategy made entirely in the moment, in the space between the game’s figurative and literal heartbeats.You play as Cadence, a headstrong delver who - through an unfortunate combination of a terminal fall and an evil NecroDancer stealing her still-beating heart - must now travel down multiple dungeon floors, fighting monsters and finding useful items. You technically don’t have to move to the beat, but not doing so will cause you to lose a vital multiplier that increases how many coins you earn from defeated monsters. The higher the multiplier, the more likely you can afford powerful weapons and items found in dungeon shops. You know when you’re moving to the beat, because the dungeon floor starts pulsing with light, making it your very own little dungeon rave.There is very little randomness to the combat in Crypt of the NecroDancer. Everything behaves according to very set rules. You move into a monster to attack it, different weapons change the shape of your attack. If an enemy moves into a square you were trying to move to, you’ll take damage instead. Certain enemies take advantage of your urge to rush in, waiting a beat before moving, or moving in interesting patterns. Monsters have unique little dance animations, their movement sounds become a part of the melody of what’s happening on the screen. These sounds are often a clue to defeating them. As you delve deeper, the music becomes faster, the monster patterns more complex. The game is ingenious, fun in ways indescribable unless you’re there, in the moment, taken by the rhythm and amazed at how well you’re doing.You can use your own MP3s for the soundtrack, and there’s even a DDR mode for use with a dance pad. The DDR mode makes a game a bit easier so you don’t kill yourself. There’s permanent progression via character upgrades, like a health increase and magic spells, unlocked by collecting diamonds. The music is being provided by the excellent Danny Baranowsky (Super Meat Boy, Canabalt, Binding of Isaac, Desktop Dungeons).			"

												One of the best rhythm games I have ever played. One of the best roguelikes I have ever played. Two of my favorite genres, tasting oh so great together.Crypt of the Necrodancer requires quick thinking, a good sense of rhythm, and a keen strategic and tactical sensibility to win, and those wins are so rewarding. With a rollicking feel, great pixel art, and excellent screen effects, it's easy to get pulled into the action and hard to put down. Possibly the best feature is Danny Baranowsky's amazing soundtrack—you can play with your own music, but I never have; I love the original soundtrack too much!			"

												Now that the full release of this game has been out for awhile, I feel compelled to write a review of this game.Crypt of the NecroDancer is a rogue like, rhythm based dungeon crawler that offers a unique challenge and experience, complete with multiple characters that have their own playing style that affects the gameplay greatly. Pros:- Probably the most important aspect of a rhythm game is its music. Crypt does not disappoint in the slightest with its amazing tunes, composed by the one and only Danny Baranowsky as well as awesome remixes by FamilyJules7x and A_Rival.- You can use your own music in the game, and this feature is implemented well. - The game provides a hard but fair style of gameplay, something that is sure to keep people doing runs over and over again.- Each of the characters adds an interesting twist (such as moving in cut time or being able to only use bombs) that provide an additional challenge for players to overcome.- This game has high replayability as no two runs are exactly the same.- A mix of items provides players with multiple ways to beatdown enemies to the beat.- The devs constantly provide updates and work hard to fix any bugs that people encounter along the way.Cons:- It can take awhile to get used to. You're probably not going to be able to get through Zone 1 on your first try. For some people, this may be a turnoff, though, if you're willing to put in the effort, you can really get a lot of enjoyment out of completing a run.- If you're trying to 100% this game... think again. One of the achievements may be impossible to get, which may turn some people away.- Pausing the game and regaining your pace can be rather difficult. While this may not sound like a big deal at first glance, there are some characters who will die if you miss a beat (Aria and Coda).Some people may complain about the price, but you can find some 33% off coupons floating around on Steam. It's not much, but 10 bucks is less than 15. TL;DR: If you like rogue likes, rhythm games, or dungeon crawlers, get this game. This game is an astounding combination of the three that works harmoniously. If the price seems like too much, go get a coupon from groups like Coupon Dumpster and that.			"

								I love this game. A lot. Now, take into account what most of the high-rated reviews say, because I agree with them. But what I'm going to touch on is something specific that I find most interesting and perhaps wholly unique about this game. Put simply, it reminds me of chess. In fact, one of the final boss room types is a chess set, which you can see briefly in the trailer, but that's beside the point. All enemies have set actions (or perhaps reactions), and will always make them according to the rhythm and how you move. For instance, the red dragon will move once every two beats toward you unless you are any distance directly to the left or right of him, in which case he will shoot a row of fire. The goblins will run away if you approach them, but pursue if you move away from them.Now, normally, if you had all the time you needed, you could plan out a perfect attack and kill everything without taking damage, but in this game, you have to move with the beat. You have to think quickly if you want to work your way out of a tricky situation. When you die, you feel like it was your mistake and the game had not cheated you, which is generally the case (though there is a small chance of the game generating an absurdly difficult enemy encounter). Even so, due to the random generation, it is possible to find a good weapon or food early on, making giving you an advantage. I always hope for an awesome weapon, but sometimes find myself doing surprisingly well with just a standard dagger. It's action/strategy/cool music-y rhythm/rogue-like at its finest.			"

												Rhythm games and dungeon crawlers seem like they'd be incompatible, but Crypt of the NecroDancer makes the two work together. You have to move and act to the beat of the music, so you must assess the enemies, traps, and walls around you and act very quickly. The enemies start out simple enough, with easy-to-tell movement patterns. However, subsequent zones become muh trickier, with things and foes that mess with your position or require you to be very attentive of your surroundings. Managing and understanding is key in reaching the end of the game.There are a fair amount of extras here. In your regular runs you collect diamonds, which you use to unlock new items to find in your runs, upgrades like more life or a higher money multiplier, the opportunity to practice against bosses, and more. There are several different characters to play as, who all change the game in some manner, which can be as simple as requiring you to act in double time or as substantial as restricting your weaponry to bombs.The music is fantastic. As you may expect from the title, it's all very dancable stuff. I seriously would listen to this at a party. Perhaps the best part is the various ways it's mixed when you enter certain areas. The graphics are in a pixel style and it looks and animates well enough.In summary, Crypt of the NecroDancer takes rhythm and dungeon crawling elements together and brings out the best of both of them. Combine that with a great soundtrack, and the end result is a game that comes highly recommended.Also, NecroDancer is a superb pun. I mean, it's simple and thematically appropriate!			"

								Can't stop playing this since I bought it yesterday. Catchy music, interesting enemies/items, randomly generated levels, and some challenging parts! I haven't played too much yet, so this could be in the game somewhere, but one thing I hope gets added is a list of spell/item descriptions. I still don't know what some of the rings do and when I find a new spell scroll I just cast it randomly just to see what it does so I know for the next time I find it.As a forewarning I wouldn't recommend having anyone else near you while you play if you have a mechanical keyboard. Especially if they're trying to sleep.10/10 would get murdered by my girlfriend again.			"

								Holy Jeezus phuuuck, this is an amazing game. I highly recommend getting the soundtrack when purchasing, because if you don't you'll wish you had after playing.A rhythm-game dungeon-crawler rougelike? What about that phrase doesn't spell the word ""awesome?"" Nothing! There are only the movement buttons: they cover moveing, attacks, items, spells, etc. and it works all so well. You can only move on the beat, and that's what makes the game what it is, and what makes it so fun.It's a very well executed take on a unique combination of genres. It is HARD, like Nintendo-hard, which is refreshing. When you think you finally get it, the game will hit you with a curve ball. And then you'll think you got it again, and you've re-learned how it *really* works, but NOPE it's shaken things up again.I'd like to see this ported to consoles, the dev deserves money. Hell, buy it even if you're not going to play it. This was obviously an act of love, and this behaviour should be encouraged.			"

			Crypt of the NecroDancer is a hardcore roguelike rhythm game. Can you survive this deadly dungeon of dance, slay the NecroDancer, and recapture your still beating heart?		

Bottom line: Great game for anyone who likes rythm games and/or roguelike games.			"

												Since this is both a dungeon crawler AND a rhythm game, I've had people ask which one is more prominent. Personally, I would say it plays more like a rhythm game, given almost all mechanics of the game play into that strength. I absolutely love this game myself, and I would definitely reccommend it to anyone who has enjoyed rhythm games in the past, or even those of you with musical talents - keeping the beat will just flow with you. If you like the dungeon crawler aspect but are a bit iffy with rhythm games, I would suggest trying a demo or something to see if it sits right with you. As far as I know, however, this game is a very sound investment. Plus, new DLC came out fairly recently, proving that the game is still expanding, and the devs are still active (neither of which can be said for a lot of games nowadays).			"

								One of the best games I've played in a long time. It's a mix of Spelunky and Binding of Isaac's zone and random item mechanics, all smushed in with a dungeon crawler and a rhythm game. It's fairly unforgiving but not deathly hard (unless you do hardcore mode or above, but that's expected).It's definitely worth a play if you're a fan of rhythm games or dungeon crawlers regardless. The soundtrack is probably one of the most solid soundtracks I've heard on a game in quite a while, and even after 16 hours I'm still not tired of it and want to keep playing (though trying to resist due to waiting for missing content to be finished).The game's in Early Access but you wouldn't notice it if it weren't for zone 4 being unfinished, so it's definitely in a fun playable state already and the only places it can go is up. There's a lot more content on it's way but there's no harm picking it up now, you'll definitely get your money's worth if you enjoy any of the genres within.			"

												This game is easily my favorite game of 2016.  The soundtrack is amazing which is important since you'll be using the audio cues for movement.  When buying the game, I assumed I would want to play with my own mp3s.  That is absolutely not the case (I cannot stress enough how well crafted the music is).  The four zone bosses are awesome and unique with their own soundtrack that matches their theme.  The difficulty curve is perfect.  Once you start to master a zone, you move to the next zone and are immediately given a healthy dose of humility as the basic enemies brutalize you and it's time to learn brand new enemy patterns all over again.  Because of the diamond upgrade system you don't feel bad for dying and it keeps the items you find in chests less complex until you master them and are ready for shiny new spells/weapons/stuff.  Because the levels are random, they never get boring or predictable.  And here's the real kicker.  Each different character you unlock has a different playstyle which changes how you play the levels completely.  I recently found out that some characters have different remixes of the standard songs too which is amazing.Honestly, I cannot recommend this game enough.  If you enjoy a challange and like dungeon exploration games that require you to think rather than level stats, this game is for you.			"

								Absolutely amazing. I never thought there would ever be a roguelike-rythm game, but here we are, and it's executed in such a way that this will probably end up being my favorite game of the year. The game is played using just arrow keys for movement and item usage, and it works really well.The game appears as a standard roguelike dungeon crawler; you make tactical choices in turn-based style battles, find equipment and try to battle your way through dungeons. The difference is that the game focuses on forcing the player to keep in step with the beat of the song for movement and actions (traditionally what you'd consider to be ""turns""), giving the player a bonus in gold which can be used to buy equipment if done without flaw. Failing to move with the beat will result in a missed action while all the enemies take a turn and losing this bonus.I don't think I've ever played an RPG so easy to get into, yet challenging on many levels. It has a fun plot that works with the premise of the mechanics and the voice acting is actually very good. The music is superb, and if it's not your thing you can use your own music to power the gameplay. I don't even think I have anything I could say needs improving. It supports controllers and even dance pads. There's a slightly less difficult mode meant specifically for playing with dance pads. They already have a character that doesn't need to move in time, turning the game into a traditional roguelike dungeon crawler if you want to get used to the game or want to take a break from the rythm aspects of the game. I mean, they thought of everything and the game is super polished, all that seems to be missing is four characters and the last zone (which I haven't even reached yet). This is seriously a game I wish I had helped made.			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is a cross of both rhythm game and turned based  RPG in where you have to move along to the beat of the song and keep a steady rhythm to get a higher combo count. Every note counts as a turn and missing a note resets your combo as well as costs you a turn. This is a game in where you must have must both quick reflexes and foresight since you don't have much time to think. Your enemies also move along to the beat of the song so you can estimate how long it will take them to reach you and plan accordingly. Movement is grid based so you move square by square and the only buttons you will need during the game are the arrow keys. You attack by moving next to an enemy and hitting the arrow direction they are in and stranger still is that you use your bombs by holding the down and left arrow. There are also spells and other items that are activated by holding the up and right keys. As you can no doubt tell this is a rather strange control scheme and it does take some time to get used to. It is a strange gameplay concept to explain properly and there is nothing else like it on the market so I would suggest looking up some gameplay videos to see if this is your cup of tea. The levels are split up into 4 zones accessible via the hub-world where you can also purchase new items and weaponry that randomly spawns in the level once purchased. To purchase these items you will need diamonds which are semi rare collectibles scattered around the levels. Once you either die or pass that zone you will be tossed to the hub-world and will be able to spend your diamonds. Be wary though as entering any level will reset your diamonds back to zero so always make sure to spend them before heading back into the action. Another important collectible found in levels is gold which can be used to purchase unlocked weapons and items from shops. If you don't have any gold when you find a shop you can also blow up the golden walls of the shop to collect the debris and buy your items that way, the shopkeeper won't mind his walls being blown up funnily enough. One of the really neat things about this game is that the levels are destructible and you start off with a shovel that allows you to create your own paths through them and search for hidden goodies. There is a time limit for each level however, so if the song finishes you are immediately dropped down to the next level via a trapdoor. Each zone  has three levels that lead to a boss fight and you will want to be well equipped when you face one of them.  Bosses are randomly generated so you will not face the same boss each attempt but all of them will take quite a bit of skill to defeat. One of the easier ways to handle bosses is to pick up a spear if you are lucky enough to find one as it can attack from two blocks away meaning you can attack it from a safe place. That is easier said than done however since missing a beat will cost you a turn which can have dire consequences. You need to have a good rhythm at all times and that is very hard to do when you have to press two keys at the same time to use an item or spell. Keeping an unbroken rhythm also makes any gold you collect be worth much more, so the better you are at doing that the higher your chances of survival. If you find a key and save someone from a cage you will unlock a new character which play differently from our original heroine. One of them fights by only using bombs, another character can't attack but all exits are unlocked and one of the characters even gets rid of the rhythm part of the game entirely, allowing you to move whenever you want and take your time. There are quite major changes to the gameplay from character to character which makes this game's replayablity really high.  Crypt of the Necrodancer is brutal and you will be dying a lot until you unlock some better gear with diamonds. It has randomly generated levels so learned the pattern of them is not an option and it is more than happy to toss out a bunch of enemies. Learning how to fight each enemy is integral to be able to hold your own as some will roll toward you on sight leaving you with little time to move but hitting it on time will send it spiraling back to whence it came. Weapons also have their own quirks to them such as crossbows having to be reloaded but give you great range and rapiers will cause your character to rush in to attack an enemy two blocks away. Finding armor will lower the amount of damage you take and a torch will increase your view distance. This game is much more complex than it may appear and knowledge will be your greatest strength in these funky crypts. On the hubworld, the Beastmaster’s area allows you to pick any enemy you like and practice against them to your hearts content. It is not unlocked from the beginning as he is locked in a cage and must be freed in order to show up in the hubworld. There is a story but it is very forgettable and unimportant.  As is expected of a rhythm game the music is very catchy and fit the tongue in cheek feel of the game very well. Each stage has its own unique song and if you ever get tired of them there are a few other remixed soundtracks you can choose from, such as a Metal version. You can even use your own music but the notes don't match up at all to the songs making it very hard to keep a steady rhythm. It is an extra option so I can't really knock it but I can't imagine too many people wanting to use it. Crypt of the Necrodancer supports Steam Workshop and there are quite a bit of mods to keep you entertained such as one that changes your character into Hatsune Miku and even one that overhauls the whole game to have a Mario Bros aesthetic. There is plenty of content in the base game and the levels being randomly generated insures that you will have a different experience each playthrough. What it ultimately comes down to is if you like the strange gameplay on offer here and would like to once again suggest looking up a gameplay video. I'd imagine it would be much more fun to use a dancepad and a large TV to play this but using the keyboard works well enough too. Crypt of the Necrodancer is a unique experience you can't get anywhere else and tons of fun to boot.			"

												I am GoingTo the CryptOF THE NECRODANCER!I did not know what to expect. A Hardcore Rythm based Roguelike? So I watched the trailer and got hooked. Then I got it and I am absolutely amazed.the basic priciple is like a turn based roguelike - when you move the enemies move according to their pattern. You crawl through randomly generated floors, try to find a boss monster, kill it and find the exit to the next floor. But what sets this apart is the rythm component. Because you can only move on a beat of the background music. And every beat makes the enemies move as well.The Pixel art, albeit simple looks amazing. the Music gets you pumped and theres allways something new to discover.the Gameplay and Action itself is tight. As in, you could take it slow, but if you so much as miss a beat, your multiplicator gets reset. Which means less gold and probably less equipment in turn, so you have to keep the rythm, move every beat and make quick decisions. And if the song runs out, the floor is over. the music, Kick♥♥♥♥♥ The way it should be for any rythm based game. But if you dont like it, you can use your own library to fill the floors with life.the geme itself keeps you frustrated enough to make you wanna try again, because every enemy behaves in a certain way and you can train combat against them pretty early on - so if you die its because you got careless.oh, and the shopkeepers voice is divine. Get the Soundtrach edition if you can.10/10[1.0 Update]HO-LY-CRAP! I literally mean, Holy Crap! What they did with this is Divine.I mean before the game was a 10/10 but now. Wow. just Wow.new characters each with their own feel. Bard for easy Mode, other chars for extra challenges (like one that can lay infinite bombs and can kick them a few spaces ahead. Another one can only move in 2 space intervals.The 3 main chars, Aria, Melody and Cadence now have little cutscenes after each Level, Bosses enter with an awesome Intro screen and announcement. the remastered Metal and Electro OST, that will play for Melody and aria are just Eargasmic.If the Early access version was 10/10, this version is a 12/10.I would love to give this two thumbs up, if possible			"

												Game is good.Please stop sending me death threats nowYeah okay what do you exect to read here? Everyone is saying this game is good so what can my review bring to the table that is missing from all the glowing praise?I'll tell you.Crypt of the Necrodancer should be hauled up on a pedestal for the whole world (of gaming) to see for one, very simple reason.replays on leaderboard!I could gripe and complain all day but if you play ANY steam game with a leaderboard then their is one thing you will see over and over again and that is hackers and hacked scores.Now I don't hate hackers but when I look at leaderboards I want to know how that person got that score and how I can improve my own gameplay.See, the score itself is the result and while a good result is impressive seeing all the crazy stuff you people get upto is just as good, so if you own this game I urge you to check out some replays.They taught me to blow up the shopkeeper.I wish I had more to say about the game but I would just be mimicking everything that every other review has had to say about the game at this point.Also even when I didn't initially recommend the game, I still stand by the fact that the music is great and the ability to import your own music is also great so that hasn't changed (which is good).If you struggle with the timing system, switch to bard and you can still enjoy the game as a traditional Rogue-Like game. Isn't that neat?I will be watching 'Brace yourself games' very closely because they really went all out in making the game accessible, which is a rarity.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												I picked this up in early access, had a great time and set it aside to see how much better it could get.  Now I've got a rogue-light that's beautifully animated, brutally difficult with a boisterous soundtrack on my hands.  On top of that, Crypt of the Necrodancer has an array of laid back to nail-bitingly hard characters, all sorts of game modes (one of which makes the game easier for players that might want to use an actual dance pad to play, I gotta try that sometime) and even local cooperative play.

Early Access Review
								Initially I had a really negative vibe from this game. I was frustrated because I found the rhythm aspect of the game overwhelmingly difficult, not because it is necessarily, but more likely it’s my lack of ability to time my movements right, and I found it hard to watch the in-game metronome while doing everything else. This is more of a personal problem though, and it doesn’t really reflect on the game.However, I learned that there is another class called bard available from the start of the game. The bard can move freely without the concern of coordinating with the beat, and the monsters move when the player moves; more akin to a traditional roguelike. Playing bard has made the game enjoyable to me, and I look forward to possibly taking on the challenge of playing with the other characters later. The game is well designed, and I’m impressed with the level it’s at for still being in development. The soundtrack is worth noting, it’s really good, and the pixel art is also very nostalgic, and in my opinion, it fits the game perfect. Everything you would expect from a roguelike is there too, but with a spin, and I respect the developers creativity coming up with something so unique. The play style may not be appealing to everyone, but the game will (and should) still be recognised as a good game.Everything considered Crypt of the Necrodancer is a pretty cool game for alpha. I sincerely hope that development continues, and the game is finished. A successful pre-release all to often results in games being abandoned and pretty much just left in their current state.			"

												This game seemlessly blends dungeon crawling, rouge-like elements and rhythm-based gameplay together for a very enjoyable experience. If you're a fan o any of these three genres, I highly recomend checking it out! Just be warned, as with most rouge-likes (and rythym games, if you ask me), this game is very difficult. Not a bad thing at all, just know going in that you're in for a challenge.			"

Early Access Review
								There hasn't been a game like this one before, or at least not to my knowledge. There are plenty of games in which the player displays their ability to comprehend music and beat, and there are a fair number of games where the player explores a dungeon, travelling deeper and deeper, growing in strength as their enemies become tougher and tougher, where any misstep will result in a ""game over"" screen and the option to start over from square one. I don't think mixing these kinds of games has ever been done before, and I'm in love with the result!Crypt of the Necrodancer isn't just a groovy music game, nor is it just a dungeon-crawling roguelike - it's both. It's a very demanding game, as it requires quick thinking and decision-making, and throughout the whole experience you will absolutely want to groove in place, getting as deep into those juicy tunes as you can. Play it with a keyboard or a dance mat; you'll have extreme fun no matter which way you play.I have nothing but praise for this game, and it isn't even finished yet. Even when I began playing in advance of the early access hitting steam, I never once felt like my money was misplaced. Even if this game were never finished, it'd still be worth every penny I spent on it.Are you even slightly interested in what this game has to offer? No need to wonder any longer; snag this one and lose yourself in it for a while.			"

												Finally the Full Release is here for NecroDancer! I got it in Early Acces a few months ago and could see the evolution of this game into the great game that we have now. But what is Crypt of the NecroDancer exactly?Well, it calls itself a Roguelike  Rhythm game - and what that means is, that as opposed to your usual Roguelike game, you will have to follow the beat of the music (the Standard soundtrack is produced by Danny B., and trust me, it's possibly his most awesome work). There are also 2 greatly done remixes of the Soundtrack that you can select, in addition to that you can also choose your own custom music.The main difficulty comes from learning the patterns of the enemies, weapons, what items and shrines do and how to manage all of this while keeping the rhythmn. Now that might sound overwhelming at first but the game has a beat system that is fairly lenient, which means that you can be half a beat off without losing your multiplayer and screwing up. Which is good since the monsters will make you sweat bullets later on. Patterns in the beginning are fairly easy though, so don't worry about getting stuck from the beginning.The Lobby system of NecroDancer allows you to train against monsters, bosses and practice with different weapons, so that you can find out why that red bat utterly destroyed you last time. Aside from that you can earn Diamonds when you play the separate zones to unlock items to find in the same mode. The All zones mode has everything unlocked item wise from the beginning, but it is advisable that you learn the ropes by starting with just Zone 1. Generally it is a good idea to practice with Zones separately if you have problems with them. Once you are familiar, you will probably stick with going trough all Zones, similar to how Spelunky works, to build up good equipment over the run.Every run is different, as the layouts get randomly generated. There is a fair variety of items, from weapons to rings, weapons, spells, potions that give you an extra life to boots that make you light as a feather (advised for escaping from fire and ice!). Generally speaking, and that is the second comparison to Spelunky, you should be able to get through even with your base equipment, since Crypt of the NecroDancer is mostly skill and Rhythm based. However, getting a Bow, Spear, Long Sword or other weapons will give you more range and/or different attack patterns which you can use to get an advantage over your fellow Golems, Goblins, Slimes, Bats and many, many more monsters. The variety of enemies is huge and you will learn to love and hate most of them.Each Zone is separated in three level Levels with a mini boss at the end (you will love Red Dragons) and one Boss Level. For the first three Zones, you will face a random Boss, the fourth has a special one. The boss fights have unique songs and all very well done, reaching from playing a well paced Chess game to keeping the beat against a Death Metal Skeleton Master.The is also a roster of different characters with varying difficulty to them. Your standard character is Cadence and she is pretty straight forward, while other characters have some unique movement patterns or restrictions attached to them. If you feel like playing a classic roguelike game, you can choose the Bard. With him, you don't have to follow the beat. You make a move and then the monsters move afterwards. He is best used for learning patterns but be warned: it`s possible that you will struggle a bit with normal characters when you switch back to them. Another noteworthy character is Adria, if you screw up with the beat than you will face the fate of instant Death. Best used to either challenge yourself or to practice performing well under the positive stress of the beat ^^The game also offers a Daily Challenge, a seeded run that is the same for all players. You can also play in local co-op (the mode is a bit easier) with your buddies. And if you feel like it, you can also use a Dance Pad for it.All in all, I can recommend this game completely. It has been my go-to example of well done Early Access games and now that it is released, it's as of now my game of the year 2015. What is left to be said is me wishing you fun with it and thanking the awesome developers for listening to community feedback and polishing their game up to this gem that we have now.Since I reviewed this game, it also got some free, well done soundtracks added. Good to see such great long term support for a game.			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer has very good art direction, an amazing soundtrack and a stunning and innovative new mechanism, which forces you to dance through the dungeon to the beat of the soundtrack.I think the game concept is brilliant and really well executed. The soundtrack is worth buying on its own.However, I did not enjoy the game for much more than an hour.I pretty much have a non-existing feeling for rhythm and as such, the game was quite frustrating for me, as I was not able to make any progress.There is a character available from the start to redemy this, which does not require dancing to the soundtrack, but without it this central mechanism there are many more dungeon crawlers suited for that kind of playstyle.Verdict: Awesome, if you have rhythm, mediocre if you have none!

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is a truely amazing game that manages to combine a unique and incredibly well thought out concept with some excellent technical implimentation and design, not to mention the amazing art and soundtrack that perfectly complete the style of the game. For being only in beta it feels as polished as many completed game as it has for months and is one of the best experiances I have ever had. Both challenging for experianced players while not offputting for those who are new to the genre, and with a diverse range of control options, from traditional inputs to DDR pads, it has a lot to offer anyone who is willing to give it a shot.

												With 92 hours at the time of this review, I think its finally time I sat down and wrote a good review for this game. This review is going to be in a pro-con format so yah. Review Time! Pros -The story is very well made and interesting, and a good motivator to keep trying to beat the first character (Cadence)-Rhythm and Roguelike mashups that works perfectly-Nice difficulty curve-Lots of variety in runs and characters, so as to not feel repetitive (which it doesn't)-Amazing soundtrack with now 4 different variants (2 of them you can only get through workshop mods)-Every death is your fault, not the games-The gameplay is spot on, with each weapon feeling really fun to play-Local Co-op is very fun to play and is executed well-Amazing community-Practically infinite replayability with all the achievements and things to unlock-Steam Achievements/Steam trading cards-And so much more Neutral -The game is very difficult to get the hang of, considering its very different from other roguelikes (this isn't a bad thing, it's just a thing I thought I'd point out-Some of the characters are pretty difficult (Once again, not a bad thing, just something I thought I would point out.) Cons -Part of the story is unlocked by Aria, who is a VERY difficult character to beat, or even get anywhere with (luckily youtube exists)-Coda-That's it reallyOverall I give this game a 10/10. This game is honestly the best roguelike Ive ever played, with its awesome replayability, cool characters and a very interesting story, and its gameplay is spot onVery much recommend!			"

								Crypt of the NeroDancer is a very well executed game. The genre is a mix between rhythm and a dungeon crawler in which leaves the game with a new feeling I've never experienced. There is a lot to learn and a lot experience due to the random generation system that it features. The game is another one of those games where you must learn the tricks and rules that the game has laid out for you. Cause of this you feel like it is your fault when you make a mistake, and you will learn from them constantly. Crypt of the NecroDancer features one of the best OSTs I have ever heard, the rhythm and styles of the songs are varied (Note you can also add your own music. This system works quite well I found and it picks up the beat well.) . There are many unlocks (Items, spells, character upgrades, etc.) for it being in an early stage such as it is. This allows for variety in the way you dance your way through dungeons. This game also features unlockable characters that have their own gimmicks which change gameplay. I personally found myself playing as the main protagonist the most, but it is nice to have the option. Another feature in which I like is the ability to face against different mobs and bosses in a controlled environment. This will allow you to learn their patterns and figure out what works best against them. Recently added is the level editor in which allows a player to construct massive complex dungeons. Either that or try out different weapons and scenarios. Overall Crypt of the NecroDancer is a fantastic game in which will more than likely produce more than enough fun and frustration. I'd give this game a 9/10			"

												""No. This is a joke. This has to be a joke.""Said everyone ever when they first saw this game.I didn't come in expecting much. ""Oh, it's a 8-bit 'rythm based rogue-like'. Bet the devs made this on their coffee break at Starbucks.""My expectations were blown out of the water.First of all, it's hard. Like, actually hard. Yes, a ton of challenge comes from keeping the beat. And yes, the musically-challenged will suffer with this game. (Assuming you don't pick The Bard, who isn't affected by the music at all.)But the real challenge comes from all the enemies. They all have different patters that you have to memorize learn. It never felt like memorization. You can see every enemy well in advance, and the paths aren't too complex outside of the bosses.Secondly, it has a ton of depth.There are dozens of items. Nothing out of The Binding of Isaac or Risk of Rain, but enough to make the average indie rogue-like feel scared. They all fit into specific item slots: Head, Chest, Feet, Ring, Bag, Item, Magic, Weapon, and I'm probably forgetting something. Not only that, but all the weapons have specific types that alter in power and fighting style. No spoilers as to all the different weapons, but you will very quickly discover the strengths and weaknesses of all the weapons.And lastly, it's fun!The story is surprisingly strong. All the enemies are fun to fight. All the items feel unique. The music is great...Crypt of the NecroDancer is a game I'd highly suggest at least checking out. It might not be worth buying for those who aren't interested in Rogue-Likes or aren't very musically tallented, but I'd beg you to at the very least watch some gameplay footage of it.			"

								I can't get over how good the music is in this game. The gameplay itself is really simple, but incredibly difficult to get the hang of though. You need to constantly have a sense of rythmn to bop and tap along to. Once you understand what to do, its then time to worry about the endless items, chess games, conga lines, seemingly unkillable dragons, creepy- yet weirdly funky skellingtons, fake chests, fake walls, hot coals of death, combo-braking ice, rip-off shopkeeper, secret rooms, poisonous mushrooms and massive annoying trolls. Then theres the different playstyles of each character that you can play. Then there's the permadeath hardcore mode to try and master where you have to do all zones and conga-line bosses (God I hate the conga lines), or chessboard bosses in one run.Overall a neat little game worth getting.

												My first serious review.  This game has changed my opinion so much from the first time I played it I wanted to write this incase I can convince at least one other person who may have had similiar feelings as me when I first played it.I tried playing this game a few times as Cadence when I first got it.It was somewhat fun, although not enough to keep my attention.Then I tried playing as the Bard.  It was fun not having to worry about the beat of music, and instead just learning enemy movement and attack patterns.When you play as the Bard the whole game becomes turn-based.  Each move you make causes the enemies to do one movement.A solid rogue-like.  You basically play over and over until you get familiar with all the enemies, each time you feel yourself getting better and better at this game.I was in zone 2.  Just doing another run, when it hit me.  Even as the Bard I found myself moving to the beat of the music.  I was using my shovel to dig through dirt which added its own sound to the music playing.  I was realizing that some of the movements I was making when fighting a particular enemy was almost like doing dance moves.It hit me.  This game is freaking genius.  Playing through a few times as the Bard is almost a necessity and I wish the game developers would have somehow made it more obvious that this should be a first step.Binding of Isaac used to be my favorite Rogue-Like, now I can say without a doubt this is my new favorite.

												Steam is full of many indie greats. Brilliant, inventively crafted games that spring out of nowhere, and create gameplay formulas so well refined they earn themselves a place within the halls of all the greatest classic.Whether its the addictive simplicity of One Finger Death Punch, the relaxing, almost zen like experience of playingE uro Truck simulator, or the stylish assassinating that makes Mark of the Ninja so great, there are countless titles on this services whose quality is very difficult dispute.Crypt of the Necrodancer is one of those games.The game hits you right from the get go with its gorgeously bright pixel art, which serve far more purpose than simply creating being a retro aesthetic.The sharp, bright visuals bring the levels to life in a way that serves the gameplay perfectly, the vibrantly animated enemies movement (and dancing) to the beat in beautiful detailed fashion. The distinctively detailed enemy sprites don't just look great  - they serve to help you plan your attacks, always allowing you to quickly figure out what is going on, even when the hectic beat of the game's brilliant music threatens to eclipse your hand eye coordination.The bosses especially are a treat, but I don't want to spoil those here. You'll just have to buy the game and discover what they are like for yourself!Don't be at all surprise if you lose track of time playing this game. Progress is undeniably challenging but it has the ""one more go"" feeling down to perfection. The more you play, the more you learn the important strategies needed to beat the dozens of different enemies you encounter, the best items to help you progress, and the endless number of secrets. Then you unlock a new character, and the cycle beings all over again.There is nothing else like this game on the market, and there may never be again. On the surface it is like many rogue-likes, challenging and requiring plenty of time, patient and skill on your behalf, but its rhythmic beat is an addiction that completely changes the way you explore, the way you fight, and the way you win. If you have no sense of rhythm, this is not the game for you.This game deserves you attention.Did I mention Crypt of the Necrodancer's music is amazing? I did? Well, I'm telling you again. The music is amazing. The game is worth it for the music alone.			"

												A music game and a unforgiving dungeon crawler with heavy roguelike elements, all in one game. And it's not just a dungeon crawler with music game elements, or a music game with a dungeon crawl attached, it's a near seamless hybrid of both in a way that I never could have thought would work. But it does, so very well.A soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky means it's going to be good, and the tunes go well with the rapid, split-second pace you need to keep in order to stay ahead of the game. I'm not sure if it's extremely difficult or I just plain suck, but I still have yet to get overly far in it and consistently blunder into enemies as I try to stay on time to the beat so as not to lose my combo. It's embarrassing, really. But my own suckitude aside, this is a game that's just so much fun, especially once you start getting into the zone and responding to things before your brain can really process them. It strangely reminds me of Hotline Miami in that sense, but with less ultraviolence and more dancing skeletons. It is also now out of early access, and features a whole campaign, tons of unlockables and player characters with different playstyles, and daily challenges to keep you coming back. I must have rage quit this game a dozen times already but I keep wanting more, and it probably has something to do with those infectious beats. Nothing else is like it, and nothing else could do what it does as well as it does.			"

												Watched the trailer and thought to myself - another weird mashup? That combination would never work. Oh, how wrong it was. Music game and roguelike got melted in a really crafty way here. I spent a lot of time playing Adom and DCSS - and CotN, while not as complex, rankes high up near those two. The music-enforced turn time limit adds a new challenge to the genre creating a really enjoyable experience.			"

												Boy, This gameI love it, Moving around to the beat is a cool concept, And with the release of all of these soundtracks, There's tons that it naturally offers music-wiseAnd even if you don't want to listen to any of the five base soundtracks, You can even play to your own music, Which it naturally picks up the beat forWhat problems do I have? Well I suppose there's that sometimes the difficulty ramps up Immensely, But that's fun in its own right, Relying on luck helps to give pretty much everyone a chanceIt's interesting how it originally arose from time-based turn-based dungeon crawling and now it's all this, This amazingly fun and slightly addicting roguelike rhythmic dungeon crawler that everyone's lovingNow, Some notes for those of you who are a little suspicious of what this game might have to offerIf you don't like following the beat of the music, Well actually you're already prepared for! The bard turns the game from fighting the clock to a straight up strategy game where you can move whenever you want, And everything moves after you doIf the game's too slow, Bolt has you covered, Bard does too really, Bolt semi-requires you to move at twice the speed you'd normally have to move, But if that's too fast just know you're not FORCED to move at double speed (like Coda does)Now if the game's too fast you're semi-♥♥♥♥edYou COULD set your own custom music at a pace you're capable of handling, But then you're not using the default music, In case you wanted to do that, But none of the characters allow for halved beats or anything except for the Bard who doesn't have beatsDoes the game have diverse foes and 'friends' (as in playable characters here)? Yes, Yes it does10 characters, Each with their own rules and abilities, And a Lot of enemies to learn and dance withZone 4's a really interesting zone to work with with what it gives, But I won't spoil anything for anyone who wants a fresh experienceDoes the game challenge you? Oh hell yes it doesThis game will beat you down a lot if you don't learn how to give those beatbound beatdowns (haha that almost rhymed)Remember what Eli taught you, ""Every enemy has a predictable pattern, If you learn those patterns, You won't suffer so much as a single scratch"", Very important words (Also ♥♥♥♥ the bats, They don't follow a pattern except for ""every x beats, i will move some way"", So just stay out of their way when necessary)Is it fun? Depends on what it decides to give you and what you do with those items, Or if you go for no items, And if you actually like the game itselfThere are a lot of items and a lot of enemies to contend with, Some of the items will reward you for taking risks, Like sticking to half a heart for immense damage, Some of them will rewards you for not missing a beat (however no items will reward you for missing beats, so keep that in mind)Other items require you to be strategic or to not rush ahead too much in certain areas, Like the whip, Which gives you a good sideways range, But can get you killed if you're trying to move off hot coals and there are things in just two corners around you, Same with the spear, longswords or bows in directly forwards directionsSomething that could make it really fun is challenging yourself in many ways, Including (a way in which it rewards you for doing with an achievement) Not grabbing any items besides coins in two different situationsNow if you don't like the game itself, You're fine to hate it, I'll accept you not liking how it works, Or even how it looks, Atleast you triedAll in all, I really like this game, The diversity in items, weapons, equipment and enemies really is worked in well here, And with it all based around moving to a set speed based on the beat of the music is a very new concept to the dungeon crawler/roguelike area			"

It's addicting, the music is amazing, and different game modes, procedurally generated stages, and the option to play with your own music means you'll never get bored. It's one of the few early-access/beta games I've played that already looks and feels like a finished product, which makes me very excited for what they will add in the future.			"

								Crypt of the Necrodancer is a game with admirable paicing, even allowing players to choose their own pace with differing characters and custom music. Whilst still W.I.P. I have not noticed a single bug so far, that or my sense of immersion to the actual game in terms of the music and the battling of monsters is just that great that I miss those bugs. Either way, the game is looking great, players new to this game will quickly get punished by the games relentless dedication to movement/rythm based fighting, often meaning that anyone who jumps in unprepared will end up dying a lot.What does this say about the game? Maybe for the common, run of the mill gamer it might mean frustrating and unpreventable deaths. But to the dedicated gamer, those who use tutorials or at least have played a rythm game of some kind can grasp that everything requires key timing and a suprisingly large amount of strategy.Do I reccomend this game? Yes. As of this moment its £10.99 ($17.94, €13.85), if you have the money, I fully reccomend buying and trying this game to anyone who is interested in it. More importantly I reccomend it as a backing to this genre of gaming as it is not often you see Rythm based games being produced. I know right now that more and more companies are making music based rythm games, but there needs to be a larger supply of them. With the people who made this game I do hope they make more like this as this genre is genrally underated, undersold and the variety of game titles is just too small.			"

												I bought this game on sale and figured I'd get around to playing it eventually. Later that day, I sat down to play a different game, but decided to start Crypt of the NecroDancer up just to check it out.The next thing I knew, two hours had passed and it was time to get ready to leave to go to my in-laws for Christmas. I grabbed my laptop and installed it real quick so I could play it while I was out of town (the system requirements are really low, so it ran just fine).It might be one of the most addictive games I've ever played. I don't know how many times I've told myself, ""Just one more round,"" only to spend another hour with it.It's also very challenging in a Dark Souls kind of way. If you die, it's probably your fault. Instead of becoming frustrated, I only felt encouraged to try again and pay more attention to the movement patters of the enemies.Also, the soundtrack is fantastic. So many of the songs get stuck in my head, which just makes me want to play it more.It's my game of the year for 2015, hands down.			"

												That's just great. It's like playing a 2D Zelda game in a dance club.

You must first fail to improve your skills as well as the items you'll unlock throughout your runs.

								Driven mad by music.Their twisted souls, bound to the beat!Deliver beatdowns to the beat!I love Dungeons of Dredmor, The Binding of Isaac, etc. The Crypt of the NecroDancer is unique in the way that it adds the 'beat' element to it. Moving to the music as you play with every monster having a specific moveset they dance to themselves. This means you don't really have time to strategize your moves and just have to dance along with it!Sweet as heck.			"

I wasn't even expecting it to have a story.It may seem hard at first but after a while you get used to it, and if you think it isn't a good enough challenge or that it is way too hard you can even use your own music!

Crypt of the NecroDancer is IncredibleI got this game expecting to have a few hours of fun and then get bored. 20 hours of play time later, this is still not the case.This game is almost therapeutic to me. I have a lot of anxiety issues, and this game is such a great way to get my mind off of things. Just go with the flow and listen to some great music by Danny Baranowsky.Also, the customizability in this game is great. I do a lot of sprite work, so I've already sprited one of my original characters into the game. You can add your own music as well, but I have not explored this feature yet, so I cannot vouch for it.This game is also a great way to get some fun exercise if you have a dance pad. I bought a dance pad just to use it with this game.Even though this game is still in Alpha, I cannot recommend Crypt of the NecroDancer enough. The art style is great, the music is by Danny B so it's amazing by default, and it is fun to play. Get this game. Throw your money at this game. If you like rougelike games and have a good sense of rhythm, you will not regret your purchase.			"

It killed me.- I found a chest that could have a cool sword to help me kill more dancing enemies. It started dancing and killed me.- I bought a cool new shovel to help me find secrets. I dig into a wall and it starts dancing. It killed me.- I find something that's not actually dancing. It's a statue. I attack it. I'm teleported into a small room full of dancing dragons. They all kill me.10/10 would dance again			"

												Picked up on sale.  Another rogue-like game to enjoy.  The idea of movement based on the beat makes this game require some quick thinking.  This, like most rogue-likes the random drop can make or break players like me.  I found myself replaying levels all the time and hoping for certain drops.  Once you unlock some of the characters it allows you a little more freedom to play.  I took the bard out to solve all levels to get an idea of what I was getting into before I started to attempt with the main character.  Fun game for sure and pretty cool when you start to add your own songs into each of the levels.  Worth the pickup, but dont expect to be spending 100+ hours unless you have an extensive music library.			"

								YES.I never knew how much I needed a blend of roguelike and rhythm but this is all I wanted and all I never knew I wanted.Yes. This is exactly it. I love dungeoncrawlers. I love randomly-generated dungeoncrawlers. But there have always been something missing. Yes, the difficult combat, the constantly changing experience, making strategies against specialized enemies, those are all great, but there have always been something missing. Now I know what that is.Good God, that is dancing. W-wouldn't Recettear have been even better if you had to dancefight? Dungeons of Dredmor? Chocobo's Dungeon? Nethack? Or the game that gave the genre its name, Rogue?Yes. Yes it would. Don't fight me on this or by God I will dance you to the ground.			"

tl;dr -> Played this game, now I can't help but bob my head and bounce on my feet whenever I'm walking and hear an EDM beat. 11/10 disco dungeon dance-off simulator.NOTE: You can read my full review here[theroguereviews.com]I was fortunate enough to receive this as my first-ever review copy (yay!). Very, very excited to try this game because I adore the rogue-like genre and enjoy beatmatching when I mix my electronic dance music (EDM) at home. Crypt hit on many of the themes and concepts that I’ve always loved, and I thoroughly enjoyed my gameplay experience. This is easily one of the best staples available in the rogue-like genre.If you like rogue-likes, rhythm mechanics, dungeon crawling, electronic music (Danny Baranowsky’s score), and constantly unlocking new things, then you will really love this game.The aesthetics are great – the amount of detail in the different levels and characters is well-done. The retro, pixel graphics combine with the electronic musical score to provide a very fun, fast-paced experience reminiscent of old-school arcade games (including the high difficulty that usually accompanied them). Danny Baranowsky’s music is critical to the gameplay – since you have to time your movements with the beat – and fits well with the heavy rogue-like elements found in the game. If you are partial to electronic music, then you will enjoy the great soundtrack. If you don’t, however, like EDM and/or Danny’s style, then you can always use your own music (MP3 format). There is a unique track for each level, and you have the option of loading your own playlist for each level. Note, I have a very wide taste in music, so I tried an assortment of genres – EDM tracks work very well with the rhythm mechanics (because of the consistent beats per minute), but Ariana Grande (I love her) songs DO NOT work very well. That being said, Danny’s composition is fantastic, and I don’t mind replaying levels over and over again, listening to the same tracks every time. Another advantage of using EDM tracks in a custom playlist is the length – the levels end in line with the track playing, so EDM’s lengthier (on average) playtime gives you more opportunity to explore the floor. The story involves you falling into a dungeon, your heart being magically tied to an ominous beat that you must dance to.The controls are fairly easy to learn – a tutorial is offered that teaches you the basics of gameplay. I personally prefer using a controller over the keyboard, and I suggest you use that instead. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with rogue-likes and/or rhythm games. Before you start playing, you will have to do a latency test for visual (the heartbeats and beat prompts) and auditory (the actual beat) cues; you can redo the test whenever you want. There is an “easy” mode that you can play, however, I sincerely think you will find a fair challenge playing the regular difficulty. Also, if you want a break from the beatmatching, you can play as a character (Bard) who does not have to move in time with the beat.Difficulty is something this game does very well, especially for a rogue-like. Characters you unlock will usually have harder playing conditions (ex: cannot kill enemies, die when you pick up gold), ramping up the challenge factor. To combat this, you can unlock a character/room that allows you to practice against the different enemies you may encounter – this allows you to recognize their movement/attack patterns and how to best deal with them. A character/room also exists that allows you to train against mini- and regular bosses. I highly recommend you at least check these out once you have them available, especially if you are having difficulty progressing through the levels. There is even a room that provides levels where you can learn advanced tactics, like how to kill the shopkeeper in different ways. I appreciate this approach to difficulty because it provides you with the tools to improve your playstyle, should you so choose.Gameplay involves you moving around a grid-based dungeon floor, most times in synchrony with the beat (unless you are playing as the Bard). Monsters on the floor also move in time with the beat, and they attack based on a chess/checkers-style pattern – if you move onto a tile that a monster was about to move to, you will take damage. Also, if you move into the attack range (varies based on the monster) of a monster, you will take damage if it is ready to attack – they usually have an animation cue (ex: skeletons raise their arms) to let you know an attack is incoming. To take advantage of monster movements (all units have to move each beat, or “turn.”), you can do things like backtrack or hit a wall (which will keep you on the same tile). As you progress through the level, monsters will drop gold. To increase the amount of gold dropped, you will have to build up your gold multiplier by hitting all track beats (when you move/attack) within a small window. Every time you miss a beat or take damage, your multiplier will decrease by an increment. Picking up armor will decrease how much damage you take, but will not affect your multiplier. Gold is used to purchase items from the large variety of stores available. Multipliers are especially effective when paired with multiplier-based equipment (ex: damage dealt is based on your current multiplier).Overall, the game is an immense amount of fun and always a fair, interesting challenge.If you are any bit interested in the rogue-like series or rhythm gameplay, then I implore you to give this game a try. It definitely is one of the best rogue-like titles available today.ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue ReviewsMy Website[theroguereviews.com] "

								A dungeon crawler with a musical twist! A unique game that combines dungeon crawling with music rhythm gaming. The player moves the character with the beat of the music and the same goes for attacking as well. Monsters have their own unique move sets so it is important to take note of the attacking pattern of each monster. All in all a very novel game idea and fun to boot.			"

Early Access Review
Unexpectedly Brilliant!I had been browsing Steam for at least an hour, looking for something that might hold my interest for more than a few minutes. By the time this game turned up, I was not very hopeful. The gloomy title conjured up images of a tedious slog through yet another Tolkein knock-off world. The screenshots reminded me of a hundred junk titles that bill themselves as ""retro"" and ""8-bit"" to lure long-time gamers into parting with their money in a quest to recapture good memories from their childhood. The description, touting the unlikely fusion of roguelike and rhythm genres, left me almost certain that this was nothing more than a concept gimmick that would fail to meet even the lowest of expectations.I could not have been more wrong.Crypt of the NecroDancer is the most inspired, refreshing contribution to gaming that I have encountered in years. This game blends the simplest and most predictable mechanics with enough variety to be challenging and so much creativity that even casual players will have a whole lot of goofy fun. I've played countless times over the past few weeks, died in most of them, and found myself smiling anyway, because it was almost always my own fault rather than the result of an impossible situation or bad user interface, and because it's easy to jump right back in.Each creature has a specific pattern of movement with consistent restrictions, and is easily identifiable on sight, so you can usually predict what it will do next. It will always move on the beat of the music. Press one of the four direction buttons, and you'll move, interact with an obstacle, or attack an enemy in that direction. Do it on the beat, or you'll be sorry. Use items from your inventory by pressing two buttons at once. Following these rules, you'll find yourself learning the patterns of movement (or dances) required to subdue each monster and make your way deeper into the dungeon.On top of that solid foundation sits a cast of unique bosses, playable characters with different abilities, unlockable upgrades, training areas, cooperative mode, instant replays, a level editor, gamepad and dance mat support, cross-platform compatibility, a surprisingly good chiptune-style soundtrack, and the ability to import whatever music your dungeon-crawling heart desires.And it's still only an alpha.Outstanding work, Brace Yourself Games. You shattered the preconceptions of this linux-using nethack fan. Now take my money.			"

												Fun, original, and imaginative take on the Gauntlet-styled dungeon-crawler. As you can guess from the trailers (and title), NecroDancer is a brilliant twist on the ""keep-the-beat"" music games such as Guitar Hero, Elite Beat, and Dance Dance. The graphics are nice and clean. Enemies are well-designed. Levels are procedurally generated ala Diablo, but are small enough that you don't ever feel frustrated or lost. The game has a very gradual difficulty curve that starts out easy but can become quite challenging. There are many different characters to unlock with their own playstyles and challenges, including a class that doesn't even have to keep the beat at all, for those of you who would like to just play at your own tempo (or have a poor sense of musical timing.)The highlight of the game is of course the absolutely fantastic soundtrack, but even if you're not a fan of the music itself, you can just set up your own playlist and play along with whatever music you like.I very strongly recommend this game at any price point!

Posted: December 26, 2015
												Crypt of the NecroDancer has ruined my life. I hear its catchy tunes in my head while I eat. I tap out the rhythm of dungeons in my car. And my children keep asking me what that funky song I'm humming all the time is. I can't stop thinking about this game, despite the fact it is deceptively hard and I may never actually get past Zone 3. So let me tell you why you should suffer the same fate.In classic roguelike tradition, Crypt is an adventure through randomly-generated dungeons with randomly-generated loot to find and use on randomly-generated monsters. It's all laid out in a pleasing grid of pixel art, controlled solely with the arrow keys. Special items are used by pressing two directions at once, and attacks are as simple as pushing towards an enemy in range. Unlike other roguelikes, there's no random element to attacks. Everything has a set number of hearts, and if you hit it (or it hits you), you take the prescribed amount of damage. Monsters have set patterns to their attacks, meaning there are really no surprises to combat.The catch here is that everything is set to the music, and you have to move on the beat. Enemies won't wait for your turn, either, because they're jamming to the same rhythm. Miss a beat and you effectively lose your turn. Suddenly this otherwise simple, predictable game becomes one of concentration and quick thinking. You need to be moving or attacking with every beat, and if you're focusing on keeping cadence, you're not focusing on strategy. Fortunately the game is desgined with this in mind, offering a robust tutorial, multiple practice modes, and even a second character unlocked from the start that can ignore the beat. There are four zones to conquer, each three levels and a boss. Beating the previous one unlocks the next, allowing you to skip ahead. You can also collect diamonds to purchase upgrades and new items to add to the random pool.There's a terrible secret behind this welcoming facade, though. All of this is essentially an elaborate, extended tutorial for All Zones mode, which challenges you to beat all four zones in order, starting with the full item pool unlocked but no upgrades to your character. This is the proper roguelike mode for the game, and it is incredibly difficult to get through. Missed beats and damaging mistakes mount up fast enough to make beating individual zones a challenge, and starting essentially from scratch means your strategies have to be second nature. Unless the rhythm is in your blood, mastering Crypt is going to take a lot of time and a lot of practice.Don't let that dissuade you from trying the game, of course. There's plenty to see and do even if you never touch All Zones mode. The many characters to unlock play like entirely different games, and you can access quite a few just by playing the individual zones. As expected from a rhythm-based game, the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and is sure to get permanently stuck in your head. Even if you keep getting mauled by mambo'ing skeletons, you're sure to come back for more. I really may never get past Zone 3 but I'm having too much fun to stop now.			"

												This game is pretty fun for a while, until the novelty fades. But as some others have pointed out, it's not just really difficult, it's just flat out unfair at times. After countless deaths, and getting nowhere with certain characters (which you need to finish the game with to unlock others) such as the Monk that DIES when he touches gold, the game just becomes a frustration and it's obvious the insane difficulty is being used to pad the game which has quite a lack of content. There are only four levels (with four stages each) and if you are able to complete the game you can do so in about 30 minutes or less. Now, I could understand the Monk being harmed for touching gold, but dying just for touching it seems a bit ridiculous to me. Then there's Eli, who can kick bombs (of which he has an infinite supply). Sound badass? He's not. That's his only weapon and when you come across the enemies that push you around the map it's almost impossible to kill them without hurting yourself first. To make matters worse, instead of having several completely different sounding songs to play on each level, there are only a few (you need to turn them on by yourself) that are more like remixes. You have the option to add your own music to the game, but no random option for that. This has apparently been in the works for 2 years. Unless you have a lot of patience to lose over and over, playing for hours and accomplishing nothing, I wouldn't recommend this game. Once again, it was fun for a while, but I think I will quit before I break another keyboard.			"

								What a phenomenal game, I just played it for 40 minutes as of writing this review and I am addicted, I can hear the beat in my ear and it won't go away, GOD HELP MECrypt of the NecroDancer is a must get for any roguelikes fan, if you are not a fan of rougelikes then it depends, but you still gotta try it if the price allows, it is a standard roguelike that follows a gradual upgrade system, you get to slowly expand your library of items by purhasing item upgrades and also permanent hp upgrades and whatnot, what makes this SO special is the twist of music, basically its a game with aweosme music playing in the background and you are required to play by the beat of the music, with every beat you get to perform one action, move, attack, move, attack,move,move,move,move,attack all following the beat of the music,with each enemy having a unique moving pattern, shops and whatnot, this game is beautiful in its very unique and brilliant way, as of right now it is still in early access but it has every right to be full released because right now its just slowly being updated with new stuffs, the gameplay is already 10/10 solid			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is an amazing take on the Dungeon Crawler genre while also putting in a spice of rhythm making the game enjoyable and better to listen to. Every rhythm game needs a decent soundtrack to succeed. Not only did Danny B. (Also known for his music in BoI and Super Meat Boy) fill this quota but Rival (known for his Electro Dubstep type music) and FamilyJules (Creator of several Metal Covers on OSTs.) made this game's soundtrack amazing. Not only that, but the characters are rememberable and make you actually feel for them, giving you different gameplay for each character, which is where Crypt of the Necrodancer gets it's replayability. These are the reasons why I still come back every day to this game. The art looks fresh and actually makes you wanna stop and see how your character moves to the beat of the music. This game also supports Steam Workshop, giving you the ability to play as a jiggling piece of bread if you wanted to. All of this for the decent price of $14.99 makes me believe that ANYONE, whether you enjoy Roguelike Dungeon Crawlers or the Music Lover that listens to game soundtracks in their daily lives can enjoy Crypt of the Necrodancer.

												That's pretty much turn-based roguelike game, but you have somewhere like 0.5 seconds to think about your next turn. Simple controls that include just 4 directional buttons and simple interactions with objects, but high variety of equip, enemies, shrines, portals, tactics and much more.9 singing shopkeepers out of 9P.S. Be carefull, because next few days after playing that game you'll continue to walk with rhythm in real life.			"

								I'm having great fun with this game.  More than that, I'm fully loving it!It's a unique and wonderful idea to combine a rhythm dancing game with true rogue-like gameplay.  The game has a great range of pickups, gameplay options, different playable characters, etc.  It just feels so well made.Necrodancer has a brilliant soundtrack by Danny Baronowsky, who also did the music for Super Meat Boy.  I'll buy any game with his name on it, no questions asked!  (and the soundtrack too)They've made the game cross-platform for Linux / Mac / Windows.  I do 99% of my gaming on Linux and I really appreciate the Linux support.You can play with keyboard or a controller, or real dance pads.  I've ordered a pair of dance pads to play it the hard way.  I might even get fit.  There's a two-player co-op option, so I can play with my wife or kids and use both the pads.  The game is challenging enough with plenty of variety to keep me playing while I lose some weight necrodancing like a fool!Although this is an early access game, it already has more options and features than most ""full release"" games:  training halls to practice battling different monsters and bosses (if you can pay the entry fee!), a huge variety of pickups and upgrades, hardcode mode, local co-op, daily challenge...  I don't recall another game with so many great options.  The procedural generation gives a great variety of levels, on a par with Spelunky.In short, buy this game already!			"

												Great game.  Wasn't expecting to like it so much.  A roguelike that is both challenging and fair.  You constantly feel like you're progressing as you learn enemy patterns and use your diamonds from each run to purchase new gear that shows up in the dungeons.  Every enemy has a pattern that can be learned and exploited. You almost always die in this game because you weren't good enough, not because the game cheated you.  Easily one of the best games I've played over the last year.  Dat fake shopkeeper though, wasn't ready......			"

												There's lots of ways to define a good game, none of which are necessarily wrong. Instead of saying what makes this game good, I'll say what makes playing it more enjoyable.When a game has nice gameplay, you can typically tell. When a soundtrack was made to compliment said gameplay, you can also tell. The music in NecroDancer was more than made to compliment the gameplay; it was made to be a key part of gameplay, as well as to simply enjoy - whether that be in-game or on it's own. You can even implement your own music if you so choose, furthering the possibilities.Now, as for the overall gameplay, I'll make this simple:- Do you like dungeon crawlers?- Do you like Rougelikes?- Do you like pixelated graphics?- Do you like kick♥♥♥♥♥soundtracks?- Do you like Metal or EDM?If you said yes to any of these, I suggest giving NecroDancer a try.If you said yes to a 2 or more of these, I HIGHLY recommend giving NecroDancer a try.If you said yes to all of these, why the hell haven't you played it yet?! This game was made for you!			"

								With only three hours in this game, it's already my third favorite indie game of all time (behind Bastion and To the Moon). An extremely difficult permadeath game, Crypt Of The Necrodancer is one of the few difficult games I have that manages to be difficult, but not ragequit material. Every death feels fair- you died because you have something else to learn about that enemy, or you weren't prepared enough. It's rather frustrating for a little after you're thrown into a new zone to relearn different strategies for the new monsters, but the moment you manage to finally figure out what to do it's a wave of power unlike anything. And then you die to another monster and try again- but you don't care because now you're one step closer. The music is fantastic (though the shopkeeper's voice is slightly annoying) and moving to it becomes very simple because of how well written the music is. I haven't tried with custom music yet, but I'm looking forward to it and continuing to play the game.			"

								This game is the best rhythm game I have ever played. The game is not finished but it is still really good. If you like games where you kill monsters in classic pixel lands, then you should play this. Be wary of a steep learning curve though, it takes time to get used to moving to the rhythm and slaying beasts. While you can change the music on this game I have yet to do so. The music is good enough to listen to for hours on end. The music is made by Danny Baranowsky the creator of many amazing game sound tracks such as Super Meat Boy. There is also a hardcore mode where you get no upgrades and have to start from the ground up each death. You can also do this as a daily challenge to see how you stack up to other players traversing the same dungeon layout as you.			"

								This is hands down one of the best examples of why Early Access should be a thing. Amongst the piles of early access games that are slow to update, have uncommunicative developers, and don't strives for self-improvement, Crypt of the NecroDancer continues to add more content and build upon itself.And it is ALREADY worth its price.A clever blend of rhythm game and rogue-like, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a fun challenge that urges your every move to be carefully thought out and chosen...in the length of a beat. The music is incredibly catchy, the bosses and characters are charming, the design is delightfully elegant, and the different playstyles made available always keep things fresh. And there's still more characters, zones, and content to come!I've yet to try out the importing of custom music, nor have I used the custom level editor to its fullest potential. But I honestly can't say I'm missing out; I'm still addicted to the game's levels as they are!Do yourself a favor. Buy it. Support the developers. And bide your time until you can confront the NecroDancer in a lethal tango.			"

								Highly recommended.Plays like a full release - though content is still being added and refined all the time.Terribly fun, and perhaps addicting. Don't loose the beat. You have very limtied health, and really the game is not very forgiving. You get hit, and it's a serious thing. Best part is that you have only yourself to blame. Except for red bats. Screw red bats. If you can get someone for local co-op, that's quite fun as well.Since the levels are procedural, and you never really get good enough that you never die, and you can even play your own songs (thought theirs are really good anyway), the games has tons of playability and hours in it. Another good thing is that it doesn't take long to play. It's not like an rpg or something where you'll waste away playing it. 3 minutes of this game feels like 30 minutes of most other games. So sure, you won't waste time playing it, but you also won't waste time playing it.			"

This game in my opinion is just amazing in every single way, the enemies, the equipment available, the gameplay, and on and on. The main thing to me which defines this game is its amazing music, made by Danny Baranowski (who also created The Binding of Isaac music, and when I learned of this I was very happy).This game is still in early access, and has amazing potential and in the current state of this game, it is overall just amazing and fun to play. Even if you are not the kind of person who has interest in music based games, you should still keep up with this game and its development as the potential is huge. If you dislike the music for whatever reason, there will eventually be music you can use yourself to play the game with!Also a dancepad will be usable for this game.TLDR: Buy it. If you choose not to, keep up with the development of this game, and eventually you will like it.			"

A damn good example of a dungeon crawler roguelikeFun, strongly themed and well-balanced game.Punishing, but still difficult enough.It's more of a real-time-strategy roguelike if you think about it well. Because one move is one beat, so basically you get 1 beat of the song to quickly think your move.There's lots of options and gameplay modes to be chosen, ranging in difficulty and gimmickish gameplay, but they're still all fun.I really like how well designed the tempo is, as in every zone has increasing BPM in higher levels. They really went full meme with how 80%-90% of the stuff is music-based.

												Since its alpha phase, Crypt of the NecroDancer has held a ton of promise.  As it's grown into its full release, Crypt has added multiple characters, an expansive monster bestiary, and not one, but two extra arrangements of the already-amazing soundtrack.This game is a rhythm-based roguelike dungeon-crawling game, but rather than carefully planning each move, you're given a time limit of a single beat of music.  Everything moves one turn on each beat, whether or not you offer an input, which means that you're constantly faced with split-second decisions which will make or break your run through each zone.Crypt offers a wide variety of play styles.  Cadence, the first playable character, is a pretty standard roguelike experience.  You take on a dungeon, probably die, and return to the lobby for some purchasable persistent upgrades.  You return to the dungeon, and the cycle continues on.  Later, you'll unlock Bard, a character whose actions are not limited by the beat of the music, and enemies only move on player actions.  And for the perfectionist, Aria offers a frustrating challenge in which missing a single beat or taking any damage is instant death.The soundtrack, which I mentioned earlier, is absolutely amazing.  Danny Baranowski (of Super Meat Boy and Binding of Isaac fame) takes center stage with the primary soundtrack.  Two other musicians -- A_Rival and FamilyJules7x -- also offer their talents to mix the game's music into heavy techno and metal arrangements, respectively.  Each of these remixed soundtracks is available to play in the game as well.  And, if you should ever get bored of that music, the game allows you to use your own music for any stage you please.I could go on for paragraphs about how great this game is, but suffice to say, it is absolutely worth experiencing for yourself.  It's well-made, it's challenging, and above all else it's just a really fun time.  Absolutely pick this game up if you have any interest in rhythm-based gameplay, roguelike dungeon-crawlers, or just generally challenging gameplay.			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is an amazing take on the Dungeon Crawler genre while also putting in a spice of rhythm making the game enjoyable and better to listen to. Every rhythm game needs a decent soundtrack to succeed. Not only did Danny B. (Also known for his music in BoI and Super Meat Boy) fill this quota but Rival (known for his Electro Dubstep type music) and FamilyJules (Creator of several Metal Covers on OSTs.) made this game's soundtrack amazing. Not only that, but the characters are rememberable and make you actually feel for them, giving you different gameplay for each character, which is where Crypt of the Necrodancer gets it's replayability. These are the reasons why I still come back every day to this game. The art looks fresh and actually makes you wanna stop and see how your character moves to the beat of the music. This game also supports Steam Workshop, giving you the ability to play as a jiggling piece of bread if you wanted to. All of this for the decent price of $14.99 makes me believe that ANYONE, whether you enjoy Roguelike Dungeon Crawlers or the Music Lover that listens to game soundtracks in their daily lives can enjoy Crypt of the Necrodancer.

												Crypt of the NecroDancer is a fantastic and Original roguelike. With spectacular music and design. Dont get into this thinking you will have an easy time, There is an insane learning curve, but you will keep playing and playing because thats just what happens, You wont want to stop hearing the great soundtrack, and everytime you get just a little further is a huge victory and extremely satisfying.

								I'm having great fun with this game.  More than that, I'm fully loving it!It's a unique and wonderful idea to combine a rhythm dancing game with true rogue-like gameplay.  The game has a great range of pickups, gameplay options, different playable characters, etc.  It just feels so well made.Necrodancer has a brilliant soundtrack by Danny Baronowsky, who also did the music for Super Meat Boy.  I'll buy any game with his name on it, no questions asked!  (and the soundtrack too)They've made the game cross-platform for Linux / Mac / Windows.  I do 99% of my gaming on Linux and I really appreciate the Linux support.You can play with keyboard or a controller, or real dance pads.  I've ordered a pair of dance pads to play it the hard way.  I might even get fit.  There's a two-player co-op option, so I can play with my wife or kids and use both the pads.  The game is challenging enough with plenty of variety to keep me playing while I lose some weight necrodancing like a fool!Although this is an early access game, it already has more options and features than most ""full release"" games:  training halls to practice battling different monsters and bosses (if you can pay the entry fee!), a huge variety of pickups and upgrades, hardcode mode, local co-op, daily challenge...  I don't recall another game with so many great options.  The procedural generation gives a great variety of levels, on a par with Spelunky.In short, buy this game already!			"

								I love games that make sense of old gaming tropes and conventions; in this case, how about the old idea that enemies in roguelikes only move when you do? The answer is, they're just moving to a beat, same as you!This idea has serious gameplay implications as well. Roguelikes were always about positioning and strategy, but let you take as much time as you wanted in between turns. The rhythm nature of this game melds it into an action game with the best of tile turn-based. Fighting enemies is an absolute joy: every time you walk into a room you have to think fast, what enemy do I prioritize and how do I position myself to attack them while keeping myself out of harm from other enemies. There are a few mechanics that really help facilitate this; for one, the control scheme is exclusively arrow keys or WASD, which means that attacking is done by pressing in the direction of an enemy, overriding a movement in that direction. This can play to your advantage or disadvantage depending on your weapon and circumstance, which just increases the layers of things to think about. It also means you can play the game on a dance pad if you want to, with no compromises. The one downside is that using subitems like consumables and spells is done by pressing combinations of those direction keys, which doesn't really feel great and you'll often forget which thing is bound to which button combo. It can screw you up in a frantic moment.The other element really strengthens the rhythm game connection: a multiplier. If you can keep landing enemy kills without straying off beat, you'll earn a coin multiplier, which is cool because coins serves as both currency and as points or high score. What makes it interesting is you lose the multiplier for using a wait command essentially, which means you have to constantly keep moving. This not only changes the tone of the game, but it makes approaching enemies interesting too, as you'll have to find another way to stay in the same spot without losing the multiplier.Then you have different items and weapon types, and what's great is that even though the very basic ""attack up"" weapons will change how you fight enemies, there are a lot of different types that change properties and completely change how you approach combat.Another big mechanic is that each floor is timed, and you'll be sent to the next when time runs out. This is probably an improvement over other roguelikes that give you as much time as you want; at the same time, it along with the multiplier makes the game feel really frantic. While it's a cool feeling you don't really have the chance to learn what an enemy's all about in the middle of a run, you'll have to utilize the in-game beastmaster mode to learn enemy strategies. Same goes with items, you won't have a lot of time to experiment like in something like Binding of Isaac, which makes learning new items with no descriptions even more difficult than in that game. At the same time, it's better than just giving it away with a description.I guess the other big thing is that because you can't move freely, because you are forced to move at the pace the game dictates, the game doesn't give you the same sense of control as something like Binding of Isaac, at least not initially. Initially you'll be a little frustrated that you can't move at your own pace in the lobby, and even when you're having an OP run you're still at the whim of the game's pacing. This feeling diminishes over time; eventually as you master each of the beats you'll get that control you were looking for, it just takes awhile.The game has a really smart progression system early on; basically it splits each of the zones of a full length run into its own adventure, and gives you incentives to play and learn them with the diamond system which gives you permanent upgrades to your character, or new secrets in the runs. It's a really good way to learn the game but the meat and potatoes is still hardcore mode, which takes away all of those permanent upgrades and plays like a true roguelike. My problem right now is that after beating hardcore mode and unlocking the other characters there's very little incentive to continue; the new characters represent a significant jump in difficulty, and while I could dive back into each individual zone with the characters to train there's no in-game unlockables or achievements to be earned right now. I feel kind of done with it until Zone 4 rolls out.It's also not as replayable as something like Binding of Isaac, most of the nuances in the gameplay have to do with combat. There's not as much detail optimization as BoI, aside from a few things like how to find hidden passages without a torch and what to do with excess bombs.The game is ridiculously fully featured for an early access game by the way, with multiple characters, dance pad mode, daily challenge, seeded runs, custom music, and even a co-op mode which is a ton of fun.Oh and the soundtrack is what I play videogames for, I <3 Danny B.tl;dr Combat nuances and music make this game well worth buying in its current state, only problems I have with it right now are lack of progression after unlocking all the characters, less replayability than other roguelikes, and the difficulty with learning new things and feeling in control early on.

												Great game.  Wasn't expecting to like it so much.  A roguelike that is both challenging and fair.  You constantly feel like you're progressing as you learn enemy patterns and use your diamonds from each run to purchase new gear that shows up in the dungeons.  Every enemy has a pattern that can be learned and exploited. You almost always die in this game because you weren't good enough, not because the game cheated you.  Easily one of the best games I've played over the last year.  Dat fake shopkeeper though, wasn't ready......			"

								Crypt of the NecroDancer is exactly what it is described as: a rogue-like rhythm game.This game is all about patterns. Each type of enemy moves to the beat in a specific way, and you need to learn these patterns to effectively defeat them.The simplistic controls are what really drive this game home. You only use four buttons to perform all of the moves in the game - up, down, left, and right, to be precise. The game's control scheme is so simple, in fact, that you can play it with a USB-enabled dance pad, like the kind used for DDR-esque games. Personally I have not tried this, though I definitely want to!Even though this game is in alpha, it is still jam-packed with features to entertain you for hours of playtime. I highly recommend this game.			"

								I've had interest in this game ever since I heard of it, and it has been worth following the creation of this game. This game in my opinion is just amazing in every single way, the enemies, the equipment available, the gameplay, and on and on. The main thing to me which defines this game is its amazing music, made by Danny Baranowski (who also created The Binding of Isaac music, and when I learned of this I was very happy).This game is still in early access, and has amazing potential and in the current state of this game, it is overall just amazing and fun to play. Even if you are not the kind of person who has interest in music based games, you should still keep up with this game and its development as the potential is huge. If you dislike the music for whatever reason, there will eventually be music you can use yourself to play the game with!Also a dancepad will be usable for this game.TLDR: Buy it. If you choose not to, keep up with the development of this game, and eventually you will like it.			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever played and it's easily my favorite indie game to ever come out. 10/10Necrodancer follows the roguelike genre, the mechanics are simple in themselves, a tile based roguelike in which you only only move to the beat of the music. That is where the simplicity ends.In addition, each enemy has their own movement pattern, following the beats of the music. There are traps laying on the ground that control movement, send you down to the next level and ones that flat out damage you. All of this mixed together creates complex and rewarding gameplay that keeps you coming back.Being a rythm based roguelike, music is key and the game delivers in its soundtrack. The music was composed by Danny B, known for composing games such as Super Meat Boy and Binding of Issac. The tracks are perfectly suited to the style of game and will keep your head bobbing as you move to the beat. In addition, there are remixed versions of the game's soundtrack done by A_Rival and FamilyJules7x, which allow for more variety and they sound fantastic as well.But what if you get sick of the music? There is an option to import your own MP3 files into the game so you can tap along to your favorite songs as your progress through the game.The art style, while another pixel art type of deal, looks great. The enemies are unique, it's easy to distinguish them apart and easily identify what you're going to be going up against. Even after you play the game with the default character Candence, there are many more characters availible to mix up the gameplay and keep you coming back. If that wasn't enough, there is a daily challenge mode to compete in everyday to hone your skills and try to climb to the top of the leadboards; or you could just compete with your friends.I can go on and on about this game, I adore it, the gameplay, the visuals and the soundtrack amaze me, and it all blends into this perfect package of a game.

I always had the feeling that is was the game that killed me, not just because i played badCrypt of the NecroDancer have fixed that. Whenever i die i feel like i'm an idiot for not realizing that it was a bad move, but because of the time limit-aspect you make mistakes.

 The ingenious combo of a dungeon crawler and rhythm game. GAMEPLAYIt's a dungeon crawler rhythm game. Your movements are timed to the beat of the song, and you can't just spam movements all the time. It's simple, but is executed so well and so satisfyingly that it's become my favorite dungeon crawler (which isn't saying much as i've only played 2 at the time of this review and only have 9 hours in the other one) Since everything is timed to the beat, you're retreating with the beat. You're killing to the beat. You're flanking to the beat. You are living with the beat. This makes the game incredibly satisfying to play.Enemies play by their own rules also on the beat, which becomes incredibly complicated in the later zones where the screen gets cluttered frequently, with enemies that play by their own rules, or the same rules on different beats. Enemies can in later zones also potentially move diagonally, something you can't do, and even through walls, which never felt fair when you die to those things.There are different character types, all of whom have different styles of play. Some may be incredibly satisfying and fun, others will leave you begging for mercy and crying face down on your keyboard. A very good replay value.SOUNDTRACKKick♥♥♥♥♥ You get 3 different soundtracksDannyB-The creator of the game's original soundtrackA_Rival-The creator of the game's EDM soundtrackFamilyJules7X-The creator of the game's metal soundtrack.As well as custom .mp3 support, which is incredibly satisfying and adds even more replay value.

												~~UPDATED FOR FULL RELEASE~~Rhythm-based Rogue-Like Dungeon Crawler. Yes. Please.Everything you do is to the beat of the music, you move to the beat, attack to the beat and die to the beat. And the enemies do too. Every enemies has an attack pattern so if you can feel the beat, you can avoid taking damage, but it's not always that easy when you have a limited amount to time to react (IE. the beat) The music is the first thing you'll notice, composed by the indie game music GOD Danny B. who did the soundtracks for Binding of Isaac and Super Meat Boy (He's done many other games as well, but those two are the other two that I've played and can personally vouch for the music) so you know that the music in Necrodancer is top-notch...which is good considering that's the prime game mechanic.You'll groove your way through 4 zones, beating monsters, collecting gold, buying items and beating bosses until you reach the final boss which is sometimes different if you play the different characters. All the different characters are truly different and all play very differently and some even have limitations as to what items they can get. All the different characters ensure that you never get bored with the game and always provide a new challenge if you're feeling up for it. Played too much Cadance lately? Switch it up with Melody. Don't like how Melody plays? Try out Eli. Feeling strong with Eli? Now try Dorian. There are 10 different characters to play, including one final, truly insane challenge character that literally nobody has beaten yet so there is always something new to aim for with this game. And even if you can't play some of the harder characters like Aria, Bolt or Monk, you can always lay beatdowns to the beat with all the other characters.			"

												It's exactly what it looks like, save for the difficulty. The difficulty for this game scales pretty closely to the BPM of the track, and hence, your movements. Like all tastefully difficult games, you may die a gazillion times  even to the same enemy  but you'll know *exactly* how and why you messed up. It's never the game's fault, although your angry tongue will say it is.8.6/10 Green slime OP			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer delivers an innovative, challenging, fast-paced dungeon crawl experience. I was very hesitant about the concept of a ""rhythm roguelike"" but the game completely managed to win me over. What this title may lack in complexity compared to a more ""traditional"" roguelike such as Nethack or ADOM, it more than makes up for with the fresh take on roguelike gameplay that it brings to the table by limiting each turn to the length of a quarter note in the accompanying music.I highly recommend a controller/gamepad for this game. The control scheme is very general, should adapt well to any pad, and using my thumbs felt more natural and ergonomic than using the keyboard.			"

												A roguelite based on moving with the beat of music! It's very difficult and will take many runs/tries to learn the games mechanics/movements. If you'd like a unique take on this style of game I highly recommend it. It has a decent amount of unlockable content and permanent upgrades/unlocks for new runs. I don't find the game to feel RNG based, so it just comes down to mastering the mechanics and playing well.			"

								Crypt of the necro dancer is quite a different game. It's a blend of rhythm, fighting and rogue like with the idea of moving and attacking to the beat. This game does alot of things right in very important aspects of their respective genres. The music and visuals are extremely well done! All the music has easy to follow beats and the visuals are pixel art with great design.The only problem i've had so far is the learning curve is quite steep to the third zone, but other than the curve the game seems pretty good! The developers of this game are extremely responsive to the community asking for ideas, reporting bugs, and trouble shooting with errors and crashes. I fully recomend this game!TL:DR I entirely recommend this game! The game is an amazing blend of rogue like and rhthym with beautiful visuals and music! I rate 9/10			"

												Crypt of the Nercodancer is a Dungeon Crawler game mixed in with a Rythem Movement system, as in you have to move to the beat of the song.the game itself is pretty simple and Really easy to understand, The artstyle is really nice and pretty clean looking aswell and the soundtrack is easily one of the best, all 3 of them, original, EDM and Metal. Edit: 2 more were added a while ago! A chiptune soundtrack by the same person who made the shovel knight soundtrack & a Synthwave Soundtrack by Girlfriend records, Never fail to amaze with the different styles of remixes!There are 10 Characters total, Each every different things, like bolt who moves at double the speed, or Aria who can't get hit or miss a beat (as in dies in 1 hit or missing a single beat.)There are a bunch of different enemies, which also move to the beat with different patterns which are easy to understand, Each as moving every 2 beats or lunging forward after being hit once or even teleporting the player. Even if you're someone who isn't great with hearing/listening, there's a guideline sort of thing at the buttom of the screen, which you could use to learn the beat.Its a great game and i'm amazed the Devs Created this unique game. Easily Recommedable to friends, Especially with the OSTs.			"

								Give this review a reed, it will only take a minuet. Whatever expectations you have for this game are going to fall flat. The idea behind it is just so clef-er, and even in it's alpha I don't even C any minor flaws. Much less any major ones! It's especially fun if keeping a beat is your forte, and if it's giving you treble don't fret about it, you'll get it. I am no lyre, this game is amazing!Real ReviewI have to say it now, this is my new favorite rougelike game. It is  amazing ! Once you start you are not going to want to put it down. The visuals are great and apealing to look at, and all the enemies dance! How awesome is that!? And the music- OOOOH THE MUSIC -it just works...so well. I actually started typing this review before, and when I typed, ""And the soundtrac-"" I immediately went and bought it without realizing it would erase what I had typed! It's that good. I completely recommend buying it. And then there's the shopkeeper. His voice is the most beautiful thing you can hear while fending off skeletons that have their hands in the air like they just don't care! One thing that is terrible great about it is that when you die, it's your fault. It's because you weren't paying close enough attention, or because you didn't react fast enough. There are some times when I die that I just have to take rest...sorry, and mourn my own stupidity. The game almost never cheats you. Unless there's a red dragon. I'm sorry, that's fate, it's going to kill you. There are some enemies that seem like they do, but maybe I just don't understand them. *cough* bats *cough*[EDIT] I do have a give a fair warning though, the difficulty spikes between levels 1 and 2, and I can't even imagine 3.After playing some more, I have a few things I would like to see improved:*I think the shield skeletons need an ""arms up""-like frame in their animation, it can sometimes be unclear whether they will attack or not*The red dragon is way too hard. Maybe I just suck*The ability to go from Level 1 to level 2 and so on in one run, like in daily challenges. The later levels are just way too hard to start from scratch and hope you get lucky. **More permanent upgrades, the dungeon master is hardly used after the first hour**A option/item that makes the shopkeeper always singing (perhaps if it's an item, you can see him or the music notes all the time)See, not even very many :)I haven't completed it, so maybe some things I just haven't found yet. Improvements marked ** are something I'd see coming into player after the full release			"

It's the kind of game where no matter how many times you die, you will want to just give it ""one more shot"". If you play through the game I recommend playing through with the original soundtrack before swapping it out with your custom music (if you intend to do so). The original soundtrack isn't something you want to miss out on and will definetly set the mood for how the game should be viewed... There is alot of replay value. A great game to just hop into, play for a bit, or play for extended periods of time.			"

												Brace Yourself Games has developed easily one of the most creative games I've played recently.  Crypt of the Necrodancer combines the roguelike/rhythm genres to produce a dungeon crawler that summons memories of Michael Jackson's Thriller. The skeletons dance, the zombies hop, and the shopkeepers sing as you navigate through the floors of the cryptIt plays similarly to classic turn based style roguelikes, except that the turns happen on the beat of the music.  You will find yourself hopping back and forth to the beat, dodging enemy attacks, and waiting for the perfect moment to strike.  The soundtrack is great, but you can play using your own music instead if you wish.  There is also an easier difficulty setting specifically for playing the game on a dance pad.  It makes me wish I still had a DDR pad lying around, I'd love to give it a try.The parallels with classic roguelikes do not end with the turn based combat/movement system.  The floors, the contents of treasure chests, shop items, and even boss order are all randomly generated.  The game is also very challenging, quite possibly challenging enough that some players won't enjoy it if they don't like difficult games.  There are several features available to the player to mitigate the challenge.  As you play you will unlock the ability to start at each zone, buy items before entering a zone, and practice against enemies in a risk free environment.The only criticism that comes to mind about the game is the small number of zones.  There are four zones, and each zone has three stages.  The amount of content reminds me of some NES games.  Many old NES titles could be completed in less than an hour, but took much longer due to the learning required to play successfully.  While I don't feel like there are as many zones as there could have been, they did include ten playable characters.  The characters all have very different styles of play and allow for a solid level of replay value.Crypt of the Necrodancer is a lot of fun, but I think many players should be wary.  Prospective buyers may be lured in by the cute visuals and awesome soundtrack but miss an important fact about the game.  Necrodancer, at its heart, is a challenging turn based roguelike.  I've played through and finished quite a few games that most would consider to be hard.  This one is tough.  According to  Steam's global gameplay stats, 7.2% of players manage to finish the fourth zone as the main character.  If you're down for a challenge though, you'll have a great time.  I've certainly had a lot of fun with it.			"

EVERYBODY DO THE FLOP!After the unfair atrocity against humanity that is Spelunky, I jumped away from the rouge-lite bandwagon and started to avoid this kind of games entirely. You cannot imagine the frustration which that cursed game gave me with its extreme unpredictability of annoying enemies, dirt-poor and mostly useless item pool, random stuff blowing up in your face without your fault etc.Good thing that Crypt of the Necrodancer fixes nearly everything I listed above. Listening to the Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam apparently is sometimes a good idea!You can imagine the game as a mix of classic dungeon-crawling games, generic rouge-lite games, chess and DanceDance Revolution. During the proper gameplay player makes moves on tiled dungeons, trying to move, attack, defend, explore and explode to the bounce of the sickest beats. You can consider beats as a split-second turns when everybody on the level makes their action and the outcome is immediately apparent. Either you move into enemy-infested tile and attack it or they move into yours, dealing damage etc. Every action in the game is bound to the beat of boogey-man looking Necrodancer who is the main villain of this really barebones and after-thought of the story.CotN fixes EVERYTHING Spelunky screwed up. Aside of non-common bat types, every enemy has a predicable pattern you can exploit. Items you acquire throughout your adventure are varied, allowing different playstyles and strategies. There is not nigh-required Jet-Pack and Shotgun combo you need in Spelunky because in Necrodancer many combinations of items can ease the difficulty significantly. Game also doesn't screw you up unfairly too often. Most of the time you lose because of your own mistakes and not because somebody else angered the shopkeeper or that Yeti made a bouncing ping-pong ball of you, sapping your whole life in the process. You are still fragile in the game, but healing is much less a pain-in-the-butt process andit's much more reliable. Crypt still has some fair share of annoying enemies but those are much more manageable than in the other rouge-lites. There are also single-level modes (allows story progression with checkpoints between zones) and additional, harder characters, so both less-hardcores and harder that hard-hardcores are welcomed here.As for problems of the NecroDancer: bats still exist. Enemies sometimes come in crowds, making difficulty in tackling them safely. Item descriptions are vague and show up only when you approach them from tile away, from which you need to jump off immediately, forcing you to needless experimentation until you memorize the effects. Level themes are extremely generic (Mine/Forest/Ice-Fire World/Temple) which is a missed opportunity in comparison to the rest of the game (like enemies which are really imaginative with bouncy and enjoyable animations and charm).In short, Crypt of the Necrodancer in an enchanting game, full of enjoyable gameplay, good inventive ideas and incredible music (which really goes without saying that loud. Bought the soundtracks... All of them). It's must-have on the nearest occasion for everybody who isn't tone-deaf, without the sense of rhythm or satisfaction from fair challenge.Also, f*** Spelunky.			"

												This game fooled me, but in a good way. I was expecting a cute gimmick - a music game disguised as a rogue-like. Instead, I got a solid dungeon crawler with a musical twist.Crypt of the Necrodancer is the first game to combine two of my favorite things; EDM and The Undead. The style is cute, cohesive and somehow works without jumping the shark, which is hard to do for such an odd mix.+'s * Gameplay is solid and difficult, but not because of the musical aspect. ""Spinning Plates"" and managing many simple enemy patterns together takes awareness, practice and planning.* The beat is there as a turn-timer of sorts. By forcing the decisions to be quick, there's opportunities for mistakes (and therefore mastery/learning!) * Several characters with different styles, rogue-like style.* TLC put into the production value, even considering a more throwback/pixel art style.* Soundtrack is fantastic.-'s* While there's a variety of characters, the game's core gameplay has to eliminate a lot of the dungeon options and items that make the full-run version fun, meaning many of the alternate characters are less interesting than the default.* It's said before, but Aria is extremely punishing to play. This is where it truely becomes a rhythm game, but it also has the problems listed above. Not a deal-breaker, but a sore spot.Highly recommend this if you're a fan of strange mash-ups that work, or want a dungeon delver with its own unique feel and flavor. The game holds up without the music, but is greatly enhanced by having it. :)			"

												You'll like this if :You are a fan of rogue likesLike SpelunkyAppreciate good game soundtracksYou'll hate this is :You have no rhythm and things like DDR drive you nutsGet bored with casual quick gamesThink old school graphics are horribleCrypt of the Necrodancer is a light rogue like game that owes a lot of its design philosophy to Spelunky. It does away with the depth of most roguelikes and instead concentrates on serving up a bite size piece of dungeon crawling in a challenging cute form, with many of the game design elements from Spelunky directly converted into its top down view point.So far, so similar.But CotND has a gimmick up its sleeve. The soundtrack. Everything in the game moves to the beat of the soundtrack, animations, movement, attacks - even your own input has to move to the beat of the soundtrack, like some mad version of Dance Dance Revolution where each step lets you explore further into the dungeon.Move out of step with the beat and you will be punished - losing bonus and also potentially missing your chance to move or attack. Learn to step with the beat, learn how the monsters move with the beat, and suddenly you will be popping along to this fiendishly addictive game.If the idea of playing a roguelike to the sound of a beat sounds weird - it kind of is. And I'll admit I wasn't entirely sure if this would turn out to be a flop or a cool idea. But once you play it, it just makes sense, and adds a very unique aspect to the game - that of timing. Where you have to move to the beat - staying still just isn't an option, and yet a move will push you into the path of a deadly foe, or out of striking range of a target. A new dimension of just how to ""wait"" or move in such a way as to hit an enemy becomes part of the game.The soundtrack itself that supports the main gimmick of the game is absolutely top notch, and there are a few great touches to the game - such as the singing shopkeepers - that just make this game work really very well indeed.An all round excellent experiment in combining the winning formula of Spelunky with a top down roguelike all to the beat of a soundtrack. Don't be put off because this game is kind of... left field. It manages to weld everything together beautifully, and is definitely a game where you will just want One More Try, because This Time, I've Got It.			"

								This game is absolutely amazing. The music will enter your head and refuse to leave, but for once, that's a good thing. The controls are extremely simple to learn, but deviously tricky to master. Even though it can get extremely hard, there's also easier modes and built-in systems for practicing against that enemy that you can't seem to get past, or even if you just wanna relax and explore a bit. To add on top of how beautiful the game is and entrancing the music can be, there is plenty of room for customization through the Workshop, or even just your own music! There is so much to say about this game, so many things to explore, and it's not even entirely done yet! If you like rhythm games, rougelikes, or even just games that have plenty to explore, get this game! "

Early Access Review
								Wow, what an amazing game!I love its style, the music and the whole gameplay.When I first bought the game I played it for 5 hours straight, without getting tired of it. It is just so much fun to play.But it's not just a rhythm game, you have to think about every single move, which means you have to think fast and react even faster. You have to predict the moves of your enemies, but at the same time focus on the beat and your moves.At first it is pretty hard, but after some time you'll get into it and you'll love it!This is one of the few early access games I'd recommend, because even now it's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.

												It's like a spiritual successor to The Binding of Isaac and it's probably the best indie game I ever played. It's very fun to play and because of procedurally generated levels this game has amazing replayability even after you played it for many many hours!I can't think anything bad about this game, I guess, at first it would feel like a very hard game, but just after a few hours you'll be much better at it, just keep practising and you'll be fine.The OST deserves a special mention also, this is the Danny Baranowsky at its best! And if you liked Super Meat Boy or The Binding of Isaac OSTs, then you'll be in love with this game!I rate it 10/10			"

Move your character in rhythm to the music to defeat a plethora monsters who each have their own rhythym-based attack patterns.

Crypt of the Necrodancer is well worth the price of entry and will keep you entertained for hours or short bursts.			"

												No joke, this was one of my favourite games of 2014.In theory, this is a really simple game.  Grid-based roguelikes have been done before.  The real seller of Crypt, however, is the impact of the game being set to music and moving rhythmically.Unlike a lot of similar games, Crypt forces you to learn and memorize patterns and react fast and skillfully, instead of spending forever mulling through cluttered inventories for the exact item to get you out of your situation.  It's about speed, snap decisions, and learning, and above all is completely fair - everything in the game could be handled flawlessly with just your starting equipment.There's a lot of other aspects that are strengths to it.  Mechanically, the game reaches an incredible level of play diversity, not just from the vastly different playable characters.  It also comes from the fact the massive pool of items are rarely just a straight upgrade over one another, and instead have different strengths, weaknesses, and benefits.  Presentation wise the game's super slick, charmingly animated, and the music is bloody amazing too.Do the thing.  Get the game.  It's amazing.			"

												After playing this game I can say without a doubt.  This is one of the most addicting games I have played!  All of the positive feedback about this game is within good reason.  It's a great quick fix game and can be played for long periods of time as well.  Collecting more diamonds to buy items, and just trying to progress through the various levels of the crypt.The game does a great job of not holding your hand, and letting you experience how the game plays, how various monsters attack, and how to use items wisely.  This however is comparable to ""The Binding of Isaac"" in that it is a lot of trial and error.  So be perpared to die alot.  However, the game is very rewarding and never seems to trap you in a vicious cycle of repeated death without reason.I would highly recommend this to anyone who are fans of Rouge-like, or Rythm games!!!Kryptik Rating 9/10			"

												The screenshots and videos don't do the game justice.  Everything you and the enemies do is to the beat.  The controls are incredibly simple.  Even the enemy patterns are simple.  That is why everything comes together in such beautiful complexity, greater than the sum of its parts.In short, it's a rhythm game in a roguelike's skin.  You're always getting a bit further, helping yourself proceed with each new attempt.  The game is difficult but fair.  Deaths will happen but they are always your fault.  However, you will eventually succeed and you will jump right back in for more.Buy this game.Play this game.Listen to the game's music at work, school, or in the car.Live the game.Dance for your life.

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is about delving into a dungeon, but you're doing so in synch with the current's level music : every action you take must be on the beat, any missed beat is slightly penalized, and enemies also move on the beat.Yet, to call Crypt of the Necrodancer ""dungeon delving with music"" would be to sell it short. A far better description would be ""tactical turn-based game, except the turns happen on the beat"". Crypt of the Necrodancer has you dancing around monsters in order to kill everything while taking as little damage as possible. You know all the monsters' patterns, there is no luck involved, it's just a matter of perfecting your counter patterns. Even the music aspect has been toned down a bit to ensure you focus more on the tactical aspect: the game doesn't require pinpoint accuracy to hit the beat, there is a fair beat of leaway, contrary to games that are purely about hitting beats (such as Dance Dance Revolution, Osu, etc...).The best example of how the game isn't just a ""game with a music gimmick"" is the ""Bard"" character. Once you've played a bit, you will unlock new characters, which are new modes of play. And Bard's mode is actually being able to play without having to worry about the beat: whenever you take an action, the ennemies do too, which mean you can play as fast or as slow as you want. And yet, despite not being time-pressured, it's still a fair and interesting challenge to play and finish a Bard's playthrough.The game is hard, but is also very fair. As I said, everything is known, and the game lobby offers several ways to train yourself and gather informations on enemies in a stressless manner. So after that, once you think you've learned everything you needed, you can delve into the musical dungeon, and then all hell break loose. You know skeletons raise theirs arms before moving, and yet, in the stress of having to move constantly, you keep moving towards skeletons with raised arms, and then getting damaged. It's going to take a lot of practice to become good and finish the game.But well, practicing is so much fun in this game. The graphics are great, with cute zombies dancing around, skeletons swaying their hips while moving towards you, etc. All the characters have very nicely done animations and attention to details. It also has good replayability, thanks to the randomly generated dungeons and items. Each weapon has its own strenghs and weaknesses and really change how you're going to approach each ennemy. And finally the last, but greatest element...the music.The OST for this game has been done by none other than Danny Baranowsky, one of the most famous guy in the small world of indie video game music. If you've played Super Meat Boy, Desktop Dungeons, Canabalt, or the Binding of Isaac, you already know how awesome his music is. If you don't i highly recommend checking its music on Bandcamp. I actually bought Crypt of the Necrodancer's OST months before actually buying the game. Each track is a marvel, each world has its own music soundscape, and there is a lot of music-related surprise to find while playing the game.TLDR : This game is awesome, if you like hard tactical games, buy it, and also buy the soundtrack on Bandcamp :)			"

								Crypt of the NecroDancer is a rhythm roguelike dungeon crawler. What to say. This game is 100% fantastic. A great challenge while also being incredibly fun. Moving on the beat and hitting monsters along with the flow of the music is an incredibly satisfying feeling, especially on enemies like dragons, following the pattern of hit-move-hit-move until they're dead. Every enemy design is great in its own way, as well as every character sprite. Cadence's animations are flat-out adorable. The music, integral as it is to the gameplay, is incredible, and easy to listen to over and over again. Which is kind of common, in a game as difficult as NecroDancer. My only problem with the game is very, VERY minor. It's about the beat bars at the bottom of the screen, near the image of the beating heart. They kept throwing me off the beat ever so slightly. Thankfully, the devs put in the ability to turn off the beat bars. Thank you.Verdict: 10/10			"

												The quote the Forbes review gave  ""you have to see it to believe it"" is almost sums it up. I would propose a following line - ""you have to live it to see just how unfathomably awesome this game is"". The synergistic effects of already tried and tested fantastic retro game style, with a fantastic original idea, creative artwork and utterly genius masterpiece soundtrack leaves a game that swiftly kicked the backsides of all the other games I have played to sit at the top most played and most enjoyed game of all time. I am recommending this game to absolutely anyone, for I believe everyone has the potential to be awed by the experience. Those who are not awed either haven't put the effort (normally not necessary) to see the sheer ingenuity of this game or are completely blind. (I've mostly played this game offline)			"

Early Access Review
								Crypt of the Necrodancer is the game where you think you're good at beating down monsters to the beat... then you unlock hardcore mode. You think of this as impossible as Zone 3 is one giant zerg rush of skeleton horses and elemental enemies. Nonetheless you try it anyway and manage to get some decent gear. Then a red dragon comes along and says ""♥♥♥♥ you!"" and you get one shot by a fireball because you can't do the sacred red dragon dance at that moment. (That's my life, i cri evertim ;;) But seriously, this game is amazing in many aspects. It's hard to find a game where a particular character dies from picking up GOLD, of all things! Since the levels are randomly generated there is no true pattern to the game and permanent death is indeed a thing. So that guy that dies from picking up gold? He's no exception, better watch your step! Oh yeah, and the only way you can move/attack/dig/open chests is by hitting the arrow key in the direction that you want to go on the beat of the song that's playing. There's a nice little tutorial in-game for that, though. However, there is one thing that bugs me about Crypt of the Necrodancer. That is, the diamonds that are used to purchase items to be put into the item pool for non-hardcore runs. It would make more sense to have everything unlocked already, like hardcore does, but you are forced to buy it using diamonds you find during non-hardcore runs. It's a bit more harmful than helpful and everything should just be unlocked for you to use when it's found. Despite that, this game is well worth your time. I've got 60+ hours and counting clocked into Crypt of the Necrodancer and it's not like I'll be stopping anytime soon. If you like challenging games, get this game. If you like rogue-likes, get this game. If you like rhythm based games, get this game. The point is, just buy the freaking game! What're you waiting for? Scroll back up and click that ""Add to cart"" button!			"

It's relentless difficult yet at the same satisfying and have me want to play more. Different characters will give out different end bosses, so there is always something different to look up to when clicking buttons to the beat.Also, hey, if you got rocking songs of your own?

												Aside from FTL and BoI: Rebirth, this game is my favorite Indie title.  Don't let the rhythm-based gameplay deter you.  It's more about pressing the buttons at a steady beat  than it is figuring out a rhythm.  So, even the musically-challenged such as myself can enjoy this game.I'd say if you enjoy roguelike games, this is an obvious buy.  Worth about $10.

However I'd love to be able to somehow define the rhythm interpretation of the custom tunes, because I'd love to utilize some more progressive tunes in the game as well :)After a while it starts to become a bit repetitive and frustrating, but it offers quite good fun for some time at least. Interesting and definitely a bit different game from the others, so definitely recommended to check out especially if you are a musician!			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is definitely one of the most unique roguelike games I’ve ever played, with the added bonus of actually resembling rogue instead of using roguelike as another term for “permadeath without saves”.  You play a family of musicians (or a motley crew of side-characters) determined to unlock the mystery of the magical lute and defeat the Necrodancer, a cursed necromantic bard.True to its name, you “dance” around each level by moving in tune to the rhythm meter at the bottom of the screen. Each level has its own tune and rhythm and the game steadily increases the pace as you progress. Keeping in tune with the music while vanquishing enemies will net you a higher multiplier which increases the amount of gold you find, in addition to enhancing certain special items found throughout the crypt. Failing to keep to the beat will cause your multiplier to go down and may also prevent you from moving. Since the monsters in the game also move to the beat, they will eventually close in on you to attack and you cannot stand still to “pause” the action (unless you’re playing the bard character). I found the soundtrack for CotN to be excellent and very diverse. Each level’s song fits its theme pretty well and there are a few tracks that are instantly catchy. The shopkeeper in each level will also sing along with the music, giving a clue to his location, and all of the monsters are either music-themed or have a name alluding to some musical term or instrument, adding an extra layer of detail to this thoroughly polished game.There really aren’t any faults with this game that would prevent any fan of rogues from picking it up (playing as Aria is extremely hard though) and, even if you’re not normally into games in this genre, the learning curve is very fair. This game is worth picking up even at its original cost, though if you can catch it at the average sale price of $5 it’s quite a steal!			"

The soundtrack on its own is amazing huge thumbs up to Danny Baranowsky. 10/10 on the game and the music seperate and together.			"

												This is easily the game of the year for me. It looks pretty innocent and silly, but it's extremely addicting and quite difficult. It's like the perfect mix of Guitar Hero and your favourite roguelike/dungeon RPG. Your mission is to build a character with powerful items and bring him/her through multiple terrifying zones and well-designed bossfights. All of this without breaks, because you'll be moving to the beat of the (honestly beautiful and catchy) soundtrack. So you'd best learn every enemy and every item in order to maximize your chances of survival, and even then it's hard. Not only that, but there are more characters to choose from which provide different (read: insane) challenges.I know 15 bucks is quite a lot for an indie game these days, but definitely buy it, it'll be so worth it. It's also one of the most unique games you'll ever play.			"

								This is a very fun game, 100% worth buying even at full price. (And as a notorious cheapskate, that's not something I say lightly.) Don't be discouraged by the early access tag; this game is very well polished already, and recieves regular updates. Even if they never updated it again, it would still be worth buying. You will have a blast playing this single player, and if you have someone to play with the local co-op is great as well.Pros:Refreshing concept, executed wonderfullyNice tight gameplayGREAT soundtrackLovely pixel graphics and animationsGood amount of content/replayabilitySteam workshopCons:Custom song importing doesn't work as well as you'd hope (beats are off/weird sometimes, but maybe I'm picking the wrong kind of songs)Very unforgiving of mistakes (but it's a roguelike so that's to be expected)You have to be good at memorization (Hey, it's a con for some people)I'm sure there were other things I wanted to mention so I'll probably edit this review at some point.

These two elements make for simplistic game mechanics yet challenging gameplay and with so many cool weapons and upgrades to collect in both the hub world and in-game, It really makes you want to get better and improve on your techniques as a player.There are so many things the devs can do (and have done) to make this game perfect and I look forward to everything they do with it in the future			"

								Great music, and the ability to import your own songs makes it where you're unlikely to get bored of the sounds.  While each enemy tends to be pretty easy to take down, a horde is a challenge, and can be overwhelming at first.  Thankfully, for those of us who are always off-beat or are overwhelmed, an alternate character (the Bard) allows the game to act more like a traditional rogue-like (with fantastic music), where the enemies take their turn after your character moves.Give the awesome variety of items, shrines, and teleporters already in the game, I'm really looking forward to see what they add during the remainder of development.

								Brilliant. I was glad i instantly bought this game after hearing so many good things about it. For a while i've watched few people play this game and from what i could gather, it really held up to all it's promises.I bought this game and figured since it has Co op, i could try it out with a friend of mine, and we had a blast.The music is amazing and the whole Roguelike feel mixed with Rhytm was an excellent mixture.The graphics are pleasent for the eyes and keeps a retro feel while having upbeat chiptune esque sounds compossed by the brilliant artist Danny Baranowsky who is also known for doing music for Binding of Isaac and Super meat boy.Alright, let me get into the details of what you're getting yourself into.This game feels rewarding even when you die there will always be upgrades which adds to your progress.There are items to buy and bunch of stuff to unlock to add even more replayabillity including a hardcore mode.Co Op is twice the fun and there were no issues to be had since the screen pans out the further apart both players are.Enemies have patterns which are easily memorized by repeating the game through trail and errors and the same goes for all of the traps and mini bosses and main bosses of the game.But here comes minor nitpicks since no game in this universe is flawless, so don't take this the wrong way.This game can be unforgiving to people who have a hard time adjusting to the sense of beats and rhytms but there is a steady learning curve which seems to work.The controllers input works fine but i can't seem to get the ''start'' button to work at times so i have to use Keyboard whenever i wan't to continue in a zone when i can't use my diamonds.Like i said, this game is amazing and i'm glad that it exists, don't let these minor faults ruin the experience for you.I'm rating it a solid 9/10 and recomend it, especially for Roguelike/Rhytm game fans or Binding of Isaac fans.

In short this is the first platform music game. Secondly, this game have useful workshop that allows creating mode easily althought there is no tools belong to game. If you are music producer and want to know your music will be able to dance to people, Necro will give the right answer. Thirdly, you can convert your room to gym, all you need is dancepad and deaf neighbors. Besides, skin workshop is still confusing, gameplay is really difficult fortunately dungeon's songs are awesome, therefore I can listen same song over and over without getting tired.

								Litterally the first words I thought to myself after quitting my first stint of this game? ""Wow, that was actually really good.""Perhaps not the most insightful of comments, but I MEANT it, and this was a surprising fact. Looking at the game on steam, you may think ""So a rogue-like with music. Right"" And technically, you'd be right. But that's like calling a burger ""cows backside with month old milk covered on top""It just doesn't do it justice. The gameplay is what you'd expect from the genre, constant paranoia of the simplest mobs knowing they could end your playthrough merely by invading your personal space. However, the twist is, they are all 100% predictable. Green slimes don't move. Blue ones bounce in a grid, one square per beat. Minotaurs charge in a straight line until they hit a wall, dragons...well, I still have yet to work that one out. But dragons hurt, and I don't like them anymore.You yourself are 'constrained' by the rules as well. If YOU don't move to the beat (which I have to admit, is catchy) you'll lose your coin multiplier bonus. That's it, nothing 'life ending' but...it makes it harder, thus worthwhile. *This is only valid if you don't play the bard character, who has different rules I won't go into*The rest? Eh, the graphics are bright, but still suit the 'dark' theme. Sort of like a Scooby Doo episode. The sound I was shocked with (In a good way) and the gameplay...well, I'm eager to go back for more. Once I forget about the dragons, that is.8.5/10, with only the 'promise for more' alpha state on it preventing it from getting higher (Can you rate an unfinished game as perfect?)Would highly recommend to any fans of the genre.

It takes a while to break the habit of most other rogue-likes, where you carefully plot and determine each move. The rythem forces you to jump into the game and make the best of every action, even if you haven't fully thought it through.Once you get over the intial difficulty adjustment period, you will play again, and again, and again.

								Are you bored with the same ol' same ol' ? WELL, look no further. This game is crazy addicting and a huge breath of fresh air. It combines dungeon crawling with amazingly hypnotic beats. I may suck at this game but that's the point. Every death I learn a new strategy. This game is a beautiful comcept and wonderous execution. Simple comands for a complex game. Be warry, your fingers will betray you. Just the name deserves 10/10. Good show.			"

												Only played 3 hours as of posting the review but hey this is my quick review of what it is so far and my thought.Yes, you should buy it if you're interested. It's soundtrack is made by the guy who did the soundtrack for the first Binding of Isaac and Super Meat Boy, there was no one better to do this.The game is really hard at first on stage 1 because it feels odd, it's defiantly its own style of play but once you learn it you love it, and from going from Zone 1 to Zone 2, it gets a lot more difficult, people looking for a good and fun challenge will defiantly find it with this game.There's tons of items, secrets, enemies, and different beats to make the 14.99$ the perfect price. I plan on putting a lot more time into this game :3 this is a saint for all who don't believe in Steam Beta's.11/10, there's a boss fight with a gorilla that likes to conga.			"

												This game includes more differences than other rhythm games and differences are mostly positive. Firstly, you don't have to move with continuously flowing display like that audiosurf, beat hazard, guitar hero etc. so you can choice your own destiny. In short this is the first platform music game. Secondly, this game have useful workshop that allows creating mode easily althought there is no tools belong to game. If you are music producer and want to know your music will be able to dance to people, Necro will give the right answer. Thirdly, you can convert your room to gym, all you need is dancepad and deaf neighbors. Besides, skin workshop is still confusing, gameplay is really difficult fortunately dungeon's songs are awesome, therefore I can listen same song over and over without getting tired. Consequently, It deserves every penny of the price because we are being witness and piece of rhythm games revolution			"

												Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of roguelikes... I never seemed to grasp the concept of ""good"" or ""bad"" items, and I found the everchanging map layouts kinda disorienting.When I picked this game up, I expected the same cookie-cutter gameplay style. I'm very glad I was proven wrong. CotN is a fast-paced and quick-witted game based around completing actions based on the beat of the music playing in the background, and I found it quite amazing. It has a ton of replay value, it keeps you on edge and requires split-second reactions. Also, the music is really f*ckin' good. Maybe I'm biased, maybe I'm not. It's up to you if you wanna pick this game up for yourself. No regrets.			"

								Crypt of the NecroDancer is a clever, addictive rhythm game and dungeon crawler mash-up, refreshing and definitely worth more than what I ended up paying for it during this Winter Sale. I am ecstatic to see such creative, inspired titles earn the love and respect (and business) of the Steam community. It deserves it and then some.Is this my first review? I think it is. Definitely worth the effort.My girlfriend doesn't care for this game, but she's has a severe aversion to rhythm games. With that said, this is the kind of game that forming an opinion about simply requires watching some gameplay - you'll know once you see it. It has a good heart, a good beat and a good future.			"

												This game is fun and unique and is one of the best dungeon crawlers I've played. Crypt of the NecroDancer will keep you in your seat for hrs and has an interesting plot. The characters are funny and amazing and the music fits each floor perfectly.The love that was put into this game was amazing. It's a little hard to figure out how to attack at first tho.. pros:FunEntertainingGreat MusicGood Plotline Great characters Cons:It kind of depends on luck if your going to beat a zone or not because of what items your going to get and what monsters are our there.Zones are a little to hardno more than 4 zones  I really love this game and i hope they keep adding to it. Maybe make a sequal or a prequal for it. All in all this is a must have game for any people who love music, dugeon crawlers, and hard games			"

												Got on steam sale, was hesitant to buy and am SO glad I did.  This is a fantastic rhythm game.  The focus is about unlocking powerup spawns and learning each enemy while grooving to an awesome beat.  The dungeons are randomly generated, but each zone has its own theme which remains the same in any mode (music, enemies, and art).  There are also different game modes; they are not drastically different but definately different enough to change it up a bit.  This game is something kinda new because of the rythm based movement, but DEF worth trying out. 10/10 recommend getting this game if unsure- I know I was and I don't regret this purchase at all!			"

												This game is pure genius.I've never played other rhythm based games before Crypt of the Necrodancer but I've always enjoyed Rogue-like games and I really feel like this one is amazingly realized. To date, nothing even marginally similar to this has ever been released and I sincerely think this has been one of the best games I've ever played.One more ""perk"" of this game is its simple retro-style, which one can love (as I do) or sincerely dislike.Another thing which one must realize BEFORE getting this game is that it's really challenging and requires a lot of time to be mastered.In my humble opinion this game is truly spectacular and it's worth the money.

								This game is CENTURIES over due. So damn cool, so damn fun. This will expose the rhythmless as was prophesied by the Dancermancer.Ok so srs face, this game is fun, simple, easy to get together with friends, and comes with a praiseworthy soundtrack. It's currently Early Access so I'm REALLY looking forward to watching this game polish up because its in amazing shape for a beta version. This is also one of the few games with armor built for womens breast. Seems like a small thing, but it's notable. This is what's called ""making an effort"" and it succeeds. The mechanics themselves are very easy to understand and simple to manipulate, just as you'd expect from a retro-flavored game. The $15 tag may seem on the high side, but we're all just used to getting Free or $3 games. It's worth every penny and then some. Try this out!			"

								I love Rogue-like games, but have always disliked the concept of rhythm games. Oh man have I had a lot of fun with this. The soundtrack is awesome, and the gameplay is well thought out. When you die, or lose life you only have yourself to blame, no cheap tricks. And the learning curve only highlights how well made this game is. That being said, there is obviously missing content, as it is in Early Access. The amount of levels is alright, but the overall content seems a bit lacking. It's easy to run out of things to look forward to after you've beaten the 2nd zone (out of 4) as the hub feels rather empty. I'm hoping they don't pull a CuttleFish and cut all forward content after early access release.			"

								Great music, and the ability to import your own songs makes it where you're unlikely to get bored of the sounds.  While each enemy tends to be pretty easy to take down, a horde is a challenge, and can be overwhelming at first.  Thankfully, for those of us who are always off-beat or are overwhelmed, an alternate character (the Bard) allows the game to act more like a traditional rogue-like (with fantastic music), where the enemies take their turn after your character moves.Give the awesome variety of items, shrines, and teleporters already in the game, I'm really looking forward to see what they add during the remainder of development.

								Brilliant. I was glad i instantly bought this game after hearing so many good things about it. For a while i've watched few people play this game and from what i could gather, it really held up to all it's promises.I bought this game and figured since it has Co op, i could try it out with a friend of mine, and we had a blast.The music is amazing and the whole Roguelike feel mixed with Rhytm was an excellent mixture.The graphics are pleasent for the eyes and keeps a retro feel while having upbeat chiptune esque sounds compossed by the brilliant artist Danny Baranowsky who is also known for doing music for Binding of Isaac and Super meat boy.Alright, let me get into the details of what you're getting yourself into.This game feels rewarding even when you die there will always be upgrades which adds to your progress.There are items to buy and bunch of stuff to unlock to add even more replayabillity including a hardcore mode.Co Op is twice the fun and there were no issues to be had since the screen pans out the further apart both players are.Enemies have patterns which are easily memorized by repeating the game through trail and errors and the same goes for all of the traps and mini bosses and main bosses of the game.But here comes minor nitpicks since no game in this universe is flawless, so don't take this the wrong way.This game can be unforgiving to people who have a hard time adjusting to the sense of beats and rhytms but there is a steady learning curve which seems to work.The controllers input works fine but i can't seem to get the ''start'' button to work at times so i have to use Keyboard whenever i wan't to continue in a zone when i can't use my diamonds.Like i said, this game is amazing and i'm glad that it exists, don't let these minor faults ruin the experience for you.I'm rating it a solid 9/10 and recomend it, especially for Roguelike/Rhytm game fans or Binding of Isaac fans.

It's more about pressing the buttons at a steady beat  than it is figuring out a rhythm.  So, even the musically-challenged such as myself can enjoy this game.I'd say if you enjoy roguelike games, this is an obvious buy.  Worth about $10.  I'd say $15 is too much, but worth it on 50% or greater discount.			"

												This is my first review.  Seriously I love this game.  I'm a bit bit of rouge-like games, and this is the best.  Beautiful graphics, great music, and the magic items and monsters have nicely thought out and interacting moves and features.  The different levels are beautifully themed.  And there's different characters that have individual traits that make the game easier or harder.  It's not too difficult to get through the levels and it's certainly not impossible to complete, (at least with the easier characters).  Right now I am trying to speedrun the game (complete in less than 15 minutes), a lot of fun as finding the right item can really change your strategy.  My only complaints might be that some of the text overlaps and is hard to read, and the difficulty level rises dramatically with some of the later characters you unlock.  But a great game, I can't recommend it enough.			"

												Necrodancer is an enjoyable mashup of rhythm based and rouge-lite elements that end up working surprisingly well together. The game suffers from the same problems that most indie rogue-lites do and that is that it becomes fairly repetitive after a few hours of play due to a general lack of enemy variety. Still, the game does have 10 playable characters, each with their own gimmick to help diversify time spent playing the game. The game also comes with 3 soundtracks as well as the ability to use your own mp3s so that you don't have to listen to the same soundtrack over and over if you are having trouble getting past a particular zone. It's the kind of game I pick up and play a little of everyday and overtime has really grown on me.			"

												Crypt of the NecroDancer is incredibly frustrating at first. Thats a good thing. It takes a while to break the habit of most other rogue-likes, where you carefully plot and determine each move. The rythem forces you to jump into the game and make the best of every action, even if you haven't fully thought it through.Once you get over the intial difficulty adjustment period, you will play again, and again, and again.

								An absolutely fantastic combination of roguelike dungeoneering and rhythm game. That darn Necromancer has your heart and is forcing you to move to the beat. Of course, you can skip the beat, but we really suggest you don't. Every enemy has its pattern, every item has its individual use and every run is sure to be completely different and enjoyable.Devs are very active and frequently adding new things, you can put your own custom music in and it's fairly good at recognising the beat (I highly recommend Hotline Miami's soundtrack). Several characters to pick from, a few more when you beat the 'hardcore' mode (a straight run through all the levels, a feat I've yet to accomplish at time of writing). Every death will have been avoidable and will leave you asking yourself why you did that, rather than blaming the game or enemies.A very satisfying game to play, could not recommend it any more strongly.

								This game has everything I like.  It's got random dungeon generation and permadeath like a roguelike, but with unlockable carryover bonuses and items, and characters, like a rogue-lite.  It's got rhythm gameplay, including some generated from your own music if you like, like another one of my favorites, Beat Hazard.  Oh, and it's really really difficult, and the retro graphics are cute, and there's plenty of female characters in it.  So, yeah!  Go ahead and pick it up!			"

												The quote the Forbes review gave  ""you have to see it to believe it"" is almost sums it up. I would propose a following line - ""you have to live it to see just how unfathomably awesome this game is"". The synergistic effects of already tried and tested fantastic retro game style, with a fantastic original idea, creative artwork and utterly genius masterpiece soundtrack leaves a game that swiftly kicked the backsides of all the other games I have played to sit at the top most played and most enjoyed game of all time. I am recommending this game to absolutely anyone, for I believe everyone has the potential to be awed by the experience. Those who are not awed either haven't put the effort (normally not necessary) to see the sheer ingenuity of this game or are completely blind. (I've mostly played this game offline)			"

												Easily one of the best rhythm games to come out EVER. CoTND is a procedurally generated dungeon crawler with the difficulty and addictiveness of Binding of Isaac, with, imo, a killer soundtrack. This is probably because the music was made by the same guy but, I digress. And if for some reason you hate the music (or you get sick of dying and hearing the same bloody song from level 1 over and over again like I do (inb4 'git good')) you can substitute the level songs with your own music. You play at Cadence, one of several musically-named individuals who must make their way through the titular Crypt for their each individual reasons, which is fun but the true awesomeness lies in the music-related combat and sweet pixel art visuals. That being said the game is hard. It's really hard. The good news is with a few proper upgrades you can become veritably unstoppable in any of the worlds. The learning curve drops into a cliff about the time you meet the Red Dragon, who can take you out with a single well-timed fire breath from across the map, and he'll show up every now and again in Zone 1.Easy to learn and hard to master are how I would describe this game, and would definitely recommend it unless you're known to break things if you get easily frustrated. Mice and keyboards are expensive.			"

												Pretty fun rhythm game. I kinda suck at it though, but it's a great game! I just am not that good at it; fighting-wise that is. I'm really good at the rhythm, but I suck at thinking out a strategy. You probably wouldn't want this game though if you never were the one who could keep a consistent tempo.Anyways, onto the review:The game is done really well. The music is great, items definitely make gameplay more interesting, as well as the enemies. I will continue to play this game for a while just because it's kind of a bit addicting. I mean, I haven't really seen any type of game that presents itself in this kind of way... never expected to really be able to have a game where you HAVE to move to the beat and it has roguelike elements in it. Great game, I reccommend for you to play it if you already haven't. 9/10			"

												I'm going to compress things in a manner that I would like them to be if I were the one looking for more info about the game (coming from someone that loved Spelunky)...The Standard InfoCrypt of the Necrodancer is a rogue-lite game (and I don't say that for lack of difficulty) merging together aspects of Spelunky and Rogue.There are 4 different zones, each with their own characteristics (monsters, bosses, layout etc) much like the different zones in Spelunky(caves, jungle, ice, temple).You can choose to play any zone individually after unlocking it for the first time or play through all them consecutively (the standard game mode.)The levels are procedurally generated, technically never allowing for there to be an impossible one.There's items which you can buy from the shopkeeper, and unlock to buy from the shopkeeper as you progress through the game. There's also different characters you can play as, each with their own quirks (some much more difficult than others.)The differencesThe game is isometric and turn based with the ""turns"" simply being movements (much like Rogue.)But here's the catch: The turns are just beats (each level has a different song to dan.. I mean move to.) Successfully moving to the beat rewards you with a multiplier, increasing any gold you find. Mess up the beat, and the multiplier starts over.This not only provides an immensely satisfying experience when you nail zombies and skeletons to the flashing neon lights reminiscent of Hotline Miami, but it also effectively gives you a time limit to move and complete the level. You have to do SOMETHING on each beat and if you don't defeat the mini boss and finish the level by the end of the song: PENALTIES (and sometimes death.)Each enemy has a move set that you can learn, anticipate and counter. Combine that with the different characters you can play as, the items that change the way you fight and the endless potential of procedural levels and you get a game as addictive as breaking it down any other rogue-lite out there and better.If that wasn't enough to satisfy your craving for the never-ending cycle of die and repeat then there's also the level editor, allowing you to create and share your own dancefloors levels as well as play other user-created chambers of torment.If that's STILL not enough, there's the daily challenge. This is basically a series of zones that is exactly the same to everyone. This provides an opportunity to play and compare high scores fairly until the end of the day, when a new one is generated.This game is an example of what happens when you incorporate an interesting gimmick into a core gameplay mechanic and polish it until it shines brighter than the punch-myself-in-the-jugular-with-a-fistfull-of-glitter dancefloor it does the boogie on.And if for some reason you actually dislike the music in the game, or grow tired of dying to it constantly... YOU CAN DANC... PLAY TO YOUR OWN SONGS.142857/142857			"

												I've been addicted to this game since I started playing it. I am not a big fan of rogue-likes in general, but this game is among few rare exceptions. You have 4 zones to beat, each one contains 3 floors and a boss fight. Every zone has its own theme and enemies. But wait, there's more. The enemies each move to the beat in their own unique pattern, and you have to recognize it and adapt quickly. For example, some enemies might be moving along a scripted path, others try to go for you specifically, some might stay still for 2 beats and then move on the 3rd one, others might move on every beat, and so on. It's all very well done. During your dungeon crawling you'll also come across a lot of items of varying degrees of helpfulness. You have healing items, weapons, armour, rings, spells, and even some unusual items. Some can spawn from the start, others require unlocking via collectible diamonds. You can even remove the less useful items from the dungeons via the janitor, so that there's more chances instead for chests to contain the items you find more useful. There is of course a fair bit of luck involved, as is pretty common with rogue-like games. At times you'll be lucky to find a nice weapon and other useful items early on, other times you'll just be spawning with enemies all around you. It is a very challenging game. You will die a lot. But you do learn to recognize the enemy movement patterns and eventually overcome them. I also really like the whole light-hearted theme the game is going for. I think the devs pulled it off perfectly. The music is also amazing and will just drag you in to the beat. In addition to the regular mode with the main character, you also get to unlock several other characters, which seem to have their own unique abilities (for example one of them can only confuse enemies but not kill, another is only able to use bombs, and so on). It all adds an extra challenge for those who want it. You can even go and practice fighting against specific enemies and bosses if you wish. Great game in general. Highly recommended.			"

												This is my first review.  Seriously I love this game.  I'm a bit bit of rouge-like games, and this is the best.  Beautiful graphics, great music, and the magic items and monsters have nicely thought out and interacting moves and features.  The different levels are beautifully themed.  And there's different characters that have individual traits that make the game easier or harder.  It's not too difficult to get through the levels and it's certainly not impossible to complete, (at least with the easier characters).  Right now I am trying to speedrun the game (complete in less than 15 minutes), a lot of fun as finding the right item can really change your strategy.  My only complaints might be that some of the text overlaps and is hard to read, and the difficulty level rises dramatically with some of the later characters you unlock.  But a great game, I can't recommend it enough.			"

												Aside from FTL and BoI: Rebirth, this game is my favorite Indie title.  Don't let the rhythm-based gameplay deter you.  It's more about pressing the buttons at a steady beat  than it is figuring out a rhythm.  So, even the musically-challenged such as myself can enjoy this game.I'd say if you enjoy roguelike games, this is an obvious buy.  Worth about $10.  I'd say $15 is too much, but worth it on 50% or greater discount.			"

Early Access Review
								Brilliant. I was glad i instantly bought this game after hearing so many good things about it. For a while i've watched few people play this game and from what i could gather, it really held up to all it's promises.I bought this game and figured since it has Co op, i could try it out with a friend of mine, and we had a blast.The music is amazing and the whole Roguelike feel mixed with Rhytm was an excellent mixture.The graphics are pleasent for the eyes and keeps a retro feel while having upbeat chiptune esque sounds compossed by the brilliant artist Danny Baranowsky who is also known for doing music for Binding of Isaac and Super meat boy.Alright, let me get into the details of what you're getting yourself into.This game feels rewarding even when you die there will always be upgrades which adds to your progress.There are items to buy and bunch of stuff to unlock to add even more replayabillity including a hardcore mode.Co Op is twice the fun and there were no issues to be had since the screen pans out the further apart both players are.Enemies have patterns which are easily memorized by repeating the game through trail and errors and the same goes for all of the traps and mini bosses and main bosses of the game.But here comes minor nitpicks since no game in this universe is flawless, so don't take this the wrong way.This game can be unforgiving to people who have a hard time adjusting to the sense of beats and rhytms but there is a steady learning curve which seems to work.The controllers input works fine but i can't seem to get the ''start'' button to work at times so i have to use Keyboard whenever i wan't to continue in a zone when i can't use my diamonds.Like i said, this game is amazing and i'm glad that it exists, don't let these minor faults ruin the experience for you.I'm rating it a solid 9/10 and recomend it, especially for Roguelike/Rhytm game fans or Binding of Isaac fans.

								I love Rogue-like games, but have always disliked the concept of rhythm games. Oh man have I had a lot of fun with this. The soundtrack is awesome, and the gameplay is well thought out. When you die, or lose life you only have yourself to blame, no cheap tricks. And the learning curve only highlights how well made this game is. That being said, there is obviously missing content, as it is in Early Access. The amount of levels is alright, but the overall content seems a bit lacking. It's easy to run out of things to look forward to after you've beaten the 2nd zone (out of 4) as the hub feels rather empty. I'm hoping they don't pull a CuttleFish and cut all forward content after early access release.			"

Move your character in rhythm to the music to defeat a plethora monsters who each have their own rhythym-based attack patterns. Use coins and diamonds to purchase temporary and permanent character upgrades. Use your shovel to dig break down walls and find hidden rooms and treasure. Crypt of the Necrodancer is well worth the price of entry and will keep you entertained for hours or short bursts.			"

												No joke, this was one of my favourite games of 2014.In theory, this is a really simple game.  Grid-based roguelikes have been done before.  The real seller of Crypt, however, is the impact of the game being set to music and moving rhythmically.Unlike a lot of similar games, Crypt forces you to learn and memorize patterns and react fast and skillfully, instead of spending forever mulling through cluttered inventories for the exact item to get you out of your situation.  It's about speed, snap decisions, and learning, and above all is completely fair - everything in the game could be handled flawlessly with just your starting equipment.There's a lot of other aspects that are strengths to it.  Mechanically, the game reaches an incredible level of play diversity, not just from the vastly different playable characters.  It also comes from the fact the massive pool of items are rarely just a straight upgrade over one another, and instead have different strengths, weaknesses, and benefits.  Presentation wise the game's super slick, charmingly animated, and the music is bloody amazing too.Do the thing.  Get the game.  It's amazing.			"

								Crypt of the NecroDancer is a clever, addictive rhythm game and dungeon crawler mash-up, refreshing and definitely worth more than what I ended up paying for it during this Winter Sale. I am ecstatic to see such creative, inspired titles earn the love and respect (and business) of the Steam community. It deserves it and then some.Is this my first review? I think it is. Definitely worth the effort.My girlfriend doesn't care for this game, but she's has a severe aversion to rhythm games. With that said, this is the kind of game that forming an opinion about simply requires watching some gameplay - you'll know once you see it. It has a good heart, a good beat and a good future.			"

												One, two, three, four, aah, AAAH, AARGH! ♥♥♥♥!Crypt of the Necrodancer is a beautifully crafted mix between a rhythm game and a tile-based roguelike. You play as one of several characters who are forced to move to the beat of a catchy soundtrack, each with their own quirk to make the game frustrating, painful, and gloriously addictive. Everything can be done using a single set of four context-sensitive buttons. Just press a direction to move, attack, or dig in that direction, and the game will pick the action most conducive to progress. That, of course, doesn't mean you're not going to die. Through the pressure of moving to the beat, you're going to make stupid decisions, and they will be entirely your fault. Every enemy telegraphs their moves and attacks in a predictable pattern, and if you end up cornered by three enemies and your back to a wall, you only have yourself to blame.Every zone has three floors and a boss. The stairs to the next floor are only opened by defeating the miniboss, but you can fall through a trapdoor at the song's end to get to the next floor, if you don't mind the miniboss and several other monsters following you down, forcing you to kill it before you can actually explore the floor.Each boss has their own quirks. King Conga skips the eigth beat, and if you miss a step he'll get off his throne and charge at you. Deep Blues is a literal chessboard, swarming you with pieces that you must clear out before the King stops running away. Coral Riff floods the area, creating water tiles that stop you from moving if you step in them. Death Metal works through several phases at the pace of the fastest song in the game.And, of course, there are the story bosses in the last zone if you're playing as Cadence, Melody, or Aria. Fight the Necrodancer and reclaim your freedom!You can choose to start at any zone after the furthest you've finished, at the cost of not being able to complete more than one zone at a time, or take a top-to-bottom all zones run that starts you with no character upgrades. Completing and exploring individual zones rewards you with diamonds, which allow you to upgrade your character, unlock equipment, spells, and weapons, or buy items to start with in your next zone run.Of course, unlocking items just means you can find them in your next runs! This is a roguelike after all, and every sword, armor, ring, and spell has to be found in the Crypt itself for you to use them.Play as Melody and only attack when moving! Don't get cornered!Play as Eli and blast your enemies to bits... if you don't blow yourself up first!Play as Dove and friendship the monsters away... for a while before they mob you!Play as Monk and find even more ways to die, since you can't touch money!Play as Dorian and realize that moving two spaces at once is more frustrating than helpful!Play as Bolt and learn that double speed is somehow both faster and slower than you expect!Play as Aria and discover that perfect rhythm is even harder when you gotta stay alive too!Play as Bard and move to your own beat... coward.And, once you've done all that, play as Coda, the Monk-Bolt-Aria hybrid. That's all the description you need. Good luck!Overall rating: 4/4 time.			"

												Completionists, stay away.  There are things that are practically impossible to obtain.Roguelike purists, also stay away.  The game mechanics aren't extremely deep.Otherwise?  As long as you can tap to a metronome (or at least learn to) and do enjoy action, I highly recommend this game.Crypt of the NecroDancer, at its core, is a rhythm-based action with roguelite and dungeon crawler elements.  People have compared this game to games such as Faster Than Light and Spelunky; I really enjoyed the former and felt iffy about the latter, and after 350+ hours, I don't know if I can really stop playing NecroDancer just yet.It's very easy to pick up and understand the core gameplay; one or two local players act to the beat (with only the arrow keys), and everything else responds to your movements on the same beat, allowing you to plan for the next beat.  Getting dropped into the first zone after the tutorial level, you're introduced to a small variety of items, learning about this and that, buying and picking up things to figure out what your favorites are, and dealing with a small variety of enemies.  Items definitely make things easier, but it's absolutely possible to finish everything and low% a run with only default gear.(By the way, if you want to have a sense of genuine curiosity, go into the options and disable ""show item hints"".)And once you inevitably die, it's not so bad.  There's almost always a way out of whatever predicament you managed to get yourself into, and you sensibly chuckle at it and figure you'll do better next time.You slowly progress, saving a few unfortunate NPCs from cages, buying new things with diamonds and slowly expanding the pool of items you get to find and use during runs.  You finally manage to get the boss down, start to learn why Cadence is in this dungeon of dance, and then you're back to square one, figuring out the patterns in the completely new world that is Zone 2.  And you work through it, because holy crap is that Danny Baranowsky soundtrack fantastic and motivating.And you keep at it.  Some things change completely, some things don't, and some things get flipped upside-down and force you to change tactics.Occasionally, you take a break from Cadence and pick up a different character.  Oh yeah, there's other ways to play the game in Zone 1 again, and some new strategies for enemies you've seen before.  All the normal characters are interesting to work with in their own way.Once you feel that you've finished the important stuff, a variety of things open up.  Score runs?  Speedruns?  Sure thing, try to see how well you can do on the boards and in the daily challenge runs.  Low%?  Go for that, if you want to.  In terms of replayability, you get about as much as Spelunky -- everything generally stays the same, but for some reason the variations between runs always gets you coming back for more.Mods are a thing, to some extent.  At the very least, many resources can be replaced and custom levels are supported and supported through Steam Workshop.  That's about it, though; there's no way to add in completely new items and content just yet.Remember what I said about completionists?  Yeah, if you want to 100% this game legitimately, forget about it.  The developers added in a character that even they think is impossible.  There's absolutely nothing except bragging rights and an achievement to gain from completing a run as said character (unlike in, say, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth), so you're not missing out on too much otherwise.It's been great watching this game only get better from Early Access; Brace Yourself Games has been nothing less than incredible with regular development and responsive to the community.  If you haven't been driven away from reading this yet, it's absolutely worth more than the $15 that it's listed for.			"

												Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of roguelikes... I never seemed to grasp the concept of ""good"" or ""bad"" items, and I found the everchanging map layouts kinda disorienting.When I picked this game up, I expected the same cookie-cutter gameplay style. I'm very glad I was proven wrong. CotN is a fast-paced and quick-witted game based around completing actions based on the beat of the music playing in the background, and I found it quite amazing. It has a ton of replay value, it keeps you on edge and requires split-second reactions. Also, the music is really f*ckin' good. Maybe I'm biased, maybe I'm not. It's up to you if you wanna pick this game up for yourself. No regrets.			"

												I've actually never been interested in roguelike games before, but this one caught my attention due to its bizarre premise and strong focus on music. I bought it at its release discount, partly for the novelty of it, thinking I'd try it out once or twice to have a brief but amusing experience. I didn't expect to be addicted to this crazy game and for it to already be a contender for my game of the year.It has a pretty steep learning curve, as there are a lot of aspects you need to know and the tutorial is underwhelmingly non-descriptive. However after learning more of the basics from youtube videos and wiki guides, I've found that it has an incredible amount of depth that keeps me coming back for more.This is a game I'll be playing and talking about for quite a while. Definitely recommended.			"

												Pretty fun rhythm game. I kinda suck at it though, but it's a great game! I just am not that good at it; fighting-wise that is. I'm really good at the rhythm, but I suck at thinking out a strategy. You probably wouldn't want this game though if you never were the one who could keep a consistent tempo.Anyways, onto the review:The game is done really well. The music is great, items definitely make gameplay more interesting, as well as the enemies. I will continue to play this game for a while just because it's kind of a bit addicting. I mean, I haven't really seen any type of game that presents itself in this kind of way... never expected to really be able to have a game where you HAVE to move to the beat and it has roguelike elements in it. Great game, I reccommend for you to play it if you already haven't. 9/10			"

The variaty in the sprite's movement patterns create depth, difficulty and replayablilty.In the future there are promises of new characters and floor(s), I really look forward to this.If you like awesome music created by the beloved Danny Baranowsky, then you will love this amazing (not an overstatement) soundtrack.

								The Necrodancer delivers the electronic beats and a horde of monsters to defeat. Our unlikely herione, Cadance, boldly foregoes the suggested years of dance training and rushes in to save her own heart and vanquish a legendary foe.Roommate 1: ""What are you playing, Legend of Zelda?""Roommate 2: ""That actually looks like a decent rhythm game.""Brace Yourself Games has successfully combined a couple of genres into something you won't expect to be fun into something outright addictive. Every level is randomly generated and challenging in its own right, but there is always a bunch of orderly and easy to learn patterns to every enemy you will encounter. This isn't a game for everyone, but it's a game worth trying despite the fact that it isn't fully developed yet.Sure, the game is a bunch of pixels and the learning curve is a bit harsh. But the satisfaction of beating a single level keeps me coming back for another beating, the default music is awesome, and the game never ceases to be interesting. I don't know if I'll ever get good at it, but it inspires me to no end as a game-designer-in-training. I would regret never having played this game more than I regret a lot of other things.			"

As I have already 31 hours into this game, and I expect many more hours to come.Video review

												This game is pure genius.I've never played other rhythm based games before Crypt of the Necrodancer but I've always enjoyed Rogue-like games and I really feel like this one is amazingly realized. To date, nothing even marginally similar to this has ever been released and I sincerely think this has been one of the best games I've ever played.One more ""perk"" of this game is its simple retro-style, which one can love (as I do) or sincerely dislike.Another thing which one must realize BEFORE getting this game is that it's really challenging and requires a lot of time to be mastered.In my humble opinion this game is truly spectacular and it's worth the money.

I may suck at this game but that's the point. Every death I learn a new strategy. This game is a beautiful comcept and wonderous execution. Simple comands for a complex game. Be warry, your fingers will betray you. Just the name deserves 10/10. Good show.			"

												Only played 3 hours as of posting the review but hey this is my quick review of what it is so far and my thought.Yes, you should buy it if you're interested. It's soundtrack is made by the guy who did the soundtrack for the first Binding of Isaac and Super Meat Boy, there was no one better to do this.The game is really hard at first on stage 1 because it feels odd, it's defiantly its own style of play but once you learn it you love it, and from going from Zone 1 to Zone 2, it gets a lot more difficult, people looking for a good and fun challenge will defiantly find it with this game.There's tons of items, secrets, enemies, and different beats to make the 14.99$ the perfect price. I plan on putting a lot more time into this game :3 this is a saint for all who don't believe in Steam Beta's.11/10, there's a boss fight with a gorilla that likes to conga.			"

												The game is only part of it. Holy crap, this soundtrack... Sometimes, something comes along with a gimmick that you love. I love Freddie Merchantry. I sing along with him.ProsGenuinely unique rhythm based roguelike.Amazing soundtrack (Jules tracks aren't my fav but they're still good)You can use a dance pad. A freaking dance pad.Base game has lots of options to change gameplay (upgrades, janitor, characters), workshop content goes even farther.Great artwork and sound.ConsDifficulty ramps up to 11 after completing the majority of the story, Aria is quite difficult.Sometimes you want to play a game, but you're distracted or feeling out of it so your rhythm or skill is off. This is one of those games you can't really play in those times.The initial difficulty curve of playing a roguelike to rhythm may put off some players. (Bard is here to help! Play him to the beat, stop moving when you need to think about your movement.)I fully recommend getting this game and its soundtracks for full price or discount. It's completely worth it, discounted or not, fan of rhythm games or roguelikes or not, player of indie games or not. I have 27 hours played, but by now well over 200 hours listening to the music from this game.			"

												This game is beyond one of my favorite roguelikes. When you first start out it kinda is confusing on how to move. Basically you  just move to the music. If you dont like that then you can play bard. Bard doesnt have to move based on the beats. But the downside is that the enemies will move after you. The story is fantastic. The game is well worth its price although the only downside i have had with the game is dying alot. You get these really good items and then you die and it just flops. It is a game that is worth being in your library. The graphics are pixelart but why does that matter? Unless you're a graphics fanatic then i guess it does matter. If you do not like rougelikes then i would not recommend it because you will die alot and lose items ALOT.The badeges and emotes and backgrounds look nice on this game. Anyways if you dont like then you can always refund it and get money back.			"

												So, I bought this game a while ago after I had it on my wishlist for too long. And I have to say: I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!It's hard, it's frustrating but it also is pure awesomeness. After 7 hours of playing, I finally managed to beat Zone 1. Yes, it took me that long. Everytime I had a good run, this game kicked my butt and I died. And since it's rogue-like, you have to start from the beginning after every death. Normally I get really frustrated with games like this, but Crypt of the NecroDancer does everything right! Awesome music, awesome design, awesome gameplay. Most times playing it, after 1 or 2 hours I took a break, because it made me crazy to die over and over again. But I always try again. So I totally recommend it!GO!BUY IT! IT'S AWESOME!			"

												Let me just say, I didn't really know what I was getting into when I first bought the game. I thought ""oh, it's just going to be a fun little rythem game that I could easily beat"". I was so wrong. It was a game that was easy to learn and hard to master. The first zone was actually more difficult then I expected, but I beat it without troble. By the time zone 3 came, I was just about to throw my controller. But, I kept going, kept persisting and eventually I beat all of the zones. But, the replability comes in with new characters with differnt atributes that kept me coming back to play again. This game is harder then I thought, but it was definitly worth my money.Pros:-Fun, simple rythem game.-Ability to use custom music. (Just hearing Weird Al sing Bukingham Blues on the Deep Blues boss was sooooooooooooooo satisfying.)-Tons of differnt characters to unlock.-All zones mode to dare the experanced players.-Clean, pixel graphics.-Awsome music. (There are three versions too!)Cons:-Needs more weapons/items to unlock, I basicly got them all once I reached zone 3 with my first character.-Needs an online co-op (Local feels like multiplayer in the 90's)-Needs a better interface on the level creator. (I found it slightly annoying actually, you have to use the arrow keys, enter and delete and it quickly got tedious.)Overall I give this game 9/10. I had a lot of fun with it and it has the potential to pack in a ton more hours. "

												This game is amazing! It's a mix of zelda dungeon crawlers with a rhythm game. I highly HIGHLY recommend this game if you want something to pass the time. The only problem with this game is that it gets repetative and after playing and losing/dying multiple times, you're going to need a slight break.Overall the replay factor is nice and if you want to actually play the game the ""proper"" way (in my opinion) you should definately use a controller.

												Necrodancer is an enjoyable mashup of rhythm based and rouge-lite elements that end up working surprisingly well together. The game suffers from the same problems that most indie rogue-lites do and that is that it becomes fairly repetitive after a few hours of play due to a general lack of enemy variety. Still, the game does have 10 playable characters, each with their own gimmick to help diversify time spent playing the game. The game also comes with 3 soundtracks as well as the ability to use your own mp3s so that you don't have to listen to the same soundtrack over and over if you are having trouble getting past a particular zone. It's the kind of game I pick up and play a little of everyday and overtime has really grown on me.			"

												Easily one of the best rhythm games to come out EVER. CoTND is a procedurally generated dungeon crawler with the difficulty and addictiveness of Binding of Isaac, with, imo, a killer soundtrack. This is probably because the music was made by the same guy but, I digress. And if for some reason you hate the music (or you get sick of dying and hearing the same bloody song from level 1 over and over again like I do (inb4 'git good')) you can substitute the level songs with your own music. You play at Cadence, one of several musically-named individuals who must make their way through the titular Crypt for their each individual reasons, which is fun but the true awesomeness lies in the music-related combat and sweet pixel art visuals. That being said the game is hard. It's really hard. The good news is with a few proper upgrades you can become veritably unstoppable in any of the worlds. The learning curve drops into a cliff about the time you meet the Red Dragon, who can take you out with a single well-timed fire breath from across the map, and he'll show up every now and again in Zone 1.Easy to learn and hard to master are how I would describe this game, and would definitely recommend it unless you're known to break things if you get easily frustrated. Mice and keyboards are expensive.			"

								Don't think of this as a dance game or a rhythm game. Think of it as a roguelike that forces you to make 100-150 actions per minute. It takes some of the best parts of Spelunky and refines them. The ""real"" game is doing a hardcore run from 1-1 to the end, but you'll play for 20 hours just unlocking the ""tutorial"" content via the gem system, which goes a long way to evening out the difficulty curve issues that prevent most people getting very far / enjoying Spelunky.Honestly can't recommend it enough.

Each boss having their own rhythm, keeping you on feet trying to learn how each of them move and react. At the moment you can play as 4 different characters.

								Crypt of the Necrodancer is the game where you think you're good at beating down monsters to the beat... then you unlock hardcore mode. You think of this as impossible as Zone 3 is one giant zerg rush of skeleton horses and elemental enemies. Nonetheless you try it anyway and manage to get some decent gear. Then a red dragon comes along and says ""♥♥♥♥ you!"" and you get one shot by a fireball because you can't do the sacred red dragon dance at that moment. (That's my life, i cri evertim ;;) But seriously, this game is amazing in many aspects. It's hard to find a game where a particular character dies from picking up GOLD, of all things! Since the levels are randomly generated there is no true pattern to the game and permanent death is indeed a thing. So that guy that dies from picking up gold? He's no exception, better watch your step! Oh yeah, and the only way you can move/attack/dig/open chests is by hitting the arrow key in the direction that you want to go on the beat of the song that's playing. There's a nice little tutorial in-game for that, though. However, there is one thing that bugs me about Crypt of the Necrodancer. That is, the diamonds that are used to purchase items to be put into the item pool for non-hardcore runs. It would make more sense to have everything unlocked already, like hardcore does, but you are forced to buy it using diamonds you find during non-hardcore runs. It's a bit more harmful than helpful and everything should just be unlocked for you to use when it's found. Despite that, this game is well worth your time. I've got 60+ hours and counting clocked into Crypt of the Necrodancer and it's not like I'll be stopping anytime soon. If you like challenging games, get this game. If you like rogue-likes, get this game. If you like rhythm based games, get this game. The point is, just buy the freaking game! What're you waiting for? Scroll back up and click that ""Add to cart"" button!			"

												For the rogue-like and rhythm fans alike, this game provides an amazing soundtrack, lots of replay ability with its randomly generated levels, items, and bosses, as well as amazing pixel art! If you don't have this game, buy it now, it's worth every penny! (And for the people who are a bit tight when it comes to pecuniary measures, don't worry, this game has been on sale a lot these past few days!) I'd recommend this to any friend or family member who wants to have a great, grooving time! I'm extremely glad I can be a part of this community too. I honestly need to start a real life group that's filled with people who love the game as much as I do, because Crypt of the NecroDancer is one of my favorite games due to the amount of detail the sound crew, pixel artists, and everyone else had done (I also have to thank the person who made the puns for everyone of the enemy names personally, they're amazing without a doubt)! Although I only have around 50 hours of playing the game, you can bet on the shopkeeper's amazing voice that you'll love it too. And if the wide variety of characters, weapons, etc. aren't enough for you, you can even download mods! A personal favorite of my being the Captain Falcon reskins with sound, truly amazing.) With a great community and even greater team, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a must have. And now, after the real review is over, I must now make a musical pun to balance out the silliness (and to show respect for the beautiful, beautiful man/woman/team who came up with the puns.). Let's see... oh, I have one! If you do not like this game for whatever reason, then you can kindly and respectfully kiss my brass! Heh, I don't mean to toot my own horn or anything, but musical puns are the 'key' to success! (But back to seriousness, 10 out of 10, would recommend to everyone who plays video games and/or loves music.)			"

								This game takes everything that's good about roguelikes and rythym games and combines them, wrapping the package up with excellent music from Danny Baranowsky, the same guy who did the music for Super Meat Boy and the Binding of Isaac.Even with the little time I've spent with the game, it still feels worth it.

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is definitely one of the most unique roguelike games I’ve ever played, with the added bonus of actually resembling rogue instead of using roguelike as another term for “permadeath without saves”.  You play a family of musicians (or a motley crew of side-characters) determined to unlock the mystery of the magical lute and defeat the Necrodancer, a cursed necromantic bard.True to its name, you “dance” around each level by moving in tune to the rhythm meter at the bottom of the screen. Each level has its own tune and rhythm and the game steadily increases the pace as you progress. Keeping in tune with the music while vanquishing enemies will net you a higher multiplier which increases the amount of gold you find, in addition to enhancing certain special items found throughout the crypt. Failing to keep to the beat will cause your multiplier to go down and may also prevent you from moving. Since the monsters in the game also move to the beat, they will eventually close in on you to attack and you cannot stand still to “pause” the action (unless you’re playing the bard character). I found the soundtrack for CotN to be excellent and very diverse. Each level’s song fits its theme pretty well and there are a few tracks that are instantly catchy. The shopkeeper in each level will also sing along with the music, giving a clue to his location, and all of the monsters are either music-themed or have a name alluding to some musical term or instrument, adding an extra layer of detail to this thoroughly polished game.There really aren’t any faults with this game that would prevent any fan of rogues from picking it up (playing as Aria is extremely hard though) and, even if you’re not normally into games in this genre, the learning curve is very fair. This game is worth picking up even at its original cost, though if you can catch it at the average sale price of $5 it’s quite a steal!			"

												I'm going to compress things in a manner that I would like them to be if I were the one looking for more info about the game (coming from someone that loved Spelunky)...The Standard InfoCrypt of the Necrodancer is a rogue-lite game (and I don't say that for lack of difficulty) merging together aspects of Spelunky and Rogue.There are 4 different zones, each with their own characteristics (monsters, bosses, layout etc) much like the different zones in Spelunky(caves, jungle, ice, temple).You can choose to play any zone individually after unlocking it for the first time or play through all them consecutively (the standard game mode.)The levels are procedurally generated, technically never allowing for there to be an impossible one.There's items which you can buy from the shopkeeper, and unlock to buy from the shopkeeper as you progress through the game. There's also different characters you can play as, each with their own quirks (some much more difficult than others.)The differencesThe game is isometric and turn based with the ""turns"" simply being movements (much like Rogue.)But here's the catch: The turns are just beats (each level has a different song to dan.. I mean move to.) Successfully moving to the beat rewards you with a multiplier, increasing any gold you find. Mess up the beat, and the multiplier starts over.This not only provides an immensely satisfying experience when you nail zombies and skeletons to the flashing neon lights reminiscent of Hotline Miami, but it also effectively gives you a time limit to move and complete the level. You have to do SOMETHING on each beat and if you don't defeat the mini boss and finish the level by the end of the song: PENALTIES (and sometimes death.)Each enemy has a move set that you can learn, anticipate and counter. Combine that with the different characters you can play as, the items that change the way you fight and the endless potential of procedural levels and you get a game as addictive as breaking it down any other rogue-lite out there and better.If that wasn't enough to satisfy your craving for the never-ending cycle of die and repeat then there's also the level editor, allowing you to create and share your own dancefloors levels as well as play other user-created chambers of torment.If that's STILL not enough, there's the daily challenge. This is basically a series of zones that is exactly the same to everyone. This provides an opportunity to play and compare high scores fairly until the end of the day, when a new one is generated.This game is an example of what happens when you incorporate an interesting gimmick into a core gameplay mechanic and polish it until it shines brighter than the punch-myself-in-the-jugular-with-a-fistfull-of-glitter dancefloor it does the boogie on.And if for some reason you actually dislike the music in the game, or grow tired of dying to it constantly... YOU CAN DANC... PLAY TO YOUR OWN SONGS.142857/142857			"

												I've been addicted to this game since I started playing it. I am not a big fan of rogue-likes in general, but this game is among few rare exceptions. You have 4 zones to beat, each one contains 3 floors and a boss fight. Every zone has its own theme and enemies. But wait, there's more. The enemies each move to the beat in their own unique pattern, and you have to recognize it and adapt quickly. For example, some enemies might be moving along a scripted path, others try to go for you specifically, some might stay still for 2 beats and then move on the 3rd one, others might move on every beat, and so on. It's all very well done. During your dungeon crawling you'll also come across a lot of items of varying degrees of helpfulness. You have healing items, weapons, armour, rings, spells, and even some unusual items. Some can spawn from the start, others require unlocking via collectible diamonds. You can even remove the less useful items from the dungeons via the janitor, so that there's more chances instead for chests to contain the items you find more useful. There is of course a fair bit of luck involved, as is pretty common with rogue-like games. At times you'll be lucky to find a nice weapon and other useful items early on, other times you'll just be spawning with enemies all around you. It is a very challenging game. You will die a lot. But you do learn to recognize the enemy movement patterns and eventually overcome them. I also really like the whole light-hearted theme the game is going for. I think the devs pulled it off perfectly. The music is also amazing and will just drag you in to the beat. In addition to the regular mode with the main character, you also get to unlock several other characters, which seem to have their own unique abilities (for example one of them can only confuse enemies but not kill, another is only able to use bombs, and so on). It all adds an extra challenge for those who want it. You can even go and practice fighting against specific enemies and bosses if you wish. Great game in general. Highly recommended.			"

The gameplay is great and once you get the hang of the game it becomes very addicting to try and complete the game. Highly recommended.EDIT: With the release of the new ""Amplified"" DLC recently, the game feels even better than before. The remastered version of the metal soundtrack sounds even better than the original versions did, and all the new items, as well as the new zone and character, add so much more to the original game.

I look forward to playing this game throughout it's development and can't wait to see where it goes.Not sure if i'll try out the dancepad varient but if you have one it's a great way to immerse yourself even further into this great game.Price tag was set at a reasonable rate even without the sale.

												DDR meets Spelunkey. Shopkeepers sing along to the music. Fight a chess-themed boss. Murder or get murdered. And DANCE to fantastic music! Yes. The beats are much more forgiving than a standard rhythm game, and if even those are too hard, there's a Bard character that eliminates the need for beats entirely. The weapons are balanced to be more than just extra numbers taped on to a sword (most change your attack pattern) and permenant upgrades help out a lot in later levels. 9/10 Gameplay 10/10 Originality300/10 Soundtrack+1 Title Pun+1 Singing Shopkeepers+1 Import custom musicTotal: 322/30 (Must buy if you're at all interested in this kind of thing)			"

								Oh this game. Simple, difficult, and incredibly addictive. Even in it's incomplete form I have been pouring hours in every day. Necrodancer's art style is charming and beautiful, the soundtrack is earwormy and wonderful, and the gameplay is tough as nails but fair. Play through each zone seperately and aquire gems to unlock new equipment and expand your health or magic, and then attempt Hardcore Mode where the game really begins. Completion of hardcore modes takes skill and concentration, but the feeling of actually doing well at it is quite rewarding. Unlike many other roguelikes, this game is NOT gear dependant. You CAN beat it with nothing but the starting equipment. It's just extremely hard. My only complaint at this point is I WANT MORE STUFF. EXPAND EXPAND EXPAND! |hugs game|			"

												You buy it now! I mean it.This is a concept game, and an incredibly good idea!Four keys are required to play, the arrows, nothing else. And with these four keys, you will ""dance"" on the music toward victory! or a quick death... Every step you take is a move, an attack, or a special action. On a slow music, you have about one move per second, a lots of time to think and make the best choice... but on a fast music, your reflexes will be challenged because the smallest error can kill you.The game offers many different items, all offering different advantages. The strategical value here is to know when to buy or not an item depending on your situation. Every game feels different with the random dungeons and you will never get bored playing.The game also displays many different monsters, all with a unique AI. Some are easy, you will love them; some are nasty, and you will hate them. The game doesn't force you to kill all ennemies of course, only one : the boss... but killing ennemies give you gold, and gold give you better objects. You will have to decide all the time if you risk it or not... quick! You have one music beat to decide! Oh too late... :)			"

I give this game a :8++ The music + Unique, havent seen this before+ Full controller support, including dancepad! Whait they still exist?+ After beating all the zones, there is so much other things to do!+ You can sit back while doing this+ Good value- You need to learn patterns etc. Even while sitting back and relax you need to focus to dont rage!- Some people consider its too hard and its not woth the price, i argee and im not a prof player but i made al the zones so,,, its possible "

Understanding how each unique enemy works, and then finding yourself making strategies to defeat those, and seeing how further you get into each level each time you get those to work properly just gets you a sensation that you want to play more and more.

I haven't played too much of the story but It gave me a nice cheesy epic vibe.I was surpised to be able to use my own songs to play to the game (this is so awesome and appreciated.The Dungeons re-generate making every experience challenging and unique.

								When it comes to Early Access games, it can be hit or miss, most are bare bones and can be left unfinished, but others can be real gems that show the quality and talent indie games are known for, this is one of them, a game that already feels complete and plays very well, but hats off to the developers who wish to improve this game more to the best that it can be.High Points:  The controls are tight and responsive. The level design is always different, and yet the levels overall are kept rather short and rather straightforward, which is a big plus for these kinds of games. The variety of items and unlockables to get help encourage you to continue playing over and over again. The music, no doubt the highlight of the game, the music is addicting, enjoyable and will get stuck in your head for hours.Critique: As it stands at the moment, the game is pretty solid, but there is always room for improvment.1. More variety in items - If there is one thing Binding of Isaac has shown, is that with a large variety of items that all work differently, it helps make every playthrough different, with different items everytime, so it'd be nice to have something new other then rings, boots and such.2. Floor gimmicks - It'd be interesting if on all floors of other then the boss floor, there was a chance of a gimmick happening that can change the whole experience, like being chased by an invincible enemy, having no map to use, line of sight restricted, or even having a larger level the normal.3. More traps - I think some more traps might be needed to spice up the gameplay, like spin tiles to mess up the controls, moving traps that follow a set path, and perhaps traps that trigger if you move into their line of sight.Overall: I feel overall this game is looking really good, and I know when it finally comes out, it'll be a big hit.8.5/10			"

								Great game! There's just the right amount of depth that you learn through experience and the beat keeps each quick attempt moving at a nice pace. Daily challege is a fun mode, even though I always make a terrible mistake. Music is okay chip tune stuff and the opera singing shop keeper is amazing.			"

												I LOVE this game. Take NetHack, add cute pixel graphics and a charming story, make the turns happen to the beat of music, and compress the whole experience down to a bite size morsel you can consume in 30 minutes - and you have this little gem. I bought the game for $7US, and then promptly bought the soundtrack for $15US which is the only music I’ve listened to for the past 5 weeks.This game starts off hard, and then gets brutally hard as you unlock the more advanced characters. But I’ve never felt the game cheated me, despite dozens of deaths. Each one was my fault, and mine alone. I wasn’t fast enough, I zigged when I should have zagged, I didn’t prioritise the right enemy, I didn’t control a boss’s movement. There is an element of RNGesus, but your skill and experience is the biggest factor in your success, or failure, by far. Did I mention I love this game?			"

												Really great game. Just totally solid from every vantage point. Any review that places this game below at least a 90 in score on Metacritic is either using a 5 star system and doesn't grant half stars or doesn't appreciate the nuances of the gameplay / the difficulty of the game.There is a large breadth of mechanics (there are tons of aspects of play like exploration, timing, resource management, risk/reward, etc) but all of which are approachable. The real startling thing is they have incredible depth and learning the nuances of each one give a decent advantage to the player (spotting loot in wall tiles, having perfect rhythm/decision making while swarmed in constant fractions of seconds, learning to love glass items, when to use a long-hit vs wide-hit weapon, etc). I love roguelikes but rarely find the types that I REALLY love, particularly those that emulate a style of gameplay similar to NetHack while not having any one aspect be broken. The amazing soundtracks on top of a game which is already very easy to appreciate on its own merits is just icing on top of the cake.The difficulty is fine, in spite of a few claims otherwise. Dancepad mode is available for those who need slightly easier play. Altering the music can also allow for slower gameplay too. Hell, there's a character where you can avoid the beat mechanic entirely and which is very obviously there for players to train and get better, get a purer roguelike experience, or just clear the zones as quickly as possible. ANY review that bashes the game for not being easy in the main mode despite the many attempts by the devs to give easier options is just feeding into the mindset that games with hard base difficulty are bad. It's not only not fair but it's also greatly hindering games with permadeath and large death penalties from being developed. Hell, even I can't beat clear the second zone of Spelunky but I can still appreciate it.The only criticism of this game that I found fair was that unlocking the full story requires beating all four zones with three different characters, the last of which is a hardcore player character (one missed beat or any damage and you die and have to restart the zone). With vanilla gameplay, even knowing the game VERY well it borders on being a slight bit unreasonable. Bottom line: if you're not the kind of person who complains about how hard and punishing a /ROGUELIKE/ can be and if you're willing to put in enough time to appreciate the depth of mechanics then you'll love Necrodancer.Get the game. Love it and be a casual player if you'd like. It's perfectly made for that too. But hopefully you'll join in the more competitive scene and see how far the rabbit hole really goes. It could certainly use some action and the game can absolutely support it.Best of luck unlocking Coda.			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is a game where players must travel through the many stages of the game as Michael Jackson in his quest to save Billie Jean and the Children. Players can spend health points at the benifit of synchronized dancing with the enemies to instantly defeat them. At the end of the game players turn into robo Michael Jackson and face off against the epic final boss in a disco showdown.Are you Bad enough to save Billie Jean and just Beat It?			"

								Addicting, Fresh, and Challenging with a soundtrack that will get into your head. It's hard to not get into the beat as you progress through the dungeon levels throught each zone. Taking caution in each room as you learn the movement patterns of each enemy is a tough lession to learn. I look forward to playing this game throughout it's development and can't wait to see where it goes.Not sure if i'll try out the dancepad varient but if you have one it's a great way to immerse yourself even further into this great game.Price tag was set at a reasonable rate even without the sale.

								Oh this game. Simple, difficult, and incredibly addictive. Even in it's incomplete form I have been pouring hours in every day. Necrodancer's art style is charming and beautiful, the soundtrack is earwormy and wonderful, and the gameplay is tough as nails but fair. Play through each zone seperately and aquire gems to unlock new equipment and expand your health or magic, and then attempt Hardcore Mode where the game really begins. Completion of hardcore modes takes skill and concentration, but the feeling of actually doing well at it is quite rewarding. Unlike many other roguelikes, this game is NOT gear dependant. You CAN beat it with nothing but the starting equipment. It's just extremely hard. My only complaint at this point is I WANT MORE STUFF. EXPAND EXPAND EXPAND! |hugs game|			"

												Crypt of the NecroDancer is a dungeon-crawler game set to the beat of music. The game is divided into 4 zones with several levels in each zone. In each level you must use your arrow keys to move your character in time beat of the music, the longer you can keep in time, the larger bonsues you can get which result in increased gold drops from enemies you defeat. At the end of the song, you are automatically dropped to the next level (or zone boss if you're on the last level of the zone) or you can procede to the next level by finding the stairs which may need to be opened by defeating a tougher enemy, such as a dragon.There are numerous items and weapons you can find and buy which aid you against the foes  you may encounter, from items that heal you, torches which increase your visability and charms which may freeze enemies, as well as many more. Some of these you use by using different key combinations such as down + left or up + right. Different types of weapons may have increased range, heal you if you get a certain number of kills or attack multiple enemies at once (including those positioned diagonally to you). The levels are randomly generated so there is lots of replayability, this does mean you can be screwed over on occasion depending on how certain items and enemies are spawned or not spawned, but that just adds to the fun. The soundtrack from what I've heard so far (still on Zone 1) is good, the music seems to be a kind of funky techno/trance thing, however you can set any of your own music for one or more levels. This can potentially make the game harder or easier. Enya was quite hard, but slaying enemies to the sounds of Werewolves of London by Warren Zevon was fun. As mentioned before, the level ends when the song ends so I would not recommend selecting any of the short tracks that make up the Abbey Road medley by the Beatles for example.  Crypt of the NecroDancer is quite a difficult game, especially if you don't have the greatest sense of rythmn. It can be quite easy to die especially if a dragon appears and you're just armed with the starting dagger, but despite dying often, this does not give me the desire to rage quit but rather just to try again and I still find it fun. So despite being hard, for me personally this isn't a bad thing.TLDR:I recommend this game+ Fun, easy to understand which you can+ Funky music as well as the ability to use your own + Randomly generated levels so you can repeat the same levels time and time again and each time it'll be different+ A good number of characters you can unlock+ Lots of items and weapons you can find and buy, as well as upgrades- Quite hard, I must say *dies again*- There doesn't seem to be a huge number of levels in total			"

The rhythmic aspect of the game makes it constantly challenging  but rarely unfair (because let's be real, it's not a roguelike if you don't have the occasional ""holy christ what is happening the floor is suddenly monsters"" moment) and the enemies are well designed and are all individually easy to understand, but collectively challenging to play around.The second major selling point here is the music, which is great and super catchy. There's also the option to use your own custom music for each level.And the shopkeeper sings too.10/10			"

												Just the right quantities of fun and challenging. I strongly recommend this game, even if you don't usually play rogue-likes or rhythm games. I'd never played either outside of the occasional DDR match at cinema arcades, so I was a bit dubious as to whether I'd like this. Now I'm hooked!			"

 Crypt of the NecroDancer review 	After 200 hours of playtime I think it is finally the time to do a review of Crypt of the NecroDancer... so lets get startedCrypt of the NecroDancer is a Rythm based Rouge-like, so If you like the awesome soundtrack and don`t mind restarting from the beginning, then this would be the perfect game for you.+Great Soundtrack by DannyB (Also did music for Meatboy etc.), A_Rival and FamilyJules7x+Graphics - They fit the game really good (Dancing skeletons too)+Easy contols (You only have to use 4 arrow keys, but you can bind the button combos to other buttons too)+Contoller/Dancepad support+Highly skill based (You can beat the game without picking up any items)+Awesome Shopkeeper+++ Finally beating that boss you never beaten before-Getting into the game, as you have to learn the enemy pattern, get into the beat etc.Crypt of the Necrodancer gets a solid 9.5/10 from me :Pbtw... only game you can play with 1 hand  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												Do you like rougelikes, rhythm games, adventure games, top down dungeon crawlers, and/or cryptic (Neh heh heh) feeling games, play it. The gameplay consists of moving to the beat of your heart (or music) and only to the beat and figuring out the enemy’s attack patterns. It will take some learning but you'll enjoy dancing while being tortured by this game.Note: Only play this game if you like a challenge and rougelikes. This is rather forgiving for its genre (you can buy upgrades that never go away and only have to redo the stage, not the entire game) and can be appealing to lots of people. Pick it up and give it a try.			"

												Crypt of the NecroDancer is a dungeon-crawler game set to the beat of music. The game is divided into 4 zones with several levels in each zone. In each level you must use your arrow keys to move your character in time beat of the music, the longer you can keep in time, the larger bonsues you can get which result in increased gold drops from enemies you defeat. At the end of the song, you are automatically dropped to the next level (or zone boss if you're on the last level of the zone) or you can procede to the next level by finding the stairs which may need to be opened by defeating a tougher enemy, such as a dragon.There are numerous items and weapons you can find and buy which aid you against the foes  you may encounter, from items that heal you, torches which increase your visability and charms which may freeze enemies, as well as many more. Some of these you use by using different key combinations such as down + left or up + right. Different types of weapons may have increased range, heal you if you get a certain number of kills or attack multiple enemies at once (including those positioned diagonally to you). The levels are randomly generated so there is lots of replayability, this does mean you can be screwed over on occasion depending on how certain items and enemies are spawned or not spawned, but that just adds to the fun. The soundtrack from what I've heard so far (still on Zone 1) is good, the music seems to be a kind of funky techno/trance thing, however you can set any of your own music for one or more levels. This can potentially make the game harder or easier. Enya was quite hard, but slaying enemies to the sounds of Werewolves of London by Warren Zevon was fun. As mentioned before, the level ends when the song ends so I would not recommend selecting any of the short tracks that make up the Abbey Road medley by the Beatles for example.  Crypt of the NecroDancer is quite a difficult game, especially if you don't have the greatest sense of rythmn. It can be quite easy to die especially if a dragon appears and you're just armed with the starting dagger, but despite dying often, this does not give me the desire to rage quit but rather just to try again and I still find it fun. So despite being hard, for me personally this isn't a bad thing.TLDR:I recommend this game+ Fun, easy to understand which you can+ Funky music as well as the ability to use your own + Randomly generated levels so you can repeat the same levels time and time again and each time it'll be different+ A good number of characters you can unlock+ Lots of items and weapons you can find and buy, as well as upgrades- Quite hard, I must say *dies again*- There doesn't seem to be a huge number of levels in total			"

												A beautiful blend of dungeon crawler and rhythm-based gameplay that shows progress isn't the only reward, not with a smashing sountrack like this.To start, I have put over 80hrs in on the PS4 version. That is how I learned of this game. I had to buy it ASAP because that is just how good it is. Even got it on my smartphone and spent about 20 hours on that version.This game tasks you with crawling through a dungeon while slaying monsters to get to the end. Simple enough right? Wrong. To do anything (move, attack, use item) you must do it to the rhythm of the music that is unique to that floor of that dungeon. Sound fun yet? The monsters also have their own movement style that goes to th music too so now you have to learn their pattern to be able to take them out without getting hurt.There are plenty of things to unlock too, like weapons, weapon types, character boosts, and magic items. There are also different characters to unlock in the game that very drasticallly change up how you play your game!Have I mentioned the soundtrack you play to is absolutely amazing?No dungeon crawler is as good as this one. I fear none may ever be. Get out there and buy this!			"

So please be patient, unless you're one of those naturally gifted with the ability to keep up with the music the first try.

It's Dangerous to Dance AloneRouge-Lite games have been done to death within the past couple of years. Retro Aestetic? CheckPermadeath? CheckGenerated Dungeon? CheckWhat makes Crypt of the Necrodancer stand out in my opinion?well..It's rhythm based. I love rhythm based games which was the main reason for me buying this.It's also harder than it looks. In order to move you gotta hit the arrow keys (or whatever button you wish to map to) along with the beat. Unlike some Rouge-Lite's: losing doesnt feel like a waste of time. You just want to return and try to nail the rythm with your finger tips. If you collect enough Diamonds you can buy loot in your lobby and the diamondsremain in your inventory until you restart a new zone.If you somehow are a genius and have perfect rythm and beat the game there's always daily challenges to back once a day to further up your skills.Also if you like the idea of a DDR dance pad then there's a dance pad mode to improve your cardio and dance if you want to be the Patrick Swayze of Crypt of the Nectrodancer.

Crypt of the NecroDancer is a game that intrigued me from the first moment I heard about it.Just about everything in this game is absolutly charming; from the overall visual design, to smaller details like the singing shopkeep, you can realy feel the love and passion that went in to this project. However the thing that truly sets NecroDancer apart from any other game is how it brilliantly blends the dungeon crawler and rhythm game genres into something new, and in my opinion, something greater than the sum of its parts.As a part of the Steam Awards, Valve featured The “We Didn’t Think Of Everything” Award, which allows us the chance to nominate the games that might not fit into an existing category. As such, I would like to nominate Crypt of the NecroDancer for The “Most Innovative Gameplay Mechanics” Award 2016. I have certainly loved playing this game, and I hope that you will enjoy it too!

												The way this game incorporates rhythm into its mechanic is brilliant. at times, the game begins to spiral out of one's control if your reflexes aren't enough, and through repeated failure, one find success. This game is one of those games that you can perfect over time, and getting skilled at it feels really great. =)			"

												Disclaimer. Do not get this game if you like your fancy 100% game completion rate, as this game's achievements will tear it to shreds. They are not glitched or anything, but some are unbelievably hard.But regardless it is one of the best games I ever played. It is almost perfect, though there are a few flaws here and there, mostly minor.The biggest thing is that playing one of the hardest characters is a decent part of the game's story, most of the characters aren't ""easy"" per say, but dying in one hit to anything, including missing a beat is a little extreme to have to go through to progress the story, even if you don't take the hardcore route and do it by playing the zones individually.I heard that you can do it co-op with Bard as your partner to make getting the last bits of the story more reasonable, but I haven't tried it and even if it helps, you're still in for hell of a ride. (I decided against playing that character until I get a few more achievements)Another thing is how one of the challenge characters work, the one where you have to play twice as fast, but the speed of the music stays the same, which is odd surprising that this is a game where you have to play along with the beats of the song and it doesn't quite work right in that case, but apparently there's a mod for that.And the last nitpick being how the singing shopkeeper vocals clash with the metal version of the soundtrack.But regardless it's a great game with good music and providing a unique and fun experience.

												I LOVE this game. Take NetHack, add cute pixel graphics and a charming story, make the turns happen to the beat of music, and compress the whole experience down to a bite size morsel you can consume in 30 minutes - and you have this little gem. I bought the game for $7US, and then promptly bought the soundtrack for $15US which is the only music I’ve listened to for the past 5 weeks.This game starts off hard, and then gets brutally hard as you unlock the more advanced characters. But I’ve never felt the game cheated me, despite dozens of deaths. Each one was my fault, and mine alone. I wasn’t fast enough, I zigged when I should have zagged, I didn’t prioritise the right enemy, I didn’t control a boss’s movement. There is an element of RNGesus, but your skill and experience is the biggest factor in your success, or failure, by far. Did I mention I love this game?			"

												A beautiful blend of dungeon crawler and rhythm-based gameplay that shows progress isn't the only reward, not with a smashing sountrack like this.To start, I have put over 80hrs in on the PS4 version. That is how I learned of this game. I had to buy it ASAP because that is just how good it is. Even got it on my smartphone and spent about 20 hours on that version.This game tasks you with crawling through a dungeon while slaying monsters to get to the end. Simple enough right? Wrong. To do anything (move, attack, use item) you must do it to the rhythm of the music that is unique to that floor of that dungeon. Sound fun yet? The monsters also have their own movement style that goes to th music too so now you have to learn their pattern to be able to take them out without getting hurt.There are plenty of things to unlock too, like weapons, weapon types, character boosts, and magic items. There are also different characters to unlock in the game that very drasticallly change up how you play your game!Have I mentioned the soundtrack you play to is absolutely amazing?No dungeon crawler is as good as this one. I fear none may ever be. Get out there and buy this!			"

It's Dangerous to Dance AloneRouge-Lite games have been done to death within the past couple of years. Retro Aestetic? CheckPermadeath? CheckGenerated Dungeon? CheckWhat makes Crypt of the Necrodancer stand out in my opinion?well..It's rhythm based. I love rhythm based games which was the main reason for me buying this.It's also harder than it looks. In order to move you gotta hit the arrow keys (or whatever button you wish to map to) along with the beat. Unlike some Rouge-Lite's: losing doesnt feel like a waste of time. You just want to return and try to nail the rythm with your finger tips. If you collect enough Diamonds you can buy loot in your lobby and the diamondsremain in your inventory until you restart a new zone.If you somehow are a genius and have perfect rythm and beat the game there's always daily challenges to back once a day to further up your skills.Also if you like the idea of a DDR dance pad then there's a dance pad mode to improve your cardio and dance if you want to be the Patrick Swayze of Crypt of the Nectrodancer.

												This game manages to put the most ingenious mechanic into play in such a fun way. It supplies you with seemingly endless challenge  requiring hundreds of hours to master. I still haven't completed all the game has to offer despite 150+ hours of play and by statistics only 1 in 1000 have been able to do so. The amazing soundtrack gets stuck in my head and may be worth downloading on its own without the game for some.The only downside I can think of is that it heavily adopts the ""git good"" system and requires heavy devotion to gain the most experience			"

												Really Innovative, an amazing game.Crypt of the NecroDancer has very simple mechanics, and is easy to pick up and play. The first hour or so discovering all the game mechanics great, and the game life is extended with the edition of all the other elements (weapons, items etc.) This moves the learning curve upwards, while still extending the life of the game substaintially.The music is good- fits the style well.I personally like the additional challenges of the other characters from the default- the can make the game COMPLETELY different, especially in difficultly - there is potential for a huge amount of varied hours in this game.Only downside for me is that some areas can be frustrating, even on the normal difficulty, but they can be overcome.It's also a very reasonable price, especially when its on sale.A strong recommendation for a great game  "

												Warning to all who dare to enter the Crypt - If you have no internal metronome, turn back now. Seriously, you need to be able to hold a beat to even consider playing this game in full. And yes, this is an important distinction - I've seen several attempted runs from someone who didn't, they were very short lived. Another warning - If you have any music preferences, they're about to be formatted.Anyways, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a roguelike rhythm game. The roguelike takes precedence for the most part, but it's good to keep a rhythm-game mentality. The gameplay can be a bit tricky at first, but superb once you get the hang of it. The actual progression is a bit basic (not uncommon for roguelikes), but that's not too major a problem. The biggest issue most people have with the game is that the rhythm-based controls are a bit gimmicky or unwieldy, but I had very little problems with them and they didn't get in my way too much.But enough about the gameplay. I'm writing this review to commend the SOUNDTRACK. This game's BGM alone is worth the $15 admission fee, and that's a bargain. I've been known to listen to the soundtrack on repeat for hours on end, and am working on burning the soundtrack onto a CD as I type this. And if the planets align and someone is born who doesn't like the music - you can set your own too.So in summary: If you think you can manage the gameplay, get the full game. If you don't think you can manage it, already have the game, or need a new soundtrack to listen to in your spare time, buy the soundtrack. And if by some strange coincidence you neither want this game's gameplay nor it's soundtrack, then and ONLY then will I permit you to not touch this game.What are you waiting for... pick up the beat!

Early Access Review
								A creative take on the roguelike genre which replaces most of the RPG-elements traditionally seen in roguelike games with a rhythm ""gimmick"". In the strict sense it is not however a roguelike because of the lack of actual permadeath. Throughout your runthrough you will encounter diamonds which you can pick up and unlock permanent powerups in the hub-area.Before buying the game keep in mind that it is an Early-Access game, meaning certain features you enjoy might be changed or removed entirely (Rust comes to mind). The game is also farily expensive at 15 euros/15 dollars.The soundtrack is mainly composed of ""chiptune electronica"", an easy way of describing it would be to think about ""8-Bit"" music and traditional electronica, This genre of music fits the artstyle and gameplay and is one of the best things about the gameThe game has tremendous replay value if you're a completionist. Similarly to other Rogue-Likes the fun lies in losing repeteadly and learning from your mistakes, only to come back stronger each time and eventually beat the game. There are several game-modes including a  hardcore mode which takes away all afformentioned permanent powerups to provide a true roguelike experience, and a co-op mode If you're a fan of rhythm games like guitar hero, osu! and DDR or roguelike games like Binding of Isaac, Dungeons of Dredmor or Risk of Rain it will more than likely be a good game for you, however if you're new to either genres i'd reccomend to check out Binding of Isaac which costs 1/3rd of what this game does before coming to your conclusion.They need to add steam Achievements and Worskshop to it eventually thoughsolid 8/10 for me			"

												This is a game that I just keep coming back to in my steam library, the music stays with you and and has you craving just one more play through, so addictive. I love the concept of dancing to the beat, but it could challenge those less coordinated. There is a large array of weapons, spells and items to make every playthrough different, and the dungeons are randomly generated too. The game has lovely bright colours and a cool pixelated feel, what are you waiting for? Buy it now!			"

												I waited to get this game for weeks and I was not disappointed. It's an absolute joy to play, balancing the strategy of roguelikes with the addictiveness of rhythm games. Even though the game itself is short, there's a surprising amount of content with several characters and dozens of items to unlock. Some characters even have their own alternate soundtracks, which constantly keeps the game fresh even after dozens of plays.Really, the only stain marring of this gem is the game's poorly-designed story mode. In order to see all of the game's cutscenes, bosses and songs, one must beat it from start to finish with three specific characters. The first two are fine, but the third is an insane leap in difficulty that requires weeks of practice and an incredible streak of luck to beat.Final verdict: If you pick up this game, expect to have a good time while it lasts. Try out all the characters, pick up some mods, get some achievements, but don't expect that you'll be able to finish it.			"

 Crypt of the NecroDancer review 	After 200 hours of playtime I think it is finally the time to do a review of Crypt of the NecroDancer... so lets get startedCrypt of the NecroDancer is a Rythm based Rouge-like, so If you like the awesome soundtrack and don`t mind restarting from the beginning, then this would be the perfect game for you.+Great Soundtrack by DannyB (Also did music for Meatboy etc.), A_Rival and FamilyJules7x+Graphics - They fit the game really good (Dancing skeletons too)+Easy contols (You only have to use 4 arrow keys, but you can bind the button combos to other buttons too)+Contoller/Dancepad support+Highly skill based (You can beat the game without picking up any items)+Awesome Shopkeeper+++ Finally beating that boss you never beaten before-Getting into the game, as you have to learn the enemy pattern, get into the beat etc.Crypt of the Necrodancer gets a solid 9.5/10 from me :Pbtw... only game you can play with 1 hand  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												With the surge in popularity of roguelikes, it was an eventuality that developers would need to do something other than merely make another punishing dungeon crawler like the original Rogue. While there have been many grand takes on the formula by entrants like Rogue Legacy, FTL, and Nuclear Throne, the last concept I was expecting was a roguelike crossed with a rhythm game. I wondered how this mashup would even work, but it turned out that the answer was quite simple; you just press the arrow keys in time with the music’s beat while traversing floors of a dungeon. Simple premise, but Necrodancer is deviously challenging because of its rhythmical movement, even if it can suffer from incredible roguelike luck.Dance Dance Revolution meets a dungeon crawler is the quickest and easiest way to define the game. Both the enemies and your movements are tied to the music’s beat, where trying to move on an offbeat will result in an awkward hop in place, and skipping a beat will act as a ‘passed turn’, both dropping your combo. Most enemies have a specific pattern or interaction with the beat, like how skeletons will raise their arms for one beat before moving forward on the following one, or how minotaurs will charge in a straight rhythmic line upon direct sight. Learning these patterns and quirks will let you dance around enemies, and pulling out deft, tactical evasions of enemy mobs never fails to be incredibly satisfying. Items and equipment are available to be discovered or purchased (via a rather vocal and potentially homicidal shopkeeper), including weaponry like longswords that supply an extra square of attack range, boots that let you walk across hazards without a care, rings that bestow various effects like increasing the amount of gold dropped by enemies, spectacles that will let you see what treasure you’ll get from chests and other containers, and other fun utilities. Some loadouts of equipment are more preferable than others, and gathering them becomes a priority in order to make later sections laughably easy. No need to worry about lava or ice when you can just float above the floor! No need to worry about health when you have a blood bow that lets you kill enemies from afar and replenish your health! There are trade-offs between items and gear of course and your ‘this is the run’ loadout will no doubt vary from my own, but once you get an optimal loadout, the game’s later challenging sections become trivial save for boss fights. On the flip side, poor luck resulting in less than ideal loadouts can also occur, and raw player skill can only go so far in some cases.The challenge in Necrodancer primarily comes from how the enemies never -ever- falter in their timing and movements with the music; The player however can (and will, on your first few attempts) make mistakes, thus making a missed beat punishing or potentially run-ending - Not to mention you lose your gold multiplier from being struck by an enemy. Many roguelikes require situational and environmental awareness in order to avoid losing a run, but Necrodancer demands auditory awareness on top of it all, what with how the music is your means of moving. Thankfully the developers included a visual aid of a heart that beats with every beat, as well as scales that close in on the heart to cue you on when movement or attacking is possible, which is both kind and intelligent on their part. I cannot list the number of times I’ve panicked and had to look at the heart beat in order to get back on rhythm. The music doesn’t last forever however, and if you’re still on the dungeon floor before the song ends and you don’t reach the exit, you’ll automatically be ejected to the next floor. Also as a kind gesture there’s a bestiary that lets you practice against encountered enemies to study their patterns and traits - Considering the later difficulty, these aids help balance the field. Necrodancer had more characters and modes of play added during its period in early access, like dance mat support, a cooperative mode, and even a custom track function to let you jive around dungeon floors with your own music. The core game doesn’t really change, it simply becomes modified with the various characters and different rules. There’s even a puzzle mode that gives you a floor to tackle using specific items and strategies that quickly becomes head scratching, and of course included is a daily seed that gives all players the same dungeon to take on and go for a high score. Once you get a solid grasp of the game and can get successful runs frequently, these various ways to play improve the longevity of a game that would’ve otherwise been rather short and easy to gleam over.Your purchase for Crypt of the Necrodancer will primarily rely on whether or not you enjoy the soundtrack; if you don’t, chances are you’re not going to have a good time. Rhythm games can only be so enjoyable if the soundtrack doesn’t sit well with the player, and in my case I’m a fan for most of Necrodancer’s tracks. Danny Baranowsky’s composition is full, vibrant and seldom with any musical downtime, which lends a very active listening experience to the game; for a game where the combat and movement is based on musical beats, having any song be boring or lacking instrumentation would result in dull gameplay. The backing synth for many of the tracks end up giving the soundtrack an almost gothic/horror feel but doing so within its techno/rocking manner. Of course, that’s when you discover later on that there are not one but -two- remixed soundtracks in later sections of the story mode, with the first striking chords of a laser disco and the second more grounded in reality with heavier, nastier rock. All three soundtracks have been uploaded to YouTube if you want to judge for yourself, which is advisable homework when it comes to purchasing rhythm games.Necrodancer’s strengths lie in its longevity, challenge and gimmick; like many roguelikes the difficulty does become somewhat trivial once you are knowledgeable of its components and mechanics. That said, the demands the game makes of the player ensures that you can know what items work well together and can dance around enemy patterns easily, but it all means nothing if you can’t execute tactfully. Back up this challenge with fantastic music and multiple ways to play, and you get a roguelike that is both satisfying and incredibly enjoyable.			"

												A roguelike (i.e. a turn based game where you explore a dungeon, with a different layout every game, finding loot and slaying monsters), with the turns set to a musical beat. NecroDancer negates most of the genre's traditional flaws.NecroDancer has adorable pixel art in a style reminiscent of the good 2D Legend of Zelda games, but more colourful. Roguelikes traditionally have either ASCII art or crappy looking tiles.NecroDancer is fast paced and games typically last no more than 30 minutes. Roguelikes traditionally take hours to play.NecroDancer has wonderful music and sounds. Roguelikes traditionally have either nonexistent or very bad music and sound effects.NecroDancer has simple, predictable rules for enemies (albeit challenging because you have to act on them fast). Roguelikes traditionally make the dungeon monsters all behave erratically.NecroDancer has simple controls. You play with literally just the arrow keys, occasionally pressing 2 arrows together. Traditional roguelikes such as NetHack not only have a different action for every single character A through Z both with and without the shift key, but also have an ""extended"" set of commands that you have to type by name to use, because there just aren't enough keys on a keyboard for them.The main downside is that NecroDancer is really difficult to play if you have a massive hangover like I do right now. Traditional roguelikes are no more punishingly difficult than usual when you can barely see the screen and have to stare at each individual inch with one eye, because you can just take as long as you need to pray at the porcelain throne in between turns.

												(Previous reviews below are still accurate)Steam Awards Nomination re-reviewRogue-like rhythm game, that should be enough to sell this for anyone interested, but the music is really good, too, and the gameplay doesn't get stale. Even has local co-op. 9/10 for real, not exaggeration.Post-EA review:The game is now out of early-access, and I've been playing the crap out of it all along.  Some sort of magical undefined aspect giving it massive replayability.  I'm not even using custom MP3s because the built in songs are great (and well-balanced).  I did buy the dance pad (optional) for like $350 and haven't even had a chance to use it yet, but the game is amazing enough on the keyboard :)  I haven't beaten zone 4 yet, but it's tons of fun trying and dying, I'll get it eventually!  Buy it, play it, get good at it, and enjoy the crap out of it.  Best game in a long time.  My Original Early Access review:First impression: I played this for like 5 hours in a row, it's so sweet!  Now I wanna buy a dance pad for $300Rhythm based combat and gameplay with roguelike aspects and plenty of gear upgrading!  This game is already spectacular, and it's not even finished.  BUY IT NOW!  The .ogg music files are just sitting in your Steam directory, so don't buy the soundtrack unless you're doing it to give the devs more money/support :)			"

												No game has had songs looping through my head quite like this one.  The game was a lot of fun as well, definitely play with a controller.  It reminded me of Rogue Legacy in that when you start out you'll probably die quite a bit, then as you go you'll both unlock items to help you get better and you'll learn tricks on helping yourself.  There are boss fights as well, but I didn't find them as challenging as the levels preceeding them.  That's a blessing, because sometimes making it to the boss at all is enough of a challenge.  I love that they did music DLC, something I think other games should try sometime.			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is a dungeon-crawler, rouge-like, rythm RPG with loot. You can only move and attack monsters along with the beat of the song playing, so you have to memorize the pattern of each monster's movements and attacks to kill them. It's not as hard as I made it sound, but can still be fairly difficult. If it gets too hard, which isn't likely, you can go into a training zone of the monster you struggle to defeat.Moving and attacking with the beat isn't hard, and deploying weapons and attacks you've aqcuired just takes a combo of two arrow keys.The story of the game is nothing special, and that's completely fine. The replayability is beautiful, and there is also a daily challenge to keep you playing.What I love about this game the most is that although it's hard, I've never rage quit. The fun outweighs the difficulty to keep you playing. You can add custom music from your computer's files, but it will disable achievements.It's a beautiful game with a great soundtrack, achievements, and Steam Workshop support to change the textures (Undertale, Megaman ect.) If you like retro RPGs and rythm based games, it's for you.			"

								Game goes to BSOD when launching on my Windows XP DDR-Machine PC with two Cobalt Flux Dance Pads...The PC does meet and exceed the system requirements...I really want to play this... Please message me if there's a fix, but for now I can't fully enjoy this game as it doesn't work on my DDR Rig and I just can't have as much fun playing it with a keyboard...It is definitely a great idea, and lots of fun, but I cannot recommend it for the all the people out there like me that have a dedicated Stepmania build that hasn't been updated in a while. By all means the game should be able to run fine. I've commented on the forums and if I'm helped out, I will defintely play through the game and give it the review it deserves.EDIT: I've been using GlovePIE to play this game with Wiimotes with my friends on the huge TV and it's really great fun. I'll post my configuration on the forums. Still no DDR pads, though. Hopefully it'll get straightened out soon; the developers have been talking to me and trying to help out, and that's all I could ever ask for. Really a shame I got so many downvotes on my prior review, I wasn't trying to be an asshat or anything, but it's very frustrating when you buy a game and spend hours trying to get it to work with no success. I'm sure we've all been there.Anyway, tl;dr: AMAZING GAME, BUY IT IF YOU LOVE RHYTHM GAMES OR CLASSIC ROGUELIKES			"

												If you haven't bought this already, buy it.Pros: The dungeons are different every time.Tons of characters with very different playstyles (ex the default character has to move to the beat, another one can move to his own beat, one more has infinite bombs, etc.)The music will get you. I literally cannot get the music out of my head.Pretty easy to understand. You only use the arrow keys.Daily Challenge (if that's your thing). Every day a random dungeon is set up and you get one run to score as high as possible. There's a global leaderboard.Pop in your own music and play to its beats.Cons:If you don't like rhythm games, well you won't like this. It is very VERY hard at first. You meet lots of enemies who each have their own movement and attack patterns. You will probably die a lot, and it can be frustrating. There are a lot of items that can make the game either a (relative) breeze or very hard if you don't have them.I don't really know if it's a con or not, but it was frustrating.End of list.TL;DRThis is my GOTY.

												(Previous reviews below are still accurate)Steam Awards Nomination re-reviewRogue-like rhythm game, that should be enough to sell this for anyone interested, but the music is really good, too, and the gameplay doesn't get stale. Even has local co-op. 9/10 for real, not exaggeration.Post-EA review:The game is now out of early-access, and I've been playing the crap out of it all along.  Some sort of magical undefined aspect giving it massive replayability.  I'm not even using custom MP3s because the built in songs are great (and well-balanced).  I did buy the dance pad (optional) for like $350 and haven't even had a chance to use it yet, but the game is amazing enough on the keyboard :)  I haven't beaten zone 4 yet, but it's tons of fun trying and dying, I'll get it eventually!  Buy it, play it, get good at it, and enjoy the crap out of it.  Best game in a long time.  My Original Early Access review:First impression: I played this for like 5 hours in a row, it's so sweet!  Now I wanna buy a dance pad for $300Rhythm based combat and gameplay with roguelike aspects and plenty of gear upgrading!  This game is already spectacular, and it's not even finished.  BUY IT NOW!  The .ogg music files are just sitting in your Steam directory, so don't buy the soundtrack unless you're doing it to give the devs more money/support :)			"

												This game is great. It's a rythm based rogue-like with a fantastic soundtrack. Made by the guy who did the ost for SMB and TBoI. The concept of the game may sound stupid, but it's pretty good if you give it a try. It is in early access, so beware it's still in alpha stage. I can't really give this game a complete rating until it's finished, but I'm definitely enjoying it so far. Doesn't mean you'll like it, but who knows. If I were you, I'd wait a bit longer until the game is completely finished for the full experience. *after early access*They actually finished this game, which is great. This game is a hell of a lot better, too bad a ♥♥♥♥ing potato can tap to a beat better than me. Game shaped up great. I definitely recommend this game.			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is a competently executed Roguelike with a gimmick that you have to make all of your moves to the beat of some annoying techno music. This gimmick is cool for only a few minutes, then it gets annoying. Fortunately, there's a character you can unlock called ""The Bard"" who gets rid of that gimmick and lets you play it like a normal, non-musical roguelike, and that makes you realize that it is a solid, though unremarkable, roguelike experience underneath the gimmick. It's not life-changingly good, but it's not bad either.			"

												This game, just by hearing the type that it is, causes most people to doubt it or wrinkle their nose in confusion. You'd probably think that at first too, it's a dungeon crawler, a rhythm game, and a totally amazing rogue-like game. How does it work? We may never know, but one thing's for certain: a game of this difficulty that's this fun to play deserves more recognition. Like, a lot more. The soundtracks, all three of them, all provide something awesome to the game. I've only had it for a couple days now (yeah, I'm that guy who shows up three hours into the party and acts all cool about it) but that doesn't mean I don't know that this is a game far beyond amazing. Cheers to everyone at Brace Yourself Games, you've created a masterpiece of a game that lots of people will agree is easily one of the best rhythm games out there. I'd go on, but there are too many things that are awesome about this game that I'd probably end up breaking the character limit or something. Don't worry Rhythm Heaven, you've always got a special place in my heartBut seriously, get this game. It's more than worth the $15, no doubt about it.			"

												This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing and fun. Simple to grasp, incredibly hard to master. It condenses the many qualities of roguelikes into a fast paced dance to the death that works well with short bite sized play sessions, not that any of your sessions will actually be short because you're always want to do just *one* more run. It even has co-op so you can yell at your friend or sibling for having a terrible sense of rhythm.Also, I imagine this game is a BLAST with a dance pad.			"

								Addictive, catchy, hard. I feel a ""puzzle game"" vibe from some of the things you have to do in this game.The ability to quickly restart a run makes this game incredibly difficult to stop playing, and the sound blending between the Hot and Cold area themes in Zone 3 makes it so that particular music never gets old, even as I try for the 50th time to beat the flipping first stage...Due to the amount of enemies you have to rapidly and strategically dispose of at some points, I feel like mastering this game will take me quite some time. That's a good thing in this case, because it's all due to simple concepts blending together to make something challenging. You know where you went wrong and why you died, and if you didn't, the deathcam is very helpful in pointing that out.The majority of the upgrades could probably do with some sort of price increase. I had no issue unlocking pretty much all of them pretty quickly, before I had even a chance to use 80% of them, and stat keeping would be cool too, but these are just balance suggestions rather than complaints and they barely put a scratch on the rock solid game that is CotN.

												Ever wanted to play Dance Dance Revolution but with a bit of action and narrative added to the mix? Well Crypt of the Necrodancer is a good waltz in the right direction! Crypt of the Necrodancer is a rhythm, rogue-like dungeon crawler that has you moving and attacking to the beat of the tune.The gameplay as stated above generally has you doing everything to the beat of the tune by using only the arrow keys, whether your in the main lobby or fighting your way through the next level. You can even set the game up to be played with a dance pad! In the main lobby you're able to buy permanent upgrades to weapons, armor, spells and trinkets found in the levels,  practice against certain enemies, read background about the game and choose which zones you'll be ""dancing"" through along with a few other options. In the zones themselves the overall objective is to find the stairwell to the next level, however that doesn't necessarily mean you should be racing for the stairwell with all due haste. Diamonds, your currency for permanent upgrades, can only be found while exploring these levels, and once you are done with a zone you will only have those diamonds in your next trip to the lobby. Once you decide to go back into a zone you will lose all the diamonds you collected on the previous trip! So finding enough diamonds to buy those ever increasingly costing upgrades can be well worth the exploration. Remember how I said those permanent upgrades to items only affect what you find in the levels and are not given to the characters themselves? Those items can either be found throughout said levels or in the shop in each level. Enemies drop gold in order for you to purchase these items from the store, and if you keep up with the beat, a coin multiplier is added when you kill enemies so you get more gold for your kills. With that being said the levels are on a time limit, can you guess what that time limit is? The music! If the music you are playing to finishes before you get to the stairs you are immediately dropped to the next level. On top of this each level has a boss, and not only will you lose your multiplier combo if the song ends but rather than being dropped into a relatively safe room at the beginning of the next level you will have to face that levels boss immediately if the previous levels boss wasn't defeated. The games uses pixel art and uses it's musical theme in some of the enemy designs. For example the Minotaur enemy's  horns are actually a harp and the reaper has a microphone attached to his scythe. This leads to a very visually pleasing themed art style that looks and plays it's part.The music is electronic and catchy, even making you want to stay on a level just to keep listening. In lower levels of each zone the beat is actually slower so that players adjust to the beat as it get faster with each level.Crypt of the Necrodancer is a fun and enchanting game and is well worth your time and if you have a love for rhythm and rogue-like games alike, this original gem will not disappoint you.

												You ever been listening to music while walking down the street and subconsciously (or consciously, I don't judge) timed your steps to the beat of the music?Crypt of the Necrodancer is like that, except when you ♥♥♥♥ it up somebody stabs you and you lose your coin multiplier bonus. But that's okay, because there are about a dozen different weapons - not counting their materials modifiers, which multiplies that by six - that you can use to just stab them right back.Four zones, each with their own surprises and mechanics, enemies with varied movement patterns that make the game feel like chess on a really short timer, really ♥♥♥♥♥in' awesome music, and a shopkeeper who sings along to it! ON TOP OF THAT, there are a few reasons to try and replay the game, including more story and unlockable characters.  I mean, you know, if replaying it for the sake of playing it wasn't enough.Oh yeah, and if you get sick of the music (pfft) you can add your own music. Add some metal, give yourself a heart attack, it's great fun!Honestly, I'd recommend this game to anyone and everyone who would listen. It's that good. If you're on the fence, get it. If you like roguelikes, get it. If you like rhythm games, get it. If you like both roguelikes and rhythm games, for the love of god, GET IT.			"

You can even set the game up to be played with a dance pad! In the main lobby you're able to buy permanent upgrades to weapons, armor, spells and trinkets found in the levels,  practice against certain enemies, read background about the game and choose which zones you'll be ""dancing"" through along with a few other options. In the zones themselves the overall objective is to find the stairwell to the next level, however that doesn't necessarily mean you should be racing for the stairwell with all due haste. Diamonds, your currency for permanent upgrades, can only be found while exploring these levels, and once you are done with a zone you will only have those diamonds in your next trip to the lobby. Once you decide to go back into a zone you will lose all the diamonds you collected on the previous trip! So finding enough diamonds to buy those ever increasingly costing upgrades can be well worth the exploration. Remember how I said those permanent upgrades to items only affect what you find in the levels and are not given to the characters themselves? Those items can either be found throughout said levels or in the shop in each level. Enemies drop gold in order for you to purchase these items from the store, and if you keep up with the beat, a coin multiplier is added when you kill enemies so you get more gold for your kills. With that being said the levels are on a time limit, can you guess what that time limit is? The music! If the music you are playing to finishes before you get to the stairs you are immediately dropped to the next level. On top of this each level has a boss, and not only will you lose your multiplier combo if the song ends but rather than being dropped into a relatively safe room at the beginning of the next level you will have to face that levels boss immediately if the previous levels boss wasn't defeated. The games uses pixel art and uses it's musical theme in some of the enemy designs. For example the Minotaur enemy's  horns are actually a harp and the reaper has a microphone attached to his scythe. This leads to a very visually pleasing themed art style that looks and plays it's part.The music is electronic and catchy, even making you want to stay on a level just to keep listening. In lower levels of each zone the beat is actually slower so that players adjust to the beat as it get faster with each level.Crypt of the Necrodancer is a fun and enchanting game and is well worth your time and if you have a love for rhythm and rogue-like games alike, this original gem will not disappoint you.

												You ever been listening to music while walking down the street and subconsciously (or consciously, I don't judge) timed your steps to the beat of the music?Crypt of the Necrodancer is like that, except when you ♥♥♥♥ it up somebody stabs you and you lose your coin multiplier bonus. But that's okay, because there are about a dozen different weapons - not counting their materials modifiers, which multiplies that by six - that you can use to just stab them right back.Four zones, each with their own surprises and mechanics, enemies with varied movement patterns that make the game feel like chess on a really short timer, really ♥♥♥♥♥in' awesome music, and a shopkeeper who sings along to it! ON TOP OF THAT, there are a few reasons to try and replay the game, including more story and unlockable characters.  I mean, you know, if replaying it for the sake of playing it wasn't enough.Oh yeah, and if you get sick of the music (pfft) you can add your own music. Add some metal, give yourself a heart attack, it's great fun!Honestly, I'd recommend this game to anyone and everyone who would listen. It's that good. If you're on the fence, get it. If you like roguelikes, get it. If you like rhythm games, get it. If you like both roguelikes and rhythm games, for the love of god, GET IT.			"

												Crypt of the Necrodancer's a really inventive game. It takes two things that don't really go together--rhythm and dungeon crawling--and mixes them so beautifully. Playing a game like this to the rhythm of music makes it incredibly easy to get into a certain flow. Combat is smooth and challenging. The sound design and OST are phenomenal and really add to the overall atmosphere of the game. Having been keeping track of the game since early in its Early Access days, I was satisfied with the product back then and am even more so satisfied with it now. Crypt of the Necrodancer is truly worth all fifteen dollars you pay for it. I could not recommend this game more.			"

												I got this game a few months ago and it is really fun to play!The reason I keep coming back to this game are these reasons:   -Great soundtrack   -Decent story (after finishing the first character, Cadence)   -Great gameplay   -Isn't a game you will beat in a week or two   -5 different soundtracks   -Support for custom music   -Mod support (texture mods and music replacements)   -Level editor (You need to beat the game with one character first)That all may sound great, but this game is NOT for everyone!  This game requires a lot of patience and practice.  It's fairly straight forward to play, but extremely hard to master.  The game requires you to beat each zone (individually at least) without missing a beat of the song and perfect movements.  If you cannot keep tempo/rhythm, this will not be a game for you.  The game heavily relies on you to be able to keep up with fast tempos.  If you can't do that, this game may not be for you! This game, however could be good for you if you do want to practice keeping tempo.I would rate this game 9/10 for being ridiculously fun, but a bit infuriating when trying to beat the game with a harder character (like Aria or the monk)			"

												As an off-and-on fan of rogue-lite/like games, I am always torn determining the amount of skill and the amount of luck you will find in these games. Unseen probabilities within games are something I always am wary of complaining about when I could've had some really bad luck.However, Crypt of the NecroDancer is a game where I blamed myself more so when I made errors than blame the odds against me. This is the first rogue-LIKE where I could tell I was improving myself, and it's the first one in the genre where the demands on the player's skill were mandatory.Because with each failure through the familiarity of the controls and the coodrination of my fingers to the bass-line of the music I was reading the enemy telegraphed moves. Or adjusting myself to a new tempo-change. Or finding myself becoming at ease with the bizarre control-scheme. (Minus the DDR pad.)The Rogue-Like With A BeatThe novelty of this game is that it takes the game of Rogue and gives it a beat. Literally. The musical theme is not solely an aesthetic. The gameplay is interwoven into the music itself. From the way you move around/attack to the amount of time you have to explore the dungeons. Once the song ends, you are dropped to the next stage. (There are red-bars to show that the song is nearing its end.)Every movement/action you make is managed by moving in-time of the music. You and every enemy move according to that rule, which gives the game a charming tactical feel while sometimes relying on you thinking on the fly. Enemies attack in a specific manner which usually results in them having an ""off-beat"" to strike them. If you simply attack head-on with no regard, you'll die a lot.If that sounds too convulted about how the combat works, let me rephrase it like this: You are the metronome; the music is what you need to match (as the tempo can increase and decrease); and the enemies are the other instruments in play. The game plays more like reading a music sheet than another rogue-like game. The controls are the first major obstacle to get over, which you can play this game legitimately with either a controller or keyboard (or a DDR pad, which has an easier difficulty just for itself). To get the best experience, I would suggest you map your directional keys separate from your combo keys. There are too many moments towards Zone 2 and onwards that rely on twichy relfexes in-time with the music to coordinate your fingers in combinations.Thankfully, the game isn't too demanding on you maintaining a constant rhythm. If you're like me, I struggle to keep a rhythm going longer than a few seconds without going faster or slower than expected. The game is leniant on being perfect, but you cannot spam your movements. The game simply won't let you, and you won't be able to obtain the modifiers to your gold (and modified items) if you don't keep the beat.I was able to get past the first zone on my KB alone, but the second stage's music tripped me up when I had to make those split-second motions to drop a bomb or use an item. Switching out the combos to other keys fixed it for me, and I would strongly suggest that if you play the game with a controller you get the directional pad some love.Practice Makes PerfectionMany rogue-lites rely too much on probabilites of which you can and cannot control (FTL). Others rely on attention to details of your item and the levels to spot those small benefits to get you to the end (Binding of Isaac). Crypt of the NecroDancer is a part of the trend where they provide permanent progression across chunks of the game. (There is a story mode for purists who want to play a more traditional rogue-like experience. However, I chose the permanent item/stat increases as I am not the best at these type of games.)There are stat increases and new loot to give your next playthrough something to change it up as well as possibly improving your odds. None of which are mandatory--I wouldn't think of going without them--if you are good enough at the game to read your enemies' movements.Outside of the item/stat increases, you also have another means to improve your next game: Practice rooms.You have a training room for enemies and minibosses that unlocks with a certain amount of kills for every enemy, a boss pratice room (unlocked via currency you accumulate in every run, diamonds), and a weapon-training selection screen to practice in either room. These rooms are unlocked by finding trapped tradders within Zone 1 and 2 and unlocking them with the Golden Master Key.Having a story-mode option and a perma-progression system as choices is the best compromise as both the purists who prefer to learn the game on their own and everyone else has the means to finish the game. But it ain't so easy, nor free.The bosses cost in-game currency to unlock. And you can't simply practice on all the enemies from the get-go--you have to kill each enemy type several times to unlock them. Simply, you can't cheat yourself out of a challenge without investing first.(And if you don't like some items, you can discard them for diamonds with the Janitor).It Ain't No StepmaniaPerhaps the game's own lacking feature is the infamous difficulty of its genre. The game doesn't feel that hard.Make no mistake; the game is difficult for all the right reasons, and you will die a lot. But there are plenty of items to circumnavigate the game's difficulty, and some enemies that make me wonder how fair the game truly is.For example, blood items let you regain your health, slowly, with enough kills chained together. There are also magic spells that might stun enemies, blast horrizontally, or give you some buffs to become overpowered in some situations. I would chalk these up to limitations of making a novel game without all its polish.Some enemies also break the rules. There are some enemies that move in diagonal movements, which you are never allowed to do. The red-dragons also seem unfair without a ""ranged"" weapon (weapons that extend beyond one-tile, such as long-swords or broad-swords) to get around taking damage.Zone 2 seems to have a sharp difficulty spike because you start off with nothing (even if you finish Zone 1). So expect that you may still have some bad runs when you begin new zones.The only feature of this game I hadn't tried is adding your music into the game. This game's music was tailored for the game, and I am sure slow songs will break it while Megalovania will result in a very bad time.Shake Your Groove ThangThis is one of few rogue-likes I'll always come back to because it's a fun experience. It's not a brutal old-schooling, nor is it coddling to the new players. The game's sense of challenge makes an otherwirse creative deviation into a worthwhile game of its own.And how can you not have fun dancing on a plastic pad like an idiot?(Kudos to the devs who put this through Early Access and finished the game. As well as for adding new content to the game itself with no DLCs. If they have another product through Early Access, be sure to give them a second glance.)			"

												I've been addicted to this game since I started playing it. I am not a big fan of rogue-likes in general, but this game is among few rare exceptions.You have 4 zones to beat, each one contains 3 floors and a boss fight. Every zone has its own theme and enemies. But wait, there's more. The enemies each move to the beat in their own unique pattern, and you have to recognize it and adapt quickly. For example, some enemies might be moving along a scripted path, others try to go for you specifically, some might stay still for 2 beats and then move on the 3rd one, others might move on every beat, and so on. It's all very well done.During your dungeon crawling, you'll also come across a lot of items of varying degrees of helpfulness. You have healing items, weapons, armour, rings, spells, and even some unusual items. Some can spawn from the start, others require unlocking via collectible diamonds. You can even remove the less useful items from the dungeons via the janitor, so that there's more chances instead for chests to contain the items you find more useful.There is of course a fair bit of luck involved, as is pretty common with rogue-like games. At times you'll be lucky to find a nice weapon and other useful items early on, other times you'll just be spawning with enemies all around you. It is a very challenging game. You will die a lot. But you do learn to recognize the enemy movement patterns and eventually overcome them.I also really like the whole light-hearted theme the game is going for. I think the devs pulled it off perfectly. The music is also amazing and will just drag you in to the beat.In addition to the regular mode with the main character, you also get to unlock several other characters, which seem to have their own unique abilities (for example one of them can only confuse enemies but not kill, another is only able to use bombs, and so on). It all adds an extra challenge for those who want it. You can even go and practice fighting against specific enemies and bosses if you wish.Great game in general. Highly recommended.			"

								I might not have played this game that much, but I am absolutely in love with it. This game provides a fun and challenging experience for all players to enjoy. From the combat and movement system, to the wonderful and energetic music, this game is amazing, while not perfect, as it is in early alpha, it still keeps me entertained. Every enemy has a pattern to it, which means you need to memorize it to do good, there is no RNG nonsense. In the game you move and attack to a beat. Once you break the beat, or you lose your coin multiplier (for cadence at least, not sure about the other characters) which can make the game a lot harder on you. If you can keep a beat this game is for you. All in all I give it a 9/10 at the moment, rating subject to change as more updates come out.			"

That being said (I know it is still in development) but I feel as though the dungeons might need a LITTLE bit of tweaking. After 4 hours of playtime I STILL cant get even past the first level of the second dungeon. It could be because I am a pastey white-boy with no sense of rhythm... Anyway, that doesnt stop me from taking another crack at it every couple days. I'm looking forward to seeing this game evolve as it gets closer and closer to its final release.			"

												TL;DR Buy it. Buy it now.This is a pretty amazing game. It is by far the most addicting roguelike I have ever played. It combines typical roguelike gameplay with an amazing soundtrack creating an experience like nothing else out there right now. Most importantly, every death can be prevented. You don't have to take a heart of damage if you're careful. This game is wildly skill based and highly addicting. It can also be played in short play sessions, which is good for the casual gamer or college student.			"

												I held off through early access and almost passed up this game because it was still over $10 upon release, but I'm telling you know, it's totally worth it.  It's a pretty standard roguelike (the exception is the heavy emphasis on digging through walls).  However, because you have to move on the beat of the music or else you lose your gold multiplier, it really adds a whole new level of difficulty to an already difficult genre.I'm almost considering getting a dance pad just to try this game out with it.  Just a fantastic game.			"

												Excelent work! The Rhythm part isn't so precise as in Rhythm tengoku or similar games, but it does arise the need of thinking quickly, which makes it far better. With a total of 10 characters to play as, the game has a natural learning curve, which gets of the charts at the end!The Music is excelent,Danny Baranowsky's music is groovy, so are the additional soundtracks from A_Rival and FamilyJules7x.The Controls are as simple as it gets, meaning the dance-pad way of playing is not far fetched.It's a game one might play only 30 minutes of, or try 5 hours to get through hit freeEither way, I heartly recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of rogue-like or disco-esque music.

								Me and my cousin had a little inside joke between us. When we played Heroes 3 of Might and Magic back then, we called the Necromancers, Necrodancers or Negrodancers. Yeah it's a stupid little joke but heck, it gives us plenty of laughs back then.When this game popped up in Steam, my cousin messaged me "".. Have you seen the new game title in Steam?""Ha!So anyways, the game itself is fun but only in short bursts. Being able to use your own musics is awesome, but as of now at least in my opinion, most of the musics I use doesn't match with the in-game beat well/precisely. Could just be because its still in Early Access. More items is being released too but as of now, IMO its just an ok game.[WORTH TRYING OUT]			"

								As a rogue-like fan, I must admit that this game is really good despite being an early access game because you can't solely rely on your luck but you also really need to have the skills to complete a level.Pro(s): - Good gameplay by combining rhythm with dungeon crawler- Good design with cute pixel art graphics- High replayability because you can play with different modes and use different characters- An awesome soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky (I really enjoyed the music)- And a little bit tricky (like destroying walls with bomb to get a lot of money :P)Con(s):- The content is still not that much right now because it's still an early access but the workshop content from the community can fill the gap- The shortcut/hotkey for the items and spells is hard to be pressed using keyboard maybe it's different when using gamepad or dance pad since I don't have both- The enemies have fixed pattern and that makes the enemies predictable maybe the enemies need to have combination of patterns to make it unpredictableI highly recommend this game because it's challenging and fun and it has awesome soundtrack, you really need to buy the soundtrack as well			"

												Rhythm-based roguelike that has you move to the beat to kill and avoid monsters. Deceptively hard and good music. I was going to beat it to completion, but then Overwatch and The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine expansion came out. So take this recommendation for what it's worth: deserving of your time if you don't have the money or a good enough computer for other, better games. That's a back-handed compliment, but I'm not really a huge roguelike fan. That I played this long enough that I could no longer refund it is compliment enough.

If you are the person who does not get easily convinced with positive reviews, better check this out, will keep it short.Crypt of the NecroDancer has an interesting concept and is quite unique among all the other rouge-like games. I agree with most of the positive reviews. Yet, this game lacks something essential which should keep your spark alive. To a certain extent it was okay, but then it feels like a mobile game you start with excitement and delete after a short while. If you like repetitive games (should also mention it has an unusual difficulty curve) you might give it a try. But I do not recommend it for the long term.			"

												""Hello sir, may I buy this new music game on steam with some of money I earn by working for you?""""No, you dirty underling, drop your pants and take a deep breath, because I'm cutting your wage in half for asking this!""This is most likely the conversation you had with your super rich boss that forces you to work 18 hours a day at minimum wage when you asked him if you could get the new book by the famous canadian political author, Brace Yourself Games. You might think that this just happened because your boss is an♥♥♥♥♥and while that part is also true, it's not the only truth behind it.In fact, he is afraid and he has to be afraid, because Crypt of the FreedomDancer is a lot more than just some indie book around music, it's actually a political concept that might open your eyes behind what you do and it might end up with you standing up, defending your democratic rights and take back what the sinister communist boss of yours took away from you a long time ago.Crypt of the LibertyDancer, or FREEDOM in short, is a political RTS shooting firefighter simulation in which you take the role of a supressed American worker that is enslaved by the liberal agenda of communists like Obama and Clinton. You have to dance in the rhythm that they dictate without congress approval and while doing that, you are trying to dismantle the system of injustice and slavery that they built up.Level by level you accomplish that by destroying their supression machine in form of evil monsters, skeletons and spiders that come down from your wall. You kill every brainwashed liberal boss in the end of each world and end up in the hort of evil itself, the bureau of Hillary Clinton him very self.Of course, he is entirely invulnerable until you take a guitar named Donald Trump to hit him, then he becomes vulnerable and you can kill him. Once you accomplished that, America is once again free of a dictated rhythm and you can proceed in your life in peace, wealth and prosperity.The symbolism here is clearly political and obvious. You are the great hero that is to dismantle the sinister machine of doom the liberals created, however you have to follow the rules they dictated in order to prevail.How is that fair you ask? Well, it isn't. That's what liberals are about. Being unfair and evil.In order to fully grasp the vastness that this game covers politically, we should take a look into the founding of Israel after World War II in 1473. The United States of America that just created the greatest and most freedom-loving army in world history and in order to re-establish fairness and peace over the world, it was time to create a new country named Is-Real. People immediately loved it and started moving there, creating houses and cities, lived in freedom and prosperity until the dark day Bill Clinton, son of widely known Satan Clinton, came to destroy the homes of those who seeked shelter and freedom in the new country. They started a sinister war and tried to took over the United States by disabling the constitution that our great founding fathers wrote millenia ago shortly after the Roman Empire fell in 1773. That is by the way the reason we still celebrate the day of founding in July 4th with fireworks and turkey.These historic facts are all covered in this game. Illustrated cleverly by allowing the player to choose between various characters you can go back in time and revisit those events and understand why we as free and hard working Americans have the duty to fight the liberal agenda and ensure that our consitution, especially with amendments like the first and second that build the very foundation of liberty in our great world, remain intact, even against backstabbing attacks from liberals.If you think that 9/11 was bad and that we have to stand up and fight the infowar against the groups that try to dismantle our great liberty, you should go forth, play this game, get inspired and go out on the street and fight the liberals. It is on you to defend our constitution and make the world great again.God bless America.			"

								This is one of those games that has a very clear understanding of what makes it special and commits to it hard. As a result, the game is an absolute joy to play and once you get the hang of it, you feel like a beast. Using your own songs seems to work really well (I've only tried three songs so far, but they all were great). The default music is thankfully really enjoyable, with the shopkeepers sort of ""singing"" the tunes when you're near. While the game is in early access, it feels pretty complete to me at this point, though I should point out that I only played it for about 2 hours and got as far the 5ish level, what I'm trying to say is, if you buy it now, you won't get a bug filled mess with no content. The game is great, and I expect more great things from devs in future.			"

Early Access Review
								I have a soft spot for a well executed genre mashup, and Crypt of the NecroDancer hits the bullseye of that sweet spot. It's a smart, slick roguelike where a run takes little more than 10 minutes to play, but is engaging from the start. The inclusion of a rhythm-action mechanic, where you're rewarded for moving on the beat of the music is both novel and fun. It adds a sense of urgency (and sometimes panic), while also opening up a risk/reward mechanic of when it's smart to *not* move, lose your multiplier, but gain a tactical advantage in your approach to a given enemy. The enemy and powerup design is varied and interesting, allowing each run to play out very differently. There's  a very strong feeling of ongoing progressive mastery that happens, as you figure out the right way to defeat new monster types and the best way to utilize the items you pick up. Of particular note is that you can brush the dust off your old DDR dance pad, and use that to play the game. Any game that allows you use old ludicrous peripherals scores bonus points in my book. Now, who wants to play a couple of rounds of Streetfighter with a Dreamcast fishing rod controller? FIGHT!Note - while it's still notionally in Early Access at the time that this review is written, it very much feels like a finished game with free content coming down the pike.			"

								I kept putting off buying this game. I saw the great reviews, watched videos, and liked what I saw. Yet I still didn't buy it. Then it was 33% off so I went for it. Why on Earth had I waited. It is absolutely fantastic, and deserves all of the great reviews that it has.Binding of Isaac was always my go to game when I just wanted a quick play, but now that I have this, I happily switch between them.I highly recommend it.

												This game is so very awesome. Words can't even describe the amount of happiness this little title has given me. I think what I love the most is you can play this game one handed as you sit back and relax in your comfy reclining chair. It's definitely a challenging title, but not in a way that makes you think the game is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but rather usually a death is the result of a screw up from you, the player. It makes you question your own stupidity or lack of attention that sets you in a rage against yourself, rather than against the game.The music is perfect. Zone 2 is my least favorite of the bunch, but there's so many classic tracks during the gameplay - Tracks like King Conga and 3-2 or even 4-3 are just utter perfection. Danny B deserves more acclaim from this work than he's already received. A rhythm game needs good catchy music, and Necrodancer has that in spades.The daily challenges offer a chance to separate the good players from the players like me. It's a nice touch, offering every player the game challenge, so you and some friends can compete against each other. There's a nice variety of items and shrines you can use to build your necrodancer with. A rougelike with a twist! I wouldn't recommend this game if you're deaf... or blind. I mean, that should be a given. But if you have one good hand and you like bouncing to the beat of some catchy music, you should purchase this title. And then buy yourself a t-shirt and continue gushing about your praise over this game to your girlfriend unitl she asks you to leave her alone. I mean, that's what I did. It worked out for me.			"

												TL;DR: This game is good if you like games that are both challenging and fun. It also has good music.I will start out by saying that this game is one of my favorites. It is very fun, if you can handle the challenge.It's a quite odd game, if you think about it. A rhythm based roguelike? You probably haven't played anything like it.As I have said a few times already, it is very challenging. The game will likely smash you into a pulp a few times until you learn how to beat the enemies. Which, shouldn't actually take long, as they all have patterns that you can memorize, as well as animations that will give you a heads up when they are about to attack.Though, if you are still struggling, they have a special room where they will show you... Well, more like force you to learn, how to beat some of the tougher enemies.It also has tons of different items, randomly generated levels, (Or you can put in a seed, if you prefer.) and many different characters, each with different mechanics, so you will probably never get bored.""So, you said that it's a rhythm based roguelike. Is the music any good?"" You bet. It is really good.The default music is composed by Danny Baranowsky, who has made music for several other great games, including the Binding of Isaac, and Super Meat Boy, but there are also several remixes/remasters made by other artists, or if you really want, you can use any music you want!It is also VERY compatible with dance pads. XDIt also has a story, which is mainly told through cutscenes, which are few and far apart, but they do tell a pretty interesting story.So, overall, I definitely recommend this game. It is awesome, and very fun. It is a must have for your gaming arsenal.100/10			"

												WOW. This game is a lot more difficult than I expected. Watching videos and things, it seems like it would be simple once you memorize all the attack patterns and things, but with so many enemies doing different things all at once, it's so easy to make a mistake. The great thing about this game is that you totally get each success and failure. As in when you clear a room without taking damage you're like ""yeah, totally nailed it"", but when you walk right into enemies you immediately know what you did wrong, and the game never feels unfair for it. Also IT'S A RHYTHM BASED ROUGELIKE HOLY CRAP WHY DON'T YOU OWN THIS YET?!?!?!?!			"

												I like this game a lot. At first it was pretty tricky to get used to. I'm still pretty bad at it lol. You bounce around to the beat, move with it. Gotta play smart and sometimes pretty quick. It can be easy to get frustrated but just know you don't start this game good at it. You'll get better as you play. I myself am a musician and still find myself having some trouble following the beat sometimes. I have an RGB keyboard and got a lighting setup specifically for this game, my setup turns into a dance floor for my fingers. Overall, just a really awesome game. Look forward to playing more of it. It has local co-op too. Always a plus. The soundtrack is really good.			"

												With a lack of rhythm games in general, Crypt of the NecroDancer (or CotN) delivers with Grand Results. The controls only use the Arrow Keys, but it uses this limitation to its advanatge since some item can only be activated via 2 button press and forces you to not mess up, or it i'll cost you a heart or 2. Yes, it IS a simple rouge-like, but the game requires you to plan ahead, know the patterns of enemies, know what items do what, Etc. There are upgrades to the game, but it still requries the skill you had without said upgrade. the Co-Op mode feels weird with player 2 using WASD, but It still manages to work. The Game also offers different characters with differnet play styles, an online leaderboard via Daily Challenge, and Mod Support (lets hope we dont have to pay for these any time soon) The game gets VERY challenging after world 3, granted there are only 4 Worlds, and after beating the random boss at the end, you get a little cut-scene talking about the story of the game. Overall, this game can be enjoyed by most, if not all fans of Rouge-likes and Rhythm games, I give Crypt of the Necrodancer:9.8/10BUY IT, AND ENJOY IT (the 0.2 that isnt included is just some personal issuses)			"

												Awesome soundtrack, challenging levels, great design, no bugs so far. Roguelike game which has an added gameplay element attached to it: you have to move, attack and destroy with the rythm of the music. And not only that, every foe you may encounter, every trap, every dungeon level has its own rythm as well. The learning process is fairly simple: trial and error, till you get to know how to act to counter that rythm. It's so much fun, and challenges the player in a way many would enjoy, that you could even compare to Dark Souls. The feeling of accomplishment when you finish a level, is indescribable. 100% recomend it, and at this price (currently on sale at less than 4€) you don't have to think twice.			"

 Crypt of the NecroDancer Oh boy where do I begin?The gameplay is so Unique and Intelligent which is why it's one of my favorite games on Steam! EVER!It's a Rouge-like game that combines Rhythm and Dungeon Crawling, 2 completely different genres! And it works perfectly! How crazy is that!?You play with the rhythm and make a move at every beat, whether it's walking, attacking, using items, mining (technically it's shoveling 'cause you use a shovel but there is a pickaxe), etc.As easy as this may sound, it is a really and I mean a   really   difficult game, every enemy feels unique because they all have a unique pattern to memorize, and the only way to beat it is to learn them and be able to predict when they move and where.Still not convincied it's hard? Well try playing as one of the harder character such as  Aria , ON A DANCEPAD (this is an official thing by the way, check their site for details)The graphics are really neat too! It's really captures the ""I'm underground"" feeling really well, the sprites are so full of life, er well, they're kind of dead but they're still full of life, there are also Steam Workshop mods out there to change the sprites and sound effects to everything.The music, oh God, Is it beautiful? Yes. Is it addicting? Yes. Is Freddie Merchantry the best thing ever? Absolutly. I can't get enough of the soundtrack, ESPECIALLY Freddie Merchantary's voice, but if you want to, you can change the music to whatever you have on your computer, but then you won't hear the game's awesome soundtrack or Freddie Merchantary's voice, so are you sure you want to do that? Also the voice acting is top tier just wanna point that out, Fantastic work.Now if you look at the price tag and thought this was expensive well think again, because this game is going to stick with you for a long time, I usually move on from one game to another, but this is one of those games where I can't let go of because of how amazing it is.I don't hear much people talk about this but there is a level editor if that's your thing, I'm not particularly good at making levels but I sure as heck can try.In short, It's basically one of the most unique games I've played, sure you can say you played some unique games but I never saw anything quite like this, and while writing this review I couldn't really fully express how I feel about this game, it's so good that if it were a food, it's my favorite food that I can't get enough of. My brain created tactics automatically and is one of the only games where I get 100% focused on, despite playing for (as of this review) 30 hours I can still screw up really badly. I'm currently having difficultly playing as  Aria  in Zone 3, and I love it.I have high respect to everyone who worked on this game, it's a huge inspiration to game developers, musicians, and heck even the fans like myself, because I consider Crypt of the NecroDancer as one of the most innovative games of this generation and I'm sure many others do, so a big thank you to everyone who was involved with the creation of this game.Also I just wanna point out that this game was inspired from another Rouge-like game called Spelunky, which is also another game that I love. I think I'm gonna buy a Dancepad just for this game  "

								So addictive. A lot of the enemies move in ways similar to chess moves. The protagonists' attacking style (i.e., the whip weapon, follows the formation of a knight in chess). So it is somewhat helpful if you have played some chess. Then, interestingly enough there is a chess boss level. Blood weapons are the best, as it recovers your life/hearts. My personal favourite is the blood whip or the blood raper. XDThe music is unbelievable and makes me want to dance.			"

												WOW. This game is a lot more difficult than I expected. Watching videos and things, it seems like it would be simple once you memorize all the attack patterns and things, but with so many enemies doing different things all at once, it's so easy to make a mistake. The great thing about this game is that you totally get each success and failure. As in when you clear a room without taking damage you're like ""yeah, totally nailed it"", but when you walk right into enemies you immediately know what you did wrong, and the game never feels unfair for it. Also IT'S A RHYTHM BASED ROUGELIKE HOLY CRAP WHY DON'T YOU OWN THIS YET?!?!?!?!			"

								This is one of those games that has a very clear understanding of what makes it special and commits to it hard. As a result, the game is an absolute joy to play and once you get the hang of it, you feel like a beast. Using your own songs seems to work really well (I've only tried three songs so far, but they all were great). The default music is thankfully really enjoyable, with the shopkeepers sort of ""singing"" the tunes when you're near. While the game is in early access, it feels pretty complete to me at this point, though I should point out that I only played it for about 2 hours and got as far the 5ish level, what I'm trying to say is, if you buy it now, you won't get a bug filled mess with no content. The game is great, and I expect more great things from devs in future.			"

												TL;DR: This game is good if you like games that are both challenging and fun. It also has good music.I will start out by saying that this game is one of my favorites. It is very fun, if you can handle the challenge.It's a quite odd game, if you think about it. A rhythm based roguelike? You probably haven't played anything like it.As I have said a few times already, it is very challenging. The game will likely smash you into a pulp a few times until you learn how to beat the enemies. Which, shouldn't actually take long, as they all have patterns that you can memorize, as well as animations that will give you a heads up when they are about to attack.Though, if you are still struggling, they have a special room where they will show you... Well, more like force you to learn, how to beat some of the tougher enemies.It also has tons of different items, randomly generated levels, (Or you can put in a seed, if you prefer.) and many different characters, each with different mechanics, so you will probably never get bored.""So, you said that it's a rhythm based roguelike. Is the music any good?"" You bet. It is really good.The default music is composed by Danny Baranowsky, who has made music for several other great games, including the Binding of Isaac, and Super Meat Boy, but there are also several remixes/remasters made by other artists, or if you really want, you can use any music you want!It is also VERY compatible with dance pads. XDIt also has a story, which is mainly told through cutscenes, which are few and far apart, but they do tell a pretty interesting story.So, overall, I definitely recommend this game. It is awesome, and very fun. It is a must have for your gaming arsenal.100/10			"

Gotta play smart and sometimes pretty quick. It can be easy to get frustrated but just know you don't start this game good at it. You'll get better as you play. I myself am a musician and still find myself having some trouble following the beat sometimes. I have an RGB keyboard and got a lighting setup specifically for this game, my setup turns into a dance floor for my fingers. Overall, just a really awesome game. Look forward to playing more of it.

												Crypt of the Necrodancer is a special mixture of the rogue light genre and the rhythm game genre. It forces you to fight your enemies to the beat, making the player resort to their rhythmic intelligence and their reflexes. Without a quick mind and sharp instincts, you'll die. A lot. Most of the deaths are the player's fault. Whether it was being surrounded by enemies, or forgetting an enemy's pattern.To quote Cadence from the game.""Every enemy has a predictable pattern. Learn that and you won't suffer as much as a scratch.""This game relies on skill, as you can take any amount of luck in your procedurally generated dungeon and win with enough skill. You learn from your deaths, failures, and misplays. I retrieved my heart from the Necrodancer. Can you?			"

												Very enjoyable, and also at later stages very difficult. It is what it looks like: a rhythm-based almost-roguelike game - an unusual combination of genres which works surprisingly well. The game does not have a vast number of areas, but the  levels are procedurally generated so it is not too predictable and the challenge is great enough that the game will not be over too fast. There are also various unlockable characters with different playstyles and varying levels of difficulty, which helps to extend the life of the game. The soundtrack is good, which is crucial for this type of game, although it is occasionally difficult to pick out the beat which the game expects you to move to. The only major complaint I would have is the aforementioned limited level variety which does become frustrating when replaying the same sorts of levels over and over with any one of the several ludicrously difficult-to-play characters in the game. Overall, however, the game is still well worth buying if fast-paced 2D games hold any appeal for you at all.			"

												Crypt is a game I admittedly bought pretty much exclusively for Danny B's soundtrack. The music in this game is fantastic. So much so that I bought the game for PS4 as well. But the gameplay is extremely difficult. It's randomly generated, but extremely based on enemy patterns. There's very little room for error, and each run can end in the blink of an eye. It's a game I really want to get better at, if only because it's so unique. If you put a bit of practice into learning each of the enemy's patterns, it is incredibly rewarding to beat each floor, especially for the first time. It's certainly not a game for everyone, but it's a game that you will enjoy if you spend a bit of time learning how to play it. And even if you suck, you can still enjoy Danny B's beautiful soundtrack.			"

								A harmonious fusion of what should be a pair of the most dissonant genres imaginable. It's a strong roguelike with the spine of a rhythm game, and it pulls it off spectacularly. It is a testament to the game's strengths that it's even a blast while playing as the bard, a character that completely ignores the rhythm component of the game.The rhythm component is much stronger than simply moving to the beat, as the various enemy tells end up with you effectively creating dances around them. And of course, the soundtrack is nothing short of fantastic.The fact that this game is still in early access is extremely exciting, as in it's current state, it's already a beautiful mashup.

												Party Hard to Die Hard! Death has some wicked beats!This game is by far the single most frustatingly addicting game I have found and played with great gusto. I the one thing that keeps me coming back to this abusive realtionship with the game is its sick beat. I love how it requires you to do such things as dance and determine rhythm and even though I was in band and marching band much of my life it showed me how good my internal rhythm is. Its god aweful. This game is wonderful and unique and I am glad I made the choice to finally buy this game. Now with that said the game is hard but, that is the fun. The further you get the more excited you become and your progress means something for once. So instead of playing the respawn game at the start of you where ever you died you have to continue from the begining and earn your way back. For some one who wants great music and a fun little rouge-like RPG styled game this is a great choice and honestly well worth it. Planning on buying the soundtrack when I have the cash.			"

												Ahh, Necrodancer, a wonderful mix of fun and utter frustration!This game has one hell of an interesting concept - Roguelikes are a ton of fun, if a little frustrating, and rhythm games which I love playing overall because the selection of music is great. This one has 3 artists, all of which are great, and flow with the story and game perfectly.The selection and designs of the characters are also incredible, you got Cadence, who's the good ol' main character, Melody, who is a ton of fun to wreck with her Golden Lute, Aria who is essentially the Lost and ♥♥♥♥in' frustrating, and many more characters. (My favourite is Dove because she's ♥♥♥♥ING ADORABLE). While these characters are great, I'd love to see remixes for each character rather than just Melody and Aria, that'd make it much more fun to do other characters.The gameplay is also great, where each movement and action you make must be to the beat of the music and the enemy designs are great too, as they all have patterns to the beat. This is even more fun as you can put your own songs in, and most of the time the music and beats sync perfectly!This really is a great game, and the world needs more games like these :D			"

												crypt of the necrodancer is the best rouge like game i have ever played! its so addicting, the way the music makes the game so intense you will find yourself playing over and over. i like using custom music but, the shopkeepers singing is un-beatable. this game is well worth 15$ i would pay 20$ for it!

												I really liked the music in the game. I liked it so much I just had to keep on playing and push myself to overcome all the obstacles in sync with the music. I had to switch between both hands to be able to keep on playing until they were both so tired and cramped that I had to stop. I cannot recommend it enough, it is a wonderful rhythm game.			"

You are controlling Cadence, a young women who in search of her missing father, has entered the crypt of the necrodancer which is populated by dancing ghosts and monsters, which you have to beat in order to beat the level while following the beats of sick 16-bit beats.  If you do beat a monster AND move accordingly to the beats, you get a gold multiplier, which multiplies the gold you get from fallen monsters WHICH you can spend at shops inside the dungeon WHICH got a shopkeep who sings with the voice of Luciano Pavarotti.

												I purchased this game when it was initially in Early Access and actually only played half an hour or so of the game during that phase. The lack of play time wasn't due to it being glitchy or anything, rather I had a few other games on my plate and didn't think there was much depth to Crypt of the NecroDancer. Yeah, the rhythm-based movement was cool, but what else was there?TIME SKIP. The game leaves early access and I suddenly decide that it's worth picking up and playing for a bit after getting a little burned out on The Witcher 3. Returning to it, I hadn't recognized how much depth there truly is in Crypt of the NecroDancer. You have to really plan each of your runs carefully: are you going to try to collect as many diamonds as possible? Are you trying to get to the exit as quickly as you can? It reminded me so much of how my girlfriend and I played through Rogue Legacy, where we had to determine if we intended on collecting as much gold as possible or if we should try to get to the boss rooms as quickly as possible.No doubt the games soundtrack is really catchy and fun to listen to as well, as it should be. What I appreciate is that you're not really hindered significantly if you fail to keep in time with the music, outside of losing a coin multiplier.I can't recommend Crypt of the NecroDancer enough. I have only a few hours logged in currently, partially due to the fact that the game is perfect for just picking up and playing for a few minutes at a time.			"

												CAUTION: This game is extremely addictive.This is a rogue-like RPG that merges all of your actions, such as moving and combat, with staying in tempo to whatever song is playing, as well as letting you permanently purchase upgrades and item spawns in a hub area for each randomly generated dungeon venture.  Each zone has a few areas which end with a boss fight, and you are able to return to completed zones to grind for gold and diamonds (diamonds are used to purchase upgrades at the hub while gold is used at shops within the dungeons to buy gear, spells, and health).I really like that you can start with a different character who changes the gameplay from rhythm to turn-based so that you can learn the mechanics of the game before adding in the need to stay with the beat.  The ability to use custom songs is an awesome touch, adding even more so to the already excellent replay value.9.75/10			"

								Best thing I ever spent money on. The replayability is awesome, the beats are sick, the execution is logical. It doesn't cheat you like some rogue-like games do, this is pretty much about how well you control yourself and your mind.The idea itself is golden. I've been a fan of games that incorporate and link as much as possible the soundtrack to the gameplay, like Beat Hazard and o2Jam, but a roguelike music-based game? Well I'd be damned if I didn't pay and play this with my own blood, sweat and tears.The soundtrack is extremely addicting, making you subconsciously hum them while doing other unrelated things like your laundry and taking the bus to work. Add that to the wicked idea that your every decision is based on the song and its beat, this makes for a very challenging feat indeed.The only problem I can see is that the mobs are generally hard to get by. It gets really hard at later stages, when hordes of monsters just swarm with you with many different movement patterns. If you can memorize patterns well, then this will be a piece of cake.Overall, 9.5/10. Highly recommended for sick tunes and sexy shopkeeper.			"

												There have been many music-based games in recent years. I remember buying Audiosurf in 2008 and thought that it was so unique getting a game that plays on highway-like track according to the song you play. Many rhythm-based games have been distributed over the years and Crypt of the Necrodancer is one of them. This game is different because it looks like it is set in a randomly generated dungeon with a roguelike character strictly moving to the beat of the music.You start the game as Cadence, a female character you control to collect gear, coins, and spells while a variety of monsters try to stop you. It has a very steep learning curve and it takes a while to get used to moving correctly to the beat despite the fact that the monsters have very predictable moves as they try to reach and attack you. If you move to the beat correctly, you will build up a coin multiplier while the maze turns into a disco like settings since it looks like a brightened dance floor. If you miss a beat, the coin multiplier will be lost and you will have to build it back up again. Each zone is divided into a few levels and the final level will be a boss level. Defeat the boss at the end of the zone and you will unlock a new character. There are many characters to unlock and each has such different moves that if feels like you have to unlearn the moves you used with the previous character. There is a character named Eli who can drop an infinite number of bombs and kick them to defeat nearby enemies. This means that you will have to get accustomed to the different attacks that Eli features that Cadence does not feature. Cadence moves to the beat and kills with conventional weapons like swords and whips. Another character, Bard, doesn’t have to move according to the beat whereas another character like Dove cannot kill enemies, but can exit the levels without facing mini-bosses.Besides the diverse characters in terms of number and abilities, the levels include a challenge in which you can rescue NPCs trapped in a cage that require exploration to find the proper key to liberate them. These NPCs will then become available in the lobby so that they can sell gear, spells, and other goodies that will be useful in each zone and its associated levels.The number of diverse characters, the complexity of the movements can provide plenty of replay value. Also, you can play your own mp3s to see how challenging each level in a zone can be. When playing a song from the game’s soundtrack, it is funny to see the shopkeeper sing along to the music. The music that comes with the game is varied and entertaining. The game includes daily challenges and workshop mods to add up to infinite replay value.I think Crypt of the Necrodancer is a game that was well thought out by the developers, combining coolness, diversity, and difficulty. I think people can enjoy the challenges and the diversity of the characters and dungeons/mazes that this game offers. It is unique to combine the traditional roguelike characteristics of the game with rhythm. Just be prepared to put a lot of practice into the game that requires fast thinking since one mistake can easily force you to start over. Beating a level will always feel very rewarding due to the need for precise hand-eye coordination.My Score: 8/10 "

								This game is a real joy to play, largely owing to the awesome soundtrack. It was written by the same guy who did the music for Super Meat Boy and Binding of Isaac. He has the best style, it's like Techno Nintendo Metal from the future. Don't let the whole 'rogue-like' thing scare you, this game is lots of fun and when you die it just feels like 'meh'. Worth playing for the sheer uniqueness of it imo. I even convinced my non-gamer roommate to play co-op with me today.			"

												You *need* this game. Seriously.EDITNow that the final release is out I'm updating my review. Crypt of the Necrodancer is one of those games you really just have to play to understand the hype, and yes this is one of those rare cases where the hype is 100% justified. The game just hits every note perfectly (haha). The gameplay is increadible. Even though the look is familiar, the mechanics are like nothing else out there (which is quite a feat in todays gaming age) but still seems to satisfy on some primal level. It's kind of like speed chess if it were fun. Each enemy moves in a unique pattern and each item effects the behavor of your character. Every move could either result in success or death, but you only have a split second to decide what to do. It really puts you on the edge of your seat especially when playing ""all zones"" mode. Then there's the music. It's amazing. In fact it's so amazing I bought the soundtrack version and uploaded the songs to listen to on my iPod. Of course thats the kind of music we've all come to expect from Danny Baranowsky of Binding of Isaac fame. The great thing about the music is that it makes you dance. Not in the game, but in real life. I can't play this game without dancing around with a big grin on my face like a complete idiot. My fiance thinks its hilarious, whom by the way, can't stand video games yet still found this game to be entertaining. On top of all that the execution is really what brings it all together. The way the shopkeeper sings to the music, how the music in the fire/ice stage transitions from metal to classical music seamlessly, the quirky sprite animations, and the light up disco tiles, it really brings a smile to your face. Its games like these that remind me why I game in the first place. I'm really quite pleased that amidst all the Call of Duty garbage you can still find little gems like this one.I really can't recomend this game enough! :DCan't stop dancing/10			"

												DO NOT BUY IT WITHOUT GETTING THE COLLECTORS EDITION. The music is too good.Crypt of the NecroDancer is a game where you move to the changing beat of songs in the game while having to think fast and on your feet. It is very difficult and each zone takes a while to complete and longer to master. Plus it is very mod friendly and you can use your own music. It's a very fun roguelite game where you unlock more items and permenant upgrades as you go and definately pick it up during a steam sale if your wallet is a little tight.			"

								I haven't put a lot of hours into this game yet, but it's probably one of the best games I've played in a long time.I generally like most rhythm games, but to have one that incorporates an adventuring game within it, and doing so VERY successfully, is rare to find.  This game doesn't require much time to play through a single round of it, but you can easily lose a lot of time in the game.It's certainly a title to pick up if you enjoy well composed original music set to a rhythm style play that doesn't require ""twitch-skills"" and also want to adventure through a few dungeons and killing a few baddies along the way.

												Im in love with this game; I can't get enough. The gameplay is fun and wondering how your next run is going to go is always exciting. (like a lot of dungeon crawlers) What NecroDancer does differently than other dungeon crawler games is there isnt any real artifical difficulty. Everything is choreographed (except those darn bats) and it never feels like you were cheated out of run; you lost because -you- messed up. (or your hand cramped trying to do Bolt Death Metal)I can't forget of all things the music. With a great composer such a Danny Baranowsky and currently five other styles by other artists, you can guarentee at least seven or eight songs getting stuck in your head.All in all, this game has been a great experience and I look forward to see what else is in store for this masterpiece.

												NecroDancer takes a young woman through randomly generated dungeons...  Dungeons in which she must move in time with the music to stay alive.  In her travels, she occasionally comes across people in cages, whom she attempts to free where possible.  In return, they graciously supply her with items such as armor, weapons, rings, recovery items, and more, which she will need if she ever wishes to see her father again.As I've said above, this game is dungeon crawler with a twist: moving in time with the music.  The enemies, which are diverse and build upon each other, are also restricted to this rule.  If you miss a beat, you'll likely lose a chance at making a move that would put you in a more favorable position.  In addition, if the song ends before you reach the stairs, the game drops you to the next stage immediately.I've only played the game on keyboard and the controls are simple enough.  Something to note is that there are many usable items in NecroDancer, which require you to press two keys at once to use them, which can be frustrating if you mess up.  It might be easier with an 8-way d-pad on a controller.  There's quite a few different unlockable characters you can play as, including the bard, who can move whenever he wants with no regard to the music.  There's also a co-op mode that I haven't experienced.Where this game really shines is that you can painlessly add your own music to play alongside.  You can do this by picking the specific level you want to add a song to, choosing an mp3 file from the window that comes up, and the game will pick the pace of movement for you.  I've had fun with songs with a consistent beat so far, and I'm looking forward to experimenting with adding different genres in the future.NecroDancer looks great, with its 16-bit art style.  The way enemies move in time with the music is fun, because literally all of them can't help but dance!  There's an option that's on by default that makes the dungeons look like a dance floor by alternating the colors of the floor tiles.Pros:*Endless replayability, with randomly generated levels and the ability to add songs*A co-op mode*A great soundtrack*Challenging movement that makes you feel good when you get it downCons:*It's difficult to use items when playing on keyboard*The odd movement can take some getting used to9/10			"

												The game's only failing is that the fun falls apart if you don't play to the beat. The punishment for breaking the beat on most modes is you lose your coin multiplier. This doesn't serve as a direct in the moment penalty, but as a penalty for down the line when you don't have enough money to buy the cool things.It has a great variety of playable characters which change up the challenge. I favored the easier ones over the intense deep end of the difficutly pool.I highly recommend it, especially if you love music games. A challenging and engaging roguelike.			"

												This is one of the most unique games I've played.  The dungeon crawl nature of it is fun in its self, but then having your and mobs movement tied to the beat of the music takes it to the next leve.  Many weapons and different monsters with their own patterns means that it does take some skill to be good at this game.  And that's a good thing.Tons of fun.  Get this in your life.			"

I. Love. This. Game!(Even though I suck at it.)When I started playing this game, and I couldn't beat the first stage, I wasn't really good at catching rhythm in songs. But now, it's a piece of cake! You can really learn from this game. Anyone who is making music should try it out, to test their rhythm skills, and maybe learn how to play rogue-like dungeon games :PIt has a total of 10 different characters (and another one in the DLC), each having different playstyles than the others.The soundtrack is amazing! It's made by Danny Baranowsky. It features 24 tracks in the base, and 5 extra in the DLC! (on 4th of February 2017, I don't know if Dan will make more soundtrack (which I would really like, it's amazing))Not to mention, there are a couple remixes in the game too!-an EDM remix by A_Rival;-a metal remix by FamilyJules7x;-a freestyle retro remix by Jake 'Virt' Kaufman;-a synthwave remix by Girlfriend Records;-a (i don't know what music type it is) remix by OverClocked;-and a chiptune remix by Chipzel, featured in the Xbox One version!You can also upload your own tracks, and this game will even find the rhythm!The only problem I have with this game, it's really hard. You have to stay concentrated, feel the rhythm, know the patterns and think fast - I often find myself dying from little mistakes, but that's the process of learning, right?I recommend it for everyone. It's worth it, and I love it. You might rage a bit, miss a couple beats and die, but don't all games do that? If you like challenges, this game is for you! But I don't get it, why people say it's not a game for casual players. Who really cares? It's an amazing game! I found myself enjoying it all the time. GET IT!Have fun, and don't forget you have a shovel :necroshovel:			"

												I love this game. Don't let the low hours or no achievements fool you. I play this game offline more than anything else (probably because when I beat Dark Souls: PtDE starting NG+7 I promised myself I would never go back). This game offers tons of challenge for those of you who have trouble keeping the beat (me being one of those people). Ironically you would expect something to carry over, but you are wrong. This game made me have to learn a new way to play games. 10/10 would play (and will because I am going to) again. Also, I love all of these soundtracks and the new AMPLIFIED DLC.			"

												To me this game felt like The Binding of Isaac but to a rhythm. Much like that game this is immensely popular but I don’t like it. The game is deliberately very hard, you are supposed to die repeatedly and each time scrape together enough diamonds to get upgrades to allow you to progress a little further. Despite the procedurally generated levels it grows repetitive and annoying very quickly. Given that this is a music based game, the soundtrack is disappointing. Some of the tracks are great but most of them are forgettable.  The music based combat is novel and the enemies are reasonably varied but not enough to redeem the game for me.			"

												It's not a bad game but on the surface it obviously relies heavily the music rhthym gimmick. After the music gimmick washes away and you actually dig into the game it becomes just another ""me too"" mediocre rogue dungeon crawler.One of my main issues is that the main music tracks, while pretty good, are mastered too high in volume. Any and every MP3 I brought in the game sounded much more quiet compared to the music in the game. I also found the beat was a bit off at times on music tracks I brought in though this was not a major issue (and I sort of expected this).			"

												Crypt of the NecroDancer is a game unlike any other. It is unique and really fun to play. In my experience with the game I haven't found anything I don't like, you move around a dungeon and kill monsters based on the beat of your heart.The heart beat also adds something new to these sorts of games. Turn based movement has been seen and used before but making it part of the story line and being able to change the rate at which the 'turns' pass is something really special.Pro's:- It is very fun to play and offers a lot of different things to experience.- It is unique and differs a lot from games that you find similar to this one.- The way you progress and unlock new items is really thought out and well designed so that you can really enjoy it fully.Con's:- Honestly, for me their are no con's to this game. It is fun, simple and a good use of your gaming time.I hope everyone else enjoys the game now and in the futer.			"

Early Access Review
								Rhythm games and roguelike games are both fairly small niches, and you wouldn't think they would go together well. But apparently they do!They go together as well as chocolate and peanut butter. Butter crackers and salmon spread. Uncooked fish and soy sauce. This is a fantastically fun game. It is rather brutally difficult (just like roguelikes), and the music is head-noddingly addictive (just like rhythm games). It is a beautifully weird marriage made in a version of heaven I had never even imagined. It's early access, so it's too early for a full review, but I love every minute I spend playing this. The only mild flaw I could ever say is that the music gets a little repetitive, as it's a roguelike, so you will be playing levels over and over and over (you can use your own music though).If you have anything better than a hatred of roguelikes and rhythm games, you owe it to yourself to check this out. This game is a perfect example of why indie games are, in a small way, the saviors of the gaming industry. This game is weird, bizarre, unbelievably fun, and a game a AAA studio wouldn't even listen to the first sentence of the pitch for.Also, that trader has some seriously operatic pipes!			"

								This fun ""rogue-lite"" has you dancing to the beat to destroy monsters and discover the secret of the Crypt of the Necrodancer. Though this game would seem overly simplistic if it were turn-based, the rhythm aspect turns up the heat and keeps you on your toes. Even in early access, this game is a hit. 9/10, would boogie.			"

												Finally a game where I can play with just one hand! 8.5/10.Over all Crypt of th NecroDancer embarks into a old school retro dungeon adventure that has you playing to the rythme of the music while ingaging monsters, avoiding traps and completing puzzles. Every map feels different from one another which makes the dungeon experience that much more enjoyable.You earn gold to buy armor, weapons, magic, food ext... While collecting diamonds to purchase upgrades for your hero at the main menu. You can also unlock different modes and characters to further your dungeon experience.I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys rythme games, dungeon games or just a quick game that doesn't require you to sit down for over an hour long to complete a map.This game needs mounts added... I want a Chupacabra mount!I wonder what kind of things I can do with my other hand while playing this game...			"

								Great game. It's worth playing if you get it now in alpha, but as with most early access titles I recommend you don't buy it yet unless you just really can't wait until it's done to play it. About 1/4 of the game (the finale) isn't there at all, a few items need tweaking, and some of the music (especially in act 2) needs to be better. It also lacks a diversity of enemies that I expect the final game will have.			"

								This game is so much fun to play and causes ""just one more dungeon run"" fever. Don't start playing it if you have an appointment for something.The basic change to the roguelike forumla is the ryhthm.  You move in time to the music and if you miss a beat your coin bonus goes down. You'll have to learn the pattern of enemies' movement and the pattern of the attack of all the different weapons and keep moving!If you get bored (somehow) of always dancing, there is a character called the Bard that you can play where the game becomes properly turn-based.

												Twelve hours so far and this game is being incredibly fun! It's very casual if you just want to spend time, but at the same time you actually have a lot of progress the more you play the game.You pick up diamonds that let you buy upgrades, so everytime that you play the game, you're having a bit of progress and just wasting some minutes on a casual game. Also, the sound beat based game mechanics are insane! I highly recommend the game!68 hours edit: this game went from a simple casual to a huge challenging game. Once you beat the game with the main character, you start to unlock new and even harder characters, and the challenge keeps going on! It's insane how the developers made it fun, creative and challenging.			"

								Crypt of the NecroDancer is a rhytm based dungeon crawler with some roguelike elements and great tunes. CotN is a turn based game where every beat serves as a turn. This means that if you miss a beat you miss a turn. You basically need just 4 buttons to play the game: left, right, up and down. These are used also in combination to use items and spells by pressing up+left to eat an apple i.e. though you can assign a single button for these functions also. You find consumables from the levels to heal yourself, spells like fireball or freeze and different weapons and armors. There are also diamonds that serves as a currency in the games hub where you can purchase persistent additions to your adventuring. Besides additional health the rest of the upgrades are added to the map generation for you to find. Enemies are varied as in how often they move (in beats) and in which patterns (up and down, following you etc.) and bosses are tougher and more damage dealing creatures of course. What makes CotN different is the rhytm-system. Roguelike-type-of-games are usually hard already but NecroDancer makes you do important decisions on the fly and likes to punish the player for hesitating. If you thought Spelunky was hard you've seen nothing (this is a warning). You have to study the movements patterns of the enemies and find the right timing and way to deal with each enemy. This changes with your gear since some weapons allow you to attack diagonally and you have to consider the right timing to launch that spell you've been saving. Pros:-Music, music, MUSIC.-Fast paced, quick runs-Graphics are lovely-Challenging -Different game modes and co-opCons: -I didn't like the color effect that you get when coin multiplier gets higher, makes the game look messy particularly in the second zone. -Not sure if the music/movement calibration is the most accurate possible solution-If the beat calibration is of it's pretty much impossible to play the hardcore mode-Could have more items that alter the gameplay Very good distraction for coffee break gaming and for the laughs with friends. I felt that the price was a bit high for the game but not for the soundtrack - and this doesn't mean that the game is bad - just that Danny B makes some badass tunes.			"

												Crypt of the NecroDancer is easily the most addictive game I’ve played in quite some time. It compels you to want to play more, and more, and more!Part of this is the fantastic soundtrack that blends so seamlessly with the rhythm based rogue like.

			NEW Crypt of the NecroDancer, a stylish and engaging rhythm roguelike with an amazing soundtrack. I freaking love this game!		

The story is rather cliche, you’re name is Cadence and you’ve gone to look for a family member. Only to get yourself killed, and then resurrected by the NecroDancer. Now you must move to the beat and fight your way deeper into the darkness.The game is difficult, but don’t let that dissuade you, it’s amazingly good. One of the few early access games that feels more like a completed product that some thrown together tech demo.What’s not to love about it?The 16-bit graphics and art style are beautiful and charming, and animations very well executed and the beat. That cursed beat that compels you to try again, and again.In all the hours that I’ve played I’ve only made it to Zone 3, and here there is a mix of techno and metal. Ice and fire, the dungeon is separated by these two elements. With creatures embodying either of the elements, and music shifting and changing as you move from the blue to red squares.Timing and rhythm is truly everything for the NecroDancer. All creatures in his dungeon must obey the beat, each bouncing and writhing in their own unique and horrific dance. Your yourself must do the same, although your consciousness allows you to move more freely.The simplest way to describe the combat and various weapons is Chess. Each creature, and each weapon, works in a similar way to chess. Do you attack diagonally, or straight forward only. Do you hit ahead of you, or to the side.You must learn each item’s use, and abilities, while doing the same for the enemies that stalk you so. Not surprising that one of the first bosses you encounter is actually an animated chess board. With the King at the far back playing his dark melody to move and order his minions and queen. The pawns are rather useless, but ignoring them spells doom, for they quickly turn into powerful Queens once they reach your walls.Don’t fret though, as you can also empower yourself with magical weapons, items, spells and even more life. Dotted throughout the zones are diamonds. That precious stone is used to upgrade your character and unlock more items, and spells.Along with gems, are towns people, free them as you find them with golden keys and they will join you in the game lobby. Offering you these upgrades, and even to train you against monsters, and even bosses. For a fee of course; more diamonds.If you can’t get enough punishment in the normal play style, there’s hardcore mode. None of your upgrades work, and you have to attempt to clear the entire game with a single run. Die, and you start again. The pinnacle of the masochist gamer.The game is fun, more than fun. It’s a masterpiece of Indie gaming, roguelikes and rhythm games. Hell, you can even play it with dance pad. You can even import your own MP3 collection if you want. Enjoy a fantastic game, and dance!Crypt of the NecroDancer is a must buy!			"

								For being creative in the Roguelike genre by adding Rhythm game elements (Dancepad-style controls and gameplay), it's awesome that this game did something out of the ordinary and did it WELL.New to the game? Don't worry, there's a lot of stuff in the game for beginners, from tutorials to training rooms, to get to up to par with the better players. Wanna challenge yourself? Go right ahead! There's daily challenges, seeded runs, speedrunning, and you can remove items you've unlocked from the dungeon. Like modding games? It's got that too. Just throw some pixel art together and make yourself a new character or two, make a dungeon with the level editor, or edit some of the game's XML data for lulz.If you've come for a fun time, the soundtrack, got a recommendation, or to introduce yourself to Roguelikes, you won't be disappointed. Just keep in mind, this game doesn't throw punches. The enemies are tough and there are a lot of them. They do however follow patterns, so try to learn them. "

												Twelve hours so far and this game is being incredibly fun! It's very casual if you just want to spend time, but at the same time you actually have a lot of progress the more you play the game.You pick up diamonds that let you buy upgrades, so everytime that you play the game, you're having a bit of progress and just wasting some minutes on a casual game. Also, the sound beat based game mechanics are insane! I highly recommend the game!68 hours edit: this game went from a simple casual to a huge challenging game. Once you beat the game with the main character, you start to unlock new and even harder characters, and the challenge keeps going on! It's insane how the developers made it fun, creative and challenging.			"

 This review has been edited from negative to positive. I had initially given this game a negative review (that I've left completely unedited and can be found at the bottom of this review should you choose to read my first thoughts on the game). Thanks to the developers response, I've been able to see the game in a different light. As such, I'm completely revising my review. But if you don't feel like reading all I have to say, the short version of this review is as follows in a conveniently bulleted list: Amazing soundtracks; can choose to play along with the default music, techno remixed music or metal music Fast-paced gameplay that requires patience and quick strategy Controlled entirely with the four directional arrow keys (and enter key for the pause menu) Extreme but fair difficulty; master enemy patterns and you've mastered the game Play with mods from the Steam Workshop Lots of things to unlock Encouraging developer who provided helpful insight in the face of negativity (It means a lot to me) The current positive review Crypt of the Necrodancer is what it looks like; a rhythm-based dungeon crawler. You move to the beat of the music, and the controls are simply the 4 arrow keys; up, down, left, right. Combat is as simple as moving next to an enemy and attempting to move onto the square they occupy to damage the enemy. Sounds simple on paper, but each enemy has a pattern, and I know very well from experience now that if you just try to attack each enemy head-on, you will die many humiliating deaths. Learning how to traverse the map and defeat enemies without getting hit is key to survival, as health restoration items seldom appear.There are practice modes so you can master the enemy patterns, but practice against minibosses and boss fights are locked. However, there are detailed video guides as to how to defeat each boss (and enemy) should you be unable to collect the diamonds to unlock the practice mode(s). Regarding diamonds, one of the nicest features I've found in the game is that the game will warn you if you have diamonds left to spend on upgrades should you attempt to play again (as your diamond count is reset to 0 each attempt). This warning can be disabled, but because it's there, you can maximize on the rewards you've earned to get very much-needed upgrades. These upgrades include (but are not limited to) more base health and different items appearing in chests that would otherwise need to be bought from the shopkeeper mid-dungeon.In conclusion, this game is hard. There's no getting around that; statistically (as of writing this review), only 6.7% of players have completed the game under normal conditions. It may seem like it's impossibly hard (as I initially thought) at first, but this isn't the kind of game you can pick up and master in an instant. It's a game that requires time and practice to be good at. Just like anything in life. In that sense, it exits one's comfort zone of going into a game with skills learned from other games that can be applied. As such, this game is unique and brings something new to the table; a gameplay experience I can't get from playing other games. The old negative review Crypt of the Necrodancer is a fantastic game; the rhythm element is excellently implemented and functions perfectly for me. The music is great and catchy, and the game as a whole gives a new twist on roguelike dungeon crawlers. The steam workshop compatability gives endless possibilities as to gameplay creativity.However, I can't recommend this game because it's egregiously difficult to the point of becoming nearly unplayable. It took me almost my first hour of gameplay just to get past zone 1. As of writing this review, I can't get past zone 2-2 (if I can even make it that far), and after reading many other reviews, it doesn't seem like it will get much better. There are many games that are extremely difficult yet still enjoyable to play after losing; Crypt of the Necrodancer is not one of those games. Incessant game overs are disheartening to say the least, and rather than encourage me to try again, this game encourages me to play something else.			"

												The concept alone deserves a high rating. It's challenging, fun, and I like the option to play as the bard and disable the gimmick, although the 'gimmick' is great and doesn't feel forced. I tend to find that I don't play it for too long at a time because it gets frustrating (mostly due to me being too hasty), but it doesn't feel like it's the game's fault and I will come back to it frequently. The more you improve, the more fun it gets. Good for the money, a solid purchase.			"

												Crypt Of The Necro Dancer i think is a great game, mainly because you have have to listen the beat of the music to move, dig, and attack!There are 4 zones at the moment of the game (so far) to complete there are new characters you can collect along the way. As you play through the game the story continues on (i have not finished it yet)  The main challenge of the game is the monsters, mini bosses, and the tough bosses! As you find as you play ALL the monsters have there own moving pattern (bats move randomly though) mini bosses are hard but not as hard as the bosses. The bosses are one of the most tedious things Necro Dancer has in store for you but overall i would rate this game 7/8So a great game in my opinion!			"

								Got obliterated by a dragon, some goblins, a couple of horse-riding skeletons & a hellhound to the Benny Hill Theme.10/10In seriousness, for an early access title there's quite a bit of content, and the gameplay is very solid (haven't found a single bug/rough-around-the-edges aspect yet) and highly enjoyable - think Binding of Isaac meets Legend of Zelda meets Dance Dance Revolution. This is a unique little game that blends multiple genres together in a brilliant way, and you can even pick your own music (though the in-game tracks are pretty awesome anyway)! There's even a local co-op mode - I've yet to try this, but can't wait to give it a crack.Though the final quarter & ending of the game (and additional content etc) is yet to be added, I'm having a blast with the alpha and would highly recommend it!

												Definitely one of the few rogue-likes I can enjoy! Success is built much more on skill than item drop luck, like in other rogue-likes.Also you don't drop that deep when you die. A ""level-accomplished-checkpoint"" is every 3 levels after a boss. It gets quite difficult though. There is a constant learning curve to be mastered since the btw awesome music speeds up the pace and the monsters become more dangerous with better abilities. The good thing is, that there is a way to deal with them all. There is no imbalanced uber enemy you cannot counter. You just have to be quick and stick to the beat ;-)Extremely recommended if you like rogue-likes, rythm games, pixel graphics and dungeoneering.			"

								Great game.But development is going really slowly.At this rate they'll get bored of it, release the early beta version with limited content, and call it a day.My advice is to acquire it through means not involving you paying money, and then just purchase the game after feel you want to support it. That's what I did.			"

								Yes, yes, a thousand times yes. This game is everything I never knew I wanted. It's like DDR had a sick, twisted baby with Binding of Isaac. And as weird as that sounds, it works. AMAZINGLY. With a soundtrack that never gets old, this game has almost infinite replayability. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.			"

 This review has been edited from negative to positive. I had initially given this game a negative review (that I've left completely unedited and can be found at the bottom of this review should you choose to read my first thoughts on the game). Thanks to the developers response, I've been able to see the game in a different light. As such, I'm completely revising my review. But if you don't feel like reading all I have to say, the short version of this review is as follows in a conveniently bulleted list: Amazing soundtracks; can choose to play along with the default music, techno remixed music or metal music Fast-paced gameplay that requires patience and quick strategy Controlled entirely with the four directional arrow keys (and enter key for the pause menu) Extreme but fair difficulty; master enemy patterns and you've mastered the game Play with mods from the Steam Workshop Lots of things to unlock Encouraging developer who provided helpful insight in the face of negativity (It means a lot to me) The current positive review Crypt of the Necrodancer is what it looks like; a rhythm-based dungeon crawler. You move to the beat of the music, and the controls are simply the 4 arrow keys; up, down, left, right. Combat is as simple as moving next to an enemy and attempting to move onto the square they occupy to damage the enemy. Sounds simple on paper, but each enemy has a pattern, and I know very well from experience now that if you just try to attack each enemy head-on, you will die many humiliating deaths. Learning how to traverse the map and defeat enemies without getting hit is key to survival, as health restoration items seldom appear.There are practice modes so you can master the enemy patterns, but practice against minibosses and boss fights are locked. However, there are detailed video guides as to how to defeat each boss (and enemy) should you be unable to collect the diamonds to unlock the practice mode(s). Regarding diamonds, one of the nicest features I've found in the game is that the game will warn you if you have diamonds left to spend on upgrades should you attempt to play again (as your diamond count is reset to 0 each attempt). This warning can be disabled, but because it's there, you can maximize on the rewards you've earned to get very much-needed upgrades. These upgrades include (but are not limited to) more base health and different items appearing in chests that would otherwise need to be bought from the shopkeeper mid-dungeon.In conclusion, this game is hard. There's no getting around that; statistically (as of writing this review), only 6.7% of players have completed the game under normal conditions. It may seem like it's impossibly hard (as I initially thought) at first, but this isn't the kind of game you can pick up and master in an instant. It's a game that requires time and practice to be good at. Just like anything in life. In that sense, it exits one's comfort zone of going into a game with skills learned from other games that can be applied. As such, this game is unique and brings something new to the table; a gameplay experience I can't get from playing other games. The old negative review Crypt of the Necrodancer is a fantastic game; the rhythm element is excellently implemented and functions perfectly for me. The music is great and catchy, and the game as a whole gives a new twist on roguelike dungeon crawlers. The steam workshop compatability gives endless possibilities as to gameplay creativity.However, I can't recommend this game because it's egregiously difficult to the point of becoming nearly unplayable. It took me almost my first hour of gameplay just to get past zone 1. As of writing this review, I can't get past zone 2-2 (if I can even make it that far), and after reading many other reviews, it doesn't seem like it will get much better. There are many games that are extremely difficult yet still enjoyable to play after losing; Crypt of the Necrodancer is not one of those games. Incessant game overs are disheartening to say the least, and rather than encourage me to try again, this game encourages me to play something else.			"

												This is right now one of my Favorite game that I have been playing only in 4 hours. But that will changes really soon. Crypt of the NecroDancer is as what I would say a rhythm dungeon explore game, where you try to get to the end of every floor until you find the Main boss and continue on the next zone. But it isn’t that easy. You can only move the character by listen to the beat in the music. If you miss a beat, you cannot move and will be defenseless to the monsters. You only have so many life and that’s your job to not lose. When you beat a monster, they drop gold. With the gold you can buy weapons or Items in the shop in every floor. You can also earn more money by going with the rhythm. But as you should now is, if you miss a beat in the song, you lose your chances to earn more money.There is also Diamonds that you can buy in the lobby to unlock more health, armor, weapons or Items that you can find in chests. There is many character to unlock and there is a 2 player mode. Also you can play this with a keyboard, controller or a USB dance pad!And last thing I know, there is workshop with this game, and you can changes the song in the game to something else with the MP3. Which is really nice!Otherwise the music that are in the game without MP3 is really great. 8/10 You should try this game now when It is on sale for 3,74€. But that’s just me.  "

It's an incredible mix of rhytm game, with a sick soundtrack and really solid beats(meaning you won't risk going off-beat because of irregular or vague tempo), and a roguelike that neither hols your hand nor throws you into battle without help: over the course of your journey to trace the titular NecroDancer, you'll find a rather vast array of helpful items that range from weapons, to armor, to magic spells and scrolls, and finally to helpful gadgets and accessories to further help you... But ultimately, it's up to you to put them to good use, for the dungeons are unforgiving, the monsters many, the spells limited, and your heart dancing to the tune of the master of the dungeon.			"

												Lol I just copypasted this review so I could lvl my steam prof, its a gud game tho. Unlike many games that carry the label, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a roguelike that is actually quite a bit like Rogue. You control a lone hero in a grid-based dungeon, pushing back the fog of war square by square as you explore each randomly-generated set of chambers. As you journey deeper you gather gear, spells and consumables to help you survive encounters with monsters who behave according to predictable routines. If you die, you start over from the beginning.In a traditional roguelike, your greatest asset is the time you're afforded to think, assess, plan. Crypt of the Necrodancer's defining flourish is that it reduces your thinking time to the space between two beats on the soundtrack. Move to the rhythm and you build up a multiplier, turning the ground into an illuminated dancefloor and boosting the gold you earn from every kill. In order to be able to afford the best gear, then, you should always be moving. Move thoughtlessly, however, and you'll die. The result is a game where you are always taking action but only sporadically acting well. What was once a meditative, considered experience becomes a rush of on-the-fly strategy and occasional finesse—becomes, in short, a dance.			"

												The soundtrack is awesome, and the ability to add your own music and play with cute mods makes it better.  However, I see the backstory of the primary heroine rather cliched; the gameplay, though, is quite an interesting idea.  The diamonds are annoyingly hard to come by; since the coins are much more common, I wish the upgrades in the lobby also took coins.  I also found a difficulty imbalance between Zone 1 and Zone 2, so I can't get beyond the first Zone.  Upgrading the chests and their items can make the level slightly more bearable, escept when it comes to enemies with high health/large range.Final verdict:  7/10			"

Combined those two and you made a monster, and you must kill it to the beat of the music the monster is playing, the monster being the NecroDancer, and you being Cadence (or Melody, Aria, Dorian, Eli, Monk, Coda, Bolt, or Bard). The music is extremely well made. I've found my self huming the songs like a lunatic (Like I already am. Just look at my face). If you are me then THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE...

												Crypt of the NecroDancer. So what is it? It is a dungeon crawler where turns are taking place in a certain (dictated by song) rhytm. Basically you go on andventure of 4 zones, each having 4 levels. Design of each zone is unique and entertaining, each with different enemies traps and hazards. At end of each level you will meet a Miniboss (7 different types, which most have upraged version of itself), and at the end of each level you will meet a boss (4 types). When you finish a ""run"" (beat 4 zones in a row) you will meet final boss. But if you are able to defeat him it's not over. After it you will have 2 more characters that push story to play with. ""What story?"" Every time you beat any zone with a character you will get a cutscene (don't worry you can skip it).""But why did you say 2 more characters  that push story  ?"" Because you will have 6 differeant characters that do not push story and are there to make this game even longer!Gameplay feels slick and nice with amazing songs (3 differeant song packs {normal, kind-of-disco and metal one} + a beat analizer so you can adapt your own songs to the game).  Game is quite well balanced and only issue that i have is bosses at end of zones are too easy (excluding ""main"" ones). Local Co-Op is sweet, game has controller support and achievment system.What could i say more? 10/10			"

												A respectable roguelike that does more things correctly than most of what's out there.  The basic gameplay of fighting to the beat isn't particularly interesting to me, mostly because of how much it tends to slow things down.  You can opt for a faster tempo of course, but I just prefer to have control over when I move, and not be forced to move just so I don't lose a multiplier.  And they let you do that, thankfully.  It's worth playing, though I don't know if I'd pay full price for it.			"

												A respectable roguelike that does more things correctly than most of what's out there.  The basic gameplay of fighting to the beat isn't particularly interesting to me, mostly because of how much it tends to slow things down.  You can opt for a faster tempo of course, but I just prefer to have control over when I move, and not be forced to move just so I don't lose a multiplier.  And they let you do that, thankfully.  It's worth playing, though I don't know if I'd pay full price for it.			"

								Great game.But development is going really slowly.At this rate they'll get bored of it, release the early beta version with limited content, and call it a day.My advice is to acquire it through means not involving you paying money, and then just purchase the game after feel you want to support it. That's what I did.			"

												I've been playing this game a lot again lately and i've changed my mind. I'm gonna copy some of my old review in this. (The old review was done when I was called ""Hostile Elder Oak"")Crypt of the Necrodancer is an amazing game. You just gotta play it a lot to understand.Yeah, I DID edit the files to unlock the level editor but i'm not skilled enough to beat the game. *gasp*It's a unique game. When was the last time you saw a rhythm based dungeon crawler? The closest thing I can think of is ""Patapon"" for the PSP but it's not a dungeon crawler or top-down. Look it up.You can even put in your own .mp3 or .ogg files for the music. There's a lot of different playable characters, 4 different dungeon types, a level editor, a load of items, lots of enemies, etc.You can even add your own music (and play to the beat of the song).One bad thing is that it's random so you could find a really cool weapon in one run, nothing good in another.Apart from that, I DO recommend this game.That's if you can play it...---------------------------------------------    ORIGINAL (negative) REVIEW:---------------------------------------------As much as I enjoy this game (sometimes), I can't recommend it, unless you like overly hard, unforgiving games, then go ahead.I'll start with the good things. It's a unique game. When was the last time you saw a rhythm based dungeon crawler? The closest thing I can think of is ""Patapon"" for the PSP but it's not a dungeon crawler or top-down. Look it up.You can even put in your own .mp3 or .ogg files for the music. There's a lot of different playable characters, 4 different dungeon types, a level editor, a load of items, lots of enemies, etc.Now the bad things.Just like Magicite or The Binding of Isaac, The game is pretty much based on luck. Roll a 6 and you win. Roll any other number, you lose. You need to be good at enemy pattern remembrance, have a good eye, be good with music and hope you get good items. Most of the game for me consisted of getting far and then dying some sort of cheap death you couldn't avoid, which isn't fun. It doesn't help that some enemies move randomly. Zone 4 didn't even feel like part of the game.When I said about the load of playable characters, most of them I have are useless.The Monk can get any shop item for free but dies instantly by touching gold, which is a lot harder than it sounds.The Dove (I think) Can't attack. Come on, really?And the level editor? You have to beat the game. Do you really think I would do that?So, should you get it?I would say no. Even if you really want it, I thought the same thing.I'm not saying that the game is badly made or anything. It's actually really well made.			"

												The concept alone deserves a high rating. It's challenging, fun, and I like the option to play as the bard and disable the gimmick, although the 'gimmick' is great and doesn't feel forced. I tend to find that I don't play it for too long at a time because it gets frustrating (mostly due to me being too hasty), but it doesn't feel like it's the game's fault and I will come back to it frequently. The more you improve, the more fun it gets. Good for the money, a solid purchase.			"

												I refrained for a while from buying this because it didn't convince me that much. I bought it when it was on sale and with about 2 hours played I must say I don't regret one bit buying this.Following the rythm isn't as hard as I personally thought, although it can be sometimes difficult.Each enemy has its own movement patterns, HP and damage they do to you. Fortunately there is a Trainer you can unlock where you can practice with every enemy individually in what I consider a very well done system.The game overall is really fun to play. Very extense on content and secrets, and of course, very challenging. (Also, shoopkeeper singing the level song along the rythm is a plus).Right now I can say I'm in love with this game, and I can't wait to get better at it and keep progressing.			"

												Definitely one of the few rogue-likes I can enjoy! Success is built much more on skill than item drop luck, like in other rogue-likes.Also you don't drop that deep when you die. A ""level-accomplished-checkpoint"" is every 3 levels after a boss. It gets quite difficult though. There is a constant learning curve to be mastered since the btw awesome music speeds up the pace and the monsters become more dangerous with better abilities. The good thing is, that there is a way to deal with them all. There is no imbalanced uber enemy you cannot counter. You just have to be quick and stick to the beat ;-)Extremely recommended if you like rogue-likes, rythm games, pixel graphics and dungeoneering.			"

 This review has been edited from negative to positive. I had initially given this game a negative review (that I've left completely unedited and can be found at the bottom of this review should you choose to read my first thoughts on the game). Thanks to the developers response, I've been able to see the game in a different light. As such, I'm completely revising my review. But if you don't feel like reading all I have to say, the short version of this review is as follows in a conveniently bulleted list: Amazing soundtracks; can choose to play along with the default music, techno remixed music or metal music Fast-paced gameplay that requires patience and quick strategy Controlled entirely with the four directional arrow keys (and enter key for the pause menu) Extreme but fair difficulty; master enemy patterns and you've mastered the game Play with mods from the Steam Workshop Lots of things to unlock Encouraging developer who provided helpful insight in the face of negativity (It means a lot to me) The current positive review Crypt of the Necrodancer is what it looks like; a rhythm-based dungeon crawler. You move to the beat of the music, and the controls are simply the 4 arrow keys; up, down, left, right. Combat is as simple as moving next to an enemy and attempting to move onto the square they occupy to damage the enemy. Sounds simple on paper, but each enemy has a pattern, and I know very well from experience now that if you just try to attack each enemy head-on, you will die many humiliating deaths. Learning how to traverse the map and defeat enemies without getting hit is key to survival, as health restoration items seldom appear.There are practice modes so you can master the enemy patterns, but practice against minibosses and boss fights are locked. However, there are detailed video guides as to how to defeat each boss (and enemy) should you be unable to collect the diamonds to unlock the practice mode(s). Regarding diamonds, one of the nicest features I've found in the game is that the game will warn you if you have diamonds left to spend on upgrades should you attempt to play again (as your diamond count is reset to 0 each attempt). This warning can be disabled, but because it's there, you can maximize on the rewards you've earned to get very much-needed upgrades. These upgrades include (but are not limited to) more base health and different items appearing in chests that would otherwise need to be bought from the shopkeeper mid-dungeon.In conclusion, this game is hard. There's no getting around that; statistically (as of writing this review), only 6.7% of players have completed the game under normal conditions. It may seem like it's impossibly hard (as I initially thought) at first, but this isn't the kind of game you can pick up and master in an instant. It's a game that requires time and practice to be good at. Just like anything in life. In that sense, it exits one's comfort zone of going into a game with skills learned from other games that can be applied. As such, this game is unique and brings something new to the table; a gameplay experience I can't get from playing other games. The old negative review Crypt of the Necrodancer is a fantastic game; the rhythm element is excellently implemented and functions perfectly for me. The music is great and catchy, and the game as a whole gives a new twist on roguelike dungeon crawlers. The steam workshop compatability gives endless possibilities as to gameplay creativity.However, I can't recommend this game because it's egregiously difficult to the point of becoming nearly unplayable. It took me almost my first hour of gameplay just to get past zone 1. As of writing this review, I can't get past zone 2-2 (if I can even make it that far), and after reading many other reviews, it doesn't seem like it will get much better. There are many games that are extremely difficult yet still enjoyable to play after losing; Crypt of the Necrodancer is not one of those games. Incessant game overs are disheartening to say the least, and rather than encourage me to try again, this game encourages me to play something else.			"

But there are SO MANY mechanics that the game is this ""Minute to learn, Lifetime to master"" Deal. Once you got a hang for the music you then need to get a hang on the patterns enemies use, The best rhythm to stick with for certain weopons, etc. This make it into a whole new style, Where one miss can change EVERYTHING.

												TL;DR: 9/10. They did almost everything right. Mostly boils down to how experienced you're willing to get, because it's tricky to get used to.Crypt of the NecroDancer is about shanking monsters to a kickass beat. The game stars a girl named Cadence whose entire character, backstory and development can be summarised by ""a girl named Cadence"". It is very much centered around the gameplay and music working together, which works super well in a pretty flexible way compared to other rhythm-based games. The introduction is short and doesn't add much to the game other than justifying the mechanics, so you'll pretty much have the same experience regardless.The game takes 'turn-based' in a slightly different way. Each beat of the song is represented at the bottom of the screen and symbolises a turn each. If you miss a beat or do something you're not supposed to such as walk into a wall of stone, every enemy still gets a turn while you're standing there hoping nobody noticed that your pants just fell down. Each time you miss a beat, your current combo is broken, meaning you don't have any time to stop and read useful information as even standing still will bring it to a screeching halt.Combo, you say?Why yes indeed, a combo.Maintaining the combo gives a boost to the amount of gold you pick up. Items that you pick up such as weapons or rings may give additional boosts to people who haven't accidentally thrown their flimsy shovel into a solid wall or stood around stroking themselves for too long unless they're a Monk, who for whatever reason is allowed to stroke himself for as long as he likes, which pretty much defeats the entire premise of the game.Comparing two items is a pain, as stopping to read the item's description will cause you to lose your combo, meaning you have to do a god damn raindance around the item just to read the stats and figure out if it's going to increase your chance of winning by 0.3%.The ENTIRE game can be controlled using only 4 buttons/keys, which is about as convenient as an enemy who you can't actually hit with default gear because it won't line up next to you. I'm looking at you, golden slime. Sure, it's an interesting mechanic, but its main flaw is replacing memorising which key to press with memorising which combination of the same keys to press. It does show appropriate key combinations beside relevant items, but stopping to read it in the middle of a room more undead than a haunted mass grave is usually not worth the time. Guessing which combination is hardly worth the risk; you may be trying to heal in the middle of battle and end up throwing your sword across the room.Using your own (or someone else's) music instead of the original game's works pretty decently in terms of functionality, although the soundtrack is good enough that you wouldn't want to replace any of it in the first place.Local multiplayer is an interesting feature, although playing it with a first-timer was akin to participating in a three-legged race with a monkey who has bricks for feet. Unless you're both relatively similarly experienced, one of you is going to drag the other behind. Well I wouldn't say drag behind as much as them stumbling about while you're already buying everything from the shop with a stack of gold, which for this game was about as fun as letting a monkey with bricks for feet kick you in the shins after you finished the race without him, because now neither of you are having much fun at all.And that was after they went through incredibly short tutorial. Sure, it taught the basics, but you only really got to do everything in the tutorial once before it was over and it was clear that it didn't adequately equip a person with the experience they needed to survive unsupervised inside a padded room.If someone wants to play for the first time on your copy of the game, let them play singeplayer first.Overall decent game. Can't say much about price because I almost exclusively buy games when they're on sale.			"

												The curse of the Necrodancer is a curse placed upon (Almost) all characters in this game, which makes them move to the beat of any song playing.Now I know what you're thinking. Why is that important to know, other than that's why everything is to the beat?BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST IN THE GAME.THIS GAME INFLICTS YOU WITH THE CURSE OF THE NECRODANCER.It starts out slow. Maybe you remember a particular song from this game's sountrack that you liked, and don't notice your foot start tapping to the beat. But it progresses. IT PROGRESSES UNTIL WHENEVER THERE IS MUSIC, YOU MOVE TO THE BEAT. YOU CANNOT STOP IT. YOU CANNOT SLOW IT DOWN. IT WILL HAPPEN. THE ONLY PREVENTION IS TO NOT BUY THIS GAME.BUT NOT BUYING IT WOULD BE A REALLY BAD IDEA TOO BECAUSE THE GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING.SOON THE ENTIRE WORLD WILL BE MOVING TO THE BEAT.WE'RE DOOMED!DANNY BARANOWSKY, WHAT HAVE YOU DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONE?!

								Its the most creative videogame I've ever played. A rhythm game combined with a dungeon crawler. Music is spectacular and game is very challenging. Even if it is early access it still feels like a finished product in my eyes. 10/10 would buy again.			"

								I'm not much of a rouge-like fan, but this game is freaking amazing! I love how you can put your own music into the game for each floor. You should for sure add this game to your library!			"

												The curse of the Necrodancer is a curse placed upon (Almost) all characters in this game, which makes them move to the beat of any song playing.Now I know what you're thinking. Why is that important to know, other than that's why everything is to the beat?BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST IN THE GAME.THIS GAME INFLICTS YOU WITH THE CURSE OF THE NECRODANCER.It starts out slow. Maybe you remember a particular song from this game's sountrack that you liked, and don't notice your foot start tapping to the beat. But it progresses. IT PROGRESSES UNTIL WHENEVER THERE IS MUSIC, YOU MOVE TO THE BEAT. YOU CANNOT STOP IT. YOU CANNOT SLOW IT DOWN. IT WILL HAPPEN. THE ONLY PREVENTION IS TO NOT BUY THIS GAME.BUT NOT BUYING IT WOULD BE A REALLY BAD IDEA TOO BECAUSE THE GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING.SOON THE ENTIRE WORLD WILL BE MOVING TO THE BEAT.WE'RE DOOMED!DANNY BARANOWSKY, WHAT HAVE YOU DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONE?!
