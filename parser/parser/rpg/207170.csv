												The basic premise of Legend of Grimrock is that it is a modern take on the classic grid-based,dungeon-crawling,RPG games of old, like Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder etc. You start out with a party of 4 adventurers (arranged in a 2x2 formation)... in this case convicted as criminals and thrown into a secure prison.. and must explore the prison/dungeon to learn its secrets and find a way out. Movement is directional, plus rotate left and right, around a series of 2 dimensional grid based levels. There are various monsters to fight and puzzles to solve in order to progress through the game. Fighting is done by means of clicking on the items equipped in your characters' hands, often whilst performing a ""Square dance"" with the monsters to avoid letting them hit your partyThe graphics have been updated, especially the lighting engine, which is amazing, but repeating textures are still used widely, and the gameplay itself is very reminiscent of the early games. Objects are interacted with by click on the screen e.g. to press a button or open a door and items can be picked up and carried/used by your party of adventurers. The adventurers attack by left-clicking the items that are placed in their hands, and spells can be cast by choosing the right combination of runes for a spell the adventurer has learnt.There are 4 races:- Humans; Minotaurs; Lizardmen; and Insectoids, and 3 character classes - Fighter; Mage; Rogue. and you can either play with a default party, or create one of your own.According to Steam I have racked up 410 hours of playing time on Legend of Grimrock... mostly that is because a dungeon editor was released and I have spent a huge amount of time working on my own creations. I have however also completed the main game at least 3 times. Firstly with a hand-picked party of 4 characters, then again with a special unlockable solo character, and finally a hard,old-school playthrough with no automap. I've also spent a large amount of time using the Dungeon Editor and writing scripts to create my own levels/puzzles/spells etc. My first play through took 19 hours 35 minutes of playing time, which took 26 hours in total according to steam (including re-loads and breaks).Overall.. I used to love the old DM/EOB games and I absolutely love this modern take... And what's even better is that the designers continued to support their creation by giving the modding community a brilliant dungeon editor that allowed those of us with an interest to exert our creative muscles.

												An indie game that made an impact so hard that Ubisoft resurrected Might & Magic title (in the M&M X Legacy), after so many years of oblivion.An old-school dungeon crawler which is a perfect picture of how the progress goes.See, when somebody invents a new mechanic or some better technology, it doesn't mean we should wipe all that was made before. And sometimes older tricks are better than newer ones. Take the chess game as precedent. Or even better example: Horses. We still ride them, but now we don't need to drive them to death to catch up with something. Riding horses today can be educational, emotional, engaging boost of experience. It can even heal some poor hearts, you know.The Elder Scrolls Arena was much like the Grimrock by the mechanics, but eventually we've got Skyrim, which gives a completely another experience than that brilliant of game design we're talking there. The Skyrim can get you on the top of the world... but in the Legend of Grimrock you'll get much more emotions per time spended. And more challenges, both of fighting and exploring nature.Remember Tomb Raider game (2013)? The sequence where Lara found an old bow, and a good notation from Roth? ""You can have the best form and technique in the world, but it won't mean a thing if you can't focus""... Yeah, focus is the best thing that game can teach you about. There are so many hidden buttons, levers and other stuff, so if you're find it all, I'm sure you'll get your boost to perception. That's an education of kind, and we need something like that to experience at least from time to time.Well, do that. Buy the game and make sure you're finish it. It is not that long, but in my book that's a musthave item. My mark 9/10.			"

												Legend of Grimrock is a certain game of twenty years ago, dressed in modern clothes. The recipe for this turned out to be surprisingly simple - leave completely untouched form the core of the game, using new technology only where it is necessary.Legend of Grimrock has almost no plot. Yes, somewhere in the background, we have a story of four convicts who were thrown into perdition to inhabited by monsters and traps bristling labyrinth of dungeons. Throughout accompany us also to be found in various places notes made ​​by a man named Tooruma, who wandered through the corridors and halls before us. At each level during sleep appear ""visions"" with a few sentences. And that's basically all the elements of the story. Interestingly, it was one of the first elements so characteristic of the classic games of this type. At a time when the ""stimulus feature films"" are limited to a minimum, begins to work the imagination. With scraps of information, in an atmosphere of understatement, alone, almost automatically, we are trying to fill these gaps with our own conjectures. It builds sometimes much more evocative atmosphere than most told, ""film"" story. The gameplay is based on three pillars: exploration, solving puzzles and fighting.We move through the corridors and rooms in a classic style. Levels are divided into square segments. One press of the button allows traffic to pass a single field or a reversal in the direction of 90º.By far the biggest asset Legend of Grimrock are puzzles. At each of the thirteen levels we will get at least a few of them. Sometimes, their accumulation can be intimidating. All puzzles rely on the use of several of the same components. We have a mandatory collapse, levers, plates react to the pressure, the buttons in the walls, or portals. An absolute masterpiece of ingenuity is their use.Although there are not too many types of enemies, they are diverse and properly assigned, so only at the end of the game started to be missing ""something new"". I like the fact that most of them require the use of appropriate tactics. Additionally, this old-fashioned and a bit clunky combat system perfectly conceals imperfections SI, which knows only two tactics: to follow and the encirclement. Moreover, developers have used these qualities even several times in riddles. I must commend graphic design, but here also I have a few objections. It's basically the only ""modern"" element of Legend of Grimrock but it is used quite well. Textures, dynamic lighting, models of opponents and their animations look great.Legend of Grimrock is a damn successful - I would say that close to perfection - back to the already-forgotten genre. Thought even the most hardcore enthusiasts oldschool and implemented the option to disable the automatic drawing of the map. For players remember the ""good old days"" and exchanging hand-trended on a piece of checkered maps, is a wonderful gift.			"

												I love playing ""Legends of Grimrock"".  The game is a first-person, real time RPG with an interesting twist - you actually play four different characters!  The story begins with your group being tossed into Mount Grimrock.  Instead of dying instantly from the fall, you find yourselves at the top floor of a strange building.  You must move down floor by floor, fighting monsters, finding treasures, searching for secrets, and most of all, surviving.The game balances storytelling and action, as you find notes from someone who previously made this journey.  The notes provide invaluable hints to solving puzzles relevant to the main quest line.  And they also help with side quests, such as finding the Sword of Nex to complete the Fighter's Challenge (neither one necessary to finish the game).  I recommend this game to anyone who loves RPGs and solving puzzles.			"

												I have never played a game like this before and as my very first try at a first person dungeon crawler, I have to say this was a great experience. It might be newer and easier compared to the old ones, but this was a very good take on an old genre that is pretty much dead these days. The RPG elements are fairly light, but they definitely work and it was enjoyable to kill things and level up while finding new and better gear. The puzzles were great and generally enjoyable...mostly logic puzzles with some small hints. The vast majority of them made sense instead them being seemingly random like puzzles in some games.The entire environment is all tile-based, but looked very good. A few levels would look like mossy rocks and then a few floors down they would nice, clean stonewalls, while deeper down it would be even more different. The lighting is awesome as well. It definitely set the mood for this game. The music was decent, but nothing to write home about - mostly ambient stuff. The story wasn't bad, but it wasn't super in-depth either. It was decent enough to make you want to continue your journey though.I would have never played this game had it not been for a certain youtuber that showed me how awesome this game was. They ended up not finishing the game, but I'm very glad I finally finished it myself and I hope they do at some point as well. You know who you are!			"

												Fans of old school CRPGs like Dungeon Master and the original Wizardry series will get their money's worth out of Legend of Grimrock. Traps, puzzles, hidden caches of treasure, resource management, multiple character team... it's all here. Challenging and unforgiving, Legend of Grimrock will teach you early to tread cautiously and save often. The game includes a dungeon editor and built-in mod support, and the LoG player community is truly incredible.			"

												I had played this game for a bit in the past, less then a few minutes because I could never figure out how combat worked and would always get killed off from the snail. Then the other night I started it up again and tried playing once more not expecting to get far or play to long. However I found myself playing for over an hour and was able to figure out what I couldn't before, so here is my review on a very awesome game.The Legend of Grimrock, a game I bought on Steam a couple years ago during the 2012 summer sale event made by Almost Human Games[www.grimrock.net]. The game is an old school RPG that is not turn based but live action. In other words you are able to move, cast spells, select items from your inventory and rest without waiting for creatures to take their turn. As your trying to get your spell cast or looking for a throwing item in your inventory the creature will be attacking you and won't sit there and wait till your done.I really found this game to have that pen and paper D&D feel to it and I like the idea of selecting the option to not have the game do the mapping as I explore and then I can map it out with graph paper and a pencil (I didn't do this of course). The character creation screen is very simple with 4 races and 3 classes to choose from.  The inventory and character screen isn't complex or confusing but very intuitive and easy to figure out and understand.The spell's though are based on symbols and you have to select the right symbols or combination of to cast the spell. I found that you couldn't get the spell unless you found the scroll for the right spell but this could have been because I wasn't selecting the right symbol until I found the scroll.When venturing through the dungeon your characters will get hungry and there will be a symbol of food in there avatar picture indicating they need to eat. When you kill of creatures they will sometimes leave a meat chunk behind and you will want to get these to eat along with any food things you find along the way.During combat along the way some of your party member may die, take heart because they are not gone for good. You will be able to access their inventory while dead to. There will be these big blue floating crystals that when touched will restore your party to full health and energy and raid the dead. Remember where these ones are. Once they are used you will have to wait for a bit till it can be clicked on again.Now as for combat, where I originally had most of my troubles. To attack all you need simply do is right click on your hand under your avatar (wither their is a weapon in it or not). If your a spell caster you will want to keep at least one hand empty for right clicking to bring up the symbol window for spell casting.When you left click on a throwing weapon it will be attached to your mouse cursor and if you click with it again with your mouse pointer above the midline of the screen (the top half of the window) then it will be thrown. If you click below the midline (bottom half of the screen) then it get dropped on the floor. This is a keyboard and mouse type game and no controller support. Now that I have been able to find out something about the game and how combat works, along with the abilities to make your own dungeon's and storyline and the Steam Workshop to try some community based dungeons, The Legend of Grimrock is one game to have in your collection. Its worth a play!I give this game:ːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː			"

												Legend of Grimrock is a modern looking version of the old dungeon crawling genre.What is dungeon crawling? You might ask, well a dungeon crawler is a first person game where you play as an adventurer, or usually a party of adventurers that delve into dungeons, level up and complete quests, what makes dungeon crawlers so much different from modern RPG's  is that dungeon crawlers often use complex puzzles in their level design, making it more of a puzzle game than a grindfest.The game starts you off with a standard party of four characters that work well together, but you can create your own party of course!The characters you play are outcast by society and have to fight for their lives to have their crimes abolished on the mountain of Grimrock.The game looks simply gorgeous for a game in it's genre, even on my terrible terrible laptop it runs very smooth at the maximum graphical settings.The combat system is a bit like the old Final Fantasy/Chrono Trigger combat system mixed in with the Dungeon Master/Shin Megami Tensei combat, you can move about freely in a grid of squares, while your attacks aren't turnbased, they just have cooldowns.The challenge this game holds is above average, don't expect to blaze through it on your first playthrough, nonetheless it's a great game overall!The puzzles don't let you get stuck for a long time, they're quite clear about what needs to be done, which is a good thing in my opinion.I could whole-heartedly recommend you this title if you want to play a casual game with a decent bit of challenge, especially when it's on sale, then it's definately worth the money.If you're on the fence about this game, I'd say go and buy it, if you weren't interested before, this probably isn't your type of game, and I'd recommend you watching a let's play.

												Legend of Grimrock is an old-school dungeon crawling game which is inspired by games like Dungeon Master oder Eye of the Beholder.The game tells a story of four criminals whose crimes are forgotten by getting tossed into the maw of mount Grimrock. A massive mountain which holds a huge dungeon of untold horrors. No one has ever managed to escape this atrocity. No one but, well you might guessed it, you !You are in control of the four criminals. You can either chose a preset of four ready-to-go characters or create your own party. Once you are in the Dungeon your job is to find a way out. You can move your party from tile to tile and can only perform 90° turns to the left or right. This sounds quite simple and to many quite boring, but Legend of Grimrock does a fantastic job of keeping things fresh and interesting. As you progress through the dungeon you have to solve puzzles which become increasingly harder and sometimes force you to think in unconventional ways. But they are never unfair and can be solved with a decent amount of thinking and experimenting. The puzzles are the highlights of the game which are quite rewarding in most cases and keep you motivated as you progress deeper into the dungeon.The combat system is rather simple but still challenging. As already mentioned you control four characters which are always standing on the same tile. On the bottom right of the screen you got the avatars of you characters which are also used to control you characters. If you left-click on a equipped melee weapon you will perform an attack with this weapon. The twist about this system is that the upper row of your characters represent the front row on the tile you are standing. Characters in the back row cant hit targets with melee weapons / attacks (with a few exceptions). So you are forced to build a solid mix of beefy warriors / melee characters that stand in front and weaker but also very useful range characters that stand in the back and cast spells or use throwing weapons or other types of ranged attacks. If you have a mage in your party things really become interesting. The spell-system requires you to combine several runes in order to sucessfully cast a spell. And you have to do this during the fight in real time. So things can get a bit stressful if you fight off several enemies because you still want to use your other characters. There are no shortcuts you could use. You have to memorize the runes and the combinations to put your mage to use. To some of you this might sound disappealing but if you get the hang of it, it feels really great.Technically the developers have done a great job. Some light effects in Legend of Grimrock are really great to look at, the textures are very sharp, the animations of enemies are great and fluid.One of the downsides of this game is that it may lack a bit of variation. There are only 3 different looks in the dungeon. Some of you might think that this it no problem because a dungeon is a dungeon but even in that particular scenario you could do more than three different types of wall textures.All in All Legend of Grimrock is a great expierence if you like solving challenging but rewarding puzzles and if you love exploration because you get to explore a lot. There are a lot of secrets to uncover in this vast dungeon.			"

												This game is great for two reasons:1 - This is just a VERY good old-school dungeon crawler with high difficulty level, difficult puzzles and many, many secrets.2 - This game showed other developers that true old-school game still may be the best seller. Almost Human Games - thank you for that.VERDICT:If you're a fan of modern cRPG and want to see how all of that had started, you should play it.If you're a fan of Dungeon Master or Eye of The Beholder, I'm sure you already finished this and you know how good that is.Like this review?

												This game just rocks. I never played this kind of game before, so I can't say it's an old-school experience for me, but I can see what they mean.There are no auto generated dungeonsThe loot is carefully placed and hand selectedThe fights involve you being skilled with you directional movementThere are no shops or farms or anything, when you can't carry stuff anymore you have to discard something, so keep you inventory organized. Every item countsThere are secrets all over the place and it is actually rewarding to find themAmmo is scare, I found a total of 22 arrows and bolts in my play through, if you waste them, your problem (you can collect them from dead enemies)There is no auto-aim or anything like that - you need to run, choose your direction, click on specific runes and hit your weapons all that the same time! oh and noticed that hole in the floor, whaaaaaaaaaEverything is wrapped in really awesome graphic packageSo if you like a game that challenges you, that makes you think and explore. Get this one now!			"

												Want that classic dungeon crawling experience? This game is for you!4 characters each of them can be taliored to your whims or randomly selected. And you are tasked to escape your fate at Mount Grimrock.This game has everything a dungeon diving game as to offer. Secrets around almost every corner. That need and desire to explore every inch of the level you are on before proceeding. And if that wasn't enough you must maintain your character through feeding them and making sure they are level proper or else run the risk of losing them.Another plus to this game is that it has it's own modding community, which in my opinion are really talented. Thanks to the dungeon editor you can create, and craft your very own ""dungeon diving"" experience, and judging by some of the mods on the Workshop. You are going to have a fun experience.I recommend this game.			"

												A genuinely fantastic game that succeeds at everything it tries to do.The gameplay is great; the fighting mechanics are extremely simple, but the fights do present good challenge once you get into it. The atmosphere is fantastic, it feels exactly like going through a dungeon should be: dark, secluded, and frightening. Some of the puzzles are creative and fun to get through, although sometimes they like to replace puzzles with the ""find the tiny hidden button game!"" (< and that's really my only legitimate complaint about the whole game). They also do a good job keeping the dungeon from feeling too same-y. Although it is just one big dungeon, and it really feels like one big dungeon, you slowly learn more about the area you are exploring and the place gets more and more like a fortress the deeper you go. So there is a very solid sense of progression, even if you don't have any idea where you're going or even what you're going there for, which really adds to the overal mystery in that fantastic atmosphere I told you about earlier.If you want to play a game for action, this may not be the game for you. But dammit, if you just want to go through an atmospheric rpg dungeon adventure there is legitimately no better game for you.			"

												Playing this with the sequel in mind, it's a much simpler, more confined experience, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Where the sequel is much more open and encourages exploration, this one's more about overcoming the dungeon before you, going deeper and deeper, floor by floor, as challenges and rewards alike escalate. You won't get lost, but you'll find plenty of secrets if you poke around a little. It's shorter, but there's much less time spent wandering. Played without the sequel in mind, this is God's gift to dungeon-crawl fans, taking all the old-school things you enjoyed and decorating them in modern graphics and sound. It's not as hard, even on hard, as those older games, but it captures the spirit of them perfectly with solid mechanics and atmosphere. It's a fantastic adventure, even if the final act is a bit of a letdown, and well worth playing even if you've already played the fancier second game.			"

												A great start for this indie team and the best of luck with Grimrock 2.  The game itself harkens back to the old dungeon crawlers,  for me the memory of the dungeon aspect in Dungeons & Dragons: Warriors of the eternal sun,  where you get or create a set group of characters and trudge about solving puzzles, unearthing secrets and battling the minions in the pit that were thrown into.A beautiful game a little finicky on the magic caster but a great look back at the old square based movement era.Highly recommend.

												I'm the biggest fan you will ever meet of tile-based rpgs.  Lands of Lore!  Eye of the Beholder!  YES!!  I've been playing Xeen since '92.Why doesn't someone make a game like that again?!!  No seriously, let me know if you see one, because that's what this game seems to be going for but it sadly misses the mark.  I would be more forgiving and I would even give this game a positive except that the mis-steps they took are downright bewildering.First what do I love about this title...It really is incredibly challenging.  The puzzles, battles, and resource management is unforgiving which is a nice throwback to the ""good old days"".  I love that they took that risk here, because usually it makes the difference between a grind and compelling, rewarding gameplay.  Grimrock is a nice reminder of the days when games weren't all just an endurance contest, and not everyone could beat every game given enough time.The first thing you'll notice is that this game is fun. Actually, really fun.  You can jump right in without any help and start adventuring.  The puzzles feel like first-person zelda and the written ""clues"" are a great homage to the first-generation of PC rpg titles.  I love the creepy dream sequences, and the customizable party pics are a great touch that is long overdue.  The biggest issue this game struggles with slowly becomes apparent with the combat system.  There is a gaping hole in what should be simple mechanics and functionality of the UI and especially combat.  The spellcasting system is pretty original, but the act of casting like other actions just doesn't jive with ""real-time"" battle.  Every battle quickly devolves into a scramble to CLICK ALL THE THINGS and it often leaves the player feeling cheated when things go wrong, especially considering how clunky the menus can be.  The frenzy of battle becomes a tedium of switching gear, passing potions around, and constantly equipping new projectiles.  There are no hot keys, you pretty much have to rely on the mouse for everything.  The cerebral aspects of the game (puzzles, carefully managing resources, distributing skill points) is lost every time you encounter an enemy, because battle feels too much like a chore rather than fun.  To excel in this combat system you have to play a perpetual game of hopscotch with your enemies as you desperately try to click the next action square that lights up at the right time.  In addition, the characters here can't seem to hit the broad side of a barn.   Had this game incorporated turn-based combat or at least an option for it, this game still wouldn't be a home run but this would be a positive review. I love that these devs dusted off an sadly neglected style of RPG, but other than a nice facelift there's not much else to see here.  I respect the risks they took here but the potential here is tragically lost in the tedium of the clunky and frenzied comat system and a general lack of polish.  You get 4 party members and there are 3 classes.  Scarce resources is one thing I respect, but for an RPG the equipment is so scarce that your characters are still half-naked 8 hours into the game.Thrown weapons, torches, and food all need to be perpetually ""maintained"", and inventory management becomes a chore.There seem to be no status icons, save for ""over-encumbered"", which doesn't even seem to function properly as the numbers don't make sense.  Maybe as part of the homage to old games they decided to add a dash of ""WTF"" just for good measure I don't know what else to chalk some of this up to.There's something here for those of us who remember this classic style, but this just feels like a poorly designed RPG reluctantly wedged into a brilliant dungeon puzzler.  Maybe it would be great on a tablet for poop breaks, but as a PC title it feels half-baked.  I haven't played the sequel yet but I'm hopeful that they learned some things from this release and improved on what is an intriguing foundation here.  I'm not giving up on this series.  Don't get me wrong, despite the mis-steps there really is a lot of potential here.I give it 2 out of 4 skeleton archers, with skeleton-shaped shadow lurking in the corner chattering ""tuuuuurn-BASED!!"" and another chattering  ""statusssss iconssssss...master warp portalsssssss between levels...one or two more classsesss......chchchchchchchhc""			"

												Now this is a real dungeon crawl. Getting past traps, monsters and locked doors to the stairs is the whole game. Story, Cut scenes and character motivation are all minimal. Heck the textures, loot and sound effects are minimal too. Some may be bothered by that, But I wasn't. I couldn't resist ""old school mode"",  Break out the graph paper and DIY, Even for the first time out. Doing so, Mapping became the central focus of the game. The ambiance of the dungeon also became more pronounced as you don't want to get caught with a pencil in your hand and not a sword. I've played the old Wizardry and Bard's Tales and have always enjoyed the act of mapping. And I enjoyed it here as well.Combat is real-time. So click on your weapon to attack or click on your hands to ready a spell, then select the rune pattern of the spell and then cast the spell. That's a lot to do for a mage, But then again, Casting spells should be more involved than swinging a sword. Turn-based would have been more “old school”, But may have lessened the importance of the ambiance as a result. The “Prepare, Attack, Move, Repeat” pattern is acceptable.I found less than 50 secrets. I didn't try that hard as such things have never been a strong motivator for me in-and-of themselves. Getting through the dungeon had some tough spots. The worst of which was having to redraw a badly drawn map followed by some investigation/experimentation. The best of which was being thrown in a room full of nasties with my escape route closed off. Only option...run deeper into the dungeon. But you don't have time to map when your frantically running away. For my party I decided to go sub-optimal and let a RNG choose my races, classes, initial attribute point allocations, traits (I did select a couple of racial traits myself) and pictures. I got 2 Minotaurs (A fighter and a mage) and 2 Insectoids (Both mages). Happily they all made it out alive. I'd be interested in taking another group of random criminals into the mountain.			"

												If you're below a certain age (around 25-30) you may be wondering why this game is in a tile format; why you can't just walk around freely in any direction like in Skyrim, for example. It's because this game is a modern take on old dungeon crawler games from the 80's and early 90's. They were made like this because of technological limitations but in my opinion they work just as well today as they did then and Legend of Grimrock captures the feel of that perfectly. You are 4 prisoners who have been accused of unknown crimes and tossed in to the dungeons of a mountain. As you were thrown in your crimes were absolved and if you can make it through the maze of tunnels, monsters and puzzles and come out the other side in one piece your crimes will be forgotten.You can choose from 4 races (human, minotaur, lizard or insectoid) and each has certain differences that make them unique. Minotaur are very aggressive and strong and so make great fighters, for example. There are also 3 classes to choose from: warrior, rogue and mage. As you level up you can further customize your characters by spending skill points, so as a mage you can choose to focus on fire magic and become very proficient in that, or you can spread your points out evenly and be good at all schools of magic. Similarly with a rogue you can choose between missile weapons, throwing weapons or fast melee weapons/backstabs with daggers and the like.The puzzles and monsters start off easy but get harder as the game progresses - all the clues to solve them are there though in the form of cryptic messages written on walls and notes left by other prisoners who have tried to escape before you. Each level has secret rooms that can usually be found by pushing a ""button"" - a loose rock hidden in a wall somewhere. They're not too difficult to find but you do have to keep your eyes open.I love this game and it reminds me of the good old days of classic dungeon crawlers like Eye of the Beholder. If I was forced to say something negative about it (which I guess I am because this is a review) then it would be that some enemies are quite easy to defeat by hitting them and then sidestepping before they can hit you - though this is actually a valid tactic in games these. Even so, a mistake can get you killed, for example if you allow yourself to be cornered a troll - it'll wear your hit points down fast because they hit like a train. You need to give yourself room to manouver.I'd give it a 4/5. It's one of the best quality indie games you'll ever find, it is completely bug-free and it isn't a DLC/microtransaction cash grab like so many games are today. You buy the game, you get the full game. If you're tempted to try a Grimrock game I'd definitely try this one first. It's cheaper (because it's older) then the second one and if you like this then you'll definitely like the second one too, and if you don't then you won't like the second one.			"

												I underestimated this game when it came out, but now I have to admit that playing Legend of Grimrock was an amazing experience. This is the first game in 15years that got me stuck on puzzles, it reminded me of the time when puzzle games where among the most played, and well made, games. For those of you who played games like ""Eye of the Beholder"", Legend of Grimrock will probably hit you in the feelings like a 1/2 ton truck.***GAMEPLAY 9/10The gameplay is really simple, you move as if you're on a grid one step at time (up,down,left,right and rotate 90° L or R)You have 4 characters that move together in a square formation, so you have 2 on front and 2 at the back, note that this also mean that you have 2 on the left and 2 on the right, which might seem obvious, but will become a problem if you get sandwiched between monsters. The combat mechanic is simple, but challenging. Your front row can attack any monster with any weapon, the back row can only attack monsters with ranged/missile weapons, or with spells. You can only attack monsters that are facing you, but monsters can sneak on you and easily kill your back row, so beware of how you move when fighting more than one enemy.When you are not killing enemies, you're probably trying to solve puzzles. This is the core of the game : how to reach the end of the dungeon. Your wits will be challenged, sometimes lightly, sometimes harder, sometimes you'll find the solution to a hard puzzle in no time and some other times you'll feel the king of all dumbs by realizing you had the solution under your nose for 1 hour, but you didn't see it... true story.Why 9/10? I need to write this down. I'd normally give 8, game controls are good, game is challenging but not impossible, however, this +1 bonus comes from the fact that Legend of Grimrock resurrected the dungeon crawler mechanics that was abandoned long time ago. It demonstrates that old school can still kick asses. ***STORY 7/10Story is almost a MacGuffin, it's there just to set things in motion and to give you a purpose. You're thrown into this prison/dungeon to die, but some weird voice in your dreams tells you that you can escape if you reach the lowest level... and so it begins. While descending the levels you'll find some scrolls that give you information about Mount Grimrock, which add a bit of lore to the game. When you finally reach the lowest level ... well, you'll see. I enjoyed every single bit of the story, even though it's really simple.  ***GRAPHICS 7/10Graphic isn't great, but it's good enough. A bit more variety for what concerns the levels wouldn't have hurt, but I admit it's not necessary. I mean, Mount Grimrock is a prison and a prison isn't supposed to be about beautiful hallways and rooms, so it doesn't feel weird roaming 4 levels that look the same. No glitches whatsoever.***SOUND 7/10Game is almost silent, music is just a feeble echo in the background. The monsters grunts and steps are what you'll hear most of the time. When you play at harder difficulties it creates an effect on the player, hearing wierd noises behind walls and corner almost make you fear for the lives of your characters.3) TL;DROverall score 7.5/10 Legend of Grimrock resurrects the dungeon crawler genre. If you are old enough to have played this kind of games before, you should buy this game, and even if you weren't old enough, and puzzle game are your thing, you won't get disappointed.			"

												Takes all the good elements from old-school dungeon crawlers like Dungeon Master and executes them perfectly. The UI and general handling of the game is that intuitively that you know everything you need to know after the first minutes into the game. And the developers didn't make any major changes to the retro mechanics, but they polished them. Like you walk over a previous thrown distance weapon and it will be auto-equipped into the corresponding slot. I love such details.Only tiny thing I'd wish for is a hotkey to toggle secondary weapons, because in the heat of the battle it's rather annoying to switch to a distance weapon (currently they are basically spamming my inventory).If you like this genre this game is a must.

												Simplesmente estupendo. Há muito tempo um jogo não me prendia como LoG prendeu. Puzzles inteligentes, marcantes e bem construidos. Claro que deixei inúmeros segredos e passagens para trás, mas o que descobri enquanto estive pelos subterrâneos do Monte Grimrock me satisfez. E muito.Não vi falhas. Não vi bugs. Mas vi um grupo de devsenvolvedores com potencial para um futuro brilhante e o mais importante: que conhecem profundamente como criar ambientes desafiadores sem focar apenas nas capacidades físicas do jogador (mover ou apertar o mouse mais rápido do que a máquina requer). Souberam, de forma peculiar, exercitar o meu intelecto e capacidade cognitiva.			"

												Right off the bat im going to say that this game isn't for everyone.  You're definately going to have to be nostalgic about first person dungeon crawlers from the 90's to really enjoy this game.  That being said this game is fantastic.  The difficulty curve is great, the games starts out with easy battles and simple puzzles and builds in difficulty throughout the entire game to nerve wracking battles and extremely challenging puzzles.  The visuals are outstanding, but the same stone walled environments get really repetitive and boring after awhile.  The base game netted me around 20 hours of play, with steam workshop included though this game keeps you updated with plenty of fresh user created content.  If you love games like Dungeon Master and Might and Magic than definately pick this game up during the next steam sale.			"

												I'll keep this short. The game is fun and challenging. Combat needs some work, most of it you can cheese pretty easily. The majority of the challenge comes in puzzles--not combat. One puzzle is ridiculous, and could be a show stopper for anyone that doesn't hoard inventory items. The story was interesting, that is, right up until the end. Great atmosphere.			"

Dungeon crawler with grid-based movement & maps where progression requires a lot of attention to detail and figuring out cryptic messages, which tends to get very difficult along the way. Very enjoyable though the classes and races seem to be highly unbalanced for a single player RPG. For example the mage class seems to be pretty weak for the long run since there isn't enough mage-friendly armor around and there isn't much in the game to help them defend themselves.			"

												Wow.This is a WOW game.This game doesn't have cutting edge graphics, the audio is slightly better than average, and the genre is as old as, what, the 1980s?This game isn't great because of some stupid parlor trick. It's good because it's a near-perfect implementation of a specific class of game; the old PC dungeon crawler.If you love finding secret wall switches, solving puzzles and finding loot, and eating a giant roasted maggot-on-a-stick because you're desperate to eat, then this is the game for you.If you want a fantasy FPS with lots of jumping and airducking, this isn't for you, GTFO.Legend of Grimrock doesn't try and improve much on the old classic dungeon crawler game design, I think that works well for it, and I don't think they do anything really new or crazy that hasn't been done in dungeon crawlers before. They just put modern graphics and sound together into a game and implemented it well.The game doesn't have any music beyond the title screen, but the ambient background through the game is pleasant and detailed. Turn the volume up, because sounds of the dungeon will alert you to nearby foul beasts and secrets.The background story is compelling and interesting, but nothing too deep. Secrets are found in the dungeon, and a reason for being is evident, but they leave the details up to your imagination, which is probably for the best. You can't climb back up. Your only way out is down. The story is your journey along the way.The last few levels are spooky and the game has a very fulfilling final battle.Secrets are plentiful, so pay attention. There were a couple of puzzles which had me really baffled, including two that were required to proceed with the story. I don't recomend ruining the challenge for yourself by reading a walkthrough online, but if you get stuck in the story, it's there for you. The best thing to do is sit and think. With two specific exceptions that I can mention, most of the puzzles are evident if you just use your brain for more than thirty seconds.I do have a complaint regarding the final puzzle in the game (Minor spoiler warning): There are four items which need to be placed around a single block in a room. Two of them are pretty easy to figure out, but the small gear in particular has a non-obvious arbitrary placement location which should be fixed. Even if you have the right item on the right wall, you have to click it on a very specific small area that doesn't offer any clue that it's the right part to go in the right place.Also, the level 9 riddle room had me really stuck for awhile. I just didn't get the clues and had to randomly guess at it until I figured it out.			"

												A lot of people who were PC gamers in the late 80s and early 90s have fond memories of dungeon crawlers like Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder. This game perfectly reboots the rustic subgenre that many veteran gamers remember all on a modern engine with many of the familiar quirks. Throughout the entirety of the game, you’ll be descending downward into the unknown with a party of four to solve puzzles that become increasingly complex and fight a variety of enemies. Opening the iron doors on each level and finding secrets is also critical if you want to find good gear.  If you're looking for a dungeon crawler RPG that will send you down a nostalgia trip, then you’ve come to the right place. Even as someone who never grew up playing these types of games I can say that my experience with this game has been wonderful. I’d suggest this game to anyone who is looking for a fun dungeon crawling experience that won’t break the bank.			"

												Unlike a lot of others, I wasn't around for the golden age of PC gaming. Back when you had to draw your own maps and read the manuals that came with the game. But when I bought this game a couple summers back, it made me wish I had.This game has revived the dungeon crawling genre. It's fleshed out, interesting, and well done. Graphically pleasing and is one of the few games that has puzzles I enjoy. (They can certainly stump you) It's only flaws are the scenery can get a bit dull and the enemy AI is easily fooled (Only if you have four squares to dodge around. Otherwise, you're ♥♥♥♥ed, dude.) but it's certainly a good purchase if this is your type of game.			"

												This is an excellent game that takes me back to ""Dungeon Master"" and ""Eye of the Beholder"" that were so much fun in days long ago.Like those games, this game has pre-set dungeons that do not change and offer the same sets of mazes, the same puzzles and deceptions, the same monsters, the same rewards, and the same secrets ---- it is up to the player to navigate all of these to the conclusion.The idea, of course, is to escape the dungeon with your four adventurers. Tons of replay value here, and, with the easy gameplay involved, you just might find yourself in this dungeon for a ton of hours.The graphics are great, the puzzles (ranging from simple to completely head scratching) trump the combat aspect, the atmosphere is genuinely spooky, and the story is solid.Anyone looking for an old school dungeon crawler need to visit Grimrock. Very satisfying. Highly recommended.  "

												To start with, I bought this game on the 2016 Steam winter sale. I payed a little over a $1 US for it.. I wish like hell I'd bought the game at full price now. Almost Human, if you're listening, amazing job. I'm sure I'm late to the party thanking you all for a wonderful job well done, but I must say it.When I first saw Legend of Grimrock in the Steam store years ago, I vowed to get it someday and play it, but at the time I was playing Skyrim and thought I had better things to do than play a dungeon crawler. I was wrong and should have taken the opportunity to buy your game. This game keeps with everything I loved about Eye of the Beholder, which I played for what felt like an eternity. I've always wanted something like that game to come along give me another challenge, but Wizards never seemed to care much that there was one guy out here wanting more dungeon crawler games. I'm now done with the main storyline, and moving on to Legend of Grimrock II. I LOVE the dungeon editor for that installment. (Also, massive props to dukester70 for recreating the Tomb of Horrors in the first Grimrock game) I'll stop drooling all over the steam page, but guys, if you haven't played it and love good dungeon crawling, this is the best hands down. Graphics: 10/10, story: 7/10, gameplay: 10/10, replay value: ""Are you kidding me? If I wasn't playing your second game, I'd be playing this now!""/10Another note: I can't get enough of how magic works in this game.I'll shut up now.Buy this game.			"

												I’ve just completed the game in 24 hours and now I feel I should write a review about my experience.*INTRO*First of all, I never thought these games would be my type, and I didn’t even know that it was a ‘tile based’ so when I got into the game I was like ‘oh it’s like this is it?’ but as I brought the game I persevered with it, and actually found myself enjoying it.Also I want to state that I’m not a reviewer so don’t expect some top of the line review, I’m dumb as ♥♥♥♥ and can’t form a sentence properly so please don’t hurt me. :) *PUZZELS*The puzzles weren’t too difficult but as it got towards the end of the game they just became annoying, As in the starts is all about the combat with a few puzzles, but towards the end it just seems to be all puzzles and some of them are really needless, (Spoiler Warning Start) For example when you fight the end boss, you need to go to a portal, which the game never tell you too (I looked up a guide) and this takes you to a place where you get the weapon that can damage the boss, but instead of the game just letting you get the weapon you have to go through 2 puzzles the get 2 keys, they’re easy puzzles but it’s just seems really pointless and tedious, then when you think you have the weapon nooooooo, the game give you a fire elemental to fight which I swear down has 4x more health than the others, then after you defeat that guy there is yet another puzzle which is really cryptic just like 50% of the other puzzles towards the end, this part was just a little rant but I feels like you reading this needs to know. (Spoiler End)RATING: 5/10Fun and no so challenging to begin with but annoying and pointless towards the end at times*COMBAT*The combat I found to be fun but rather difficult and challenging at times, especially towards the end, and I can’t stress that enough, the end 2 levels are really challenging.You will find yourself just kiting enemies and walking around them ‘tactically’ most of the time, but they seem to ‘pre-fire’ there attacks as soon as you move like they know the tile which you’re going to land on, which isn’t a bad thing otherwise you wouldn’t get hit at all.It’s all really well balanced and fun, one of the strong point of the game in my opinion.RATING: 9/10Fun and balanced but not perfect*STORY*(Spoiler Warning I Think)The story in my opinion is well crafted, you’re a prisoner that gets thrown into a dungeon, and sometimes someone will speak to you in your dreams, there are a bunch of scrolls scattered around of the stories of other prisoners, and that’s all there is to say really, there is a surprise at the end :)RATING: 7/10Well crafted, but it’s not in your face so it doesn’t seem like there is one for 70% of the game.*GRAPHICS*I think the Graphics in the game are really good, but im one of the few people that couldn’t care less if a game looks good or not, but what you see in the screenshots is what you get so judge for yourself :) RATING: Judge for yourself/10*MECHANICS*Here I will just go over a few things in the game which I will bullet point-	SleepingThe sleeping is a really neat feature to get your characters health back, you will find yourself sleeping a lot be careful where you’re sleeping is safe as you can get attacked and it WILL scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.-	Magic/SpellcastingIn my opinion this is okay at best, to cast a spell you have to right click the wand and you get 9 tiles of symbols, and you have to click the right combination of symbols to cast a certain spell, and as you can imagine in combat this can be annoying, but there are some useful spells and you find yourself getting faster as casting as the game progresses.-	FoodThere is a ‘survival’ aspect to this game as you have to keep your characters fed, but this really isn’t a problem, as the game throws food at you left right and centre and I never found myself running out, at the end of the game all my characters were full food and I had 2 crates (8x2=16 slots) of food items. There’s probably a few things I’ve missed in this review but I don’t usually review games to this extent unless I feels they deserve it and this one took me by surprise so it does, and also I’m not a reviewer, so if you’ve got this far then thank you for reading, I hope my review helped you decide to buy it or not, if you have bought it and you like it then I hope you enjoy as much as I do :)OVERALL: 8/10 "

												This is definitely an old school style dungeon crawler RPG and I can say that because I was actually gaming back in the 80s. The visuals were nice as well as the sound and music, but the game could be brutally difficult at times. I usually pride myself on not using guides and walkthroughs to solve puzzles in games, but this game caused me to have to do that a few times. I felt like some of the puzzles required you to make such large leaps of deduction that I found myself at times just trying random things, or trying different patterns until I got lucky and opened the door or found the secret. Also, the combat system could be a little off-putting and didn't fit with the theme of the game. Would four party members really do square dancing in a dungeon with an ogre? I beat the game and the story was OK, but even though I try to be a completist, I still left many secrets, treasure, and weapons unfound as I traversed all the levels of the game. Overall, I liked it but I will probably never play it again. It just got to grindy towards the end and I just wanted it to be over.			"

												You approach the peak of Mount Grimrock in shackles. Whatever crimes you have committed, your punishment lies within the dungeons of Mount Grimrock. With the promise of amnesty, if you ever find your way out of the dungeons, you are thrown into the prison maze. Will you find your way out?'Legend of Grimrock' puts you in control of a group of four prisoners aiming to find their way out of an extremely huge dungeon. Naked and helpless you begin your journey. Search for secrets, find clothes, weapons and armours and continuously upgrade the abilities of your party members. Solve countless puzzles to disarm deadly traps and unravel the secret of Mount Grimrock.'Legend of Grimrock' is a wonderful game if you are willing to immerse into it. But it requires a lot of patience and endurance because it's a very difficult game. You can try to move through the dungeon as fast as possible, but you will fail because you constantly need to improve your equipment and abilities in order to beat the many enemies waiting for you in the dark. Since all the stronger weapons and premium armours are hidden in secret chambers, you need to search for them and find a way to access them. This can be tricky and time consuming. But since it's never easy, it's also very rewarding and a very satisfying element of the game.The game allows you to set up your personal party, choosing the race and abilities of your members or you can simply start by using a pre-defined group. As an old-fashioned dungeon crawler you can only move one step at a time in one direction. This feels a little strange at the beginning but offers nice possibilities during fights and feels good once you got used to it. The game is designed to be played with keyboard and mouse. I played the entire game with the Steam Controller, which was very convenient.  Pros:- great atmosphere- nice graphics- addictive- extremely good and varied puzzle design- many different and gradually stronger enemies- mysterious hints gradually reveal the story - rewardingNeutral:- the maze can be maddening at times but at the same time this adds to the claustrophobic moodCons:- difficult- somewhat disappointing end			"

												It's not a terrible game, but it falls short of its predecessors. The Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder series were much better games than this one. Let me list the good and bad  points:-- Good --- The graphics are sharp. Thumbs up in this department.- The monsters actually behave differently depending on their type, giving you the idea that they aren't just sacks of hitpoints charging at you.- A lot of secrets to uncover.- Most levels have a healing crystal that will instantly heal your party and resurrect fallen members.-- Bad --- The magic system is terrible. Both DM and EOB had a rich magic system with a lot of useful spells, both combat and utility. This game has essentially 6 or 7 spells. (There are actually more than this, but in essence a fire arrow spell is the exact same as a lighting/poison/frost arrow, so I am calling it one spell.) Of these, the only real utility spell is a light spell. No healing spells, no create food spells, no detect secrets spells - nothing. This was my #1 biggest complaint with this game.- The puzzles are mostly of the 'hit a switch and race to this location to hit another one' variety. I want puzzles that test my cunning, not my reflexes.- Most of the monsters in the game are about impossible to stand toe-to-toe with. The game relies heavily on the 'attack and sidestep' school of combat. It's wasn't fun in EOB, and it isn't fun here. I understand it for a boss fight, but here it is necessary with most monsters, at least until you are way over their level.- THERE ARE NO HOTKEYS! You have to use your mouse to manually click each party member's weapon in order to attack. Come on guys - even Might and Magic had combat hotkeys! This is annoying with melee attacks, but downright aggravating when it comes to magic. To cast a spell, you have to right-click your wand, select the runes (up to 3), and then click again. Want to cast that spell again? Ok, 5 more clicks coming right up. All this while trying to sidestep and manage 3 other party members' melee attacks.My recommendation is go back and play DM or EOB. They are much better (although uglier) games. "

												LoG has often been presented as a homage or even a remake of Dungeon Master (DM). Its main gameplay strong point is its puzzles. There are a good bunch of them, very evolved and clever. But DM wasn’t really puzzle based. Moreover, the dungeon exploration is a lot more straightforward than DM ; it features a more linear and less mystified progression which requires none or only very little backtracking or roaming (except for 2 or 3 levels) ; the whole progress is made even easier by the auto-map system. And as LoG’s modern 3D engine lets you see more than 3 squares away, you almost never feel lost for the whole game.Another weak point is its combat system. It’s very simple and basically requires you to strafe-turn-strafe-turn non-stop while waiting for your attack cooldowns to reset. Even worse, if you have mages in your party, you have to enter complex rune sequences while you’re strafing & turning. It’s like that for hours till you beat the game. If you don’t strafe & turn around, the monsters will kill you very quickly.Presented like that, it seems to be very close of DM, but actually, DM’s combat was better :- melee weapons actually had 2 or 3 different attacks, so you had to think a bit and try out to find which one was the best in the present situation ; it wasn’t a lot better than LoG, but still it was more evolved and a bit less boring & repetitive over the course of the game- it also required complex rune sequences to cast spells, but as mana was pretty limited, we could cast much less spells, and often had to prepare the spells before the fights, so it was less annoyingAnyway, personally, I think this kind of system is really outdated, and today it’s possible to create more engaging & less repetitive combat systems, either by going in a more arcade direction, or a more tactical one (like Dungeon Guardians ;-) ).Another weak point is the story and its background. There’s not much going on there. But in the dungeon crawler genre, it’s not really penalizing.But there’s a last severe weakness : the ending level(s). Without spoiling much, let’s say it felt out of place, rushed, and not satisfying for the gamer (ie: no real sense of achievement).And still, LoG is a good game (great some people might say if they didn’t get bored by the combats). Mostly because except its puzzles, it has another very strong point : a great atmosphere, brought by a finely mastered artistic direction. So globally, we still get a good adventure in an oppressing dungeon.So in short, that gives :Awesome puzzles, so-so exploration, boring combats, weak ending, impressive visuals & atmosphere.			"

												The Legend  of grimrock is a 3-d dungeon crawler which is hard, rage causing, keyboard breaking fun. Yes i said fun, the game is fun, but when its not fun its frustrating. I like the game alot due to the fact that it reminds me of the game King's Quest, in the fact that most of your time is either puzzle solving or combat. Overall i like the game and i would say buy it for the diffulculty, which is also the reason why i think the game didn't sell as much as it should have made, because now and days people expect easy games like Call of Duty or Minecraft. So try the game out if you want,i can say wether or not you'll like it but hey atleast check it out on Twitch or Youtube......			"

												Legend of Grimrock took me totally by surprise. I bought it expecting some kind of mild distraction that I would drop shortly after picking it up, but even after only a handful of hours, I'm hooked. The gameplay is nearly identical to the dungeon crawlers of yesteryear (Eye of the Beholder, for example). And while I was never a big fan of those types of games, Grimrock is a blast to play. Exploration is entirely tile based, and simple as it may be, the grid-based format allows for some truly interesting map layouts. After the first couple of areas, it becomes quite easy to get lost, but this only adds to the experience. It's refreshing to play a game that doesn't lead you by the nose with quest markers and waypoints. ""Old school"" mode makes navigating the maze-like levels of Grimrock even more compelling by removing the map. The combat, at first glance, is very basic and shallow. However, like the grid-based level design, there is a certain amount of depth to be found in the enemy encounters. Since the game is so reliant on the grid system, navigating around mobs of enemies has a certain strategic feel to it. As the enemies become stronger, it becomes essential to position yourself in such a way that your back row doesn't get hit. This provides a pleasant tactical challenge to Grimrock's combat.Where Grimrock truly shines, though, is in its puzzles. It speaks to the game's elegance, that I, a person that despises games that have puzzles for their own sake, have loved every puzzle and riddle I've come across so far. Consisting of stepping on pressure plates in the right order, pressing switches in the right way, and using certain items on objects in the level, all of Grimrock's puzzles are well-planned and well-implemented. I never encountered a puzzle that I felt like I couldn't figure out. You are always given the necessary information to progress, and the puzzles are never reduced to just random clicking hoping to get lucky. Furthermore, there are tons of hidden switches and mini-puzzles that you can find that unlock hidden treasure stashes or high quality gear. Clever thinking and careful observation are always rewarded by the game.All of this probably sounds familiar to gamers who (unlike myself) are veterans of the old dungeon crawlers, but the presentation of the game makes it much more accessible to younger gamers and strangers to the genre. The graphics, while not mind blowing, are excellent. There is a high level of detail in all the textures. Even the enemy models are well done and interesting to look at. Additionally, the sound design is phenomenal. The ambience includes shuffling monsters, footsteps, and barely audible muttering. Combined with how dark the game is, the ambient sounds create a very creepy and foreboding atmosphere, perfect for the theme of the game. There were even a few times that I got so caught up in the sounds around me, I was startled by a previously undetected monster jumping at me from the edge of the screen.The game isn't perfect (there is no actual music aside from the title theme, the lack of combat animations may seem silly to some, and the distribution of gear is a bit questionable), but all in all, this is a fantastic dungeon crawler that everyone should try.

												Well,I like this game and I don't. It invokes a weird mix of nostalgia and frustration spiced with a bit of 'is this it?'Let me explain: I'm an older player so I grew up with games like wizardry, Eye of the Beholder etc. That's the nostalgia part summed up. I've done it before and liked it.Now for frustration: unless you have the reflexes of a teenager, you are going to reload and reload until, by fluke, you pass the generously sprinkled reflex. I hate this stuff even more than jump puzzles in other games. And now for the spice: here and there you can find a new weapon, armor or spell. But they are few and far between and offer next to nothing but a bit more damage etc. Same goes for spells: there are 20 or so spells in the game and half of those nearly useless. So you spam the same spell to oblivion over and over again. Conclusion: pretty boring and frustrating.			"

												Legend of Grimrock is a great game where you play as a little band of prisoners thrown into the mountain of Grimrock, which contains a prison deep within it's core, from which something is trying to escape.It took me 15 hours to complete the game (there are 13 levels). The game is super fun and engaging. The secrets are really enjoyable to find, and easy to recognise (but impossible to ""expect""). If you enjoy games like Binding of Isaac and Dark Souls, you'll enjoy dungeon crawling through Grimrock. The controls are a little unintuitive, but you get used to them. For this kind of game you need patience in your playstyle. If you don't have it, don't play the game.Thoroughly recommended.-Nilesy			"

												This game was a total surprise back when I played it.I love RPGs and Dungeon games, but never played the old school style ones. This was so refreshing from a gameplay perspective, it was one of the coolest games and played it to bits, did not leave and stones unturned, corners checked etc.From a graphical perspective it's top notch and, along the amazing sound, it create a really intense and immersive atmosphere.The puzzles were quite well done and the exploration part was amazing. You can feel so satisfied when you manage to find a secret switch, which leads to a secret door, which leads to a secret treasure :) The only thing lacking might be the story, which is very strait forward, but still... they did surprise me at the end level.The game kept me playing and wanting to go back until I finished it... and them some, due to fan created levels and possibility to try the game with different classed+increased difficulty (loved the pen&paper map idea).Definitely a must play for all lovers of Dungeon Exploring Fans.

												Legend of Grimrock is a great example of an indie game that finds a niche that bigger devs and publishers have no interest in and does it well. It takes the gameplay of old dungeon crawlers like Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder and puts a nice coat of paint on them. It's surprising how well the idea holds up with only a few little quality of life improvements.Of course, Grimrock isn't for everybody. Most people are probably going to find it a little tedious to slog through same looking hallways while having to save scum in case a monster closet opens up on them.The tile based movement and ""click on a character portrait"" combat is less than smooth, but if you're the kind of person who likes Resident Evil with tank controls than you probably understand how restrictive design can be a good thing sometimes. It creates a frantic combat atmosphere as you try to coordinate moving around with attacking while setting up rune combinations to cast spells.For a certain kind of person, there's something engrossing about wandering lonely, abandonded hallways, solving puzzles and finding secret treasures. There's no soundtrack here, just the moan of an empty dungeon and the occasional skittering of an enemy that might be safely locked away or just around the corner waiting to pop out at you. There are no loot drops, if you want better weapons and armor you better make sure your puzzle solving is up to snuff as everything needs to be earned and a lot of things are squirreled away pretty deviously. Generally the game is pretty fair and you can get through with a minimum number of secrets found (I discovered a little over half) one puzzle that required backtracking for specific items that you might not think important to carry was annoying, but most puzzles that you need to solve to progress won't make you tear your hair out.If you're interested it may be better to jump to Grimrock II, which I've heard improves a lot on the formula here, but on its own this is still a solid game and a unique experience if you're not familiar with this style of game.

												I was a huge fan of Dungeon Hack by Dream Forge when I was a kid. My brother and I used to create our own custom character and then play through the randomly generated levels and die at some point misserablely before we could reach the bottom. I believe grid based strategy and level design was lost with 3D, MMORPG, open world games, FPS, etc.My bro sent this to me for Christmas a few years back. I had a ton of fun playing through this and finally beating it. I bought Legend of Grimrock 2 when it was released.  The puzzles are probably the best part of the game, but the level progression and character customization is a huge bonus.I highly recommend this game! Plus, it doesn't have those Illustionary Walls that were killer back in 1993. :)			"

												Well, I must say, this is much, much better than all that Skyrim ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Old-school dungeon-grinding, with a bit of new-school twist.    For the record, I haven't played many games like this in, well, almost DECADES...so just to clarify, I'm not really up with what the dungeon-delving kids are into these days, bar the aforementioned Elder Scrolls nonsense and the very, very excellent Darkest Dungeon.  I am pleased to note, however, that this is more than a mere ""dungeon hack""...there's lots of puzzles and traps, and interesting and strategic ways to fight and handle monsters, so it's already ten times more intelligent than, say, a Borderlands game (not that that's any great feat, but bear with me).      In case you're wondering how it all works, your party moves through the dungeon in a limited version of a first person perspective (you can only move forward, left, right, and back; then turn to face in a different direction, ninety degrees at a time) and the combat is half-way between a turn-based approach and a more real-time urgency.   What this all adds up to, best as I can tell, is a bit of a best-of-both-worlds approach to dungeoneering: That is to say, it's not TOO much of a game of reflexes and/or hand-eye coordination, but still has more moment-to-moment suspense and atmosphere than one could muster with a strictly turn-based situation.     It also offers a nice middle ground between so-called ""casual"" gaming and something a bit more involved, not to mention a decent compromise between ""lighter"" fantasy elements and something a teensy weensy bit ""darker""...so if it's a game with that kind of balance you're looking for, then by all means, step inside.     Me personally, I was in the market for a bit of a nostalgic dungeon crawl with some slightly spiffier, more modern graphics, and that's precisely what I got; so for the price of three bucks (on severe sale) I was well-chuffed.  In all honesty, though, it's probably worth the full asking price even if you play it through just the once - it's certainly LONG enough! - and it furthermore has a fair dose of replayability, thanks to customisable characters and multiple difficulty levels and so forth.  It's far from the Second Coming, and gets awfully grind-y at times, but it's pretty darn good for what it is.  Know what you're signing up for, and chances are you won't be disappointed. Verdict: 8.5/10.			"

												LoG is based off the old school RPG’s from early PC days and I think there may have even been a few on consoles. I never played much in this FPS style when I was younger but that doesn’t take away how much fun this game was to play. You have a team of 4 characters and move through a grid based dungeon you were locked up in. You can create your characters with a variety of classes, powers, and skills to whatever playstyle fits you best. There are many floors to travel through and many secrets to find on the way. There are plenty of great challenging puzzles and enemies to keep you occupied for a good time.There is also plenty of replay value with different difficulties and even an old-school mode where you lose the AutoMap and you can pull out some grid paper and make your own. Then there is also the added Steam Workshop where you can install mods to give you more challenges and fun to last you a long time.The game is fantastic looking with some cool character design and great sound to go along with it. Going through the tunnels when your torch is flickering out and you can hear the skittering of an enemy somewhere nearby made for some cool moments in the game. I played through on easy mode as I’m new to this style of RPG and figured I could get the hang of it better. It was still a decent challenge and enjoyable for me. I would highly recommend Legend of Grimrock if you like the old-school RPGs or even just want to play a well-made fantastic game. This is Almost Human’s first game and you can tell they put a lot of love into it and it was only a 4 man team too. Don’t pass this game up.			"

												Legend of Grimrock aims to give players an old school dungeon crawl experience which harkens back the old Dungeon Master games, and it does an admirable job doing that. . Legend of Grimrock is a faithful addition to the genre, yet gives it a modern level of accessibility. This is a great dungeon crawler for new players to get introduced to the genre as well as for veterans to relive the nostalgic goodness of the old dungeon crawlers.All the ingredients that made Dungeon Master so great are here. The game has a simplistic presentation on the surface, but with a fairly deep level of gameplay underneath. The party begins with nothing, and the player must explore the dungeon and find items that will help the party survive including weapons, armor, and even food. Everything takes place in real time where the player must click each party member’s action buttons for the party members to attack with either melee, ranged, or magic attacks. Starving characters take severe penalties on their ability to fight, and the food meter is always ticking. This gives some level of urgency to find food to keep your party effective throughout the game. The player can make the game as difficult as desired by options like increasing the power of monsters (mobs), turning on ironman mode, or even turning off auto-mapping and bringing out the graph paper (now that’s old school!).Besides combat with the horde of mobs crawling around the multilevel dungeon, players will be engaged with the many puzzles obscuring the player from progression further into the dungeon or from finding the many secrets that the dungeon holds. The game does a decent job of rewarding the player for problem solving. There is always some hidden room or passage that may hold a useful item that will help the player. Item distribution and progression is somewhat flawed, though. You’ll often come across items that are obsolete the moment you find them because you found something much better already.There are three classes to choose from (fighter, rogue, and mage). Each class has a unique set of skills that the player can spend skill points on to develop the characters. You can come up with some interesting builds that suit your playstyle. You can have characters specialize in certain melee weapons or ranged weapons, you can have characters play more defensive with skills such as armor and dodge, or you can also have characters specialize in unarmed combat for some “kung fu” action. The magic system may feel somewhat clumsy at first and takes some getting used to. It is faithful to an old school feel, though, and an interesting system that gets away from a mundane menu system that is typical of spell systems. There may be some balance issues that make some attributes and skills more desirable than others, but just about any build you can think of is viable enough to complete the game.The visuals are what you’d expect from a dungeon crawler made in 2012. The ambient sounds, with the footsteps and growl of mobs on the other side of doors, walls, or around corners, create a spooky and claustrophobic atmosphere. It does a good job of immersing you in the dungeon and keeping an eye over your shoulder to make sure you’re not being creeped up on by anything.This is a cool game that I highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of dungeon crawlers and especially the old Dungeon Master series. This is also a good introduction to dungeon crawlers for those new to them. Get this game.A Warning to those who suffer from Arachnidphobia. The spiders in this game are creepy as hell.			"

												Grimrock plays like Eye of the Beholder with better graphics and actual depth of field. If you liked EotB, that's a good thing. If you hated it (or have no idea what EotB even is), this game is PROBABLY not for you. It doesn't feel like a modern game. It feels like an upscaled version of a game from the DOS era. The puzzles are vague and cryptic, there are no ""directional arrows"" pointing you where to go, very few map notations, you have to memorize (or write down) spells and recipes, and your supply of... everything is limited. If you do stupid things, you will die. The good stuff in the game is obvious (and I've mentioned some of it). There's challenging puzzles, the ambient noises are useful (you'll want good, bi-aural headphones), the classes/builds allow for enough flexibility to build the way you want, the magic system is great, the tileset is pretty, and the controls are sharp. Combat actually feels dangerous, and requires you to be aware of your surroundings at all times. It's exactly what you would expect from a well-reviewed game in the same format as EotB. I really enjoyed Grimrock, but it's not without flaws. The enemy AI is bad. Really, really bad. You can kite everything. It's practically required at points (and therefore I'm fairly certain it's an intentional ""feature""), but it feels and looks really stupid to dance around a 2x2 square stabbing wildly whenever the enemy walks into your line of sight. Some of the hidden switches (those specific to getting treasure, NOT clearing the floors) are very hard to find. It's not a bad thing necessarily, but if you want to get the best gear you'll likely need a guide. Inventory management is cumbersome, because you cannot have more than one character's bag open at a time. Before you begin, you don't know what kind of gear you're going to find, meaning you can dump a bunch of early points into, say, Armour on your Fighter, but not have any heavy armour to take advantage of it. This problem is particularly bad for mages, who rely on you finding hidden scrolls to learn new spells (or cheating and looking them up online...), and can have 20 points invested in a tree they only have the first couple spells for. You're never sure if you missed the scrolls, or if they're just further along. There are some weird things with items, too. Occasionally you won't pick up an arrow you fired, leaving you to go hunting for it after the battle (not fun). You can't use a mortar and pestle from inside a container, meaning all your Alchemy materials have to stay in a character's inventory (10+ bottles, 6 reagants, and the Mortar takes up about half that guy's bag). You find weird things all over, some of which you will want later and some of which are just garbage. It's impossible to know which ones are critical to your mission (or hunt for treasure), though, because there isn't any tagging. And it's not like the game ASKS for this sword you found to be in your inventory. There's no prompt saying ""No entry without sword."" It's a silent check that you either pass or fail, and without a guide you might never know it was even there. You'll notice none of the issues I had with the game are anything close to being ""game-breaking."" They're just minor, quality of life things (and most of them are things that, if changed, would dramatically decrease how difficult the game is). It really is incredibly well polished, especially for an indie game. If you're curious, I'd put the game at about 20 hours in length if you go exploring. It's far easier than EotB, both because the updated graphics give you better depth perception and because it has a built-in map+healing crystals.

												Finally a dungeon crawler for modern age!This is a lovely homage to the old school grid based dungeon crawler genre, easy enough to learn so the younger generation of gamers can enjoy it, but truly challenging enough what older gamers would expect.Well balanced, fun, proper achievements and hours of gameplay with an affordable price tag.Highly recommended for anyone who love single player adventure and rpg-games in fantasy style.Be aware though that if you never had played any grid based dungeon crawler games before, the controls will probably feel a little awkward for the first minutes, but just learn how to move properly and soon you will be dancing around the enemies :)(Sorry for any grammar errors, English is not my native language)			"

Legend of Grimrock: a classic dungeon crawling role-playing game. Legend of Grimrock gets it right by keeping the premise simple and making the game easy and interactive while making sure to put the challenge in the combat and the puzzle solving. You were four prisoners who were shoved into the depths of Mount Grimrock to atone for your crimes, you are free the moment you fall, however you have to escape Grimrock if you want to enjoy your freedom, and that’s the story. There are tidbits of lore and story in scroll, text on walls and various objects you find throughout Grimrock, its simple and that’s honestly for the best. The game plays up the survival part well with needing to keep your guys fed or risk of getting hungry, health and energy regenerate although slowly, you can rest but risk getting attacked while resting.  Graphics weren’t top notch for the time it came out, but they don’t feel dated or old, they’re more than adequate and the style of the dungeon and its inhabitants is very realistic in tone.  There is no music throughout most of the game; instead you get this creepy ambiance similar to Amnesia or Penumbra games. It isn’t meant to scare as much as it is to create a tone of dread from  hearing ‘things’ in the distance, again the game feels like it’s going more for a realistic immersion.  Combat is much more interesting and tactical, your team is in a 2x2 formation, two in front and back, the two in front are taking the brunt of the damage while the two in back are support, you can switch these positions easily and you often will in order to save companions from death or to rotate dealing damage, spells are cast by selecting the correct rune sequence, you can do this as long as your skill level lets you and you know the combination, you can find scrolls that tell you correct rune combinations, but these aren’t required, you can find them through experimentation, or if you don’t care about finding it out, the internet. You can also craft in this game various potions from the reagents you find in Grimrock, potions can be simple healing or energizing potions to better damage or even invisibility, again you can find the correct combination through experimentation or scroll and recipes. Finally the puzzles in the game are much more challenging, there are a few simple and easy ones to begin with, but, even in the first room you start in there are various secret switch to hidden treasures, and as you progress the game starts putting more challenging riddles up for you to solve, some necessary to progress others to great treasures to help you survive. Overall, I felt the puzzle solving in this game was a good balance between challenging while also not needing to be overly difficult.Legend of Grimrock is a great throwback to dungeon crawling RPGs, it shows that this type of game can easily be done and be fun if done well, it’s simple and easy to get into and actually gave me quite a challenge and I was really impressed once I finished the game, it took me about 20 hours to beat the game, and for $14.99 USD that is not bad at all. I highly recommend this game if you’re looking for good ole fashioned role-playing games, or just something different from the standard fair now-a-days, if you need that more action oriented role-playing game, Grimrock may not be for you, although I still feel it’s just as fun, if not more. TL/DL; Legend of Grimrock is a classic dungeon crawling RPG with up to 20 hours of gameplay at only $14.99 USD, it’s a steal and well worth the price, its challenging, creepy, and interesting, it’s simple in its gameplay and story making it easy to jump in, it’s worth checking it out of you enjoy RPGs in general, if you need more action oriented RPGs, it may not be for you, but, I encourage you to check it out, you won’t regret it.-Double Thumbs Up from RoyialVideo Reviews: https://www.youtube.com/RoyialNetwork "

												Grimrock plays like Eye of the Beholder with better graphics and actual depth of field. If you liked EotB, that's a good thing. If you hated it (or have no idea what EotB even is), this game is PROBABLY not for you. It doesn't feel like a modern game. It feels like an upscaled version of a game from the DOS era. The puzzles are vague and cryptic, there are no ""directional arrows"" pointing you where to go, very few map notations, you have to memorize (or write down) spells and recipes, and your supply of... everything is limited. If you do stupid things, you will die. The good stuff in the game is obvious (and I've mentioned some of it). There's challenging puzzles, the ambient noises are useful (you'll want good, bi-aural headphones), the classes/builds allow for enough flexibility to build the way you want, the magic system is great, the tileset is pretty, and the controls are sharp. Combat actually feels dangerous, and requires you to be aware of your surroundings at all times. It's exactly what you would expect from a well-reviewed game in the same format as EotB. I really enjoyed Grimrock, but it's not without flaws. The enemy AI is bad. Really, really bad. You can kite everything. It's practically required at points (and therefore I'm fairly certain it's an intentional ""feature""), but it feels and looks really stupid to dance around a 2x2 square stabbing wildly whenever the enemy walks into your line of sight. Some of the hidden switches (those specific to getting treasure, NOT clearing the floors) are very hard to find. It's not a bad thing necessarily, but if you want to get the best gear you'll likely need a guide. Inventory management is cumbersome, because you cannot have more than one character's bag open at a time. Before you begin, you don't know what kind of gear you're going to find, meaning you can dump a bunch of early points into, say, Armour on your Fighter, but not have any heavy armour to take advantage of it. This problem is particularly bad for mages, who rely on you finding hidden scrolls to learn new spells (or cheating and looking them up online...), and can have 20 points invested in a tree they only have the first couple spells for. You're never sure if you missed the scrolls, or if they're just further along. There are some weird things with items, too. Occasionally you won't pick up an arrow you fired, leaving you to go hunting for it after the battle (not fun). You can't use a mortar and pestle from inside a container, meaning all your Alchemy materials have to stay in a character's inventory (10+ bottles, 6 reagants, and the Mortar takes up about half that guy's bag). You find weird things all over, some of which you will want later and some of which are just garbage. It's impossible to know which ones are critical to your mission (or hunt for treasure), though, because there isn't any tagging. And it's not like the game ASKS for this sword you found to be in your inventory. There's no prompt saying ""No entry without sword."" It's a silent check that you either pass or fail, and without a guide you might never know it was even there. You'll notice none of the issues I had with the game are anything close to being ""game-breaking."" They're just minor, quality of life things (and most of them are things that, if changed, would dramatically decrease how difficult the game is). It really is incredibly well polished, especially for an indie game. If you're curious, I'd put the game at about 20 hours in length if you go exploring. It's far easier than EotB, both because the updated graphics give you better depth perception and because it has a built-in map+healing crystals. It's still challenging, though, it's fairly priced, and although not without flaws I would recommend Grimrock to anyone who likes old-school CRPGs. Just be sure to read the manual before you start, and always keep an extra torch or five handy. You never know when you'll need them.			"

												Un RPG bien old school y hardcore. Tiene puzzles bastante complejos, sobre todo los que te llevan a las salas secretas. Graficamente cumple de sobra, muy linda iluminación. Jugablemente es excelente. Hay cientos de items: armaduras, armas, ingredientes para pociones, tesoros, accesorios, etc.. También hay unos cuantos enemigos diferentes, los cuales requieren cada uno su propia estrategia para vencerlos. Los modelados de la mayoría son muy grosos. Podés jugar con los personajes prefijados o crear tu propio grupo, configurando la imagen y nombre, clase, atributos y skills.Una joyita indie bien pulida y cuidada. El único punto en contra es que el enemigo final es patético y fácil de vencer, desentonando con el resto del juego que es más complicado.			"

												This game is amazing. I bet anyone who has played Dungeon Master and has enjoyed it, will enjoy this one.The puzzles do make sense, but can be really difficult sometimes. The gameplay is fun and addicting. There is a lot of secrets and collectible items. The fighting is also real good. Although sometimes it might be a bit unfair, but hey it belongs to these games.The game takes a while to play through unless you know everything about it.The game is near perfect in its genre. Also the atmosphere is really good. For example the prison actually feels a bit creepy to roam around in.TOTAL POINTS: 9/10			"

												This was my first dungeon crawler and it was an extremely positive experience. I got hooked immediately and my doubts, mostly related to the grid-based movements and the need to play with a keyboard, vanished at the same time. The game is very immersive and the satisfaction one gets from solving puzzles, challenging but never impossible, and finding secrets keeps you coming back for more. I'm looking forward to play the second!			"

												Legend of Grimrock is an excellent, atmospheric, well-made RPG in the style of much, MUCH older gems of the early 90's. The square-based movement style, and D&D style stats and gearing up, as well as the different patterns and intricacies of every enemy makes every encounter challenging, but not overpowering.Legend of Grimrock has incredible atmosphere. In the tight, packed corridors, you feel constantly trapped in a labarinth of passages, doors and levers. With over seventy secrets, treasures and notes, Grimrock's focus on exploration never dilutes the main path, meaning that you can explore each area as much or as little as you want.Legend of Grimrock's puzzles are very well made. Some require pinpoint reflexes and timing, while some require a more calculated and steady approach, but none feel impossible save one or two truly evil puzzles. The difficulty setting, however, is a tad arbitrary. Difficulty affects enemy stats and your hunger bar, but aside from that it changes nothing. Playing the game on easy will give you a much more enjoyable experience, and will not mean that a death of a party member is permanent.That being said, I only experienced one game-over screen and that was due to my own misstep on the final boss (who is definately innovative, if a tad underwhelming).This game is an excellent purchase, and a guaranteed source of enjoyment for a good ten or so hours, provided you do a full playthrough, fifteen if you're unfamilliar with the genre. The exploration bonus character makes for another interesting experience, so it may be wise to play through the game twice over - perhaps using a guide to help on the second time around.In conclusion, Legend of Grimrock is a bonafide gem of a game, and I would reccomend this to any fan of RPG's			"

												This game follows in the footsteps of games like Eye of the Beholder, yet gets lost along the way.Mainly this game is trying to take an RPG and make it a strategy/ puzzle crawler, instead of a dungeon crawler.  In order to succeed at this game you can't fight monsters toe to toe.  The game seems to be designed in a way that you must exploit the game mechanics (taking a swing at a monster then retreating before it can attack) in order to survive.  This combined with constant puzzles instead of exploring, make this game a poor choice for anyone looking for a true RPG dungeon crawler game.Party creation is also mediocre, with a minimum selection of classes, and non dynamic races.  You also only get a 4 person party instead of 6 which also limits experience.The game also has a combat interface that is clunkier than I remember the Eye of the Beholder games to be.  You can equip two weapons on a chanracter, but can't use them at the same time.  Also the spell system tried to be inovative with a rune selection process to make spell casting more of a challenge in the heat of battle.  However, the spell interface needs to be opened each time and has some issues.Also food seems to be unevenly distributed in the dungeons, making me wonder if food was initially and after thought of the game, and then made into a major mechanic at the last minute.  It seems to be laid out that if you try and 'clean' the dungeon by exploring every inch of a level, your party will starve to death.  However since the game is based on puzzles to unlock the next dungeon, complete exploration is usually a must.			"

												What shall i say? It feels (and plays) like the ""good old times""-dungeon crawlers, yet looks modern with more than decent graphics and models. It even looks pretty great with 3D Glasses (Helix).Do i recommend it? YES! But only if you liked them old crawler or these things sound interesting to you if you don't know them at all:- building a party you'll never really see except their portraits (get the fat pack from nexusmods!)- wander around a dungeon room by room and not step by step (no free movement)- fighting monsters with a simple click or casting spells by recalling the patterns (from easy to less easy)- rest to heal/refresh mana- use the mouse to find possible switches or something on wall/grounds (point-and-click-adventure-like)- solving minor puzzles of switches/traps/whatnot- die and reload :-)I really liked it (so much that i just bought it on steam just to support the developers. Hence my few playtime). And I'm no hardcore old-schooler, i also love Skyrim :-)			"

												In my world, Legend Of Grimrock would be called ""The reincarnation of Eye Of The Beholder"", or something of the sort, as I have really good memories of the first Eye Of The Beholder game from the early 1990s (although I never beat it), and Legend Of Grimrock looks just like it. Just recently I realized Eye Of The Beholder itself was a reincarnation (or what some people would call ""a clone"" or ""a ripoff"") of a similar game called ""Dungeon Master"" from the 1980s (which I've never heard of until recently), but 'nuff said about that.Back to Legend Of Grimrock -The game is a first person dungeon crawling Action/RPG. You play a group of 4 adventurers (aka convicted criminals, but nevermind about that :P), whose goal is to survive the dungeon by means of solving puzzles and fighting monsters while staying alive in the process. The default party consists of two fighters (one human, one minotaur), one wizard and one rogue, set in a fixed formation of two rows - two characters in front, two more behind them. You can choose which character to place where and change it while playing, but you can't change the formation. The idea is that the two front characters use melee attacks, while the other two need to attack from long range (either magic, throwing weapons such as knives, or missile weapons such as bows).Up until now (8-10 hours ingame), I'm really having fun. Technically, everything looks and feels good. There's nothing overwhelming about the graphics or the music, but they are definitely good enough. Come to think of it, there's hardly any music ingame, and I think it's a really good idea. The lack of music makes the game feel more realistic, and it lets you pay the worthy attention to the sound effects, which just like with Eye Of The Beholder, play an important role, as they serve as warning signs from certain enemies.  The controls are simple and intuitive (left click to move items, right click to attack when it comes to battles). Some of the puzzles are very easy, others are more difficult. I did find it necessary to look for help online in a couple of incidents so far, but I did manage to solve most of the puzzles myself (up to where I am at the moment, can't say anything about the puzzles I haven't reached yet). All in all, this game is fun. If you like dungeon crawlers, get it. It might not be a masterpiece, but it is fun to play.			"

												I know many people loved it, but this is not my kind of game.I expected the combat to be a bit more tactical, but because its active it seems to mostly involve turn-and-circle strafing most enemies and DPSing them down while avoiding being hit.  This isn't what I expected from an RPG, even an active one.  Theres not much back-and-forth, HP is there to make up for the mistakes you make or if you encounter too many enemies to easily achieve hit and run tactics.  Or for if you fall afoul of a trap.  Theres not much in the way of resource management, and the best solution is to backtrack to full-heal savepoint crystals for even minor wounds because the only reason to expend consumable resources is in dire emergencies and never to cover normal mistakes.  Character progression (from what I remember researching) seemed prone to the trap of making a useless build.  Its been awhile, so I could be wrong here and dismiss this if I am.Speaking of traps, I really dont like the puzzle and trap mechanics in this game.  Some of the puzzles are fairly obtuse, which could be okay except that you can end up just wandering forever not seeing a switch on a wall or the like if you dont look up a guide.  This is just true of some genres, even ones I love like point and click adventures, but the solution basically spoils part of the game.  In P&C games the puzzles are tied to a story.  A lot of traps aren't great because they're kind of like being exposed to a jumpscare.  'Haha, got you!'  Sometimes you die, sometimes you backtrack to a save crystal because you took somewhere between 1 to 99% damage, sometimes you backtrack because the trap diverted you, etc.  A lot of it is just trial and error, some of it is gotchas, but it never really felt clever or fun to me.Story is also lacking from what I saw.  Your characters have no backstory and you occasionally receive cryptic telepathic messages about a mysterious person who knows the mysterious truth behing the mysterious dungeon you are trapped in.  I didnt get far enough to figure it out, but I assume its just a premise to tie the gameplay together.  That can be okay, but I just didnt personally enjoy the story.A lot of people liked the game, but do your research first.  I like RPGs and have played them all my life, but this one wasn't  for me.

So without any nostalgia altering my perception of this game I can honestly say that this is an awesome game, the character types ,the secrets, the progression , it’s all done really well, and I would recommend this game to everyone out there , especially if they haven’t played a game with this gameplay style. Really good game, it allows you to import your own pictures for the portraits of the heroes thus making it a more fun experience, In my team I had Dark Blade (YuGiOh), a Tauren (From Warcraft), Dark Alchemist (From Torchlight 2) and a Argonian (From TES obviously) so I had a unique personal experience XD .Anyways enough talking, buy this game now ! good game , good games must be bought and played !4/5!

												This is a great modern game that succeeds in giving players a old school dungeon crawler feel while still manages to be creative.The Good:1) ""With a 95% positive rating, its likely you will enjoy this game."" - Captain Obvious.2) Good Graphcis3) Good Music4) Good RPG experience5) Creative and smart puzzles/riddles. What's a good dungeon crawler game if it didn't have good dungeon designs?6) Old school mode. I never had a chance to unds how playing a game while having to draw my own map was like. No longer the case with this game.7) Extras. Above sound track and concept art, there's actually reading material and quite abit of lore builing. Love the world map and descriptions of each races etc.8) Good combat, a true test of gaming dexterity and skill. 8a) You will soon realise timing is crucial. If you timed your attacks well enough you can put enemies in a partial stun-lock. consider enemy recovery time and your characters' cooldown etc. Very fun to learn how to exploit this.8b) I'll say that the combat is clumsy in a good way. You have to draw complicated runes to cast powerful spells. Potions can only be used from inventory. Weapons must be changed in inventory and dragging the icon. Attacks will only be made by right clicking on the correct location where the images of your weapons are. Your archer will have to swap between crossbow+quarrel and bow+arrow (thats 2 item swaps which takes alot of time). You have to pay attention to enemies' attacks and movement and then move your party accordinly to dodge attacks. All of that and much more are all in real time. No pause of combat. Opening maps and inventory only makes you open to enemy attacks instead of pausing the whole game or combat. All these makes this game awesome.The Bad:1) Story suck.. I don't actually mind since good story are usually more of a bonus. But the most rememebered and talked about games are the ones with great story. So I find this more a pity than anything else.2) Replay value. Kinda low since any difference in a 2nd try would be too little to justify the trouble to have to do the entire adventure all over again... Toorum mode was interesting though.All in all, good game sold at a low price. You're totally losing out if you gave this game a miss.			"

												Legend of Grimrock is best summarized in its manual: ""The game features dungeon exploration, puzzles, secrets, combat, magic and role playing elements.""The game's enjoyment comes from navigating the dungeon, avoiding traps, finding hidden switches and looting treasures. Combat is fairly simple, it consists of avoiding attacks by maneuvering around your adversaries, and the only tactical element is picking a place with enough room to do so (also being mindful of pits and other enemies cornering you). All in all combat is just another puzzle element in this game, the experience points and skills you earn a different form of reward.The game's overall difficulty is rather involved but lenient, it requires patience and attention to detail. There is a lot of diversity in puzzles, I've never come across two identical ones. They will test your memory, reflexes, and creativity, so you are bound to appreciate some of them while finding other tedious or unremarkable. Only in two instances did I get stuck. On the other hand the designers can be quite devious at times when it comes to traps, especially towards the end of the game. Some might find it frustrating, but I see it rather as playfulness and awareness of the exploits used in that genre of games.The game's visual and sound design, while polished, lacks diversity. Being quite lengthy (20-30 hours depending on difficulty/old school mode settings), but only comprised of two different kinds of environment (with a third on the tiny last two levels), the game can seem quite bleak after a while. The loot also becomes more scarce and less exciting, supplies more numerous, making it less rewarding to search for secrets. The lack of new enemies and puzzle elements adds to an overall fatigue building up until the two bottom floors. The final boss requires mobility and precision, also some ingenuity but most of all calm. It reinvigorated my enjoyment of the game, as the end fight was unexpectedly innovative.			"

												Pure dungeon crawling goodness. This is not dragon age. It is repetitve, a bit on purpose since it's a dungeon crawling game.You begin your quest half-naked and you try to get out of this maze. Oh, and your torch burned out. Woops.It's dark and you hear something coming your way. So it's hack n slash everything, try to resolve some puzzles. Loot what you can.So far I did not see real role playing.I say if you are into ''classic'' dungeon crawling this is a must-play.  "

												Featuring an old school experience of  paper/pencil rogue-like games that the 80's and 90's were famous for, Legend of Grimrock successfully updates the genre while maintaining emphasis on difficulty, customizable parties, and lore. Rich in story, secrets and diverse gameplay, Legend of Grimrock serves up a great platform for players looking for challenging yet ultimately rewarding gameplay.			"

												The glorious revival of the original king of the dungeon crawl feels like a labour of love on every aspect. Wonderful level design, nefarious puzzles, immersive graphics, and the sweet, sweet feeling of complete isolation. It's old-school, polished to modern perfection. There's also a free level editor on the way, which should keep the replay value even higher.			"

												If you like games such as Kings Field, Stonekeep, etc. This game is for you. I was a little confused with the controls at first, but they are easy to get the hang of. I suggest making your own characters as that is fun in itself. The dungeon has many secrets hiding surprizes, and hidden rooms galore. You will have to look very carefully, and some puzzles may stump you. Combat involves strafeing, plus timing your attacks so you take the least amount of damage. There are blue crystals hidden on each floor that save your game, and heal diseased characters if you happen to get caught by a trap like i did my first time playing. In short, i do recommend this title.			"

												LoG is a grid style dungeon crawler that has revived the genre from its dying lineage from such games like 80's Dungeon Master.  This 13 floor, heavy puzzled, medium combat gameplay title does an excellent job at presenting new comers and old to the maze like dungeon of the Mountain of Grimrock.  Most of the puzzles work around pushing lose stones that protrude out from the walls and the combat style is of dancing around in a grid motion around the enemy.  There is no tank and spank strategy here unless playing on easy difficulty.The game will take 20+ hours to complete depending on whether or not you spend the time to do the puzzles and/or find all the missing treasures that can be used for achievements or just upgrading you characters with better equipment.  The graphics are well done and the animation is quite well too.  There is an unlockable character that you must find in the dungeon which will let you run a new game once found with all new traits that will be different compared to the games regular 4 person party you've played with.  If enjoyed this alone is great replay value that extends the life even further to this gem.Looking for a great grid style dungeon crawler look no further to The Legend of Grimrock!			"

												I usually don't like playing dungeon crawler games but this was different. This game is a great deal of fun and with a interesting twist of playing as four charaters, or one if you so choose. (It's REALLY hard though.) I really like how I never felt forced to have rogue or a mage in my party. Sure it's easier with a least one mage and very hard with no warriors, but you can still play it as you want. You're never locked out of a area if you don't have a rogue to unlock the way. As for the story its a little sparse compared to games like Dragon Age or Mass Effect, but there is enough of a story to get behind and a mystery to further pull you along. You up your own idea's to it if your the imaginive type. The Puzzles are a bit hard especially if you are running this on weak computer. (some of the puzzles are timed) Even so I would Highly recommend this game!			"

												The level design, enemy placement, and especially the puzzles are all, by and large, wonderfully crafted. There are a few instances where the ""traps"" seem more unfair than clever, but that hardly tarnishes what is otherwise a terrific experience. You'll be hard-pressed to find a modern game like Legend of Grimrock any time soon, but with a game of this quality, you won't need one.In a way, The Legend of Grimrock is a lot like Dark Souls. The game rewards calculated, meticulous play and any severe injuries or deaths are likely a result of not taking in your surroundings. There are a lot of ways to die in Grimrock and if you're not paying attention, taking the time to search out better gear and learn to craft potions, you're going to have a difficult time with it. However, there's a great feeling of accomplishment as you traverse each floor, defeating powerful monsters and figuring out puzzle solutions on your own.			"

												Every now and then there comes a game that tries to revisit genres that have fallen by the wayside as the video game industry continues to change and grow. Dungeon crawler games, for the most part, happen to be one of those genres. So when I first saw images for Legend of Grimrock I couldn’t help but be excited.When I was a kid I spent a lot of time playing the old dungeon crawler games. I still vividly remember such titles as Dungeon Master and Dungeon Master II: The Legend of Skullkeep. Given how much time I spent playing those games, and loving every minute of it, I was hoping that this new game would live up to the games in whose footsteps it was following.I’ll tell you right now, I have not been disappointed.Legend of Grimrock is everything it is supposed to be. It is an old-style dungeon crawler modernized for today’s gaming world. While such a game can be limited in terms of graphics and art style, Almost Human, the indie developer behind the title, has executed it perfectly. The game looks great and the various creatures’ appearances are fantastic given the limits of the genre.Read the rest of my review at Press2Reset: http://press2reset.com/reviews/review-legend-of-grimrock/ "

												This is a great tribute to the first person RPG's of yesteryear, such as Dungeon Master and the Eye of the Beholder series.  Combat is difficult, and requires careful maneuvering as well as the right builds for your characters.  Some of the puzzles are fiendishly difficult, but all of them are fair, and I only had to go searching for solutions a couple of times on my first play through.Graphically, the game does what it sets out to do very well, though the tile sets and enemy types are all limited.  Even so, the look of the game, combined with what turns out to be a surprisingly good sound track add to the intense atmosphere of the whole experience.  The whole thing gives off an almost 'survival horror meets fantasy rpg' hybrid, and one that I greatly enjoyed.  I recommend it highly.			"

												This game is a tile-based hack n' slash with very rudimentary role-playing elements. The closest thing I could compare it to is Might and Magic X, although this game is not turn based and has no emphasis on story. You create and control four characters, moving on a tile, and fight stuff/solve puzzles. You get 2 characters in the front row that can swing melee and get hit by melee, and two in the back that can't reach or be reached. Let me jump right in to the gameplay. I did not like the combat in this game because it is what I like to call ""very clicky"". Since the game is not turn-based, you have to fight monsters in real time. Basically the combat involves clicking on all of your character's weapon icons to make them swing or shoot at the enemy, then waiting for the attack to come off cooldown so you can use it again. You can get fancy and swap out characters that are getting hurt too badly with characters in the back, ostensibly ""tag teaming them"". You can also abuse the fact that you can move on tiles faster than the enemies can, out flanking and out maneuvering them so that they can't hit you but you can hit them. This is pretty much the limit of what you can do in combat. It makes the game feel rather actiony and twitchy, rather than tactical. The latter technique just feels rather abusive and cheesey which made it not fun for me to do. However, I quickly found out that you need to do this in order to not take too much damage. Now, it's true that you can cast spells in combat to make things a little more interesting, but the spellcasting system is rather flawed as well. You're basically tracing patterns and clicking certain rune buttons that comprise a ""formula"" for the spell. But since you're doing this in real time, it's very clunky and awkward to do. It becomes more of a clicky reflex thing (how fast can you do it!) than a tactical or roleplaying thing. Something like this could be really cool in a turn-based game, where you're depending on the character's skill and not your own hand speed as the player. Overall this would make a more RPG friendly experience. The second bad thing about the gameplay is that the puzzles are extremely contrived. The very first one I encountered was solved by clicking a tiny section of wall that looked no different than any other section of wall. I found it only because I clicked literally everywhere on screen for several minutes and got lucky. I guess this is the gameplay?! You'll probably have to look up guides if you play this. I don't see why they can't put some kind of clue or hint or make the section of the wall look suspiciously different. This would make the puzzles at least engaging and make the player feel smart for figuring it out. So, what about the ruleset and character progression? Well, I actually can't say too much about the rule system. That's because the game doesn't explain how different stats are being calculated. At the character creation screen, you put points in four ability scores that are well defined as to what things they increase. The game even shows a stat block next to the ability scores which changes to reflect the ability scores as you mess with them. The problem is, we don't know what a lot of this stuff does, how it's calculated, or even what a ""good"" score would be. For example, we know dexterity increases accuracy, but ""accuracy"" isn't defined at all. Sure, it's obvious it has something to do with hit chance, but we don't know how attack rolls are claculated in this game so we're not really making an informed decision here. This system could be a lot more transparent. Moreover, you also buy skill points. Mousing over a skill tree shows the first few bonuses you get from increasing that skill, but not the whole chart. So again, you don't really know what it is that you're choosing. The spell skills (earth, fire, water, air) don't even define what type of spells that tree covers! It would be awesome if it showed brief explanation of what kinds of things to expect in each tree, followed by two examples of earth spells. But because the game doesn't do that, you're going in blind again. This neccessitates that you're going to end up picking some combination of skills and stats that don't work. This game is very trial-by-error type of gameplay. I myself made a minotaur tank who focused on large hit point pools for defense and massive strength for big damage output, and he got massacred right away which of course ended up being a TPK. So you can forget about playing the character you WANT to play. Instead you'll be playing the character the developers want you to play. My minotaur example helps me transition to the next point: there is extreme imbalance in the stats in this game. From personal experience of dying so much when using certain stats, as well as looking up guides online, I found out the truth about the system. Strength is completely awful for a melee character. ""What! That's completely counter-inuitive!"" Exactly. Turns out, the damage bonus provided by high strength doesn't scale at all and isn't enough enough to actually change how many hits it takes to kill and enemy. Doh. Stamina is likewise bad for a tank, it's just better to focus on evading damage and protection (armor). Again, counter-intuitive. Turns out the only stat that really matters for anyone who isn't a mage is Dexterity. Likewise, a lot of the feats in the game are totally useless and there are like 2 good ones that you should just take on every character. Lastly, everything in this game is incremental. None of the skills or feats really make your characters pop out as unique or change the way you approach combat. The game would have benefitted from some really colorful Fallout style feats. Summary: This game is an optimization, trial and error, incremental hack n' slash lacking any depth or unique character progression. The combat is action based and clicky. I would reccomend this to an action gamer who likes to just look up guides and isn't interested in roleplaying.   "

												This game is great! It is a spiritual sequel to the old game Dungeon Master from the 80s, but with modern graphics and updates like better AI and an automap. If you like dungeon crawls, get it. You wont be disappointed.Its a dungeon crawl like Eye of the Beholder. Graphics are very nice with the traditional square tunnels and chains hanging on the walls, moss ect. Theres alos the occasioanl cool statue or art on the walls as well. Step, turn, strafe and so forth. The puzzles ramp up in difficulty nicely. They are the typical find keys, secret buttons, pull levers in order, run quickly, and so forth. But defintely not stale. Theres also some interesting and unique ones too.  Combat is heavily reliant on the step dance just to survive, a feature I'm not too thrilled about. Unless youre a minmaxer, going toe to toe with an enemy of the appropriate level (on Normal) is not recommended. Youre going to be freezing the enemy and/or dancing all over the place if you want to stay alive. The enemies hit hard. I would say that this is the games major flaw, as I'm way more of a fan of toe to toe melee than swinging and running all over the place till the enemy dies. Its too bad cuz the AI is nice for a square based dungeon crawler. The enemies will actually try and sneak up on you.DMs levelling system was better too. In LoG, theres 4 races and 3 classes. Minotaur, human, lizardman, and insectoid, and mage, rogue and fighter. Once you pick, you're that class. Fighters cant learn magic, and mages cant fight (or seem to do much of anything). And you get XP, just like typical RPGs. Contrast that with DMs ""practice a skill and level in that class"" style and it just seems...lesser. Also, the game really lends itself to specialization. Pick 1 weapon, 1 magic school. Jack of all trading as far as class skills seems to really hurt in the late game. The sounds and music are nice, typically dungeon-y without being too intrusive. There really isnt too much of a plot in the main game, but thats not why you're here. You're here for the awesome exploration, wondering whats around the corner and seeing if your condemned prisoners will ever win their freedom.All in all a great game and definitely worth picking up for any dungeon/RPG fan. Theres a custom dungeon I have, not sure if I d/led it or it was installed in a patch. Its really great. Uses the same assets, but theres a lot added. For instance, theres way more story. Your character actually speaks to his/her self and when you find more party members, you can chat with them. And you only design one char, picking from the 4 races, but also 4 classes, each with 4 subclasses all slightly different.			"

												I am not sure why this game has received the critical acclaim it did, because aside from bringing back the long-dead (at the time) genre of tile-based dungeon crawling, the design, mechanics and gameplay are somewhat mediocre.It is effectively a point-and-click puzzler with combat - however, the creativity of puzzles is hurt by the game's limited mechanics, and the combat is shallow and a huge chore. Legend of Grimrock would please neither fans of adventure games nor fans of dungeon crawlers, unless they are desperate for anything in the genre.			"

												The first levels are thrilling. It was my childhood's ""Eye of the Beholder"" all over again, oh boy! Then the flaws started to creep out. First, as you progress you'll find out that dancing around is a necessity to survive battles. No matter how good your builds are, you characters just can't take hits. That's so hugely silly. Just picture that party of four misfits madly sidestepping around.Which brings us to the stats system. Some attributes' effects are nonsensical and unbalanced. As a result, optimal builds are ridiculous. End game heavy armor on a minotaur will never equal in survivability to puny rogue with evade investement. Heavy axes never equal the devastating power of thrown weapons on a minotaur with nil investment in dexterity.Lastly, the puzzles are obtuse, arbitrary and frustrating.I don't really understand all the glowing reviews.

												Dungeon crawler game where your party and monsters are moving in boxes but in real time combat.A lot of secrets and puzzles with hints provided only around 1 or 2 lines.Some puzzles are really challenging and you will need to squeeze some brain juice to solve.Some puzzles requires player's dexterity and reflex which can be challenging even frustrating to some player.These challenges what makes this game so good and I am very sure you will experience that ""so rewarding"" feeling when you managed to solve some puzzles you been struggling with.9.5/10!-0.5 point because those damn poisonous spiders they put in in so early level.Annoying as hell, but still manageable!

												This game is great and works great on Ubuntu (Linux). I have played and finished the game with some help (the puzzles can be really hard). I loved the story line and loved how everything looked on the screen, Just a heads up on average while I was playing the game I was getting 60 FPS at 1080p. Also for my computer I am running Ubuntu 16.10, 32 gigs of ram, AMD 8370 and a GTX 960. My steam drive is a Samsung 120 gig 840 series. For the video card driver version I am running 367.35. If you love dungeon crawler games and very good story I would play this game right to the end. It would be really nice for the 2nd one to come to Linux but have not heard of anything yet.			"

												There is a certain beauty to a polished game such as this one.  If you like RPGs, Puzzles, Adventure, Riddles, or really any combination of those, then buy Grimrock.

												Classic D&D squares! Heavy class based characters! Dice rolling!LoG is basically D&D on screen. You move according to the squares on the floor, so basically in only predetermined steps. Enemies will also move the same as you. Game tends to be puzzle heavy. Every puzzle, is aquainted with a scroll giving a hint towards solving it. You attack by clicking on your character's weapons and continue moving forward. You will have to maintain spells, items, weapons so on and so forth. No actual game bosses just the end game stuff (WHICH IS HILARIOUS AND AWESOME)Too bad there's no New Game Plus to restart your old characters, but you can reuse them on community created maps. Uses Steam Workshop. Music is outstanding. Would kill aga... err play again.			"

												8/10Fans of oldschool dungeon crawler games will most probably love Legend of Grimrock, as it is an extremely well done dungeon crawler game.While the game only has 3 classes, the different choices in skills make it possible to have multiple builds for each class - thus, there are multiple choices for how to build each of your 4 characters.Combat is specially good in this game because, although the party can stand still and fight one monster, movement can be used to an advantage and, sometimes, it must be used, which adds to the level of challenge of the game. Managing items - weight, ammount and which items are or will be useful or not - is also a challenge by itself.Multiple secrets in each level - and also in the game itself - add a LOT to the game.The game, however, lacks in variety, both in items and enemies. There's little variation between equipment beyond their base values, with a few exceptions of weapons with special effects, and enemies repeat a lot throughout the levels.Leveling up is also somewhat limited - I had the impression that I could get to the end of the game having one character max one skill while also keeping one or two other skills at somewhat decent levels, but I couldn't. And, many times, focusing entirely in one skill is not as good as it seems.The biggest issue I had with the game was the last fight, mostly because it seemed badly designed to me. It's hard to explain without spoiling the fight, but I think people who have finished the game might understand why.Despite its downsides, it's still an amazing game - and the level editor also adds a lot to the game, with some really interesting potential from the player-created levels I've seen.

												Having played 'Dungeon Master' back in the early 90's, I was delighted to see a game based on that style but with modern graphics. So, when the game came on sale I instantly bought it. So, what did I think?A really big WELL DONE! It takes me back to my childhood, playing Dungeon Master and other titles like it with my dad. The nostalgia instantly washed over me, bathing me in that happy feeling. The game is simple in its execution and layout, but does employ various puzzles the deeper you travel into the game, making you think. Combat is good and easy to manage.There is an absence of speech in the game. By that I mean that the four prisoners you command do not engage with each other or say anything. The enemies don't seem to either. Not a problem as it's not that kind of game but at times when the only sound is your footsteps it can get boring. This may have worked twenty years ago but not now in 2015.All in all a great game and a great homage to those early dungeon crawlers.7/10			"

												If I could describe Legend of Grimrock in one word, it would be grueling. Yet this isn't necessarily a negative. This a constant trek through a single dungeon, with little respite or change in scenery. You constantly have to worry about health, energy and food while fighting enemies, evading traps and solving puzzles. But it feels rewarding in a way. You really need to pay attention and work out scenarios to go foward. Though an obstacle may seem impossible at first: an unbeatable enemy encounter or an unsolvable puzzle, all you gotta do is step back, prepare and use quick wits to get past it. Time and time again you'll pull through in the search of the next floor or secret loot. The controls are a little awkward at first, especially the rune-based magic system, but I feel it's part of the charm. The combat is simple, but requires you to be quick and composed while paying attention to enemy patterns. The puzzles do a lot with very little, simple switches and floor pads are used to create some clever riddles without delving into Myst or La-Mulana tier arcanery. The biggest drawback would be the low production values, due to the small developer. There are only 3 tilesets for the dungeon, one of which you barely see. The main menu theme is great, but the actual game has mostly one ambient track, which is effective for building atmosphere but can get tiring after awhile. Overall, LoG is a great game for those wanting a tribute to the old school dungeon crawlers like Eye of the Beholder, or anyone wanting a somewhat challenging change of pace.			"

My only complaint would be that it's a little bit simplistic, in the combat and loot departments.  Also that you don't nearly level up enough.

A Paladin’s Review: Legend of Grimrock: Fun Old School Dungeon Crawling With A Creepy AtmosphereGenre: 1st Person Old School Dungeon Crawling RPG. Developed and Published by: Almost Human GamesPlatform: Windows, MacOSX and LinuxBusiness Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsLegend of Grimrock (LoG) is a RPG dungeon crawling adventure. It mixes old-school dungeon crawling with modern graphics and design. It focuses on survival and puzzle solving with some combat. Combat and travel is executed on a grid-based system. You and the enemies move forwards, backwards and sides in squares, an old-school throwback.The StoryThe game takes place in a world known only as The Northern Realms. You play as a group of four prisoners of varying races. These four prisoners have been sentenced for their crimes against the King by ""The Court"". Your sentence is to be thrown into the pit at the top of Mount Grimrock and once at the bottom of the pit, you'll be pardoned of your crimes. The only problem is, no one has survived the depths of Mount Grimrock. Can you survive past the creatures, traps and challenges before you? Well, your going to find out soon enough. Your mission is to do just that. You have to find out a way out of the place. Solve the puzzles, unlock the mysteries of Grimrock and survive. You're also being talked to in your dreams by someone...or something. The story is mostly told in dream sequences and scrolls left lying around in the dungeons. From these scrolls, you'll get clues to what's going on in the depths of Mount Grimrock as well as vague hints about the outside world.Combat and PuzzlesLoG features combat, puzzle & riddle solving, RPG elements and exploration. Combat is tile based and in real time. Since it has this tile movement, your enemies must be directly facing you to attack. They're unable to attack at a diagonal from you. The combat system is a bit quirky and wonky. It takes quite a bit of practice to get used to fighting on what is essentially squares and being able to only face four directions. Not only that, it's in real-time, so creatures may come out of no where and take you by surprise. For the most part, the combat doesn't have a lot of depth but it's surprisingly enjoyable. Since you can't take too many direct hits from enemies, as they hit like a truck, most of the time will be spent sidestepping around enemies and poking them to death with spells and weapon swipes. This also means that getting caught in a surrounded by creatures will lead to a quick death. This can be a frustrating part of the game and it can happen almost too many times for comfort. However, it usually felt like I had gotten myself in that bad situation, not the game. So, you need to be very self-aware of your surroundings and survive as best you can. Fortunately, there's a finite amount of creatures on every level. Once you kill them all, you're given free reign to walk around and explore the level on your own terms. Still, I will say that the combat system stands on a razor's edge. At times it can be far too easy and others it can be far too frustrating. This is the type of system that if it strays just a little, will cease to be enjoyable. There's also has a variety of different puzzles and riddles you must solve to not only advance but to find hidden secrets. Switches, levers, camouflaged buttons, defeating the right enemies or finding keys are all items used to impede your forward progress. Still, figuring it out is what I enjoy most about LoG. Even if it is tempting to use the Internet or Steam guides to solve a particularly tricky puzzle. (Which I did do that a couple of times. I know, I know). LoG definitely shines when it's about puzzles and less so when you're in combat. So, if you aren't a fan of puzzles, then you might not enjoy LoG that much. VisualsThis game is a looker. Everything has a fidelity and crispness that you wouldn't expect out of such an indie project. The creature designs and animations are very well done. It was impressive how lifelike some of the attacking creatures looked when they attacked. Even if a lot of the animations are reused, I still think of these creatures being real, of having substance. The lighting system in this game is excellent, with shadows playing lifelike over the walls and creatures as you move about. It all sells the experience of being in a dark, underground dungeon.Audio and AtmosphereWhile LoG has an awesome intro menu song that pumps you up for action, there isn't any music in the game itself. Instead, the game has whistling, quiet winds and other sound elements that sell the atmosphere of LoG. This sense that you're in an underground dungeon that is out to kill you. That every step forward is both a step towards ultimate freedom and possible death. Just to really sink it in, they let you hear the footsteps of potential enemies nearby. As though at any time, they might pop out of the wall and split you in two. But you wanna know the best part? There are some enemies that stand perfectly still until it's much too late. Think on that for a while.PC Settings and MoreLoG comes with all the graphics, audio and keybinding settings you'll need. Resolution options are plentiful and it can display in fullscreen, windowed borderless and windowed. V-sync has a enabled/disabled setting. Texture resolution, filtering, shadow quality and SSAO quality have low-medium-high sliders. There's also separate audio sliders with mute options. Autosave can be turned on/off with other minor settings included as well. Keyboard controls can be completely configured if needed. You can also enable a touchscreen/tablet mode which is pretty neat. There is no FOV slider and this is probably intentional for game balance. I can't say for certain if the FoV is fine or not but I think the grid-based movement will prevent any motion sickness from becoming an issue. It should be noted that Steam cloud isn't enabled for LoG. Final ThoughtsI really enjoyed exploring through the depths of Mount Grimrock. The creepy atmosphere is ever present as you crawl through empty halls expecting danger to popout at any second. The combat is pretty good as well but it can easily tip towards too easy or too frustrating. Legend of Grimrock was an unexpected treat and pleasure for me to play through. It isn't often that I find a game that just clicks with me like this one did. While a few of the puzzles were a bit of a hair-pullers, some of the riddles moreso, I didn't feel like they were too opaque or difficult to figure out. Though it's really tempting to just use the internet or Steam guides to get all the answers. Even so, there's 20 hours of content to enjoy.

												Fun and very addicting. A good mix of puzzle/trap and monster battles. The only trouble I see is that once you have completed the Grimrock dungeon and found all the secrets and treasures, there is not much of a point to playing it again, other than to test different character builds. However, with a free map editor now released, there is already no end of user-created content to test, which I can only hope will live up to the legend that is Mount Grimrock.			"

												Absolutely brilliant.Legend of Grimrock brings back to life an old genre of games I am not too familiar with. While it does use some oldfashion gameplay mechanics (like tile based movement) the game does not feel old in anyway. The gameplay is surprisingly clever and engaging. The real time, tile based combat creates an interesting challange forcing the player to dance around navigating in panic the well designed dungeons. It is not an easy game but the challange is fair and rewarding. The puzzles in the game and very creative and quite often challenging. Add to that the great atmosphere and it is a must try.			"

												Very good for classic gamers. If you ever played Eye of the Beholder or Lands of Lore, you'll feel right at home. :)The premise is similar: here, you have a grid-based first person RPG with real time battles. You control 4 characters, 2 in the front row and 2 in the back, and explore a huge dungeon full of monsters and puzzles. Its VERY similar to the first Eye of the Beholder, but with a better interface and an automap feature (that can be disabled, if you feel like it).The graphics are great, the enemies are varied and the challenge is quite high. And the puzzles... Ahh, those can range from ""I had to think a little"" to ""WHAT THE HELL DO I DO HERE?!?!"". And believe-me: they are FUN, and give a feeling of accomplishment when you finally solve them. The sound effects are great, with realistic ambient effects that give a nice scary mood to the dungeon crawling. The only issue I have is that the game doesn't have music. But thats not a BIG issue (EoB  also didn't have music. ;) ).Anyway, this is one amazing game. Can be frustrating if you don't like puzzles too much, and the battle system can become repetitive after a few hours. But hey, its an amazing game that can take more than 20 hours to beat, and you can even download usermade dungeons to make the playtime even longer.This game is very recommended. ^^			"

												8/10Fans of oldschool dungeon crawler games will most probably love Legend of Grimrock, as it is an extremely well done dungeon crawler game.While the game only has 3 classes, the different choices in skills make it possible to have multiple builds for each class - thus, there are multiple choices for how to build each of your 4 characters.Combat is specially good in this game because, although the party can stand still and fight one monster, movement can be used to an advantage and, sometimes, it must be used, which adds to the level of challenge of the game. Managing items - weight, ammount and which items are or will be useful or not - is also a challenge by itself.Multiple secrets in each level - and also in the game itself - add a LOT to the game.The game, however, lacks in variety, both in items and enemies. There's little variation between equipment beyond their base values, with a few exceptions of weapons with special effects, and enemies repeat a lot throughout the levels.Leveling up is also somewhat limited - I had the impression that I could get to the end of the game having one character max one skill while also keeping one or two other skills at somewhat decent levels, but I couldn't. And, many times, focusing entirely in one skill is not as good as it seems.The biggest issue I had with the game was the last fight, mostly because it seemed badly designed to me. It's hard to explain without spoiling the fight, but I think people who have finished the game might understand why.Despite its downsides, it's still an amazing game - and the level editor also adds a lot to the game, with some really interesting potential from the player-created levels I've seen.

												Sleeper hit! Legend of Grimrock is a old school dungeon crawler, grid-paper style. This is one of those games that make me wonder if i would enjoy D&D because although its simplified, it pretty much has the hallmarks of a on-paper western RPG. Interesting and fun, you will eagerly anticipate each new puzzle or secret as you traverse deep into the bowels of a maze-like fortress.			"

												O jogo é excelente, possui muitos meios de jogar, muitas estratégias, muitas builds para personagens, peca um pouco na quantidade de itens e monstros, mas acho que foi feito de propósito para dificultar o jogo caso você não explore e encontre os secrets. O boss final é o único monstro que deixa a desejar, realmente esse inimigo fora feito com preguiça, mas o resto dos monstros são impecáveis, os itens também são impecáveis.

												If I could describe Legend of Grimrock in one word, it would be grueling. Yet this isn't necessarily a negative. This a constant trek through a single dungeon, with little respite or change in scenery. You constantly have to worry about health, energy and food while fighting enemies, evading traps and solving puzzles. But it feels rewarding in a way. You really need to pay attention and work out scenarios to go foward. Though an obstacle may seem impossible at first: an unbeatable enemy encounter or an unsolvable puzzle, all you gotta do is step back, prepare and use quick wits to get past it. Time and time again you'll pull through in the search of the next floor or secret loot. The controls are a little awkward at first, especially the rune-based magic system, but I feel it's part of the charm. The combat is simple, but requires you to be quick and composed while paying attention to enemy patterns. The puzzles do a lot with very little, simple switches and floor pads are used to create some clever riddles without delving into Myst or La-Mulana tier arcanery. The biggest drawback would be the low production values, due to the small developer. There are only 3 tilesets for the dungeon, one of which you barely see. The main menu theme is great, but the actual game has mostly one ambient track, which is effective for building atmosphere but can get tiring after awhile. Overall, LoG is a great game for those wanting a tribute to the old school dungeon crawlers like Eye of the Beholder, or anyone wanting a somewhat challenging change of pace.			"

												For all those folks who miss Eye of the Beholder or even Dungeon Hack from the old TSR days of D&D, this game is a real treat.  The combat's not terribly deep, but then again it was never the strongsuit for this genre.  PC games like these were huge in the early 90s then they just kind of vanished to make way for the smoother FPS-esque experience found in Might & Magics VI thru IX.  It's old school goodness with a fresh coat of paint.			"

												Having played 'Dungeon Master' back in the early 90's, I was delighted to see a game based on that style but with modern graphics. So, when the game came on sale I instantly bought it. So, what did I think?A really big WELL DONE! It takes me back to my childhood, playing Dungeon Master and other titles like it with my dad. The nostalgia instantly washed over me, bathing me in that happy feeling. The game is simple in its execution and layout, but does employ various puzzles the deeper you travel into the game, making you think. Combat is good and easy to manage.There is an absence of speech in the game. By that I mean that the four prisoners you command do not engage with each other or say anything. The enemies don't seem to either. Not a problem as it's not that kind of game but at times when the only sound is your footsteps it can get boring. This may have worked twenty years ago but not now in 2015.All in all a great game and a great homage to those early dungeon crawlers.7/10			"

However, with a free map editor now released, there is already no end of user-created content to test, which I can only hope will live up to the legend that is Mount Grimrock.			"

A Paladin’s Review: Legend of Grimrock: Fun Old School Dungeon Crawling With A Creepy AtmosphereGenre: 1st Person Old School Dungeon Crawling RPG. Developed and Published by: Almost Human GamesPlatform: Windows, MacOSX and LinuxBusiness Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsLegend of Grimrock (LoG) is a RPG dungeon crawling adventure. It mixes old-school dungeon crawling with modern graphics and design. It focuses on survival and puzzle solving with some combat. Combat and travel is executed on a grid-based system. You and the enemies move forwards, backwards and sides in squares, an old-school throwback.The StoryThe game takes place in a world known only as The Northern Realms. You play as a group of four prisoners of varying races. These four prisoners have been sentenced for their crimes against the King by ""The Court"". Your sentence is to be thrown into the pit at the top of Mount Grimrock and once at the bottom of the pit, you'll be pardoned of your crimes. The only problem is, no one has survived the depths of Mount Grimrock. Can you survive past the creatures, traps and challenges before you? Well, your going to find out soon enough. Your mission is to do just that. You have to find out a way out of the place. Solve the puzzles, unlock the mysteries of Grimrock and survive. You're also being talked to in your dreams by someone...or something. The story is mostly told in dream sequences and scrolls left lying around in the dungeons. From these scrolls, you'll get clues to what's going on in the depths of Mount Grimrock as well as vague hints about the outside world.Combat and PuzzlesLoG features combat, puzzle & riddle solving, RPG elements and exploration. Combat is tile based and in real time. Since it has this tile movement, your enemies must be directly facing you to attack. They're unable to attack at a diagonal from you. The combat system is a bit quirky and wonky. It takes quite a bit of practice to get used to fighting on what is essentially squares and being able to only face four directions. Not only that, it's in real-time, so creatures may come out of no where and take you by surprise. For the most part, the combat doesn't have a lot of depth but it's surprisingly enjoyable. Since you can't take too many direct hits from enemies, as they hit like a truck, most of the time will be spent sidestepping around enemies and poking them to death with spells and weapon swipes. This also means that getting caught in a surrounded by creatures will lead to a quick death. This can be a frustrating part of the game and it can happen almost too many times for comfort. However, it usually felt like I had gotten myself in that bad situation, not the game. So, you need to be very self-aware of your surroundings and survive as best you can. Fortunately, there's a finite amount of creatures on every level. Once you kill them all, you're given free reign to walk around and explore the level on your own terms. Still, I will say that the combat system stands on a razor's edge. At times it can be far too easy and others it can be far too frustrating. This is the type of system that if it strays just a little, will cease to be enjoyable. There's also has a variety of different puzzles and riddles you must solve to not only advance but to find hidden secrets. Switches, levers, camouflaged buttons, defeating the right enemies or finding keys are all items used to impede your forward progress. Still, figuring it out is what I enjoy most about LoG. Even if it is tempting to use the Internet or Steam guides to solve a particularly tricky puzzle. (Which I did do that a couple of times. I know, I know). LoG definitely shines when it's about puzzles and less so when you're in combat. So, if you aren't a fan of puzzles, then you might not enjoy LoG that much. VisualsThis game is a looker. Everything has a fidelity and crispness that you wouldn't expect out of such an indie project. The creature designs and animations are very well done. It was impressive how lifelike some of the attacking creatures looked when they attacked. Even if a lot of the animations are reused, I still think of these creatures being real, of having substance. The lighting system in this game is excellent, with shadows playing lifelike over the walls and creatures as you move about. It all sells the experience of being in a dark, underground dungeon.Audio and AtmosphereWhile LoG has an awesome intro menu song that pumps you up for action, there isn't any music in the game itself. Instead, the game has whistling, quiet winds and other sound elements that sell the atmosphere of LoG. This sense that you're in an underground dungeon that is out to kill you. That every step forward is both a step towards ultimate freedom and possible death. Just to really sink it in, they let you hear the footsteps of potential enemies nearby. As though at any time, they might pop out of the wall and split you in two. But you wanna know the best part? There are some enemies that stand perfectly still until it's much too late. Think on that for a while.PC Settings and MoreLoG comes with all the graphics, audio and keybinding settings you'll need. Resolution options are plentiful and it can display in fullscreen, windowed borderless and windowed. V-sync has a enabled/disabled setting. Texture resolution, filtering, shadow quality and SSAO quality have low-medium-high sliders. There's also separate audio sliders with mute options. Autosave can be turned on/off with other minor settings included as well. Keyboard controls can be completely configured if needed. You can also enable a touchscreen/tablet mode which is pretty neat. There is no FOV slider and this is probably intentional for game balance. I can't say for certain if the FoV is fine or not but I think the grid-based movement will prevent any motion sickness from becoming an issue. It should be noted that Steam cloud isn't enabled for LoG. Final ThoughtsI really enjoyed exploring through the depths of Mount Grimrock. The creepy atmosphere is ever present as you crawl through empty halls expecting danger to popout at any second. The combat is pretty good as well but it can easily tip towards too easy or too frustrating. Legend of Grimrock was an unexpected treat and pleasure for me to play through. It isn't often that I find a game that just clicks with me like this one did. While a few of the puzzles were a bit of a hair-pullers, some of the riddles moreso, I didn't feel like they were too opaque or difficult to figure out. Though it's really tempting to just use the internet or Steam guides to get all the answers. Even so, there's 20 hours of content to enjoy.

												This is a first-person RPG in the style of Eye of the Beholder.  The plot is simple but appropriately so.  You are four convicts who have been exiled to Mount Grimrock.  You receive a pardon upon being exiled because nobody makes it down and out of the mountain.  Ever.  This game is an epic dungeon crawl and it knows it.  You need to find light sources or you will die.  You need to find food or you will die.  You need to manage your inventory and weight loads or, yes, you will die.  The game is pretty tough on the normal difficulty and you can ramp it up with a hard mode as well as an old-school mode where you must create your own maps out-of-game.  The itemization, art direction, and music all contribute to an ambiance that other games from top-tier studios would be wise to emulate.  It is not without its flaws.  The combat system is rather clunky and the grid-layout of the game allows many enenmies killed through mechanical exploitation.  The real difficulty is in the carefully crafted puzzles that push the limitations of the grid-based system to new levels of awesome and often require precision movement and perfect timing.  This game goes on sale often but it is worth it at full price.			"

												What a fun little game this is! It is a very lightweight game which offers a surprising amount of dungeon crawling enjoyment! I think it's beauty lies in it's simplicity - it's basically just a 2D grid environment with 3D perspective graphics. Your party of 4 adventurers take up one tile and can only move one tile at a time either north, south, east or west. Combat is basically hack n slash but there is quite a bit of timing involved and strategy with how you use your 2 'front row' characters who can melee directly as opposed to the 2 'back row' characters who can either use ranged attacks/magic or perks to do melee attacks from afar. But sometimes you might find yourself cornered where monsters surround you and take big bites out of your typically soft back row guys. There are alot of interesting puzzles some of which can drive you mad trying to figure them out! I really also like how food plays into the game (your guys need to eat!) and how items are very scarce.			"

												Old-school dungeoncrawler par excellence. Definitely worth a look if your idea of fun involves being thrown in a hole with nothing but your underoos and stabbing your way through dark tunnels full of inexplicable logic puzzle-based security systems with no real goal beyond ""survive to the next room.""-----After about... what, two years? I haven't been counting... I've finally beaten this game. And I admit with zero shame I used a walkthrough to find all the secrets, as I was going for achievements and the only way you're getting all of them in one playthrough is prior knowledge, a walkthrough, or going through every brick in the dungeon with a fine-tooth comb.There's not much to say that isn't summed up in that opening paragraph. Legend of Grimrock feels like Tomb of Horrors Lite in terms of surviving by the skin of your teeth through dark, miserable corridors specifically designed to make advancing painful, with some truly clever and sadistic puzzles, some more one than the other.Ultimately my only major criticism is that the final boss is quite possibly the most annoying boss in any game I've ever played, mainly because the arena is litered with swarms of minor enemies that serve no purpose but to be mobile walls to keep you from fleeing, and their mere presence in the room feels so arbitrary that I'm almost certain they were lazily tossed in during beta testing when the devs felt the boss was too easy.So yes, rubbish boss, but altogether a fun old-school dungeon crawler. Give it a go.			"

												This is a first-person RPG in the style of Eye of the Beholder.  The plot is simple but appropriately so.  You are four convicts who have been exiled to Mount Grimrock.  You receive a pardon upon being exiled because nobody makes it down and out of the mountain.  Ever.  This game is an epic dungeon crawl and it knows it.  You need to find light sources or you will die.  You need to find food or you will die.  You need to manage your inventory and weight loads or, yes, you will die.  The game is pretty tough on the normal difficulty and you can ramp it up with a hard mode as well as an old-school mode where you must create your own maps out-of-game.  The itemization, art direction, and music all contribute to an ambiance that other games from top-tier studios would be wise to emulate.  It is not without its flaws.  The combat system is rather clunky and the grid-layout of the game allows many enenmies killed through mechanical exploitation.  The real difficulty is in the carefully crafted puzzles that push the limitations of the grid-based system to new levels of awesome and often require precision movement and perfect timing.  This game goes on sale often but it is worth it at full price.			"

												What a fun little game this is! It is a very lightweight game which offers a surprising amount of dungeon crawling enjoyment! I think it's beauty lies in it's simplicity - it's basically just a 2D grid environment with 3D perspective graphics. Your party of 4 adventurers take up one tile and can only move one tile at a time either north, south, east or west. Combat is basically hack n slash but there is quite a bit of timing involved and strategy with how you use your 2 'front row' characters who can melee directly as opposed to the 2 'back row' characters who can either use ranged attacks/magic or perks to do melee attacks from afar. But sometimes you might find yourself cornered where monsters surround you and take big bites out of your typically soft back row guys. There are alot of interesting puzzles some of which can drive you mad trying to figure them out! I really also like how food plays into the game (your guys need to eat!) and how items are very scarce.			"

												LoG is an old school RPG that will appeal to gamers who seek a hardcore nostalgia trip. The character creation system is deep, with 4 races, 3 classes, and a dozen skills to choose from. Combat is a strange mix of real time movement on a grid and turn based attacks. But I didnt find it balanced. Get trapped in a corner and death is inevitable. Have room to move and you shouldnt even get hit. Theres no fun but challenging middle ground. The puzzles are intelligent. Its refreshing to play a game that doesnt guide you by the hand. Its more difficult than say, Portal, but the solutions can usually be figured out if youre patient. However I confess to using a guide on four occasions. The story is decent, but honestly the ending is worse than ME3. The length of the game depends on how long you take to solve the puzzles, but even the smartest gamer should get at least 10 hours. Overall, even though I'm critical on some points, I think LoG is worth playing, especially at the low indie price.			"

												People who remember Dungeon Master I / II, Black Crypt, Lands of Lore will enjoy this game for its nostalgic value as well as being a fun game on it's own.  People who've never played those old school games will still like this game for being different, fun, and not always easy.  Puzzles don't all have obvious solutions, enemies don't always fall so quickly, and a simple hole in the floor can put you in worse trouble than the trouble you were running from - or lead to better armor.  Party member options are somewhat limited, choosing skills when leveling up can make things either easier or more difficult for you, and food and torches become precious.  But this all enhances the challenge of the game, there are even modes that don't automap for you and make enemies harder to kill.  Even the instructions won't tell you everything, you have to learn how to find secrets on your own.  But don't worry, you can still save anytime, unless you'd rather limit yourself to the use of saving stones.			"

												Excellent game which requires you to think otherwise you can not get easily through enemies. You would mostly want attack one enemy at time, as getting surrounded leads to quick death of your 4 heroes. At the start you can choose your own three classes: fighter, rogue & mage and there are also races which make some advantages over others. I let it by default. Game is very similar to old M&M. Movement is chess-like, only step by step. Your party occupies one square, you can get trapped, you need to figure out the way out and solve puzzles (read your puzzle & try to understand its meaning & use instinct for solving). The game is though pretty simple to understand and I can only recommend the game to every RPG player who likes strategy, chess or puzzles.			"

(Of course there are some exceptions)You can choose between different breeds which have their own benefits and these players can be signed as: Mage, Warrior, Rogue - to gain skills of their speciality.★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Graphics: Looks in my opinion fairly nice. No complain!★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Story: hmmm... Not really an impressive story. Get thrown into a Mountain and you have to escape...The helping ""thing"" in the dreams and all the notes of toorum makes it a bit more interesting.★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ Leveldesign: It is impressive to see that they got 71 secrets on 13 different Levels. I didn't get even 50 at my first playthrough. As I said, Impressive work. Nice riddles...★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Music: Well... the theme Music at the Menu is amazing. <3 But the whole game has no other soundtrack, at least no soundtrack I've heard... Not even the Boss has one and that was a bit disappointing.

												Prepare to die, again and again. 'Legend of Grimrock' is a hardcore RPG even in normal difficulty. Either I made all the wrong choices either your party is always at a (more than slight) disadvantage as you get to higher levels. I've been poisoned and eaten alive by spiders, incinerated by those flying armored mages, and even chewed up by frosty lizards. The devs really want you to suffer in this dungeon that often seems like a dead end as it's almost impossible to fight and defeat more than one enemy at the time. All the fighting is done real time but there are no shortcuts or hotkeys, therefore the computer will always be quicker then you as you will struggle to command the attack with your mouse - especially with the spells that need several inputs : choosing the wand, choosing 1-4 runes, and then pressing on the attack button AGAIN! But most of all the puzzles will drive you crazy: 'The Maze of Madness' will drive you as mad as hell until you can't take it anymore (or find the improbable solution with no hints whatsoever) and the mostly random logic will leave your characters and yourself starving while you bang your head against the wall. The minimalistic nature of the game is classy, but the lack of real meaning to many of the puzzles is frustrating; some are genuinely good and easy to understand thanks to a scroll (the shadow maze for instance), but now I'm currently stuck in an endless hall in level 9. There's probably a hint I'm missing somewhere in the slaughterfest but maybe I'll die before I find it. I might never see the light of day, after all I've been there for over 24h already...Grimrock don't roll, it's a total headbanger!PS: I eventually found the scroll and got to the game's over-the-top goofy conclusion; you have to see it to believe it! Also the level editor is great and relatively easy to use and some of the mods are actuallly way more enjoyable than the original, there's this awesome Mine of Malan Vael and The Tower of Bones that could both easily be official DLCs while we are all waiting for the sequel.

												I Just finished this game and will finish uploading the series to youtube soon. If you are a fan of old school dungeon crawlers like Eye of the Beholder then this is definately a must for you! even if you never played a Dungeon crawler and you like RPG's then this is a really good modern game to bring you into the genre. There are so many secrets in this game and when you find one you feel so happy and you get better loot most of the time and it's just amazing. Check out my series if you are interested.

												Feels like a simplified version of Might and Magics III with better graphics.The character progression is oversimplified compared to that old classic, but the secrets doors and traps seem to be the main focus here. The whole game happens in some sort of underground prison/maze. If you really want nostalgia/challenge, use the ""old school mode"" and you will need to draw the map yourself, like in the old days! Aaaah how I miss that... not. Gearing is easy, but often requires you to find a bloody secret door with the last piece of your set. Or many secret doors. That's the spirit though!Achievements are okay to do, I wonder why few people got it 100%.			"

												Legend of GrimrockA 3D take on a RPD board kind of style. The game is based in a dungeon which is situated inside a mountain, Your 4 characters are prisoners and your only chance of survival is to escape the dungeon.You slowly progress floor by floor down a grid style environment. It is in a way turn based but it does it very well. The controls are very easy to learn and everything is taught to you pretty early in the game.The art style  is very typical of a dungeon rpg you have the vines hanging from the walls and the cobblestone bricks but for a dungeon it can look very pretty the monsters especially have been made very well with their stationary movements and attacks.One of the only issues I had with this game was that some of the puzzles I just didnt understand or they just werent obvious so I had to check some youtube videos but that could just be down to my own incompetence.I rate it a 8/10 Definately check out the sequel as well!

Good for playing casually and not a lot of hand holding involved. The price was right with the two pack and the sale.			"

												Proof you don't need a D&D license and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ soap opera story. Just make a great game and leave it at that.Grimrock is a modern dungeon crawler that puts age old mechanics to good use. Your goal is very simple. Guide a party through a nasty dungeon while avoiding traps, fighting monsters, collecting better equipment and leveling up.The game is comfortable and easy to play despite the difficulty ramping up after the first few levels. For those who enjoy exploring and getting lost there's an option to switch off the automap. There are secret areas aplenty and some puzzles require a bit of thinking. Most of the time it's enough to just look everywhere and figure out how to make use of things like pressure plates, teleports or timing mechanisms.The enemies are quite cruel and your party will become overmatched pretty quickly. Fortunately it's possible to close gates and block off some areas, and it's not necessary to kill everything. If you must kill things to progress, usually there's a way to make use of the dungeon itself and make it easier.I have played a lot of dungeon crawlers and have liked some of them. Ishar 3 was good though i never finished it. I loved Captive but finished it even less... Albion was interesting, though not exactly a classic example, and neither was Whale's Voyage. Hired Guns was incredible for it's time and hard as hell for good measure. Never could get into Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder much, though EoB was ok. Anvil of Dawn was pretty impressive. I think there's a few games i forgot, but anyway...Maybe i'm weak for Hired Guns a bit more but Legend of Grimrock is the most awesome of the bunch!			"

												 Legend of Grimrock is a old school dungeon crawler offering intense combat, puzzles, exploration, and most of all survival. This game actually reminds me of Shining In The Darkness. Legend of Grimrock offers some really neat features like the ability to eat so you won’t starve. This might throw more casual players off the game because you’ll be managing a entire party and you have to make sure each person/thing in your party is well fed, has plenty of health, weapons, armor, and torches before you decide to continue on your descent into this maze like prison that you’re trapped in. The character creator in this game is awesome. It’s very old school like dungeons and dragons. Basically you choose a portrait, decide on what class you want that character to be, then choose their strengths, and traits. No one character will be good at everything so be careful on what you choose. I always have two warriors, a rogue, and a mage in my party and i’m doing pretty good with them.  The way you learn magical spells is by finding them on pieces of paper scattered around the dungeon. These papers will have the correct way for you to cast the spell. You can also randomly try and cast them but when you’re in a fight you really don’t have time to experiment with your spells. As you find weapons and armor throughout the dungeon you’ll be faced with a choice. Who will you give them too? This is what I love about this game. You won’t find enough equipment for everyone and you have to decide who you want to have them. I usually get my warriors set up for battle before anyone else. I gave the bow to my assassin, staff to me mage, axe to my minotaur, and sword and shield to my human/warrior/tank. Combat in this game is also very old schools. You click on your weapon to attack the enemy in front of you and watch as your sword cuts through the enemy. It’s very basic and easy to learn but it’s up to you to strategize and use tactics when you encounter a large group of enemies.   You don’t want to get surrounded in this game and risk losing one of your party members because they will not come back. Once they die they’re gone until you can find a giant sized blue crystal to revive them and that’s not always easy. In order for you to recover some health you can either rest by pressing the R button or by using a health potion that you’ll eventually find. You can also heal with a magic spell but I wouldn’t advise that since it’s not all that useful. The best ways to heal are by resting, or using a healing potion. When you rest your characters will get hungry so you’ll have to feed them. It’s up to you to decide when to rest and if you have enough food to eat when you’re done resting. ugly Graphically Legend of Grimrock is a good looking game. All of the enemies look good, and the dungeon itself is dark, gloomy, and creepy like a dungeon should be. The sound effects, and soundtrack all help build up to the creepiness that the game has. You’re all alone in this place and I think that adds to the tension while I play the game. Legends of Grimrock isn’t all about looting and killing things. It also has some pretty good puzzles for you to figure out in order to advance to a secret area or get to the next area. I’ve been stuck on more then one occasion trying to figure out the clues to the puzzles when the answer was staring me right in the face. Legend of Grimrock is a amazing, old school dungeon crawler that should be experienced by everyone that loves games that does not hold your hand. My final verdict for Legend of Grimrock is a 10/10! This game took me back to the 90′s with it’s play style and hardcore, no hand holding gameplay. The puzzles are a nice change of pace and knowing that the only way to bring your lost party member back to life is by finding a giant blue crystal really appeals to me. It’s old school and a lot of fun. This game is by all counts Legendary and easily earns my recommendation.  For more of my reviews you can find me on drakulus.com and johnheatz.com.			"

												A classic RPG in the style of Eye of the Beholder and other first-person RPGs from the early '90s. There's about 25 hours of content here, and its all worthwhile. Much of the game involves trap puzzles. There is no grind or repetition here -- your character will progress at a reasonable rate to match the challenges of each level, and each level offers new and interesting challenges. The game has a retro feel with modern graphics, and doesn't drag on forever like many other RPGs. Much of the fun involves hunting for secrets (and there are many).There's essentially no replay value here, but your first playthrough will give you more than your money's worth. There are no unskippable cutscenes to destroy the fun.			"

												Grimrock keeps you up. It's tough as nails, but it scratches that dungeon crawler itch... That ""Eye of the Beholder/Dungeon Master/So many late 80's early 90's games it's hard to count"" dungeon crawler itch. And unlike its roguelike cousins, grimrock is a meticulously plotted and paced experience.I'll admit I probably spent more time playing this than was strictly necessary, but I combed every wall for hidden switches, I slashed every tapestry to see if a cubby of treasure hid beneath, in short, Grimrock hid dozens upon dozens of little wonders and I couldn't help but go seek.My only criticism is, I think a new game + would have been amazing. Being able to play through the game again at a harder difficulty with your entire party and all its equipment would've rocked. But other than that...  I loved it. If you like your games difficult and intelligent, your monsters menacing and your character progression rewarding, buy this game.			"

												I liked Legend of Grimrock for what it was (a basic dungeon crawler à la 'Dungeon Master') but for someone looking for a more critical review, I'll list what I missed in the game regarding:Combat: very simplistic and monotonous. It can be described in 5 words: ""Sidestep > Turn > Click attack/spell."" You won't be doing anything else from the first trash mob till the final boss.Story: There is none.Items: There is not a lot of variety with weapons / armor, it's a pretty flat, straightforward upgrade path. I think they could 've done more here with random itemization à la Diablo 2 to keep things interesting.Again, these were probably deliberate design choices - partly because of budget constraints (nail the basics > bodging experimental stuff) and partly to emulate the old dungeon crawlers with their very basic gameplay. If that's what you're looking for though, LoG delivers.			"

												I have only played an hour and a half of this game (as of writing this review) but that is all it took to sell me on the sequel. I really enjoyed the time I had with the game and I just didn't want it to end. At first it was a bit confusing because I didn't know what any of the controls were but after completing the in-menu tutorial that lasted about a minute I knew exactly how to play the game. I also looked over the controls to make sure I knew everything I needed to. I found the game was incredibly immersive, it even got to the point of me writing notes in the in-game notebook, and they were written in a perspective that made it sound like I was there. If you compiled a book of my notes in chronological order it would sound like someone was telling you a story. This game is pretty damn good. Definitely the tastiest game I have played in a long time. Mmmmmmmmmmm...			"

A very immersive experience and even some scare jumps are things that you can find in Legend of grimrock. It has good looking dungeons and some quite challenging puzzles on every level. The only con that I would say is the AI, because after some time playing you'll be able notice some tricks that make fighting the monsters much easier. Other than that, it's a great game that fullfills prettymuch everthing about sounds/graphics and any other in-game characterists for the year that this game came and for considering that it was made by an indie company.I totally recommend it.

												I thought at first that the simple grid based navigation and 90 degree view transitions would have been a hindrance to immersion. I was completely wrong. The navigation makes this game what it is, and you spend a lot of time figuring out the right combination of moves to avoid obstacles and conquer the AI. The game is tough as well, and one of the first in a long time where I found myself forced to explore beyond save points, then reload the save points to actually progress (albeit, mostly due to running out of food or mana). Give this a try if you want a new RPG experience.			"

Not to mention the amazing one song soundtrack (That menu will be the best menu you've ever listened to, my friend). If you like this style of game, this will be the game of your dreams that you will never get tired of. Otherwise, it's still a fun experience that can at least get you a few hours of gameplay before you get tired of all those spiders and crabs. Even if you only aim to play through the main story once, that's at least fifteen hours of gameplay right there (or so I'm led to believe, I've never beat it; gave up after the fire demons).			"

												I am seriously loving this game a ton. It's almost completely about exploration, although the combat is well-tuned too (albeit it'll stick you in some of the douchiest situations sometimes, though). I highly recommend playing this game with headphones and in the dark, because then it has an almost horror element added to it due to the amazing atmostphere generated by the environment and the ambience, as well as the knowledge that you'll have to fight incredibly difficult enemies in not always the best of conditions.

Very fun game, and a very different experience from most on the market today.			"

The combat is fun and interesting, its fast paced enough to keep you on your toes, but slow enough to give you time to do things like brew a potion on the fly or swap out weapons. The controls can take a little getting used to, but its overall simplicity is a godsend in an age of Menus: the RPG.

												Ok, so you remember the old-school first-person dungeon crawlers? It's one of those, and it's excellent.Oh, wait, you said ""no""? Oh, well, let me break it down for you. It's an RPG with light story, grid-based movement, puzzles and exploration a-plenty, and monsters intent on ruining your day at every turn. You know The Elder Scrolls? It's not like that. You don't go on quests, you don't visit towns, you don't save the world. You get one massive dungeon that you and your party of four wander through in a ceaseless battle for survival and escape. The game is hard for the modern gamer. It requires careful planning, strategy, and knowing a few things about RPGs (fire wrecks undead, poison is wasted on spiders, etc.), but every battle is rewarding.If you want something old (or something new, depending on your gaming history), grab this. It's incredible, and there's the promise of custom dungeons on the horizon, so you'll have plenty more exploring to do in the future. Good luck.			"

												Do not underestimate this game: it is tough. Even on easy, the puzzles become daunting, the monsters brutal, and your party's resources frighteningly scarce. If you're not careful to level up your characters efficiently right out of the gates you'll find yourself trapped in grinding mode until you're able to progress...but be warned: your food dwindles at an alarming rate and is every bit as elusive as any other form of aid. It's a no-joke type situation, and a person would do well to get into this with the mindset of committing to a hardcore adventure.Nonetheless, I find the challenge a good thing. It's refreshing to have to think in a video game again and quite rewarding when you manage to proceed to another floor. You can spend a huge amount of time playing this game too--plenty of levels, lots of achievements, tons of brain teasing puzzles, plenty of weapons and gear to scavenge and disburse amongst your characters. While not for the faint of heart, this game gets my thumbs-up.			"

												This is a great ""old school like"" RPG: the already good ""campaign"" is complemented by the goodness you can find on Steam Workshop, which arguably gives this game more than it's money worth. In this game you control a party of four prisoners in first person, which all move simultaneously along a grid ( which means you can go one square forward/left/right/back at a time, but not diagonally ). The classes available are the classic Warrior, Rogue and Mage. Each character has attributes ( Strength, Dexterity, ... ), skills ( Axes, Air Magic, ... ) and two choosable traits ( perks ) plus racial traits. Combat is real time, and magic is casted by selecting a valid combination or 9 runes.			"

												A great tribute to oldschool dungeon crawlers (the kind I grew up with in the late 80s and early 90s).  I think it definitely helps to have been a fan of tabletop stuff like D&D and Warhammer (which I'm thankful to my father for, for raising me on) to really appreciate how cool this game is.  It's just as much about strategy and timing as it is hunting for loot.  A nice mix between easy, almost obvious puzzles and puzzles that will have you face-palming in frustration.If you're like me and you were raised on high fantasy, classic computer games and tabletop strategy, the nostalgia factor will be very high.

												Ok, so you remember the old-school first-person dungeon crawlers? It's one of those, and it's excellent.Oh, wait, you said ""no""? Oh, well, let me break it down for you. It's an RPG with light story, grid-based movement, puzzles and exploration a-plenty, and monsters intent on ruining your day at every turn. You know The Elder Scrolls? It's not like that. You don't go on quests, you don't visit towns, you don't save the world. You get one massive dungeon that you and your party of four wander through in a ceaseless battle for survival and escape. The game is hard for the modern gamer. It requires careful planning, strategy, and knowing a few things about RPGs (fire wrecks undead, poison is wasted on spiders, etc.), but every battle is rewarding.If you want something old (or something new, depending on your gaming history), grab this. It's incredible, and there's the promise of custom dungeons on the horizon, so you'll have plenty more exploring to do in the future. Good luck.			"

												Do not underestimate this game: it is tough. Even on easy, the puzzles become daunting, the monsters brutal, and your party's resources frighteningly scarce. If you're not careful to level up your characters efficiently right out of the gates you'll find yourself trapped in grinding mode until you're able to progress...but be warned: your food dwindles at an alarming rate and is every bit as elusive as any other form of aid. It's a no-joke type situation, and a person would do well to get into this with the mindset of committing to a hardcore adventure.Nonetheless, I find the challenge a good thing. It's refreshing to have to think in a video game again and quite rewarding when you manage to proceed to another floor. You can spend a huge amount of time playing this game too--plenty of levels, lots of achievements, tons of brain teasing puzzles, plenty of weapons and gear to scavenge and disburse amongst your characters. While not for the faint of heart, this game gets my thumbs-up.			"

I think it definitely helps to have been a fan of tabletop stuff like D&D and Warhammer (which I'm thankful to my father for, for raising me on) to really appreciate how cool this game is.  It's just as much about strategy and timing as it is hunting for loot.  A nice mix between easy, almost obvious puzzles and puzzles that will have you face-palming in frustration.If you're like me and you were raised on high fantasy, classic computer games and tabletop strategy, the nostalgia factor will be very high.

												Easily a 9/10.Definitely worth the full price.At first I bought this game during a steam sale and forgot about it, but after burning myself out of a couple of other RPGs I noticed I had this game still practically untouched. The combat is fun and interesting, its fast paced enough to keep you on your toes, but slow enough to give you time to do things like brew a potion on the fly or swap out weapons. The controls can take a little getting used to, but its overall simplicity is a godsend in an age of Menus: the RPG. It would not have much replayability if not for the robust steam workshop integration. The game is pretty light on the story and allows you do get right to the heart of this Dungeon-Crawler without worrying too much about the details.Overall an excellent experience.			"

												This game is amazing, I really like it, I put a few hours into it so far nd I am loving every minute of it. The combat is very well done, and although its turn based, the fact you can move around to avoid damage is very good. Also having the 2 front line characters and 2 back line characters makes it so you can strategically place your characters the way you want. I made to fighters  with one being really tanky and the other one having a bit more damage to go in my front line and a mage and rogue for my back line, and I find it a very good setup. Theres 4 races. Human, Minotaur, Insectoid, and Lizard man, and each has their own strengths and weakness. Human is balanced all around, but isn't the best at one specific class, Minotaur is more tanky, but has low dexterity so they have a low starting hit rate, making them good tanks, Lizard man has high dexterity, but lower strength, making them better rogues, and Insectoid has higher willpower, making them better mages.Of course you don't have to make a character based off their stats. You could for example make a Lizard man fighter that has high dexterity, but lower strength, or a Minotaur rogue that has more health and damage, but hits less,  or all humans for all around classes. It may not be as reccomended, but would work. Also honestly the game allows you to import your own photos, only the specs make up each race, so you could essentially have 4 anime chicks if you really wanted. Overall it is a great game, and is very fun, and addicting. It has great gameplay, great sound deseign with the ambient soundtrack, pretty decent graphics that are pretty enough, but also not too demanding for those that have lower end pcs can play, engaging puzzles and the enviroment is nice, even if it is just a dungeon it really fits the game, and although there isn't much to the story, it is just enough to fit the style of this game. I would highly reccomend this game. 10/10			"

												I thought at first that the simple grid based navigation and 90 degree view transitions would have been a hindrance to immersion. I was completely wrong. The navigation makes this game what it is, and you spend a lot of time figuring out the right combination of moves to avoid obstacles and conquer the AI. The game is tough as well, and one of the first in a long time where I found myself forced to explore beyond save points, then reload the save points to actually progress (albeit, mostly due to running out of food or mana). Give this a try if you want a new RPG experience.			"

												This is the first dungeon-crawler that I've played and I gotta say that I'll be playing many more of this genre again. A very immersive experience and even some scare jumps are things that you can find in Legend of grimrock. It has good looking dungeons and some quite challenging puzzles on every level. The only con that I would say is the AI, because after some time playing you'll be able notice some tricks that make fighting the monsters much easier. Other than that, it's a great game that fullfills prettymuch everthing about sounds/graphics and any other in-game characterists for the year that this game came and for considering that it was made by an indie company.I totally recommend it.

LEGEND OF GRIMROCKA first-person dungeon crawler set in a series of underground labyrinths, filled with monsters, puzzles and traps.Rating 7/10A throwback to the early 90s role-playing games like Eye of the Beholder, Ultima Underworld and Stonekeep. Whilst in many ways Legend of Grimrock is a homage to those early games it's worth buying not just for nostalgia but because it's a great game in it's own right.In updating the classic formula they haven't changed much, grid-based movement, advancing one tile at a time with 90 degree turns. The party consists of four different characters spread across three classes, the fighters in the front row and the more vulnerable mage and Rogue in the back row. The two in the front row will deal the most damage and take the most damage via melee combat, the two characters in the back row can use magic and ranged attacks. It's a fine balance and timing is key in order to keep your party alive. Combat suffers from the same limitations as it did in the games Grimrock is trying to re-create, wait for the enemy to enter the tile in front of you before unleashing all of your attacks then back away or strafe sideways before they have a chance to return damage. Rinse and repeat. There are obviously times this strategy doesn't always work such as being surrounded by three or more enemies or backing into a dead end but it's the strategy you'll end up using the most. It worked back in the 90s and it still works now. There is a story loosely attached but it's not really important, this is a dungeon crawler at heart and the fun comes from fighting your way through and solving puzzles in each new level of the dungeon. There are no quests to speak of other than to survive the dungeon. During the game you pick up clues and lore via letters left by a previous prisoner called Toorum, it's a simple but effective way of building up some atmosphere and history to the adventure.It's a bit too easy and a bit too short. I completed the game twice unlocking all achievements, completing my second play through on Hard Boiled and Doin' It Old School and even then I completed it with little effort. Aside from making the game longer I felt it would have benefited from a few NPCs, something Stonekeep did to great effect. It would have broken up the game play a bit and offered something different. However these are fairly minor disappointments to what is otherwise a superb game.Looking forward to Legend of Grimrock 2.			"

It is simply one of my favorite games on steam, it is well built, steam workshopped and completly taking on the old genre making it an interesting advance in technology while keeping the fun of a dungeon crawler. The last boss is dissapointing, but the secrets, achievements and other interesting feature this game gives is making it worth every penny.10/10even though the boss is.. Rather dissapointing, the story and the way they introduce it is  well played.			"

												What can I say about Legend of Grimlock... Playing on computers since commodore 64 I have always loved games. One genre that sucked so much of my life away as a kid was dungeon crawlers. Floor after floor of single step adventure, never knowing when something will cross your path. The terror of when something is standing deep in that barely lit hall. Every step followed by theres until the faceoff tells who will step once more. This games has it all wrapped in new beautiful graphics. EVERY thing that I loved, All that I hated. I highly recommend it to any fan of the old dungeon crawler genre. I might even go as far as saying you are doing yourself a disservice by bypassing this one.			"

												One of my favorite indie gamesA grind based dungeon crawler, aparently based on some old school games ive never played, but if they are anywhere near as good as legend of grimrock ive missed outWithin the game you control a party of 4 characters at the same time and move in first person through square grind based dungeons, the game has a great degree of micromanagement, you use the different attacks of your party members individually, they suffer from different status effects, they all have their own stats and they all suffer from hunger and carrying limitations, not to mention since your characters are set up in a square formation within the square grind you are on attacks from different directions affect different party members, learning to balance all of this is pivotal to successthe dungeons in this game are all well designed with clever puzzles and some nice settings. The combat in the game is for the most part decent, it can get a little boring agaisnt single enemies, since running around em is usually enough, but when multiple enemies are present it becomes really challenging, since you must maneuver the environment skillfully to avoid getting trapped and having your weakest party members killed. Your party members can belong to 4 races and 3 different classes, each with their own characteristics, the mage class is a standout, offering the most interesting and challenging combat of all classes. The game in general is very hard but fair, with only a couple of traps and situations id describe as cheapWhen it comes to graphics, they are somewhat simple but pleasing to the eye, with an adequate amount of detail on screen and a good art direction, its understandably claustrophobic but this goes well with the game's setting and mechanics, i guess one flaw on this regard is the fact we are dealing with the overly familiar middle ages fantasy setting herethe game has a very long campaign, it took me around 19 hours to finish the main campaign and i didnt even find all the secrets, you can start a new game with different party configurations and the game has steam workshop support with over 700 custom dungeons, this thing has some serious replay valuefantastic game overall, my mayor complain is the fact a game like this begs for randomization and yet it has none, it could really benefit for random dungeons with random loot, random spells, random enemies in random locations, but well i guess the game couldnt have these brilliant puzzles otherwise, and the steam workshop support does alleviate this shortcoming a bit﻿			"

												I really enjoyed this game other then some weird flaws that I felt were in the mechanics of the game.Straight up tanking the ememys is for the most part impossible unless you build the right team and know what perks to go after quick in the game. Most noobs wont know this, so the game becomes about running around to avoid getting attacked, shutting doors on enemys after you have attack to wait to attack again, and so on. I feel this kinda takes away from the game alote and give an odd dull feel. There seems to be lots of replayable contect and playing the game secend time around can still offer some fun on the harder difficulty  and building a team better then what the stock game offers you the first time.

												A fantastic old-school first person dungeon crawler full of hidden passages, complex puzzles, and difficult combat. The graphics and sound design are amazing considering the game is only 600mbs. Most of the music is ambience leading to a calm gameplay experience... until a skeleton rushes around a corner and makes you jump. Old style games like this have a terror of their own with the lighting and sound effects. When your torch goes out, it is pitch black until your characters ""eyes"" adjust and even then you can barely see. The only real complaint I have is the combat can be frustrating when you get body-blocked into a corner or are simply overpowered because of poor stat placement or equip.If you go into this expecting ""Amnesia with swords"" instead of ""Skyrim without towns"" you will have a great experience. Be prepared for a game that wants to beat you down; save often and take map notes because you will need all the help you can get.			"

Legend of Grimrock is a dungeon crawling role playing game with an oldschool heart but a modern execution. A group of prisoners are sentenced to certain death by exiling them to the secluded Mount Grimrock for vile crimes they may or may not have committed. Unbeknownst to their captors, the mountain is riddled with ancient tunnels, dungeons and tombs built by crumbled civilizations long perished now. If they ever wish to see daylight again and reclaim their freedom the ragtag group of prisoners must form a team and descend through the mountain, level by level. - Highly Recommended!			"

												A great and well rounded game that has just the right amout of difficulty and unforgiveness. Reminds me a lot of table top Dungeons and Dragons. My only complaint is there is hardly a punishment for death. When a character dies they can still hold torches and their inventory can still be opened. If I were to change something about this game it would be that dead characters can't hold torches(or provide light in any way) and also make it so either the dead character's inventory becomes locked or their inventory is split up into the other party members. Other than that I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys dungeons and dragons, dungeon crawlers, and even rogue likes. I give it a solid 9/10.			"

												I bought this game to relive the EOB experience and for a few hours LoG was a positive experience.But along with the combat, discovery and puzzles, the developers opted to throw in twitch-inducing speed puzzles that don't work well on many graphics card - and lead to endless frustrations for gamers who don't want a mouse-mashing race. And even if you finally solve speed puzzle A and B, C, D, E and many more will follow.With so many games to play I decided trying to beat the speed puzzles was not the way I want to go.

												Legend of Grimrock is an accessible dungeon crawler with fun and engrossing puzzles; the kind of puzzles that aren't complicated but require a decent understanding of the point-and-click mechanics. Unfortunately most of the underwhelming puzzles require hugging the wall and hunting down hidden wall switches.The RPG mechanics are pretty barebones. The combat consist of mindless clicking and side-stepping. You'll most likely never reach the end level class skills in your first playthough without excessive grinding. The only redeemable aspect of combat is the spellcasting system. In Grimrock, using magic spells require you enter the correct combinations of runes, as if you are dialing them on a keypad. Learning new rune combinations through the scrolls found in the dungeon is always an enjoyable treat. I only beat the main campaign but it took me roughly 10 hours not counted on Steam as my internet connection was down for a period of time. The user submitted workshop dungeons could hypothetically add even more unique playtime with this but I haven't had a clue if they are as good as the main game. Grimrock is well worth the full price by itself, though.One final note is that if you are of faint of heart you might not enjoy this game as it throws you a ton of creepy creatures that run around in the darkness of the dungeon.

The vanilla game it is not very easy and you will need skill in this oldschool game, also orientation AND patience. Very most  if you grasp to unlock quite all Steam achievements with just one playthrough :)I rate this game with a 8/10- 1 point for the lack of music in the game, killing the atmosphere.- 1 point for the repetitive monsters and items			"

												One of the first birthdays i can remember, i was given ""Dungeons & Dragons: Warriors of the Eternal Sun"" for the sega mega drive, and played that game well into my teens and it left a huge footprint on gaming for me, mostly the dungeon networks within the game i spent hours trying to explore.  I saw a few screenshots of ""Legend of Grimrock"", and that was all i could think of. After playing it, It seems like a complete graphical overhaul of the traditional dungeon crawler mechanics, with more puzzles and exploring to do.The addition of mods (steam workshop) will bring fresh life into this game for a long time. I found the official level (story?) a bit hard to get into. But tried a go at some of the dungeons made by other players and found those more entertaining at the beggining.

												So, you want an old school RPG adventure ? This is it ! Legend Of Grimrock starts you off with 4 prisoners, in a mountain, consisting of 13 levels. These levels are filled with puzzles, evil creatures, traps and more and, obviously, it gets increasingly difficult along the way.However, the difficulty is a bit random at times. Near the end it took me literally minutes to take down one enemy, even though I had some proper spells and weapons. There are moments where you will be overwhelmed by quite a few enemies. Remember to save often, and try not to lose any of your party members before you reached the end of a level. I had to finish a level with just one rogue and it took me 3-4x longer than it should've.The game can be finished in about 10-12 hours (in-game time) but in reality it should take you about twice as long. You will die several times, and some puzzles require thinking, experimenting or just plain luck. But despite the difficulty, I did have a great time with it ![Rating: 82/100]			"

												A modern take on the old-school tile-based dungeon crawler, was something of a surprise hit. Blending a close to perfect mix of horror, suspense, mystery, puzzles, and combat, Legend of Grimrock enticed my inner adventurer. The game itself is quite enjoyable, the grim-dark atmosphere lends itself perfectly to the setting, and the tile-based movement adds an interesting mechanic to it all. The is a game where you will make mistakes, there’s no avoiding that, you will fumble and fall and lose party members and grumble as you backtrack to a crystal. You’ll jump and curse when spiders sneak up on you, groan and rage as traps trigger and surround you with enemies, and kick yourself for not saving more often. You’ll experiment in the skill tree and find out that you’ve invested in something useless, or that you’ve given points wrong, or expended one-use items on the wrong character. Sometimes you’ll wish you’d taken the other loot, or wondered what was in the other locked room, so you’ll reload and find out, then compare before reloading again and deciding. You’ll rage as monsters surround you, you’ll rage as you find a character suddenly out of ammo, mana, poisoned, or just plain dead. You’ll rage as you run from Ogres, you’ll rage as Fire Elementals hit your back-row characters, you’ll rage as you’re confronted with new horrors the dungeon has to offer. But most of all, you will rage at the puzzles.The game does not hold your hand, which is both beautiful and mildly infuriating at times. There’s a lot of trial an error when it comes to solving puzzles, and you will die a lot trying. But that’s what this game is, a lot of trial and error. It can be harsh, but it’s never unfair, so long as you use your brain and save every 5 minutes. The only genuine complaint I have with the game is the inventory/loot system; space was simple to manage so long as you saved your sacks and boxes, but the weight mechanic was a little challenging at times, when I discover that the Kayran Nipple I just looted and put in a character’s inventory has weighed them down and has made the party slow as hell. What really got me was that there was no loot selling or anything like that, things just became obsolete and you had no reason to keep them, other than maybe convenient replacements for rocks.All in all I love this game to death, and had that rare compulsion to play it every second I had free time, though the game is best enjoyed, in my opinion, in longer sessions. That way you remember all the little details you were going over and you don’t miss out on something. That being said, I went over the entire dungeon with a fine-toothed come and still managed to miss some secrets, as the statistics will tell you. Half-way through my first playthrough I realized my lizardman rogue was relatively useless when I could have just gone double fighter mage combo, since I had teched him into ranged and throwing. And that was a mistake. You MUST specialize your character if you want to survive, if you choose to go down swords, you stick with swords, if you want axes, don’t switch out for maces because you found one and it was better, and try to keep to one or two disciplines of magic.For anyone who likes grim-dark fantasy, dungeon crawling, RPG’s, mystery, puzzles, and/or tile-based combat, Legend of Grimrock is definitely a must. Your inner loot-♥♥♥♥♥ will be pleased, your inner puzzler will be perplexed, and your inner adventurer will be grinning all the while. Enter Mount Grimrock, and make your way to the horrors within, best of luck.   "

												9/10 So i bought this game a while ago, but didn't really start logging many hours into it until recently. This game is great--if you're a fan of oldschool dungeon crawler games, I highly suggest you look into the Legend of Grimrock series. A few notes:-This game is fairly easy to add content to, such as extra player portraits-Does not lag, seems to run pretty well on most machines-You can choose to fill in the map as you go, classic style-Doesn't have turn based gameplay, but rather each character has a cooldown on their weapons-Spell system is intrigueing and somewhat reminiscent of magicka-Straightforward gameplay-Challenging without being unnecessarily difficult-Graphics are okay, not top of the class but still decentIf you like puzzles or dungeon crawlers, you'll like this game. Try it.			"

												""Why aren't you playing Skyrim instead"" came to mind when I played this for the first time. Nostalgia is why. This is oldskool gaming so those new to this may find it a little simplistic. I played the classic Dungeon Master for ages on my Atari ST and thought it was the best thing. Ever. LoG has simple controls (makes a nice change these days) and you move around in a shuffling chess like fashion. My imagination was working a little more than it usually is picturing my hairy Warrior clad in his leather pants and brandishing a brutal looking cudgel. You can customise the portraits (Homer Simpson as Warrior anyone?) so you could have the Dixie Chicks going around whacking the heck out of everything. Remember to use the quick save often because death is permanent.  It would be a better World if there was a tablet version of this.			"

												A throwback game to old-school Dungeon Crawler RPGs, Legend of Grimrock easily succeeds at that, with a feature that, I feel, should’ve been in all those old-school Dungeon Crawlers of Yesteryear. It plays like one, it has absolutely no music, but rather, ambient sounds like none of them, it has hard fighting monsters like one, and in this review, that’s only scratching the surface. Let’s dig a bit deeper, and see what this game really offers.Gameplay: As mentioned earlier, Legend of Grimrock is a throwback to the old-school Dungeon Crawlers of the late 80s to the early 90s (or at least, I think that’s when these games were hot) and it succeeds at what it set out to do, too. It’s setting is that of Mount Grimrock, a large dungeon inside a mountain, and every bit of it is in first-person. The combat is somewhat fast-paced, but not so fast that you have to be faster than greased lightning to be able to get through fights. Their are helpful hints, if a bit obscure in places, that tell you how to proceed, and plenty of puzzles and traps to slog your way through. Story: The story in Legend of Grimrock feels a lot more fleshed-out than those games from which it takes its inspiration, such as the Dungeon Master games. Basically, though, the whole story amounts to this: you and your party members are prisoners convicted of an unknown crime, and you have been promised your freedom if you can escape from the dungeons of Mount Grimrock. Problems is, is that no one has ever managed to escape from Mount Grimrock, or at least, those who’ve been pardoned in this manner never have. It’s cliché, yes, but it works as a good driving force, because you’ll want to see what the King or whoever it is that sentenced your party to be pardoned in this way since you’ll inevitably be the first ones to ever escape this fate, right? But it actually goes deeper than that, because your party has dreams telling them of an original prisoner in the dungeon who knows the way out. I won’t say anymore on the story, because then I’d have to spoil it for you, and that wouldn’t be any fun, now would it?Music: As I said earlier, this game only has one particular song, and it only plays on the title screen. It’s pretty good, too!Graphics: The graphics look like about what you’d be expecting from a Dungeon Crawler that takes its inspiration from Dungeon Master, but with a modern day take on them. They look like graphics that you’d see in a modern day game.Now, that’s everything that’s in the game itself, but the game’s true strength really shines with the built-in Dungeon Editor. That’s right! Now you can make the Dungeon Master dungeons of your dreams with a bit more interactivity, thanks to Lua scripting and the Drag-and-Drop editing power of the Dungeon Editor for Legend of Grimrock.Overall, an amazing successor to the old-school Dungeon Crawlers of Yesteryear, Legend of Grimrock is an obvious success, and it’s one in which I hope you can escape the shackles that will undoubtedly hold you to it and keep you coming back for more!

												Nostalgia FTW.  This will bring back fond memories of the dungeon crawlers of yore.  They even have a mode where there is no automap so you can sharpen your pencils and get out the graph paper (with an achievement for completing the game this way, naturally).   The setup is basic - you create 4 characters, chosing between classes (Fighter, Rogue, Mage) and races (human, minotaur, insectoid, and lizardmen).  You have the basic stats such as strength, dexterity, willpower, and vitality, and are given a pool of points to assign them at the beginning as well as selecting a couple of traits to your character (Athletic, agile, strong mind, etc).  Your initial stats will only be increased by leveling up skills - and they display the complete tree and bonuses earned with each level so you can plan accordingly.  For the base game, there is a good mix of combat and puzzles to solve, though items and maps are static - no random loot here.  However, the game comes with a dungeon editor and there is a healthy selection in the Steam Workshop to give you plenty of replayability.I've beaten the game twice - the second time was a bit of achievement farming as well as trying different character builds.  The sound is adequate - no award winning voicework apart from some grunts, there are just a couple of cutscenes, all of which can be clicked through very quickly, and the bones of the story are pretty bare.  You're all convicts that have been awarded a pardon - which you receive once you are cast into the pit at the top of Mount Grimrock.  From there, you are working your way down, following the path of some other criminal who left notes behind that provide a little bit of background, clues to puzzles, and so on. This is NOT turn-based - you click each character's action and wait for the cooldowns to expire before that character can act again. As such, you can maneuver around in combat, dodging, moving out of range, or even circling around behind the enemy for a backstabbing attack (if your rogue has that skill).I recommend the game for fans of the old RPG crawlers.

												Wizardry inspired gameplay with a friendly interface.  Atmosphere is intense.  The semi-turn based play is perfectly timed to make the dungeon dangerous.  Skills procide customization beyond the 3 base classes, keeping race selection vital. Magic is difficult yet fun.  A party well balanced to your personal style helps immensely.  Now I wish Wizardry would take some cues from Grimrock!  ~ This from an alpha tester.  Has charm similar to Etrian Odessey.   A great game for players new to  dungeon crawling or veterans alike.Auto-map: off.  Graph paper: Go!			"

												Ok, I just marathoned through Grimrock 1 and 2 and thought I would conclude that with a concise review.In short : the games are unbelievably good. Admittedly, this was the first time I've ever played a first person dungeon crawler with classic grid-based movement, but there is very little I can actually criticize.The puzzles are extremely well designed. Even though it usually took me few minutes to go from ""This ♥♥♥♥ makes no sense at all, what the hell!"" to ""ohhhh, I get it!"", it felt all the more rewarding when I finally managed to solve a particularly difficult puzzle all on my own.The first game manages to create a great gloomy atmosphere, when you delve into pitch black dungeons, devoid of any other human being, and when you can hear the various critters crawl somewhere on the other side of a wall. I would even say, it's not too far off from what a horror game feels like.The successor has a much more open and interconnected world, with differently themed areas, both above and below the surface, similar to how the first Dark Souls approached level design (including the bit where you aimlessly wander around in already cleared areas, looking for the entrance to the next dungeon). It may not be quite as eerie as the first Grimrock game, but the first mimic you encounter in the game will make sure to give you a heart attack regardless.The only thing left to say is : Don't play them on hard mode on your first play through, like I did, or else you're in for a lot of frustration. The games do have a few really cheap moments, the second one even more so than the first one. Because if there's one thing the developers really like, it's trying to make you fall down into a monster infested trap pit, which spells inevitable death. Few things are more infuriating than finding and activating a hidden switch on a wall, only to be mauled by a dozen monsters crawling in from all directions a few seconds later. Now, combine that with an incredibly clunky combat system (Grid-based attacks and movement. In real time. Why...?) which in itself poses enough of a challenge, when enemies can kill your front line in two hits, and you'll find yourself dangerously close to throwing something valuable out of the window. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who would have loved to have turn based battles, like in Wizardry 8 for example, in these games.			"

												This is how a dungeon crawler is done. It's really old school with lots of modern elements.So, what's the story? Well, there sort of isn't a story, ok, yes, there is, but it's not so essential to the main plot. The plot is that three people accused of crimes are thrown into a dunegon and must escape. So they must survive while there are monsters everywhere, disgusting food, a strange dream that happens sometimes when you rest, creepy sounds and amazing atmosphere. The graphics add so much to the atmosphere too because they look very amazing and somehow this game runs very well on my terrible PC. I wish more games did that.There are 3 main parts to this game and I will review each aspect one by one:CombatPuzzle SolvingExplorationCombat-The combat in this game is an old school style one, you're party is in 4 people all linked together and you walk on square tiles. You have to gather up weapons from monsters, hidden rooms and exploring the place as so. The magic combat system and the magic system in general is you have to combine a certain combination of runes. You can find these combinations on scrolls which you find and by leveling up the certain types of skills in the game. Speaking of the skills, the skills are pretty much subclasses in classes. The 3 classes in this game are fighter, rouge and mage. (There's a fourth one too but you will have to discover that for yourself) Each class has different abilities, attributes, purposes, uses, etc. There's also traits you can have on each character. There's lots to choose from and some races have their own trait. The 4 races are Human, Minotaur, Lizardman and Insectoid. Each are good for their own class, like how the Lizardman makes a good rogue and how the minotaur makes a good fighter.Puzzle solving-The puzzles in this game are diffucult. I had a LONG time trying to solve them. But after solving all of them, it was all worth it since it was fun and rewarding.Exploration-Without exploration, I don't think this game would've been so great. There are TONS of secrets everywhere. Some are easy to find, some take forever to find. For all those loot lovers out there, you will love this game because of all the loot and what it takes to get it. To go into a little more depth of exploration is the moving system, to turn you can't just turn all the way around, to do that, you would have to turn sideways and look sideways again since you look always in a 90 degree angle.To conclude, I would love to say Legend of Grimrock is a great modern day game and I would recommend it to anyone.

												If you were a fan of the Dungeon Keeper, Eye of the Beholder and Lands of Lore series of games and you're longing for more of that classic style of game play, you can't go wrong with this game. It'll take you right back to the 90s!That said, it's main draw is puzzle solving. The combat isn't as gripping nowadays, and there is very little in the way of plot or mood or story. I'm at the 4th level of the dungeon, but I'm not sure if I still have the time/patience for this sort of game when games like Divinity: Original Sin await my attention...			"

												Grimrock is a really fun game that harkens back to the Bard's Tale type games that I used to play on the C64 back in High School.  Great dungeon crawler with a good story and RPG elements.  Fun and interesting levels to explore that are fortunately not so complicated that you'd need graph paper for mapping.  The only thing I didn't like was that to defeat enemies past a certain point you often have to sort of strafe and attack to kill them - I don't mind fighting like that in a more action game, but for a game like this, that mechanic felt a little out of place.  Still, a great game for an old school type dungeon crawler RPG.  Highly recommended.			"

												Giving a simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down to Legend of Grimrock seems to me to miss the point of the game; it was consciously designed for a very specific audience, and your enjoyment will depend upon your belonging to said audience. I'd describe Grimrock as a puzzle game with an RPG overlay. You're dumped on top of a mountain and have to fight and puzzle your way through a series of dungeon levels in order to get to the exit at the bottom. There's an opening graphic about being condemned to the maze and offered a slim chance at survival as punishment for unspecified crimes, like eating puppies or promoting Justin Bieber's music or somesuch. Unimportant; it's a reason for your four-person party to wind up stuck in a dungeon. Players of the Recent Might and Magic X: Legacy will find it has less involved, less tactically sophisticated combat but much tougher puzzles (it pains me to admit that I got stumped fairly early on); you look for a hidden switch that opens a door somewhere on the other end of the level that leads to a dead end with another switch disguised as a torch sconce that when pulled opens the gate you saw three turns back which leads to a scrap of paper with a password on it for that magical barrier you couldn't get past before...I've given Legend of Grimrock a thumbs-up because it seems to do what it set out to do: it provides a series of tougher and tougher dungeon puzzles for the player to obsess over, with some simple combat to leaven it. The game's a bit like extra-dark chocolate in that respect: people who already find it to their taste will love it, while people who don't will find it has a bitter, gritty flavour that sort of reminds them of something they like.

												Legend of Grimrock is one of a very small litter of games that attempts to create a classic dungeon crawler similar to those of the old days such as Dungeon Master and succeeds in not only emulating that style, but updating it enough to make it a refreshing experience for modern gamers, as well as a familiar one.A feature I found to be charming (as well as terrifying) was the option to play the game on a Classic difficulty that forces you to draw your own maps out on grid paper, much like old pen-and-paper tabletop games. I myself haven't been brave enough to give this playthrough a try yet, but I still find it to be a wonderful option for true gluttons of punishment.As deeply rewarding as it is challenging, with lots of replay value, and great Steam Workshop options to keep the game new for even the most frequent players, LoG is a for sure winner. I'll be eagerly awaiting the release of the second game, ready to brave the dangers between the dungeon walls once more.			"

												Fantastic game!Dungeon crawler deluxe. Hard to come by these days. If you like RPG and old school games, this can't go wrong. The game could of course always have been bigger, but you can choose what dungeon to play, if there were more available.Many hours of fun, for a cheap price. I really hope for more dungeons and classes and spells and all.Great buy!			"

												Even though I am or used to be an avid fan of old school dungeon crawlers, this one was disappointing for a reason I can't really tell. Sometimes a game just does not click with your imagination. Or isn't fun. Or you expect too much because of the hype. Not sure. In this case I don't think the game was worth the money spent.			"

												$15 or less gets you a remarkably well-designed retro-style dungeon crawler, complete with a four player party (of Humans, Minotaurs, Lizardmen and Insectoids), a wide range of devious traps and puzzles (which you really don't see in RPGs anymore), and some very challenging fights.It has all of the features of a classic first-person RPG - tile-based movement, dying of starvation, reading bits of the story off scrolls, and the like - mixed with the accessibility and graphics of a modern, big-ish budget RPG...so it's both nostaglic and a refreshing change of pace for the genre? Eh, I'm crapping on, just buy it.			"

												Not since Portal have I played a puzzle game that made me feel both stupid and empowered when I figured out the answer was right in front of my face. Legend of Grimrock combines an old-school dungeon crawler mixed with puzzles and RPG elements.  Synopsis: You control a group of 4 prisoners trying to escape Grimrock by solving puzzles and fighting monsters. Puzzles can be as simple as a hidden button on a wall or as complex that things may take time and patience to solve. Gameplay: The best way I can describe this game is if you mixed D&D and Myst, with tons of aggravation. The Legend of Grimrock isn’t as one dimensional as the art style and movement may lead you to believe. Many of the puzzles will leave you scratching your head and swearing there isn’t a solution. The other aspect of the game which I believe could use some work is the battle system. As intricate as the puzzles can be, the system to fight monsters throughout gets repetitive and leaves a lot to be desired. It’s a mix between real time and turn based, with a focus on the formation of your team. If your characters use all short range abilities, you have to swap one of the two, for the one you want to attack. Many monsters can be defeated without much strategy and sometimes become a hindrance to trying to solve a puzzle. There are four classes you can choose from as you customize your perfect party, but very little direction or tutorial on how to use each class. I found myself having to look up a guide on how to use a mage to even understand what magic could be used. I have logged thirty-eight hours on this title (some of it was afk during a multiplayer game), but at less than $5, 20 hours of engrossing gameplay and a strong community following, this game is more than worth it.Positive: +Challenging puzzles are intricate enough to make you feel clever+Game can be saved at any point.+Large community following where content can be downloaded.Negative-Battle system can get repetitive.-Not all classes are created equal. Art Style/Graphics:  Think old school, first person, dungeon crawler. This game is a great blend of classic nostalgia with a jolt of current 3d graphics. Much of the game in spent in the darkness with two to three walls around you, but this doesn’t mean the creators were lazy. Attention is paid to simple cracks in the wall, to how the light bounces off each wall. To speak more about the lighting; this plays a huge role on the tone of the gameplay. The torches on the walls (or the ones you drop on the ground) limit vision to what can be around the next turn, which makes you feel like you are actually there.Positive:+Lighting is engaging.+Can be played on lower-end computers.+Can be played in Windowed ModeNegative:-Characters and enemies could be upgraded.Soundtrack/Sound effects: This was one of the biggest negatives to the game for me. For the 20 hours I played, much of the time was spent trying to solve puzzles. To solve puzzles you have to explore the dungeon, often falling to lower parts. Hearing my characters yell as they were falling, over and over, got very annoying. This is only increased by the often reused sounds of the characters attacking and grunting in every fight they encounter. On a positive note, the minor sounds of metal doors closing, walls moving, or crackling of the fire, add a realistic aspect and can be heard in surround sound.Positive:+Simple sounds of environment Negative:-Repetitive Cost: I personally bought this game in a Humble Bundle (only paying $5), but that being said, I would wait for this game to go on sale. $14 (full price) is a bit too much for the amount of gameplay in the standalone. At 75% off ($3.75) a case can be made. This does not include the amount of community related additions on the workshop; which is extensivePositive:+HUGE community created contentNegative:-Full price not worth standalone "

												For years I've been wanting to play a modernized old school first person dungeon crawl/RPGs. I tried going back and playing older ones like might and magic games but they just don't cut it over time. All I can say is Legend of Grimrock is EXACTLY what I've been waiting for. It takes all the fun, excitement, and strategy out of those old games and brings it to the current level of gameplay. It removes all the buggyness of older games, it replaces the confusingly blurred graphics where it's easy to miss an important item with beautiful design, poor puzzles with strategic challenges, choppy fighting with challenging battles, etc. I LOVED this game, I had so much fun playing it, and with the added function of a popular mod community and a dungeon editor it is really a top tier experience. If you like RPGs, or dungeon crawls, or have been craving what I have then look no further: this game is TONS of fun.			"

												Grimrock... I have never had a game ever before take me back so very far into my gaming past. Way back, there was a game called Dungeon Master. It was the first adventure game I played, and this game replicates it perfectly in terms of gameplay. The game engine, the puzzles, everything about it just screams that this is one game that will take up a lot of your time.The gameplay itself is solid. You move on a grid, everything happens in real time, you have to eat, you sleep to regain health and mana, your torches burn out. So much management that most modern adventure games seem to miss, that add to the experience. The puzzles are well thought out, take effort to solve and are satisfying to get past. Combat is fast paced, requiring thought as well as a fast clicking finger.This is one game that remains true to the classic, old adventure games of gaming yore. Whether you remember that time or not, this is one experience not to be missed.			"

												A throwback game to old-school Dungeon Crawler RPGs, Legend of Grimrock easily succeeds at that, with a feature that, I feel, should’ve been in all those old-school Dungeon Crawlers of Yesteryear. It plays like one, it has absolutely no music, but rather, ambient sounds like none of them, it has hard fighting monsters like one, and in this review, that’s only scratching the surface. Let’s dig a bit deeper, and see what this game really offers.Gameplay: As mentioned earlier, Legend of Grimrock is a throwback to the old-school Dungeon Crawlers of the late 80s to the early 90s (or at least, I think that’s when these games were hot) and it succeeds at what it set out to do, too. It’s setting is that of Mount Grimrock, a large dungeon inside a mountain, and every bit of it is in first-person. The combat is somewhat fast-paced, but not so fast that you have to be faster than greased lightning to be able to get through fights. Their are helpful hints, if a bit obscure in places, that tell you how to proceed, and plenty of puzzles and traps to slog your way through. Story: The story in Legend of Grimrock feels a lot more fleshed-out than those games from which it takes its inspiration, such as the Dungeon Master games. Basically, though, the whole story amounts to this: you and your party members are prisoners convicted of an unknown crime, and you have been promised your freedom if you can escape from the dungeons of Mount Grimrock. Problems is, is that no one has ever managed to escape from Mount Grimrock, or at least, those who’ve been pardoned in this manner never have. It’s cliché, yes, but it works as a good driving force, because you’ll want to see what the King or whoever it is that sentenced your party to be pardoned in this way since you’ll inevitably be the first ones to ever escape this fate, right? But it actually goes deeper than that, because your party has dreams telling them of an original prisoner in the dungeon who knows the way out. I won’t say anymore on the story, because then I’d have to spoil it for you, and that wouldn’t be any fun, now would it?Music: As I said earlier, this game only has one particular song, and it only plays on the title screen. It’s pretty good, too!Graphics: The graphics look like about what you’d be expecting from a Dungeon Crawler that takes its inspiration from Dungeon Master, but with a modern day take on them. They look like graphics that you’d see in a modern day game.Now, that’s everything that’s in the game itself, but the game’s true strength really shines with the built-in Dungeon Editor. That’s right! Now you can make the Dungeon Master dungeons of your dreams with a bit more interactivity, thanks to Lua scripting and the Drag-and-Drop editing power of the Dungeon Editor for Legend of Grimrock.Overall, an amazing successor to the old-school Dungeon Crawlers of Yesteryear, Legend of Grimrock is an obvious success, and it’s one in which I hope you can escape the shackles that will undoubtedly hold you to it and keep you coming back for more!

												Nostalgia FTW.  This will bring back fond memories of the dungeon crawlers of yore.  They even have a mode where there is no automap so you can sharpen your pencils and get out the graph paper (with an achievement for completing the game this way, naturally).   The setup is basic - you create 4 characters, chosing between classes (Fighter, Rogue, Mage) and races (human, minotaur, insectoid, and lizardmen).  You have the basic stats such as strength, dexterity, willpower, and vitality, and are given a pool of points to assign them at the beginning as well as selecting a couple of traits to your character (Athletic, agile, strong mind, etc).  Your initial stats will only be increased by leveling up skills - and they display the complete tree and bonuses earned with each level so you can plan accordingly.  For the base game, there is a good mix of combat and puzzles to solve, though items and maps are static - no random loot here.  However, the game comes with a dungeon editor and there is a healthy selection in the Steam Workshop to give you plenty of replayability.I've beaten the game twice - the second time was a bit of achievement farming as well as trying different character builds.  The sound is adequate - no award winning voicework apart from some grunts, there are just a couple of cutscenes, all of which can be clicked through very quickly, and the bones of the story are pretty bare.  You're all convicts that have been awarded a pardon - which you receive once you are cast into the pit at the top of Mount Grimrock.  From there, you are working your way down, following the path of some other criminal who left notes behind that provide a little bit of background, clues to puzzles, and so on. This is NOT turn-based - you click each character's action and wait for the cooldowns to expire before that character can act again. As such, you can maneuver around in combat, dodging, moving out of range, or even circling around behind the enemy for a backstabbing attack (if your rogue has that skill).I recommend the game for fans of the old RPG crawlers.

												If you're into this type of a game I'm sure you will like it but there are two things you should know about this game that I didn't when I got it: It is not turn based. You move and attack in real-time.The dungeons are static and are not randomly generated. The enemies are also not randomized in any way. This kills replayability for me.The graphics are great and the gameplay is strategic enough to keep interest up, but honestly speaking it's not really my type of game. I still recommend you buy it if you find the gameplay interesting!----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----Story: -/5 (I didn't play long enough to get into it.)Gameplay: 3.5/5Challenge: 4/5Discovery: 2/5Replayability: 0/5Aesthetics: 4/5Visuals: 5/5Atmosphere: -/5 (I didn't play it enough.)Music: -/5 (Don't remember it well enough.)

												LEGEND OF GRIMROCK is so perfect in its execution of old school retro hack and slash its supernatural. The balance of puzzle difficulty and battling enemies is as perfect as humanly possible. Dungeons are buetifully designed in their retro design ala DUNGEON MASTER. Lighting and shadows give an eerie haunting ambience as they flicker about walls and cast their forms on stone floors. Some times shadows are moving about violently due to some ghastly horror standing in front of a light source about to pounce on my party of four dungeon prisoners trying to survive to earn their freedom. Monster design and animations are amazing and terrifying. Its like actually being in the world of DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS with familiar classics from the table top games gracing ones eye with their artistic beauty. Running into new enemies is a major adrenaline rush bringing back memories of playing EYE OF THE BEHOLDER etc where part of the reward of continuing was seeing the great looking monsters. Combat is a strategic joy as giant bats lunge and fly at my party repeatedly as we try to time our acttacks for best effect and hopefully a critical or two. Animations really add to the immersion making one get lost in the excitement of the moment. Alot of times i'll find myself having to acttack from long range or retreat lest my entire party is slaughtered with no one left alive to bring them to huge blue crystals which can bring your fellow adventurers back from the dead. Sound effects are subtle and all consuming adding to the realism of the experiance with plenty of retro inducing emotional thrills. Its nice for a change to actually hear my characters give a blood curdling scream as they die compared to other rpgs where they hardly give out a whimper. So far the only music i have heard is the intro theme which is fabulous alive with old school adventure as if from a 1980s Conan movie or b-movie. While traveling in dungeons of Grimrock my ears are sweetly embraced by spooky ambient sound effects. Character creation and developement is handled very well with a comfortable amount of detail to make each adventurer in ones party feel unique. You can add points to strength, dexterity etc and also put points into certain character based skills only available to certain types of characters. So certain skills will only be available to a particular class such as a rogue and others to a mage etc. If you loved old school hardcore rpgs back in the day such as Dungeon Master and Black Crypt you owe it to your happiness to get LEGEND OF GRIMROCK. There really isnt any excuse. Just pick up a STEAM card at your local game shop such as GAMESTOP or BEST BUY add some money and go buy the game online without worrying about the hassle of credit cards etc. LEGEND OF GRIMROCK. Truly it is legend.			"

												A much longer game than expected.  Somehow I assumed it would be shorter since it has downloadable levels through Steamworks.I enjoyed playing it since it is a throw back to the original days of PC gaming and RPG's.  Took me about 17 hours to complete with breaks/getting lost.  I tried not to use any walkthroughs but I had to at the last area only to go... duh....The combat is slow pace to start but by floor 8 out of 13, you need to start being fast and moving around monsters or you'll die.  You can create your own team/race/class set up with four chars and create your own playstyle.  I had two tanks (sword/mace) and two mages (fire/earth).The downside is I started to get bored around floor 9, but decided to rush to the end and beat it.  Luckily floors 11-13 are somewhat qucik.  Cool if you dig old PC gamestyle, but most will likely be turned off by a game like this.			"

												What can I say about this wonderful gem? As an avid retro-gamer that still boots sometimes DosBox to relive the classics, LoG is a wonderful homage to the old RPGs. The game is a fresh breath in a world where FPS like games take over all GENRES. This game just brought back my Eye of The Beholder nostalgia back. Its solid, simple and some of the secrets and puzzles are actually fun. If you expect this to be a ""spam the attack button for lootz"" game, go somewhere else. This is a slow, leisurely stride in the pools of nostalgia. Well worth it for me, a craver of the ""classic"" taste. Are you one?			"

												I used to have a board game called Hero Quest when I was a kid.  I loved it!  It was a gateway game to harder dru...erm, games like D&D, Vampire, and other table top games and eventually back to board games (I'm a proud board game geek).  Coincidentally, I also began to take a second look at dungeon crawlers.  Before this time, my largest exposure to first person RPGs of the like was Bard's Tale and I hated that game.  I bought ""Eye of the Beholder"" and ""Shining in the Darkness"" back then.  I dabbled with them, but quickly moved onto other RPGs.  Fast forward twelve years later and I picked up and finally beat Shining, giving it more respect and reigniting an appreciation for that style of RPG.  Two years after Shining, I beat Phantasy Star.  Two years after Phantasy Star, I beat Shadowgate and now Legend of Grimrock.I love top ten lists, cause I'm a sucker for order. Given the four dungeon crawls I beat, Grimrock would rank second after Shining.  The game is great, but I'm not sure it was enough to pull me back for more.  I enjoyed the opening music and the sound effects were atmospheric.  Graphics are decent and are done well for being programmed in Lua, but the effects do make certain reflective surfaces appear artificially shiny.  Gameplay is pretty straightforward.  Find better gear and attack bad guys.  The battle system is very simplistic as it really just comes down to right clicking.  The joy in combat actually comes from side stepping and dodging enemies to smack them.  It really is pleasing to be able to pull this off flawlessly after some practice. If done correctly, you can go floors before even getting hit. I played on Hard and Old School mode and it hurt me emotionally. I ended up getting lost several times, despite best efforts at maps and some enemies made me swear bad things against their offspring. The story is nearly nonexistent, but tidbits of flavor in the form of Toorum's notes and the ever detached presence pushing you forward is enough as the story takes back seat to the puzzles on each floor.  ""You're dumped into a dungeon, find your way out,"" is what is it comes down to.  The final boss was unexpected until you got down to the 12th floor and the battle wasn't overly difficult, but was a tad too long as I would dish out a few hits, drop down to the lower floor, heal, save, repeat.   The artwork for the ending is well done and I was surprised that a game this well made was done by four people.  It's worth a play if you're into this type of thing.			"

												An excellent RPG that really brings back the days of using pen and paper to play dungeon crawlers. The option to use the game's auto-map function, or pen and paper to manually map out your surroundings is fantastic because it gives players a nostalgic feeling when they used pencil and paper. Graphics are good and the puzzles are challenging, so I'd say that it's definitely worth the money. However, this game doesn't have any predefined goals other than to escape Mt. Grimrock, so if you're looking for any side quests, better you know now.			"

This game is great--if you're a fan of oldschool dungeon crawler games, I highly suggest you look into the Legend of Grimrock series. A few notes:-This game is fairly easy to add content to, such as extra player portraits-Does not lag, seems to run pretty well on most machines-You can choose to fill in the map as you go, classic style-Doesn't have turn based gameplay, but rather each character has a cooldown on their weapons-Spell system is intrigueing and somewhat reminiscent of magicka-Straightforward gameplay-Challenging without being unnecessarily difficult-Graphics are okay, not top of the class but still decentIf you like puzzles or dungeon crawlers, you'll like this game.

What I liked:  Nice old school RPG brought to modern times  Superb puzzles  Combat is simple yet satsifying (magic is rune based, meaning you must input the spell you want, adds that speical touch)  That Boss fightWhat You Need to Know:  Is a moddable game  No bugs or glitches  Has old school mode( no map, must draw the map yourself, with pen and paper)  You are in the same walled in dungeon with not much vareity in textures of wallsMy Score:APaid: Included in Humble BundleCompleted in: 24Similar games you might like :   Dungeons of Dredmor  StarCrawlers(early access) "

												Nostalgia FTW.  This will bring back fond memories of the dungeon crawlers of yore.  They even have a mode where there is no automap so you can sharpen your pencils and get out the graph paper (with an achievement for completing the game this way, naturally).   The setup is basic - you create 4 characters, chosing between classes (Fighter, Rogue, Mage) and races (human, minotaur, insectoid, and lizardmen).  You have the basic stats such as strength, dexterity, willpower, and vitality, and are given a pool of points to assign them at the beginning as well as selecting a couple of traits to your character (Athletic, agile, strong mind, etc).  Your initial stats will only be increased by leveling up skills - and they display the complete tree and bonuses earned with each level so you can plan accordingly.  For the base game, there is a good mix of combat and puzzles to solve, though items and maps are static - no random loot here.  However, the game comes with a dungeon editor and there is a healthy selection in the Steam Workshop to give you plenty of replayability.I've beaten the game twice - the second time was a bit of achievement farming as well as trying different character builds.  The sound is adequate - no award winning voicework apart from some grunts, there are just a couple of cutscenes, all of which can be clicked through very quickly, and the bones of the story are pretty bare.  You're all convicts that have been awarded a pardon - which you receive once you are cast into the pit at the top of Mount Grimrock.  From there, you are working your way down, following the path of some other criminal who left notes behind that provide a little bit of background, clues to puzzles, and so on. This is NOT turn-based - you click each character's action and wait for the cooldowns to expire before that character can act again. As such, you can maneuver around in combat, dodging, moving out of range, or even circling around behind the enemy for a backstabbing attack (if your rogue has that skill).I recommend the game for fans of the old RPG crawlers.

												A throwback game to old-school Dungeon Crawler RPGs, Legend of Grimrock easily succeeds at that, with a feature that, I feel, should’ve been in all those old-school Dungeon Crawlers of Yesteryear. It plays like one, it has absolutely no music, but rather, ambient sounds like none of them, it has hard fighting monsters like one, and in this review, that’s only scratching the surface. Let’s dig a bit deeper, and see what this game really offers.Gameplay: As mentioned earlier, Legend of Grimrock is a throwback to the old-school Dungeon Crawlers of the late 80s to the early 90s (or at least, I think that’s when these games were hot) and it succeeds at what it set out to do, too. It’s setting is that of Mount Grimrock, a large dungeon inside a mountain, and every bit of it is in first-person. The combat is somewhat fast-paced, but not so fast that you have to be faster than greased lightning to be able to get through fights. Their are helpful hints, if a bit obscure in places, that tell you how to proceed, and plenty of puzzles and traps to slog your way through. Story: The story in Legend of Grimrock feels a lot more fleshed-out than those games from which it takes its inspiration, such as the Dungeon Master games. Basically, though, the whole story amounts to this: you and your party members are prisoners convicted of an unknown crime, and you have been promised your freedom if you can escape from the dungeons of Mount Grimrock. Problems is, is that no one has ever managed to escape from Mount Grimrock, or at least, those who’ve been pardoned in this manner never have. It’s cliché, yes, but it works as a good driving force, because you’ll want to see what the King or whoever it is that sentenced your party to be pardoned in this way since you’ll inevitably be the first ones to ever escape this fate, right? But it actually goes deeper than that, because your party has dreams telling them of an original prisoner in the dungeon who knows the way out. I won’t say anymore on the story, because then I’d have to spoil it for you, and that wouldn’t be any fun, now would it?Music: As I said earlier, this game only has one particular song, and it only plays on the title screen. It’s pretty good, too!Graphics: The graphics look like about what you’d be expecting from a Dungeon Crawler that takes its inspiration from Dungeon Master, but with a modern day take on them. They look like graphics that you’d see in a modern day game.Now, that’s everything that’s in the game itself, but the game’s true strength really shines with the built-in Dungeon Editor. That’s right! Now you can make the Dungeon Master dungeons of your dreams with a bit more interactivity, thanks to Lua scripting and the Drag-and-Drop editing power of the Dungeon Editor for Legend of Grimrock.Overall, an amazing successor to the old-school Dungeon Crawlers of Yesteryear, Legend of Grimrock is an obvious success, and it’s one in which I hope you can escape the shackles that will undoubtedly hold you to it and keep you coming back for more!

												Legitimately the best game I've ever played. Great puzzles, great combat mechanics, great story and (most of all) IMMERSION. It's saddening so many games lack this. You actually feel like you're trapped inside the dungeon; you actually feel scared when you know there's a stronger enemy ahead, instead of simply being more careful; you actually feel that if you take damage you're screwed, unlike some games *ahem* CoD *ahem*. Honestly, the only not so great thing that I can think about this game is that *sometimes* you move 2 squares instead of 1 because you tapped w twice by accident, which may cause you to fall into a pit. If you like RPGs, dungeon crawlers OR puzzle games, GET THIS. It's worth every cent and every minute you spend on it.			"

												This is how a dungeon crawler is done. It's really old school with lots of modern elements.So, what's the story? Well, there sort of isn't a story, ok, yes, there is, but it's not so essential to the main plot. The plot is that three people accused of crimes are thrown into a dunegon and must escape. So they must survive while there are monsters everywhere, disgusting food, a strange dream that happens sometimes when you rest, creepy sounds and amazing atmosphere. The graphics add so much to the atmosphere too because they look very amazing and somehow this game runs very well on my terrible PC. I wish more games did that.There are 3 main parts to this game and I will review each aspect one by one:CombatPuzzle SolvingExplorationCombat-The combat in this game is an old school style one, you're party is in 4 people all linked together and you walk on square tiles. You have to gather up weapons from monsters, hidden rooms and exploring the place as so. The magic combat system and the magic system in general is you have to combine a certain combination of runes. You can find these combinations on scrolls which you find and by leveling up the certain types of skills in the game. Speaking of the skills, the skills are pretty much subclasses in classes. The 3 classes in this game are fighter, rouge and mage. (There's a fourth one too but you will have to discover that for yourself) Each class has different abilities, attributes, purposes, uses, etc. There's also traits you can have on each character. There's lots to choose from and some races have their own trait. The 4 races are Human, Minotaur, Lizardman and Insectoid. Each are good for their own class, like how the Lizardman makes a good rogue and how the minotaur makes a good fighter.Puzzle solving-The puzzles in this game are diffucult. I had a LONG time trying to solve them. But after solving all of them, it was all worth it since it was fun and rewarding.Exploration-Without exploration, I don't think this game would've been so great. There are TONS of secrets everywhere. Some are easy to find, some take forever to find. For all those loot lovers out there, you will love this game because of all the loot and what it takes to get it. To go into a little more depth of exploration is the moving system, to turn you can't just turn all the way around, to do that, you would have to turn sideways and look sideways again since you look always in a 90 degree angle.To conclude, I would love to say Legend of Grimrock is a great modern day game and I would recommend it to anyone.

												If you were a fan of the Dungeon Keeper, Eye of the Beholder and Lands of Lore series of games and you're longing for more of that classic style of game play, you can't go wrong with this game. It'll take you right back to the 90s!That said, it's main draw is puzzle solving. The combat isn't as gripping nowadays, and there is very little in the way of plot or mood or story. I'm at the 4th level of the dungeon, but I'm not sure if I still have the time/patience for this sort of game when games like Divinity: Original Sin await my attention...			"

												This game is basically a dumbed down version of dungeons and dragons. now before you go and think ""wow that's so nerdy and stupid"" let me explain. the gameplay is, in my opinion, very good. I honestly can't think of another game that has the same type of combat. the gameplay is a action game where you move as a group in a grid pattern. basically you (your group) moves like a rook in chess. and each class (fighter, mage, and rouge) each play differently. also you can play the same class differently depending on how you build them. ontop of the good action there are also great puzzles in this game.  it's really hard to explain the gameplay i would suggest youtubing a few gameplay videos. all and all if you are on the edge of getting the game or not i would say buy it! especially if it is on sale. all and all after playing this game for about 5 hours i would give this game a 8.5 out of 10. if the graphics where better i would give it a 9.5.

A few notes:-This game is fairly easy to add content to, such as extra player portraits-Does not lag, seems to run pretty well on most machines-You can choose to fill in the map as you go, classic style-Doesn't have turn based gameplay, but rather each character has a cooldown on their weapons-Spell system is intrigueing and somewhat reminiscent of magicka-Straightforward gameplay-Challenging without being unnecessarily difficult-Graphics are okay, not top of the class but still decentIf you like puzzles or dungeon crawlers, you'll like this game. Try it.			"

												Nostalgia FTW.  This will bring back fond memories of the dungeon crawlers of yore.  They even have a mode where there is no automap so you can sharpen your pencils and get out the graph paper (with an achievement for completing the game this way, naturally).   The setup is basic - you create 4 characters, chosing between classes (Fighter, Rogue, Mage) and races (human, minotaur, insectoid, and lizardmen).  You have the basic stats such as strength, dexterity, willpower, and vitality, and are given a pool of points to assign them at the beginning as well as selecting a couple of traits to your character (Athletic, agile, strong mind, etc).  Your initial stats will only be increased by leveling up skills - and they display the complete tree and bonuses earned with each level so you can plan accordingly.  For the base game, there is a good mix of combat and puzzles to solve, though items and maps are static - no random loot here.  However, the game comes with a dungeon editor and there is a healthy selection in the Steam Workshop to give you plenty of replayability.I've beaten the game twice - the second time was a bit of achievement farming as well as trying different character builds.  The sound is adequate - no award winning voicework apart from some grunts, there are just a couple of cutscenes, all of which can be clicked through very quickly, and the bones of the story are pretty bare.  You're all convicts that have been awarded a pardon - which you receive once you are cast into the pit at the top of Mount Grimrock.  From there, you are working your way down, following the path of some other criminal who left notes behind that provide a little bit of background, clues to puzzles, and so on. This is NOT turn-based - you click each character's action and wait for the cooldowns to expire before that character can act again. As such, you can maneuver around in combat, dodging, moving out of range, or even circling around behind the enemy for a backstabbing attack (if your rogue has that skill).I recommend the game for fans of the old RPG crawlers.

												A throwback game to old-school Dungeon Crawler RPGs, Legend of Grimrock easily succeeds at that, with a feature that, I feel, should’ve been in all those old-school Dungeon Crawlers of Yesteryear. It plays like one, it has absolutely no music, but rather, ambient sounds like none of them, it has hard fighting monsters like one, and in this review, that’s only scratching the surface. Let’s dig a bit deeper, and see what this game really offers.Gameplay: As mentioned earlier, Legend of Grimrock is a throwback to the old-school Dungeon Crawlers of the late 80s to the early 90s (or at least, I think that’s when these games were hot) and it succeeds at what it set out to do, too. It’s setting is that of Mount Grimrock, a large dungeon inside a mountain, and every bit of it is in first-person. The combat is somewhat fast-paced, but not so fast that you have to be faster than greased lightning to be able to get through fights. Their are helpful hints, if a bit obscure in places, that tell you how to proceed, and plenty of puzzles and traps to slog your way through. Story: The story in Legend of Grimrock feels a lot more fleshed-out than those games from which it takes its inspiration, such as the Dungeon Master games. Basically, though, the whole story amounts to this: you and your party members are prisoners convicted of an unknown crime, and you have been promised your freedom if you can escape from the dungeons of Mount Grimrock. Problems is, is that no one has ever managed to escape from Mount Grimrock, or at least, those who’ve been pardoned in this manner never have. It’s cliché, yes, but it works as a good driving force, because you’ll want to see what the King or whoever it is that sentenced your party to be pardoned in this way since you’ll inevitably be the first ones to ever escape this fate, right? But it actually goes deeper than that, because your party has dreams telling them of an original prisoner in the dungeon who knows the way out. I won’t say anymore on the story, because then I’d have to spoil it for you, and that wouldn’t be any fun, now would it?Music: As I said earlier, this game only has one particular song, and it only plays on the title screen. It’s pretty good, too!Graphics: The graphics look like about what you’d be expecting from a Dungeon Crawler that takes its inspiration from Dungeon Master, but with a modern day take on them. They look like graphics that you’d see in a modern day game.Now, that’s everything that’s in the game itself, but the game’s true strength really shines with the built-in Dungeon Editor. That’s right! Now you can make the Dungeon Master dungeons of your dreams with a bit more interactivity, thanks to Lua scripting and the Drag-and-Drop editing power of the Dungeon Editor for Legend of Grimrock.Overall, an amazing successor to the old-school Dungeon Crawlers of Yesteryear, Legend of Grimrock is an obvious success, and it’s one in which I hope you can escape the shackles that will undoubtedly hold you to it and keep you coming back for more!

												Summary:Grimrock is a first person (first party in this case) dungeon crawl.  If you've ever heard/played a game called Stonekeep (late 1990s), you'll enjoy this game too.  Well designed, immersive, and an absolutely beautiful sound track.  Some skill is required to be a magic caster / use magic in your party, but if you get good at it, you really feel you've earned the title ""mage.""Overall Score:  Worth Getting (Niche game)  -- ( 79/100)Gameplay:  (56/60 points)Mechanics (35/35 points) – rules/physics/noticeable glitchesI have never encountered any bugs while playing Grimrock.  The rules of the world fit very well with the challenges you face and you never feel like the game is cheating.Controls (8/10 points) – ease of operation / button dynamicsControls are very basic, left, right, back, forward, casting is difficult, but in a good way where you feel really good when you successfully cast a spell.  My only beef with the controls was inventory managment.  Trying to maintain 4 peoples inventory was very cumbersome at times.Difficulty ( 5/5 points) – how hard is it to progress & does this difficulty work for or against the playerThe game trains you as you go.  The first few levels are about learning how things work.  It's a good build up and by later in the game, it's about exploration, adapting and facing challenges that force you to use everything you've learned up to that point.Immersion ( 4/5 points) –  very subjective:  Being drawn into the gameThe environments are realistic enough and the sounds and music will make you forget about everything around you.  The desire to save as often as possible and searching for secrets areas and having to look up a few solutions was the only thing that broke immersion for me.Fun ( 3/5 points)– very subjective: other enjoyment factorsVERY fun, but not so fun that I actually finished the game.  It was still excellent though, I've gotten further into this game than most.Content:  (20/35 points)Story (13/15 points) – Does it exist, coherent, presentation of, and does it enhance game play?The opening was excellent, there's little scraps of papers and books that tell you more of the story thorugh the ponderings of a former ""inmate.""  Also every level of the game tells a different story and as you move further in, the very walls and status hint at darker things that have gone into the formation of Grimrock.  I can't say that the story is deep, but it is enjoyable. Characters (5/10 points) – Interesting, well developed, work with gameplay and storyThe characters are fairly standard fare for your Dungeons and Dragons -esque setting, but the manual had some great backstory on each.  It doesn't play into the game, but was good flavor text.“S.S.D.D.” value (2/10 points) – abilities, roles, tools, NPCs, and general world setting uniquenessVery typical for a dungeon crawl. Gamer Parent Factors:  (3/5 GOLDEN points)- (WIN) Ability to save / pause and come back later to pick it up right away again- (WIN) Ability to progress during short gameplay sessions (30 mins – 1.5 hours)- (WIN) Replay value and game length not related to required repetitive grinding to increase stats-  (NO)  Ability to play game with spouse or offspring-  (NO)  Availability on multiple platformsGamerDad Game Reviews -- Purpose and CriteriaThe purpose of GamerDad Game reviews is to evaluate ‘aged’ games that have been on the market long enough to experience a substantial price drop from their original industry standard price. Reviewing games towards the end of their life cycle will offer an updated consumer valuation of the game based on if known issues have been fixed since release, value of optional DLC (Downloadable Content made available after initial game release) to gameplay, and if the entertainment return on investment is worth the new price point.

												Lengends of Grimrock, what the hell is that?  My first thought as I clicked on the link.  To my utter surprise this appeared to be a leap back in time to the wonderful dungeon exploration days of Dungeon Master & Eye of the Beholder.  Not only have they captured the soul from the Dungeon crawler era, they've improved upon it.  For the uneducated amongst you, Dungeon Master let you create a party of 4 and turn by turn you'd explore a dungeon mapping as you went, solving riddles and nasty puzzles whilst fighting creatures way too powerful for your team.  LoG has this option but wisely have included automapping (on squared maps for authenticity) with ability to write notes.  Graphics and sound are atmospheric with level design that not only tips the hat to the former greats in the genre but pushes it beyond.  I'm 5 levels in and hooked.  Each room you get to has hidden dangers and rewards to find.  The turn based mechanics have been sped up.  If you don't move the enemy will keep going.			"

												Beautiful masterwork, in the lines of the Eye of the Beholder series. Challenging fights, interesting creatures, puzzles that would make you tear your hair out. The game keeps exploring, while always checking behind you, to make sure nothing has snuck up behind you.Pros:+Puzzles are well done to keep you thinking+Good Pacing with Combat, never to easy, but never really feel to weak either.+Does not feel to over use any of the dungeon mechanics.Cons:- Controls felt wierd at times when trying to do things quickly, making certain timing puzzles very very frustrating- Magic system is a little wierd, powerful, but really would appreciate an autocast, or repeat cast.Neutral:= I wanted more fluff, backstory, history, information on the dungeon. Their is some, but just wanted alot more. "

												Yes, I know, it's a whiny statement, but let me kind of explain why I feel this way and perhaps it'll make more sense.I get the dungeon crawl concept. I've played them before, and roguelikes. Against all expectations, I beat the hardest of hardcore modes on Dungeons of Dredmor, I went through a couple playthroughs of Dark Souls, all that stuff. When I lose in those games, I feel it's because I did something to mess up, missed a move or made a wrong decision.With this game, there is no wrong decision to make, because no matter what you decide, you get thrown up against a difficulty spike that you can't possibly be ready for until you die at least once to it. If it isn't the obtuse puzzles that only make sense about half the time, it's the enemies that pop out of nowhere, can take forty times as many hits as any of your characters, and deal out damage that can kill you in seconds in a straight fight.I know a lot of people may disagree with this, and they certainly have a right to. But to me, this game isn't a challenge, or a dungeon crawl. It's just mashing my face against random walls in the hopes of finding a hidden switch, and getting killed a dozen times by the same overpowered monster group until I find the hidden cheese tactic that somehow lets me go down another floor.

												To make it short and sweet, this game can't decide what it wants to be. The base systems it sets up are sound, their levelling and RPG and class/team building mechanics are all solid and interesting.Then the combat throws all that out the window and makes you essentially try and play an FPS on a grid by circle strafing and dodging and such. There is little sense of type weaknesses, formation shuffling, tactical considerations, or any other interesting RPG type mechanics; just running around enemies and tapping the attack buttons until they die.This gets progressively worse throughout the game, with more and more ""bullet sponge"" enemies, until what might be the worst final boss fight I've had the displeasure to experience in a long time, in terms of lore, mechanics and comprehensibility.Maybe try that new Might and Magic game if you want an actual dungeon crawler, instead of a gridlocked FPS.

												Prepare to click. A lot. This game decides that the ideal way to make a game difficult and ""old school"" is to make the controls awful. There are no useful keyboard shortcuts for anything, and it employs realtime combat with you controlling all four party members. Making a game's controls awful to increase difficulty doesn't make it fun, just frustrating.Click to attack, click to move, click to turn, click to cast a spell, click to open your inventory, it gets old very fast. I couldn't even stomach a second hour of play, and I normally love games with old school themes or mechanics. I honestly think it got such good reviews because the genre is starved for this sort of old dungeon crawl, rather than another Minecraft-like. But they could have done much, much better.			"

												The game started off being very entertaining, but it became less and less of an RPG and more of a ""twitch"" reflex game. I had to quit at level 6 where you are required to press three different buttons in sequence with absolutely no room for thought or planning. If you enjoy very fast complicated key strokes with split second timing, this may appeal to you. If you want a real RPG, look else where.			"

												As the game begins, you are released into a grimdark dungeon crawler that looks to be fantastic. This is veneer. As the game progresses, cracks appear most aggresively in terms of the combat. Fighting enemies begins to turn into a game of slow speed kiting. This is the fundamental problem with doing tile based combat in real time. Most puzzles seem to work properly, but more than a few are entirely unintuitive.The problems with this game are really unfortunate. It has such promise, but lets you down consistently.			"

												While I like the idea of dungeon crawlers Legend of Grimrock is simply too rough around the edges to recommend. At the time of writing this review I have completed the first three levels of the game with a Human Warrior, Minotaur Warrior, Human Rogue and Insectoid Mage party.Almost nothing is explained wellThe tutorial is a series of images that explain the most basic concepts of the game. The tooltips when you mouse over attributes or skills give you essentially flavour text. They don't really explain exactly what affects they will have which is a crucial part of RPGs like this where you really can't afford to waste points.I was constantly Googling trying to get clarification as to what exactly certain attributes or skills would do. A lot of times I got linked to the Steam forums where players seemed to be debating amongst themselves exactly what the affects were. The reason this irked me so much is that this is the prototypical old school RPG where you can easily spend points on stuff that is essentially useless and with no ability to respec it makes it really easy to make mistakes and which then feels like you have neutered your character.The combat is way too repetiveI'm about three hours in and so far the combat has essentially boiled down to right click on all four characters to have them take a swing, wait a couple seconds and repeat. There is no real strategy in how you attack, at least not yet.My melee classes have a weapon and a shield because it seems that high evasion is an absolute must for frontline fighters. However this means that they basically can do nothing except right click every couple seconds. Rogues in theory could have a bit of variety because you don't need a shield if your in the back row and could have two things equipped but the problem is that you can't attack with both. Any attack puts both equipped items on cooldown. This caries over to the mage who after they cast a spell has to wait again.For all of these reason combat becomes incredibly repetitive and boring. Perhaps it gets better later on and you get more ability to strategize but I am three hours into the game and it feels incredibly dumbed down to me. I'm sure some people reading this review are saying ""you're suppose to move a lot in combat"" and while I tried doing that it was no fun at all. Since you have to move on a grid it's essentially like chasing a younger sibling around the kitchen table. You can literally run in circles and the enemy can't hit you and while it is a valid strategy running around in circles for hours is by no means fun in my books.Old school grindingYou know how a lot of people talk about how games make ""quality of life"" improvements because developers realized that many of their game mechanics were simply there to elongage the time the user spent playing and actually really agitated the user? This game took all of those lessons and ignore them and instead went back to the old school Dungeons & Dragons mindset.Simple things like mages burn through their energy far faster than rogues or warriors so they become useless faster and require constant rest or trips to the life crystals to restore their energy.Health regenerates so slow that after a battle you often have to sit and wait to heal back up. Otherwise you're spending a couple minutes running back and forth between the afformentioned life crystals.Perhaps all of this wouldn't be an issue if the game dropped health or energy potions but in my three hours of playing I have only got enough ingredients to make four health potions and you will burn through them almost instantly.The straw the broke the camels back for me was the spiders on level 3. I had the best armor I could get at this point in the game as far as I am aware. Full light armor for both my warriors and they both had over 100 hp but the spiders would still hit for 20+. So I could take a max of three spiders back to back before my party was completely wiped and I had to take a couple minutes to properly heal.The kicker was that these spiders can poison you and of course poison means damage over time. Problem is the same ingredients you need to make health potions are the same ingredients you need to make antidotes and even if I made antidotes instead of health potions I would only have made four of them. I easily fought over 20 spiders and got poisoned over a dozen times. It would not have made any difference and I still would have had to run back to the life crystal a dozen times just to cure my poison because the game did not give out proper resources.In my mind these kind of games should be about battle strategy and how you use medicine during a battle is part of the strategy. But after four battles if you're completely tapped and the only strategy then is to cheese by running around the kitchen table well then I think that means something went wrong during the design of the game.Cool idea but bad executionLike I said in the first sentence of this review, I really like the idea behind this game. Crawling through a massive dungeon while overcoming the challenges inside. I just didn't think the challenges would be limited resources and knowledge of playing ring-a-round the rosie.			"

												Probably a pretty cool game overall?  Will never know, though.  First two levels were fun but the third introduced spiders that decimated my fighters (which were already skewed towards defensive stats) unless I took every spider one-on-one and did a stupid little dance to exploit the AI's inability to turn quickly.  I was willing to keep going until the game thought it would be ""cute"" to trap me between two sets of 3+ spiders by having a set pop out of a hidden room.  I couldn't even just attempt to gun it for the exit because a swarm of impassable spiders continually covered the tiles leading to the next room.  Tried all manner of consumables just to clear a tile so I could maaaybe escape - nada.What goes through a dev's brain when he designs something like this?Edit: Did some additional reading on this level.  When the prevailing advice from hardcore fans of your game is ""exploit doorways, rest after every fight, and savescum"", your design has problems.			"

												Starved for a good ole fashion dungeon crawl, I reallllly want to like this game...Pros:- Graphics are gorg- Ambient/Creature Sounds add to feelings of isolation/dungeonosityCons:- Combat is an utter slog...boring, unispired kite-fest- Puzzles slow down pace of gameplay and I just Google answers after frustrating minutes- Game has zero human/personal element...feels like an empty, unfinished dungeon made by User, rather than the devs - Lands of Lore from over 20 years ago has far more personality/plot/story/engagement- No hotkeys- Weapons seem to miss a sh!t-ton of the time, and are sparse and slow in coming- Point distro into skill to use basic armor is prohibitiveSurrrrrrie, but I feel a little cheated with the 95% love for this game...it's ok....just ok.

												The devs are on the right track, and  I'll try the sequel, but I'm not playing this one anymore.Man, at first I thought the controls just needed time to learn, but having realized that whether or not they are nostalgic, which they aren't, they are just bad. They kill all the fun that was here to be had.  Some of my favorite reviewers love this game, it looked super fun, so I gave it a shot.  I just finished the last session I'll play any time soon.I've been gaming for 4 decades, all kinds of games. Don't feel bad if you don't like this or any other very highly recommended game.  Also, some of us gamers sure take themselves seriously. They're games. Calm down.			"

												This game is great in that it brings back an old-style game. Unfortunately, they didn't only bring back the good things, but all the bad things as well. That, to me, is just unforgivable. They should have improved on the game-play aspect but haven't. Especially the user interface (GUI, mouse, keyboard) are downright terrible.ProsNice graphics.ConsThe turning and looking is annoying.The combat, especially magic, is downright terrible.Inventory management is incredibly weak.Mini-map is absent (constantly pressing tab is non-fun busy-work).The enemies just stand there and hit you while you slowly walk backwards. The IQ of the AI is nonexistent. "

												The Legend of Grimrock is a fun and entertaining dungeon crawler role-playing game that really captures the core of the genre. Elements from Dungeons & Dragons and like games have been incorporated into the Legend of Grimrock and with great success. Coming from a person who normally doesn't like dungeon crawlers, this is definitely an amazing game! As if it could get any better, a dungeon editor is available, which allows players to build their own customizeable dungeons and share their creations with other players. This game contains many features for the player to explore and customize, as well as stimulating puzzles that can really boggle your mind. Although the puzzle aspect of the game pervades and dominates over the action or dialogue, the Legend of Grimrock is nevertheless an exciting RPG that revitalizes the dungeon crawler genre!			"

												I had few problem with this game. First I thought it was turned based like the classic games of this genre I played in the past. The game is in real time.  Not a huge problem so lets go on.  All the levels look the same. The game looks boring.  There seems to be only one tile set.  The bigget problem is the controls. The game moves like a tank.  If you hold down a movement key you can over shoot the spot you wanted to stop at. This because a big problem when dealing with timed puzzles and traps. The one thing that made me drop the game is that timing is directly related to screen resolution and graphic card power.  There were traps and puzzles that were impossible to get through without lowering my resolution to reduce the speed of the trap.   Now this is mainly a hardware issue for people that good graphic cards.   However, I feel the game was  poorly designed  for the traps they had. The limited classes and portraits just added to my let down but didn't effect the game much.  For me this is a insult to the old school dungeon crawlers I played in the past.			"

												I used to like this style of dungeon crawler in the 90s but it really feels dated now. This game had me panic quite a lot. Not sure if I liked the puzzles in it either. It was a solid effort to connect me to my past but Im not sure if I really missed it afterall. I just said no to this game because I feel like I am well and truly past that part of my life and if others are in the same position I'd give it a miss. But YES if you do miss it.			"

I expected to be there all the way to see a sorry mageling through every challenge and help him grow into an arcane terror of epic proportions.I didn't expect a game where the best viable party are two unarmed rogues in the front row and two ranged rogues in the rear, and I certainly didn't expect the ability to mash buttons in a specific sequence or play reverse dodgeball with a swarm of white fireballs to be the only decisive skill in this game.
