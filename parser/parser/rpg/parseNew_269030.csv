												The Yawhg is absolutely beautiful for what it is, and it's a lot of fun, however, I really can't recommend it. It feels like a demo, or the introduction to a larger game. The entire game plays out like the character creation for a game that never happens. You spend six weeks making decisions that shape and define your character, each one including a small flavor text choice that lets you deepen your character choices, and then, when it feels like the game should be starting for real, all you do is pick a profession and see how good your character is at that profession.I wanted to be a part of this world, I wanted to take my character out, to play a game with them. Who doesn't want that? This game is maybe worth a dollar. I wont say that I feel cheated, because I truly savor and enjoy the narrative, and the very novelty of a cooperative choose your own adventure experience was just enough to make me feel like at least I had gotten something interesting and beautiful, if lacking, but I would not recommend this for every gamer. Be very aware, this game is extremely content light, and there is no campaign. Once your character is created after six weeks of character creation choices, that's the end of it. I really crave more, and am very disappointed in how little is here.			"

												For a more comprehensive review, please see my write-up at http://criticalindiegamer.com/2014/02/the-yawhg-review-pc/What can I say? It is very, very good, but also a brief experience. With a few friends the tales you weave will cause fits of raucous laughter, but they will be short-lived. A play-through takes around 10-30 minutes, and the end phase offers no real-resolution. A folk music style soundtrack interweaves the basic, but charming presentation of the game. Both are lovely, and compliment one another well.The Yawhg puts me in a tough place because I really enjoyed it, but I question its worth at $10. I don't usually draw comparisons between price and longevity, but if I paid $10 I can't help thinking I would feel a little let down. There are multiple play-throughs here, but even by the second play you will be seeing the same situations again.Buy it if you are looking for a fun, memorable experience to play with your friends, and don't mind the longevity issues.

												I really want to be able to recommend this game, but...it just doesn't feel like a complete game. It's short. I have, what, nearly three hours of playtime on record? I think I've played 20 or so games in that time. You have 2-4 characters, there are six turns, and for every turn, you decide what stats your character will improve. At the end of the six turns, every character picks a profession and then you see if you managed to rebuild or not after the Yawhg leaves. Pros:- Absolutely beautiful- Great music- Two male characters, two female characters, always a plus- Great for when you have a little time to kill- Most weeks you'll have an ""event"" happen to you, anything from deciding whether to pick up a rusted dagger to dancing with a dryad to giving sex tips to the king. These were cool (at least, the first few times...).Cons:- Repetitive. The events that pop up during the week are the same thing over and over and over and OVER and unless you happen to have the exact right stats, the results of whatever you choose don't realy differ.- Only three endings. The good, the bad, the ambiguous.- Absoutely not even remotely worth $10. It's worth like $1. - There's just not much gameplay or variation, and that means there's not much reason to play this beyond a few hours time total.			"

 Playtime and Time/money After playing through the game 3 times with a friend at a moderately slow place we pretty much exhausted the game of unique encounters within 3 hours, however, this being said. I really enjoyed what time I was playing the game.I can't say you should buy this game for only one reason, and that is that the game is too short for the few bucks you'll be spending on it. Exactly what is this game? The choose your own adventure game has about 100-200 encounters, (and yes I looked in the game files for this number range) However being that you can hit about 20 per character it's not extremely hard to start seeing repeats in playthrough two. Along with that though I give the game credit where it's due, the game has a very open file system where you can modify... the whole game. Not only can you modify it, but so can anyone else, if you look on the discussions I'm sure you can find a player made extension or a whole 'nother story, which is great! that looks to be more play time added on to this game. Final note on the game itself, it is a LOCAL Co-Op/single player game, however me and my friend used Teamviewer (http://www.teamviewer.com a free screen sharer, that's easy to use) and we played the game as if we were both in the same room.;-; #forever alone  #Screw that I don't want people in my house.Overall yeah you should get this game if you can nab it on sale or if you can get it in a bundle, I can personally only recommend playing this with a friend, so be sure to grab 2 (or a DRM free copy).... not saying that there are any maybe in the humble bundle...So now the standard game rating:Story: 10/10 (Enjoyable, Fun, Ridiculous, everything a good sit-down-and-play game should be)Gameplay: 3/10 (I can't give good marks here for a game that uses only U/D/L/R/Enter, but it passes by my personal standards.)Presentation: 9/10 (The game has a nice art style and feel about it.)Soundtrack: 7/10 (I'M SORRY WHAT WAS THAT?! I had to turn mine down to 4% just to hear my friend, no in game slider, and doesnt save sound settings after closing. Other than that it's fine, fitting music.)Replayability: 10/10 (I'm just waiting for that free content DLC that was mentioned in a thread somewhere, that or I'll go and download someone elses.) "

												If we follow Sid Meier’s definition of a game as “a series of meaningful choices”, then The Yawhg is indeed the gamiest of all the games. It is all about the choices you make. Still, there might be people out there who will think that there’s not enough, uh, game in this game.In the end it doesn’t really matter though, I have no problem whatsoever with thinking of this as a “mood piece”. I enjoyed it immensely. Sometimes it is rather straightforward, sometimes it is deliciously dark and twisted. It is an astonishing, unique thing and I am very glad that it is out there.			"

												This is a visual novel in the same style as Monster Loves You. The game involves choosing where to go each turn, then responding to the randomized event that happens there. The event and your response to it will have positive or negative effects on one or more of your character's stats, which in turn influence later events and the end of the game. It's sort of like a dating sim, except instead of trying to get the girl, you're trying to survive the apocalypse.The music and the writing are top notch, which makes the game a joy to play through several times over. Events are randomized to give the game more replay value, but they also interconnect with each other in surprising and delightful ways, so you're likely to see something new even on your tenth time through the game. Each run only takes about ten minutes, so finishing it multiple times is more fun than frustrating.Though enjoyable as a solitary experience, the game really shines when used as a party game. Grab a few friends and try to stave off The Yawhg together - or don't, and see if your character can fare better than the others after the apocalypse.			"

												The Yawhg's main draw is the art and stories of Emily Carroll.  I liked her comics and so bought the game, but was honestly disappointed.  The 'game' is nothing more than a collection of Carroll's stories told in a branching narrative fashion.  The game functions by having you choose what each character is doing each week but results are unpredictable and seem arbitrary.  Each game of The Yawhg is very short, not allowing for any sense of attachment to develop with the characters you're controlling.  Ultimately, you're just clicking around to see what pops out next.   While I love the artwork and scenarios that occured, I can't help but feel this really should have just been a series of webcomics rather than a video game.  Overall it left me wanting.			"

												I played the Yawhg a couple of times, and I must say it is quite an amusing game. It's all pretty straight-forward: you and/or your friends each choose a character (you can also choose characters yourself and play the game on your own) and choose a location you wish to go to. Each location has a couple of options on actions you can perform, such as cutting wood, tending to patients, and yes, even getting drunk! But beware: each choice you make might positively or negatively affect your stats. After a couple of turns, the mysterious Yawhg happens and each person will have to choose a role which fits their character's stats best (or you can do the opposite, and watch the outcome!), after which you'll get to know whether your town survived, and -more importantly- how your characters pick up their life again afterwards.The Yawhg is a funny little game which you can play with friends. The graphics are all really fitting and nice, the music is simple, yet suits the game and the absolute highlight of the game is the amount of choices you can make, and the randomnized events you'll encounter. However, the game is VERY short. Almost too short. And that, in my humble opinion, is the only thing where it falls short, for me personally. However, the replay value is very big. Get it during a sale, or if you like experimental choice-heavy little games like this one.All in all, 7/10			"

												The whole game is only six turns long.  The number of events that can happen in that time seem very limited.  In four-five play throughs i had the same things happen pretty much every time.  The music is nice but there is no menu option anywhere so you cant turn down the volume or resize the screen or anything.  In addition it managed to crash a couple of times which is just rediculous in a six turn game.  It would have been a really good game if there was a decent amount of content but sadly as it is its only good for a few minutes.			"

												I don't think a game has ever made me feel so conflicted on its value.I'm not sure I can justify spending money on this game. Even $1 seems like a high asking price. The game has beautiful art, relaxing music, and the writing is amusing or even heartwarming at times. The way the game maintains continuity over a single playthrough is nothing new for video games, but in a ""board game"" it might lend it a small air of novelty.But, frankly, there's almost no gameplay. It's pretty much a very short, interactive, multiplayer visual novel. A match will last around 8-10 minutes per player. There are 6 turns, and they amount to picking one of eight locations, then making two binary choices at each of these locations to somewhat randomly gain or lose stat points. These points will affect how successful you are at succeeding the second binary choice each turn, depending on what, precisely, the choice is. With a very small number of art assets and almost no gameplay, the game survives entirely on its writing. At a maximum of 40 minutes per game and low variety per playthrough, you are unfortunately likely to get more value out of riffing on a movie with friends than The Yawhg.I really want to recommend this game, but its brevity and shallowness just keep me from being able to justify saying anyone should spend money on it. The experience was enjoyable, but there's just not enough there.			"

												The Yawhg has nice art and story telling. Unfortunately, that's all there is. About 10 minutes worth.Right when I thought the game was starting, I was ""Yeah! The Yawhg is finally here! I'm gonna kick his♥♥♥♥♥"". After I assigned professions to each character, that was it. Ending was generated and credits rolled. That's it. The whole game plays out like the beginning of a Fallout game. Answer a few questions and gain some stat points.Your choices do effect the outcome and there are events that destroy locations on the map which is pretty cool. The one map you see on the screen is the only location in the game. After the Yawhg arrives, you assign positions to each character and the game generates an ending for each character based on their previous choices. Fade to black, roll credits.While I like the art and story telling, there is simply not enough here to justify the price at all. I genuinly feel like I wasted money and I really didn't want to feel that way because I really wanted to like the game. There is simply not enough here.			"

												Telling stories around a campfire might seem antiquated, but The Yawhg replaces both the fire and the stories with its own tales of a civilization on the brink of the collapse. You and three friends take roles in the town just a week before ensured destruction. Attend a ball, clean a hospital, or even fight crime. The Yawhg presents imminent danger and allows you to forge a healthy backstory and stat sheet in only a few days. The real treasure is seeing how these actions affect your friends or the town itself. Once the town is overcome with darkness, it's up to you and your friends to triumph or despair with your experiences.It's a superb bit of storytelling.			"

												The Yawgh is coming.  You have 10 days!A story with interaction that goes beyond a click and choose interface.  You can actually increase the stats of your character in order to make a choice at the ""end"" of the game when the Yawgh arrives.The bottom line with this game is that it's meant to be a hot-seat game you play with your friends.  It's not really that much fun to play alone since you can see just about every choice in a couple playthroughs.  But, with friends it'll take a bit longer to get through.So, if you like a story that can have some humorous turns or some dramatic fallout from seemingly simple choices, then this might be a fun game for you.

												The kind of tainted fairy-tale spectacle The Yawhg promotes sadly fades all too soon, despite the whimsically strong writing and the playful art that often hints at a slightly darker edge. For all its subtle melancholy and inventive storytelling, there’s only a small window of time when all these things mesh together to create something special. After that, it’s more about rediscovery and rehashing in the futile hopes that relevance can be found by combining the old and worn.

												I went into The Yawhg expecting something like a Visual Novel emulating a tabletop session. 7 minutes later, I realized what I paid $10 for was a Visual Novel emulating a character sheet. You spend a few days building your heroes with jobs and chores, and the game ends with a pass/fail test determined by what stats you built. It’s the charming, quirky, digital equivalent of drawing straws, and while the Yawhg may be a good case study for developers looking to make choose-your-own-adventure type games in the future, it offers very little for people wanting an enjoyable experience now.

												I debated for a bit whether or not to recommend the game. I decided to recommend it, but I thought I would leave some information so that others considering purchasing will understand what they are buying.1) This game is a text-based ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" game. There is art (and I like the art) and music (and I like the music), but ultimately, it's about the choices you make.2) The game is very short. It is completed in 6 turns. However, there are a variety of options  to choose from. There are different endings, so choose wisely.3) If you are looking for a more typical ""rpg"" experience, this is not for you. If you are looking for something fun, rather light, and enjoyable with friends, this is a good game to pick.4) I recommend purchasing the game on sale. It is just a little too pricey at it's original price in my opinion, but nabbing it on sale is generally a good idea. I got it at a slight discount.5) The game is turn-by-turn and is certainly not going to eat any significant amount of your time. If you just need something sort of light to play for ten minutes, this is a good game to pick up. If you are looking for a somewhat more serious game purchase, perhaps you should not buy this. I do not have a lot of time logged in at all, but I have already beat the game a few times.6) The game, even though it is short, does have some replay value.7) Ahem. Demon baby. That was unexpected. Especially when it stopped being a baby...Ultimately, I recommend it. Just remember that this is not a typical gaming experience, and gamers who prefer more standard grinding/number crunching/tactics-style games might want to give this a pass. If you're the type of person to be fascinated by choices and options, to see how your choices affect others and endings, then you might like this.			"

												It's a simple enough concept of a game.  Four people go about their lives for 6 weeks, visiting up to 8 locations and choosing one of two actions at the location they choose.  Each choice will provide a bonus to the character's stats, and there will be a secondary event.  After 6 weeks, the town will be destroyed and you choose a role in order to help rebuild.That is the gameplay in its entirety.  The genius of the game comes from the varied events, how those events can lead to other events, and the beautiful resolution as you're told what your character does with his/her life.  Also, the music is well-thought out.  I think there's only three separate songs for the six weeks, and they all use the same theme with an increase in tension as The Yawhg approaches.  The final song, however, is amazing and I don't think I'll ever grow tired of hearing it.  Whether it's $5 or $10, I insist that you pick this up, sit down with some friends, and live life inside of The Yahwg.			"

So I will give you a rundown on why I feel so mixed along with if it's a good or bad thing.Pros:The game itself can be beaten in around 10-15 minutes-You pick 1-2 or maybe all 4 of the characters and build their statsThese stats affect in game things that happen along with the endThe gameplay is like a visual novelThe art work of the game is beautiful and refreshingThe music is amazingCons:You can't really get attached to the characters so you don't feel anything at the endVery little content even for a short game$10 is a little high I would have payed maybe $5 for itThe game seems amazing at first but slowly becomes state as there isn't really much to it.Not any real randomization. Go to the hospital oh no demon baby, oh no I got the swirly disease. etc.No options meue so you can't play windowed or adjust the volumeOh yeah ear♥♥♥♥♥♥from that amazing music.I want to recommend the game I really do, but it' just not the best there is for choose your own adventure.

												The Yawhg is a seemingly quick game with not much to do on the surface, but first glances of this game would be wrong.With a wonderful aesthetic, beautiful music and images, and a strong if loose narrative, The Yawhg is a beautiful and refreshing game you can pick up for 10-20 minutes at a time.The characters do not have much of a personality on their own, instead you sort of put your own will upon them and their options and events open to them change depending on their stats and previous choices. Saying that, you can end up with vastly different characterizations even using the same two people over and over again. The game supports up to 4 characters working in the world at once, and can in fact even be treated as a hotseat multiplayer game.The choices and tasks you do in the game have deep and lasting effects, completely changing which avenues are open to you while keeping all avenues of adventure open. The Yawhg presents a rich and satisfying game, beautiful in looks and story. Filled with melancholy and whimsy the Yawhg is suitable for anyone looking for a good time.			"

												Only buy this if you intend to play it as a party game with four people at least, and people have been drinking heavily and most of them don't usually play games.  This could be a fun little diversion for up to even as long as half an hour if you really drag it out, but I'm not sure it's worth the money even for that much entertainment.  There's nothing here for the single player - it's just too brutally short and simple.  You can probably finish it inside of five minutes, and it does not take very long at all for the options to start repeating on your multiple playthroughs.  There's a bit to like about it, if only there were more of it, but simply adding more weeks however, would probably expose the lack of depth.For a very similar type of gameplay with a bit more depth and much more duration, try 'Monster Loves You!'

It says the game ""randomizes a unique story every time you play"", but on my second play through the results were already repeating themselves exactly as before.It's too bad, this is a lovely little game with beautiful artwork and music. The game is so short that you really don't care if anything ""bad"" happens, because you'll just finish and start a new game in five more minutes. Your choices really don't have much impact. The main reason I'm not recommending this is based on how much gameplay/replay value you get for the purchase price. There's no reason this game should be priced over $4.99 at most.			"

Expect no depth.So, with these in mind, why would I recommend this?Simply: It's a fun way to spend half an hour with a small group of friends, brought us some laughs and giggles, and was worth the couple bucks I spent.The game is essentially a ""choose your adventure"" in which each player is allowed to make a few decisions over the course of a session. At the end, everyone's choices create an outcome for them that's some shade of negative, neutral, or positive. Though each character's story is connected, they really only interact very loosely.Think of it as a little board game to pull off the shelf when someone brings their kids over.			"

												The long and short of it:At 10 CHF (roughly 10 USD) the game isn't worth it. That's just too steep a price for something so short, and so indefinable.The slightly longer:The game is fun to play. It's odd and quirky with an interesting visual style and often bizarre narrative. Without spoiling anything I'll just say that no matter how many times you play it you'll likely never really feel as if you know what in the hell is actually going on. That in itself doesn't bother me in the least, but the main reason I have to come down on the side of ""not recommended"" is the price, plain and simple. The game does offer replayability, and in fact sort of encourages it, being a point-and-click with a somewhat variable storyline and outcomes. And maybe you and a group of drunken friends will get some laughs, or be moved to have deep philisophical discussions of the kind that only drunken friends can have, but when all's said and done (which will take very little actual time), your experience with the game may well resemble the experience you'll have the next morning. You'll have a slight headache, and some dim recollection that something meaningful may have happened, and then you'll try to forget the whole thing and get on with your day.If it drops to half price, sure, give it a whirl, but for 10 bucks you can sit this one out and, if you're so inclined, learn everything that can possibly be learned about it by watching a 5 minute video on Youtube, because that's about how much entertainment you'll get in a typical playthroughl anyway.

Nothing you do really feels impactful.  The description tells that you the world is fully fleshed out so I was expecting a much deeper experience than this, but it never really goes beyond ""you were out drinking and then this happened!"".

												I wouldn't recommend this game at full price.After reading the reviews, I thought ""The Yawhg"" was going to be an exciting adventure story. I, personally, go to games based on their stories. Seeing this one tagged ""Story Rich"" caught my attention, and I figured, ""Hey, why not give it a go?"". I was extremely disappointed.. It was not at all exciting. Overall, it just felt flat and boring. The only things I really felt were at all worth it about this game were the music and the art style. The compositions were impressive, but that was the extent of my satisfaction with the game. I suppose this game could be fun if you invited over a couple of friends and played it drunk with people, but still, I would not recommend investing the $10 on this game... It's just not worth it.

												A lot of people think this game is random - it's not. It's all based on your skill stats. If you work to raise your magic skill and no others, and something like a finesse roll comes up - you will fail that roll. The randomness comes in what skills are tested at each location. I worked to raise my mind skill at the hospitol and ended up continually failing physique rolls, and as a result ended up raising my magic skill and lowering my mind, leading to my picking the conjurer ending for that character. This makes it seems as though the game is random, but it's all ruled by your base stats.That said, this game can be played in 10 minute intervals if you're killing time, or in longer stretches if you want to unravel more story lines. It's very rewarding getting the best endings, but even some of the worst plot twists reward your curiosity. I tried to play an evil character and stayed in the slums pickpocketing on every turn but ended up giving that character the best Robin Hood ending I could have imagined. Some endings seem great, but have a twist to them that ends up haunting you and bringing you back just to try to improve it. I reccomend playing with all characters out as that seems to lengthen the game time.This game is quick paced (if you want it to be) and rewarding, and worth a play -  or five or six or a hundred.-Misha			"

												I'm pretty disappointed with this game. I love the idea of interactive stories with random events where choices are supposed to matter. But I don't feel like my choices mattered at all here... the game is over within 1o minutes. That's like reading a book that ends on the prologue. And to add insult to injury on playthrough 2 I see many of the same so called random events that I saw in playthrough 1, all over again, which makes me realize there's practically zero variety of possible events and almost no replayability because by playthrough 3 I had milked it for every permutation it was possibly worth and the whole experience was over in 30 minutes... The aesthetic is glorgious, but the price is steep for what it is.			"

												I'd like to start by pointing out this is a novel idea for a game; one usually finds the genre of text-based adventures to be overrun by crap. Sadly ""The Yawhg"" falls short of being enjoyable by simply being lazily released. On just the second playthrough I found myself in situations which felt familiar, largely because I'd been subjected to the same bar-brawl and alchemist mishap just minutes beforehand. The straight lack of variety is what kills this title for me.Sadly my ♥♥♥♥♥ doesn't end there, as being a lazy console port also throat-punched my inner child. You really couldn't remove the ""press A"" prompts? I really have to hold a button down to exit? Come on, give us a proper menu. Finally: Multiplayer - or lack thereof. Who in Robocop's name plays local multiplayer on PC? I'd wager anyone who would even begin to consider it is lacking the ""friends"" prerequisite for multi-user gaming.To summarise, a shoddy port which doesn't try hard enough. Nice idea, but one I really hope somebody with game building prowess mimics.			"

												The Yawhg has excellent writing, interesting mechanics, an incredibly low barrier to entry, and the art is gorgeous!This title really shines with multiple players and despite technically only featuring local coop, it works nicely over live stream or any video conference software with screen share. Each playthrough will be short but multiple playthroughs are rewarding because there is actually a lot to see here. There are unexpected interactions and numerous choices to make that really do change the outcome. The Yawhg very much encourages the players to see what happens instead of simply trying to win by making the correct decisions. Playing the game is creating the story, which might not be for everyone, but there is a lot here to play with here! "

												The Yawhg is a fun game you can play by yourself, but the true fun of the game comes from playing it with friends.  Playing by yourself you'll likely have encountered every possible scenario, or at least have a good idea of what you need to do to get whichever ending you want, after a couple quick playthroughs.  That's where friends come in.  Friends add a layer of challenge to the game, because you can be assured that friends will be the ones to trample all your hopes and dreams of getting a good ending.  Sometimes you can get everyone to work together and other times there'll be that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ friend who just wants to do everything in their power to try and make sure everything goes down in flames.  Friends are the random variables that make The Yawhg fun and increase the play time of the game.  A single playthrough normally doesn't take too long, but again that all depends on how much time you spend talking over the decisions you need to make and laughing (or crying) over the results you reap from said decisions.  Overall for a $10 game it has a lot of playability (if you play with friends).  It also doesn't hurt that the game has beautiful graphics and music.			"

												I've played The Yawhg twice on my own and twice with a friend and had a blast every time! It's a really simple concept: something bad's going to happen in six weeks, but you're not going to worry about that, there's hunting to do in the forest, patients to tend at the hospital, and malicious hedges to confront!You play a minimum of two characters (up to four) playing with friends is as easy as passing the keyboard (or controller) back and forth. Gameplay is simple, you choose an area of the city that you want to spend your week at, and then you choose what you want to do at that location. For instance, at the palace, you can choose to do administration work or attend a ball. Each activity will raise different stats (physique, finesse, charm, mind, magic, wealth). Random events at each location will also raise or lower certain stats, often, you will be asked to make a choice during these events. Whether you pass or fail seems to depend on stats some of the time and on random rolls other times. The game mixes comedy and horror in a way that reminds me of Welcome to Night Vale with a pinch of Princess Maker 2 and the art style of Don't Starve or a Roald Dahl book. It's funny, dark, and at times very disturbing, and it frequently flip flops between funny and horrifying moments in the space of seconds (the endings are particularly prone to this).Yes, The Yawhg is pretty short, a single playthrough can take anywhere from ten to twenty minutes (or longer if you're playing with friends) and you will be seeing repeat events quite often, but the game has a ton of different endings, and each playthrough tells a different story. In short, if you like interactive fiction, a bit of comedy with your horror, or maybe you're just looking for something unique, The Yawhg is well worth the full price.			"

												Did you enjoy D&D?  Do you not have time for it anymore?It's okay—nobody does.  But next time you have a bachelor party with your nerd friends, get your drinks, buy the Yawhg, pick someone to click and narrate it, and laugh as everyone goes balls-deep into tragedy and comedy.I really enjoyed Emily Carroll's ""Through the Woods"", and her illustrations in this game add whimsy and horror in the best way that could be done.  There's no live narration but there is a constant contemplative soundtrack that adds to the meaningful experience.  The game will surprise you, even if there is a bit of repetition to be found.TL;DR The music is good, the art is good, the price is good, and the satire is good—the Yawhg is good stuff.			"

												This game looked hilarious but would have been better as a card-/boardgame with friends. The concept as a PC game felt spectacularly lackluster and took about 12 minutes to complete from start to finish. You choose up to 4 characters and rotate between them, choosing a different map location for them to perform Task A or B. It has stats that change each turn you make and you're given Result X or Y for each turn. (That's it. Choose a location, choose an action, event happens, you choose your response, solution. End of turn. This whole process takes about 30 seconds max) Overall the game would have been much cooler as anything other than a pc game. If you're easily amused by ""Well that escalated quickly!"" type scenarios, you'll love it. Otherwise I'm annoyed I paid money for this game, even at half off.			"

												This is a good game, and a great party game if you have 2 or more players (best with 4)  There are a lot of people who play ""The Yawhg"" a few times through and say that it is pretty monotonous.  My statement to them is that they are probably monotonous in their play style.  If you play this game trying to maximize your character, it turns into a boring game quickly.  This is a game for adventurousness and sometimes crazy play styles will actually make a much more successful and interesting ending.  Those who played the game through 3 times are judging a game almost by the tutorial.  You need to play quite a few times to see some of the interesting random occurances play out that make the game really fun.			"

												Initially, when I first heard of this game, I just figured, ""hey, this looks kinda neat but I'm not paying $10 for it becuase I'm a lousy cheap♥♥♥♥♥"" It looked like a cool concept to me and if it looks like a cool concept to you, then you're perhaps in for something of a treat.Now, when I first played it on my own, I wasn't particularly entertained. I mean, yes, the different story paths were somewhat interesting and the various different endings were kinda cool but I wasn't really absorbed into it. It was just something I used to make a good 45 minutes pass by one day when I was feeling bored. Then, while with some friends the other night, I decided to pull it out because we all needed a game to play and this just so happened to be multiplayer and seemed like a nice change of pace from the usual stuff we always tend to play (e.g. Genital Jousting, Jackbox Party Pack, etc.) What I didn't expect was for us to keep playing over and over again for several more hours, as we found ourselves unusually entertained by this strange little game.This is because where The Yawhg shines is in its multiplayer gameplay. As you each play through the runs as your individual character, you become attached to the story and are actually quite affected by the events that happen to you. Trying not to spoil any of the specific events as that would take away from your game experience overall, I will say that each event is quite interesting when it first happens. You feel fear, shock, and surprise as you're faced with various choices, unsure of their meaning or where they lead but finding yourself satisfied by the game's clever use of various fantasy cliches to create a coherent story for your character. But it's in this that the game's largest flaw lies. See, there's only a limited number of events that occur, and, though the game is likely designed to be played in sets of multiple consecutive runs, after a few playthroughs you start to see events repeat and they lose the impact that they originally had on the player. No longer does the story really have any sort of impact, and instead you begin picking choices just to try to get a different ending and experimenting, skipping through the game's incredibly creative dialogue and just rushing through each run. It's still enjoyable in a way, but it's a much less interesting experience as the game goes on and on which I was disappointed by to some extent.The gameplay itself is quite simple. The game is more or less a choose-your-own-adventure book, and thus you play it by simply making choices on where to go, what to do, and how to react to the random event that always occurs. The gameplay is there to simply give the player choice, immersing them in the story that the game crafts and presents, and in that regard it succeeds. I truly don't think this game is for everyone, and if you're the type of person who's driven by a ""win-lose"" sort of mindset then this game might not necessarily appeal to you in terms of how it plays, because the enjoyment is not through feeling as though you ""won"" the game. It's through that feeling of autonomy and choice, the decision it grants that makes the player feel unique and able. It does, essentially, what it's supposed to do. The characters will recieved stat boosts that affect their decisions throughout the course of each run, and once you learn what different actions give you then there is some thinking that may go into character building in whatnot, but it's really not sophisticated enough to become the main draw of the game.Graphically the game is quite appealing. The art is drawn cute but not excessively so, and the visuals are primarily presented in a still-painting format that simply serves to accompany the text as opposed to distracting from it, which I thought was a good design decision. The art style is haunting in a way, matching the somber yet somehow mildly humorous nature of this game. Truly, The Yawhg is not a particularly happy game, and it may give you chills if you're not ready for some of what it presents, and the art style adds greatly to this. Musically, the game has a very relaxing, quiet soundtrack, but I was bothered by the fact that often times it consisted of little 6-second loops playing over and over again as the players went through their days. It accompanies the game well enough but the fact that I could hear it looping was quite bothersome. However, there is a full track that plays at the end and beginning of every run that is so intensely haunting and emotional that my friends and I all found ourselves quite affected by it playing.Essentially, the Yawhg is not a game that you'll find yourself playing very often if you do decide to buy it, which is something that you probably should keep in mind when making your purchase. Rather, it's a game that you'll pull out from time to time when you have enough time to forget many of the random events and are able to experience them fully again. Also, it's WAY better with friends. Trust me.			"

It's actually a very short raising sim where you have six turns to beef up your characters (don't stress about which characters to pick - they're functionally identical, *ONLY* their art is different) before a disaster affects the city. Before playing, I somehow had the idea that the Yawhg disaster was different every playthrough. It's not! It's always the same, you can't protect anyone from it, and (despite all the other weird magic stuff in the game) the nature of the disaster is really boring. After the disaster is over, you choose your new post-Yawhg career and succeed or fail (to varying degrees) based on your stat points and sometimes the special events you experienced. (Note that the careers have no stat requirements, because programming in a ""Given that you have literally zero Charm, the other survivors laugh at your suggestion that you should be the leader"" message would have been too much work).A single playthrough lasts about 10-15 minutes. You can play again and get new events and endings, but I started seeing repeats as early as my second playthrough, so no thanks.			"

												Apocalyptic yet hopeful. The Yawhg rewards us with a short exciting story about a doomed city from the viewpoint of humble citizens. The story so simple, so unexpected and engaging though, replayability is a must.If you appreciate short plays, unexpected outcomes, and playing with the hand of fate you will love The Yawhg (the game, not the Yawhg itself).

												I went back and forth on whether or not I wanted to recommend The Yawhg to others. In the end, I decided on a no because, while it is in equal measures unique, fun, and visually appealing, The Yawhg is, quite frankly, not worth the asking price. On on hand, I really want other people to experience the Yawhg's interactive story. The art is a delight to look at, the writing, although brief, is clever, and most importantly, It's fun, especially if you sit at a computer with a couple friends and play it as a co-op. On the other hand, the game is too short. And I say this as someone who will happily shell out money for short, high-quality games. A playthrough of The Yawhg will last 10-15 minutes at best. You could argue that this is because The Yawhg is meant to be played multiple times, but after five playthroughs, which only took me an hour, I felt like I had seen everything there was to see. The ""randomized"" events are not randomized enough (for example, --mild spoiler-- if you go to the hospital at a certain point in time, your event will always, always be the patient with the sores, which leads into the same chain of events that last the rest of the game). In an even bigger flaw for a game trying to accomplish what The Yawhg is, there also aren't nearly enough events, which is why I felt like I had seen at least 90% of them by the fifth playthrough. More of a subjective complaint, and another mild spoiler, but I found the ending to be a letdown. Not just in the ""wait... that's it? The game is already over??"" sense, but also because I felt like the narrative leading to the ending didn't fit what happened at the end. I do realize that it was intentionally misleading, but just because it was intentional doesn't mean it was carried out well. I love games as a storytelling medium, and I'm so on board with what The Yawhg was trying to do, but it fell short in almost every area. If it had significantly more content, or if it cost $5 instead of $10, I'd be badgering everyone I know to buy it. As it stands, I'd save your money and wait for someone else to come along with a better execution of this very cool concept.			"

												I bought The Yawhg before it was released on Steam, and I really wish I could recommend it, but I can't. It's a menu-based time management game for up to four players with gorgeous comic art, which would be fine if there was enough content for more than a few playthroughs. The problem is that after you've played it a couple of times, the random events begin to repeat, and you get the sinking feeling that you've already seen all that there is to see. Honestly, it seems like it was designed to impress people who don't actually play games.I strongly recommend checking out Emily Carroll's comics at emcarroll.com. If you're interested in a similar style of time management game, take a look at Horse Master at noncanon.com/HorseMaster.html "

												It's really tough to give this a thumps up or down. It's interesting to play through a couple of times but since it's an incredibly short game (one playthrough is about 10 minutes) and some of the random events did repeat already in the second playthrough it won't be able to keep you entertained for long. For the price rather get a game like FTL that also offers this kind of storytelling but combines it with more depth in the gameplay department.			"

												Aesthetically beautiful, with great atmosphere and a strong soundtrack, I really wanted to like this game. Unfortunately, it is an ultimately shallow experience. I'm happy replaying short games if they're engaging, but The Yawhg proved to be pretty vapid... even when making choices to get good endings, the results are always underwhelming; in fact, the whole experience, outside of the visual and aural presentation is underwhelming. The Yawhg provides a beautiful facade but is ultimately a very hollow game.			"

												First things first.  I must issue an apology to Gone Home, for it is not the most overrated game of 2013.  That title belongs to The Yawhg.I'll try and start by saying some nice things about it.  The art is lovely, and the music is appropriate and enjoyable.  Oh, and it doesn't overstay it's welcome.  It took me all of 12 minutes to finish my first playthrough.And it's a good thing my following playthroughs also lasted 12 minutes each, because that allowed me to better understand just how mechanically shallow this game is.  You (and maybe some freinds) take control of two to four characters living in a villiage that's six full weeks away from being sacked by the titular Yawhg.  You spend each week engaged in one of 16 different activities at one of eight different locations.  These activities will reward the character with stat upgrades, followed by a Visual Novel style scenario with two choices that can either grant additional stat points or take points away.  The scenarios themselves vary from day, but aren't very deep or engaging.Sadly, no matter what you do, the Yawhg will level your hometown, forcing the survivors to rebuild.  This is where your pre-Yawhg stat-building comes into effect.  Each player character now has to take a role in rebuilding the town, and their performance in the choosen role is dependant their stats and other pre-Yawhg actions.  A character who built up a large magic stat will perform wonderfully as a conjuror, while someone with an abundance of charm will make a natural leader.  After a brief epilogue, the game ends.And that's it.  That is all 12 minutes.  The game justifies it's existance by billing itself as some sort of multiplayer party game, with four players taking turns at the hotseat.  There's some replayability to be had, since certain events are dependant on the outcomes of other player actions, but these rarely effect the outcome.  In fact, barely anything affects the outcome.  The Yawhg smashes things up no matter what you do, and all your efforts amount to is how soundly the rebuilding effort goes.  The Yawhg is a Multiplayer Visual Novel that lacks both the gameplay mechanics for a deep multiplayer experience and the emotionally charged story of a good Visual Novel.2/10			"

												A surprisingly great party game, The Yawhg is filled with laughter and spectacular failures all around. Get a group of up to 4 friends together and have each of them control a character in the game's world. Each round lasts around twenty minutes long, and is replayable enough to easily last the length of an entire night of fun. Is made even better when you bring a great narrator to read the dialogue aloud and give it a bit more depth.			"

												As much as I'd like to recommend The Yawhg, I just can't. It's beautiful and it has a great core idea, but it's awfully short and unfulfilling.The ""unique story"" is far from unique and it gets repetitive on the second play-through. It is also pretty shallow and the fate of the characters often seems to ignore their background and your efforts (for example, a werewolf that killed a lot of people can kind of live happily ever after, but a person who had a normal life and became the leader of the survivors may go insane and drink him/herself to oblivion; not to mention a hunter dying of hunger in the woods or a person who spent all the time tending sick people at the hospital not being able to act as a doctor after the Yawhg). And just when you think that you're going to have any real impact on the story, it turns out that the game is over and you can only start from the beginning, hoping to come along a line of text that you haven't yet seen.Furthermore, the characters don't meet each other and not all of their actions result in changes to the whole town that can be experienced by the rest of the protagonists. I played the game alone and I really can't imagine it being more fun with more people, because you just don't interact with them in any way. You can have some laughs about the choices each of you makes, but there's no actual co-op play - you do what you want with your character and you hope that his or her skills will be useful in the end.Finally, I don't see any improvements and/or fixes coming to The Yawhg. There are no game options whatsoever, so you can't change the resolution, or sound, or anything; alt-tabbing and window mode workarounds bug the game. Besides the local co-op, there is no option to play with someone else, because, according to the developer, ""online multiplayer would be silly and underwhelming"". There was a word of a ""MASSIVE free expansion"", but nothing has been heard about it since 2014. The game could've at least had some achievements to keep me interested for a bit longer, but it seems like it was too ""silly"" to include such things. The final nail in the coffin is the ridiculously high price for a game that's completed in 10 minutes and only pretends to offer a high replay value.			"

												A strange, short, and varied pick your own adventure game.Playing solo was a bit of a flat experience.While the randomly generated plot was interesting, the game failed to provide any sense of immersion or depth.Gameplay consists solely of a short collection of binary choices that offer no real risk or reward for the player.Is it fun?Playing solo is a curious, but meaningless experience.In a group, this may be more enjoyable. The target audience however would get much better value from an afternoon with a few dice and a good imagination.Is it worth the cost?No. While the game does attempt to make an interesting exploration of the value of choice, it simply doesn't make any effort to be more than a decision tree. This would make a good submission for a student project, but does not stand up as a commercial game.In summary, while The Yawhg may present an interesting 30 minutes to a group of four, it is time and money better spent elsewhere.

												Ok so, here's the thing. The Yawhg isn't a bad game, in fact the ideas behind the game and the execution are very sound. The problem is that this really shouldn't be a paid product. The Yawhg feels and plays like a free flash game, and ironicly is no where near as good as other Flash games of this type. Unlike the interactive fiction games you find on Kongrigate The Yawhg isn't really a single player game, rather is basicly a digital Cards vs. Humanity type experience (i hope that makes sense). The Yawhg is turnbased, with each turn repersenting a week Players take turns selecting what they will do on any given week, after 7 weeks a great disaster (the titualr Yawhg) will befall the city and using the skills you've learned throughout the last 7 weeks will try to repair the town in the best way you can. the idea being that the event's pre-Yawhg will be so wacky that players will be able to laugh and have a good time and all the post-Yawhg stuff will be really sad and dramatic. In practice though it's horibly broken, the way the game is structured with it's stat system means that after about one playthrough you'll have no problem easily maxing out a stat to win at the end. This would be fine if the random events at the core of the game kept you guessing, but they don't. Not because there bad or anything but because there are so few of them. I bet that if you played the game with four players one you would see everything this game had to offer. So in other words the game has no replay value what so ever and in the end for a game that costs $10 that's unacceptable.It may sound like The Yawhg is the worst thing ever but it's not. It clear that the developers put a lot more heart and soul into it then... other games *cough* Call of Duty *cough* and i would love to see a game like this with a lot more random events. But The Yawhg just feels unfinished, both as a regular video game and as the party based experience it WANT'S to be. Meaning i can't recomend playing 10 or even 1 dollers on The Yawhg, becing as it clearly shouldn't be a paid product.Nice art though.			"

												This game is a great example of how there are no true quality metrics in video game design.  Graphics?  This game is entirely un-animated and the still images consist completely of low-res cartoons.  Gameplay?  You pick options off a menu.  Music?  One guitar.  Story?  You will finish it in less than a half hour.And yet The Yawhg is probably worth twice its $10 asking price.  In a market saturated with ""gameplay advancements,"" ""4K resolution,"" ""roleplaying elements,"" and hundred-hour lengths, very few game developers stop to ask themselves whether they are using these tools to do something worth doing.  The Yawhg does something worth doing and does not need any of these tools to do it.To nitpick the game's description, The Yawhg is not a ""Choose Your Own Adventure.""  Choose Your Own Adventure books very rarely had multiple main characters or stats to track.  The Yawhg is a /Gamebook,/ and while these were great fun in the 80s before we had real branching-path video games, today this is the best possible format for the medium.  The Yawhg is a perfect example of the synergy of right tools and right task, and it is worth the time of anyone who enjoys a good interactive story.  I suppose you might call this a visual novel -- I don't know, really, I feel like genre has become largely irrelevant in describing video games.The story of The Yawhg is different every time you play it, so I can't comment on its quality universally, but if you find yourself telling a story you don't care for, it will only last for 20 more minutes.  Suck it up and then start a new one.  I still recommend you finish the playthrough, however, because what comes to pass may surprise you.More like this, please, industry.  More like this.			"

												The game has great artwork, good music, interesting and humorous choices that refreshingly impact other parts of the town, and a great premise.However I'm giving this a thumbs down for two major reasons:1) The game is over, very quickly.  Why wasn't there more to do after The Yawhg happened?  Even if it was just a seven-week repeat of what previously happened, give us more.2) There's no main menu which means no settings, volume controls, fullscreen/windowed toggle, ANYTHING.  Heck, there's literally no way to exit the game without just Alt-F4ing it.  Alt-tabbing the game even crashed it.  For $4.99 I expected a little more on the technical side, guys.This is a game that I'd be pleasantly surprised to receive in a Humble Bundle, but not purchasing directly.

It's also an easy game to share with friends or partners that don't normally play games (but you may wonna screen it a few times before you play it with younger children, there is some darker content there). It has funny and bleak moments, good writing, cute images, beautiful music, and it's good at what it sets out to do: It crates an interesting scaffold for player driven stories, and plays DM at the decision making moments. Which also means that most of the enjoyment comes from what you put into it.Because your characters start off as completely blank canvases, the fun will be very short-lived if you are just trying to ""win"". Instead pick a backstory or at least an archetype for them, and invest them with some motivations. This further serves to make the (moderate) amount of content feel much more expansive. There are frequent skill checks dictating the outcome of choices and events, but the developers have managed to allow for some entertaining ""arbitrary"" results, where the game succesfully imitates a sometimes benevolent and sometimes evil DM punishing or rewarding the players and pushing the game in different directions.And yes, there are many branching and converging paths with fun (or horrid) unexpected results down the line, but even within an hour of playing you will start running into repetitions. Which matters little if you are playing with friends and roleplaying different characters, but will probably become boring fast for one person playing alone.In short, if you're with a friend trying to decide what to do for the evening, and if you like a bit of roleplaying, this is a good (and much cheaper) alternative to going out for a movie. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, and plan to invite more friends to accidentally poison the town's water system with mutating substances, teach the king how to satisfy the queen and become addicted to strength poisons, all before the Yawhg arrives.

												This isn't a game; it is an interactive story that has 7 pages per character, with a wrap-up using details from some of the stuff that happened in the story. You can finish a session in under 5 minutes. For the price, I would heavily recommend watching someone else play it.There is also very little gameplay to speak of. Your character accrue Attributes for each choice you make. Each location gives you a fixed Attribute boost and then a choice to expand upon it (there is usually a positive gain). At the end of the game, you will have to make a choice - the outcome of which depends on the choices you made. This means that, from a gameplay perspective, it is incredibly shallow - since every location gives you a fixed benefit at the start, simply maximising it will let you power through to ""win the game"". I, in fact, could list what locations to visit to win the game right now but that would be exceedingly heartless. But I could and that fact should display how shallow it is.Story-wise, there is some continuity from one day to another but in general, there is not much connectivity. This is to be expected between characters, the point of the story is to display days lived out in the lives of these arbitrary characters in this city. However, the fact that there is very little connectivity within the events of any individual storyline basicly renders most of the events as stand-alone vignettes that could have happened to any other character and NOT the character you chose. In other words, unless you get one of the continuity-based events (which still only really leak into the next week's event), your character does not have a developing personal storyline, just a sequence of events that happened to happen to him/her.A final point on the gameplay as it relates to the story is that you don't know the effects of your actions beforehand. So, for at least the first time you see an event, there is an element of guesswork where you have to guess whether or not the thing you intended to happen will happen. Luckily, the game's events are very simple and there isn't a lot (if any) complexity to the story. It also happens to repeat itself a lot. In fact, on my third or fourth playthrough I happened to have already seen most of the events that were offered to me.A positive point is that the game's narration between weeks is atmospheric. Another positive point is that it has very good and fitting music (in my opinion).For these reasons, I would suggest NOT BUYING THIS GAME. Instead, watch someone else play it - you will get the same experience. Watch a run-through if you think that's an exaggeration. Stay away from purchasing game. Look at it, note what it attempts to do and then move on. It is nowhere remotely worth the money (except for the music, which as I said before, is pretty good in my opinion).			"

												The Yawhg is a cool game based on storytelling and random events.  However, after 20 minutes of gameplay, you can see them all and predict how much of what skill you need for each decision.  If there were more events, I would reconsider, but as it is the game is pretty quick with low replay value.			"

												I've played this with a friend and we were done within half an hour. The storytelling compells for a few moments but after that we were just clicking through the motions untill something new would happen, but it wouldnt. The game ended and all we did was click to another day, read some text, made a decision and waited for the next day. There's no actual gameplay involved, just some desicions to make, and by the way the days evolved i'm guessing the replay value is almost none.Not recommending it.			"

												You get very little by purchasing this game. It is a little bit fun in groups (but what game isn't?), but don't expect ANY replay value, you'll have seen events repeat without addition of any depth within the first hour.Pros: A fun group experience for one or two (pretty short) playthroughs Suitable for non-gamers.Cons: Very little strategy involved. Events start repeating themselves on the second or third playthrough -> No replay value Too expensive for a game this restricted. "

												This game is short - I played with 3 friends and we went through it once in about 30mins (we went a moderate pace). That being said, it's a light little RPG that shouldn't be played alone and that can add some laughs to a party if you have a group willing to get into it. The writing isn't atrocious and the choices are interesting - while you still have some to discover. I recommend getting it on sale and playing without high expectations. Just enjoy the ride :)			"

												The visual and the idea of the game is great but... it's SO short that it loses its purpose.I was really excited to get it, because I love this kind of game — the ""choose your adventure"" type with great illustrations. In my first play I probably finished in 10 minutes and I couldn't believe that. It's totally an incomplete game sold by a price that's not fair. The beautiful look doesn't worth the short time and the only 4 characters we have to choose. It's almost like we don't play at all, the story and the characters don't have time to captivate us and explain what and why those things happen.Yeah. I finished it so so disappointed I can't describe. Even trying to play more times seemed something repetitious to me. Some people liked the game, and it's fair to say that it's a beautiful game... But I really wish something more elaborate. Please, think about this, developers.			"

												I really REALLY wanted to give this game a thumbs up, but I can'tThe art style is wonderful, I love the music, and the gameplay, to me, is ok. It seems to be more focused on being a multiplayer game than a singleplayer game and that's okay. I love the story of how each person can choose a role and that role will effect the future of the town...However, every time I go to exit the game, it freaks out and crashes my computer. I haven't had this problem with any other game. I just tried holding ctrl+alt+delete to go to task manager so I could simply exit out of the game once it was stuck on a black screen. No luck, I only got another black screen. I've never had any sort of serious computer problem with any game before. Additionally, I have played this game more than what steam has recorded. I'm not sure if the crashing had anything to do with it or maybe just a bad internet connection.Please make it so I can exit your game without force shutting down my computer			"

												Pros: -Good art and sound-Interesting branching story-Co-op couch game-Short game lengthCons:-Short game length-Lack of features-Easily repetitive story Conclusion- The Yawhg is great if you like the ""choose your own adventure"" type games. It looks and sounds great, but there is a slight lack of gameplay elements. That is not to say that there isn't any game content; it will just take a few trail and error playthroughs to get to the more interesting choices in the story (especially with only six turns before the games conclusion). The Yawhg has plenty of replayability if you can find different groups of people to play with so you don't end up with the same story/ending every time.Imagine the fun and creativity of a game of DnD with waaaay less commitment.

												The whole point of the game is you choice from several locations in a town to buff up your character with the odd random event thrown in where the results depend on how your stats are currently. The reason you need to buff up your character is to prepare them for the end of the world. Once it has arrived you need to pick a role that best suites your character by picking a role that suites the stats they have. Depending on how well the characters do in their final roles will decide the ending.Great game for parties, especially if you have someone with a good voice narrating the process.You will get many-a-laughs from your choices and how events playout.I cannot reccomend this game however unless it is going cheap as chips as the game simply does not have enough content to justify the price it is asking for.I love the art and the relaxing theme song and the game in general is charming but it's just not worth the asking price.The downsides also include: - The game optimal wise is not that good, with it lacking an options menu.  - Tabbing out of the game breaks the game and you will need to use task manager to close it. Putting the game into windowed mode also breaks the game.  - This means you can not adjust the sound for the game as tabbing out of the game at all breaks it and even if you set the volume then reset the game to fix the game from breaking due to you tabbing out to adjust the volume in the sound mixer, the sound levels keep resetting themselfs every time. - No resolution options. - No replayability. - You should in theory be able to play the game over Skype with your friends as the game is simply choice based but due to the bugs the game has, this is simply not possable which is really disapointing. Even if you use the Watch game feature on Steam, you will still have trouble as you would barely be able to hear them from the loud music that is unadjustable.If you have friends that you can have come over and the game is going SUPER cheap, then the game is good for a giggle, but otherwise I'd stear clear.

												The fact that it is possible to complete this very halfassed game in 10 minutes is pretty much the reason you should not spend the 10 buck asking price for it. Are they kidding? What on EARTH makes them think a random game with little gameplay involved is going to be worth 10 dollars?Here's the game. You pick anywhere from 1-4 characters. You send them to a random location, get a random stat increase, which, considering there is no battle system whatsoever, is merely to decide how successful you are at future random stat increases... then 6 turns later, you choose a profession for your character(s), and the game decides if you were lucky enough to merit a happy or sad ending. Pretty lame, huh? Control wise? If you alt tab out of the game to lower the volume because the music gets really dull after awhile, the game crashes. And there is no option to mute in game. In fact, no option menu at ALL! You can play it, or play something else. This game doesn't WANT to be muted or windowed or any of that. That is frankly, an insult to gamers. I should be able to reduce the loud volume of your game. That's just standard practice, you terrible programmers you.Look, for further reasons not to get this game? Zoe Quinn is listed in their thank you section when you complete the game. If that isn't a reason to run far the hell away from this game, I don't know what is. Don't even bother to wait for a sale, no amount of money makes this worth a look. Even at a 90% discount, you're still looking at a buck for this, and a buck is like 99 cents too expensive for a 10 minute reading exercise. It's not even worth the trading cards. Skip this with extreme prejudice.			"

												The Yawhg is reminiscent of old choose your own adventure games that's visually appealing. Best played with imaginative friends who like to inject some role-playing into their characters to enrich the experience. The game is extremely easy to get into and is all about making choices which sometimes lead to unexpected results. The story is left to some interpretation, the visuals are unique and pleasing coupled with ambient music that sets a whimsical, relaxing environment.If you're looking for something light, somewhat random and quirky to kill a couple of hours, this would be a nice game to introduce to non-gamers. The Yawhg however, is quite short, simplistic and with consecutive multiple playthroughs to unlock all the endings, it becomes repetitive, thus I'd suggest only buying it when there's a sale going on.

When I had seen that the lovely, sumptuous, supple Emily Carroll had helped done the art for this videogame, I immediately became erect. I, for all 20 something of my steam friends, would have the opportunity to show how very sophisticated I was by purchasing this extremely fun videogame. I was not mistaken in this. Thank you for this level gem, and thank you for remembering that videogames are supposed to be fun. So much fun I finished my first game after around 10 or so minutes and never played again as to not tarnish the experience of course.			"

												This is an incredibly simple game, yet it always manages to bring out some emotion in me - be it the awe of standing on the shoulders of giants, or the sadness of gaining fame and wealth, but never finding love and happiness. I just played a couple of games with my sick girlfriend, and I was crying a river when we reached an example of number two.The music is freaking amazing, somehow managing to be both somber and inspire hope at the same time.I highly recommend playing this with at least one other person. The writing is still enjoyable when played alone, but getting invested in the story with someone else is just amazing.			"

												Although it's short and contains a limited number of events, The Yawhg is still a great game.  Its writing and art are both excellent, and seeing how your actions impact your characters and the game's ending is fun.  It's a fine game to play in short sittings, and takes on new dimensions when played with friends, as your actions affect both your own experience and theirs.  For its low price, it's hard not to recommend this game.			"

												It's a great game, especially for that time when you have 4 friends and only 3 controllers. However after a few playthroughs many of the events are quite repetitive, but the endings have always been different and are a joy to read. Overall fantastic storyline, no bugs so far, and the art is great. Could the developers occasionally add new content? Because that would really get 5 stars from me if I knew every time I played, There might be a slightly different ending....			"

												As a simple choose your own adventure stat manipulator the game is a little lackluster.  Any illusion of multiplayer is if people want to spend 10 minutes doing this as a group activity around the computer.As a more articulate reviewer noted it's impossible to invest in characters when the game is done in ten minutes and it's impossible to be upset on how you did because there is literally no investment of time.  You did well, so what, you did terrible, who cares?I'm just not sure when I would want to spend a lot of time playing this game.			"

Definitely do not buy it unless it is deeply discounted, or you will probably be resentful.Also, be sure you play it with a friend.

												Friend recommended this to me as he said he'd seen a review on it and it was pretty good. Thing is I was really bored so I decided to give it a go. I guess it's true that people with more money and less sense really do provide for this shallow industry of false games.So about the game...if you would call it that...I don't and won't for the rest of this review. You start up this...thing...and you choose 2 to four characters. I guess it's supposed to be multiplayer, but the thing is that when you play with friends you either work together or against each other. You don't just randomly do single player things 'with' each other. the worst part is that nothing you do matters because there's no real 'point'.  you literally just go from place to place and read some text and make a yes or no answer which may or may not be good.This game could have had a chance if it was single player or something, but I don't see the point to the multiplayer. Like, why should I play this with friends instead of poker or mario party or something like that? It's not even online Mplayer and there's no windowed mode and if you alt tab you're screwed. The game isn't worth 10 bucks!I'm an idiot yes, but someone has to play it and suffer and all that jazz right? So yeah, don't get it unless you just want to just click around as if you're reading a book. Go read a book instead. It'll be cheaper and worth more.			"

												An okay game if a bit overpriced for 10$ (I'd recommend a pricepoint of 5$) considering the amount of overall content/things to do present.Essentially consists of a lot of RNG, short text-like events.Game is definitely meant for multiple people/a group of people to play in a social setting.Given that the game is primarily text-based and delving into the game files a bit (because I'm naughty) I'm sort of disappointed by the actual number of events/occurrences that can happen. You'll start seeing repeats in your second playthrough (and a tidy playthrough may only take 10 minutes), but hey you can't honestly expect much out of a game when Zoe Quinn is in the special thanks.I'm sort of neutral about the title, and subsequently don't recommend it.Just didn't do it for me.

I'd avoid it if I was you unless you can get it for £1-2, and that's coming from a fan of VNs (I'd even say Danganronpa is GOTY 2014 so far).			"

												In two sentences: Only pick this game up at a *steep* discount, as the game is too short, and there are not enough unique scenarios to justify the price tag.  I finished four (4) complete playthroughs in under an hour and saw many repeats.More detailed review (based on the singleplayer experience):The Yawhg is not so much a choose-your-own-adventure story (there is very little narrative, and your characters are gamepieces - not people) as it is a short opportunity to build up a couple of characters' stats in a short time to fulfill the game's hidden requirements.  There are four characters from whom to choose, but the only difference among them seems to be the appearance - I didn't notice any difference in events or stats.  As a single player, the game will ask you to choose two to four characters to play, and your goal is to raise their stats (there are six stats: physique, finesse, etc.).  For each turn, you will send each character to a place on the map to do a task.  There are eight locations and two possible tasks at each, so sixteen tasks in total from which to choose each turn, but two characters cannot be at the same location at the same time.  Each task will raise or lower one or more of your stats, but the only way to know what a task will affect is through trial and error.  Most tasks will also trigger a short text-based ""event,"" which may allow you to choose your character's response and further affect their stat gain/loss.  To be clear, as a fan of both visual novels and choose-your-own-adventure-type games, the game's systems are *not* the reason I am not recommending it.  The problem comes from the fact that the game only consists of six weeks (each turn is a whole week).  This means that you only have six opportunities to raise each character's stats before the Yawhg appears (off-screen) and wrecks the town (again, off-screen).  At that point, you are given a choice of roles for each character to take in the rebuilding process; again, there are no explanations or listed stat requirements, so you just kind of guess.  Finally, the game checks to see if your character's stats are high enough to meet its invisible requirements, and you get a couple of epilogue slides reflecting your characters' success/failure and their fates afterwards.  That's it.  Six turns, a guess, and an epilogue.  So, each playthrough is EXTREMELY short to begin with, and then there is the fact that although the game supposedly has something like 100-200 unique events (I'm not arguing that it doesn't), you will see a lot of repeats in each playthrough, so subsequent playthroughs are not as exciting.  When I first played the game, I did 3 full playthroughs: the first using 2 characters, the second using all 4, and the third using 3 just to be thorough.  All 3 playthroughs took me a combined *32 minutes*.  Thinking that maybe I missed something or was in a bad mood that day, I waited some time, then played it once more before posting this review.  Again, maybe 10 minutes, and I'm pretty sure that all but one of the events and the two ending cards were repeats.To finish, I hate to post a negative review for anything, but I just can't recommend this game at its $10 asking price given the dirth of content.  If you can get it for <$5 and plan on playing with friends, by all means go ahead: the art is unique and interesting, the music is nice, and I like the general concept -- there's simply not enough here to keep a person busy for even a single hour (and again, this is from someone who enjoys text- and menu-based games).  Sorry. :(			"

												A delightfully charming 2-4 player ""choose your adventure"" game. It can be played by just one person, you then control 2 to 4 characters for each of the weeks, or up to 4 people can control an individual character.In essence, you select a character and send them to a location each 'week'. There you will get a random event with two choices, which will have a certain effect on the character that can increase or decrease stats.At the end of the game, the last choice you make is weighed against the stats to see what happens.Where this game shines however is in how everything interacts. The choices are fairy-tale like whimsical, and as you play it you realise everything interconnects, so you are actually building a short but internally coherent story, that can be different every time.The game also has a really beautiful and fitting soundtrack. It is not offered on Steam alas, but you can find it on Bandcamp. I definitely recommend picking it up, too.HOWEVER, and it's potentially big problem for the full price -- the game is short. You will have seen almost all it has to offer in four or five ten-minute playthroughs. At the current discounted price of 50% I can recommend it, but it just falls short of a recommendation at the full cost.			"

												A game modelled after a choose-your-own-adventure. It's unique in it's story telling, and you're likely to get a couple of hours gameplay out of it - but it has nothing beyond that. You can control one (or four) characters, each mapped to a different direction on your control pad. Don't worry, the characters are 'controlled' through menus. You choose where a character should spend it's week - each choice has a different outcome, gives different stat bonuses, and influences the town you live in.After six weeks, the Yawhg arrives. The rebuilding effort starts - you need to use your characters, and the skills they've gained to help your town survive.The art in this game is gorgeous, and probably it's selling point. Would I recommend it? Sure - I enjoyed playing it. But it's not something I would pay full price for.Grab it on a sale.			"

The game consists of 7 turns for 2 or more characters in which you choose a location, an action, and then maybe a binary choice or two at a random event.The charm of the art and music and writing don't really make up for the fact that there isn't really a game here. This game should be a $3 or $5 purchase at most.			"

												Excellent casual cooperative role-playing game.For this game, you can choose from 4 characters (you need at least two) who take turns each week for 6 weeks at 16 different jobs around the city. Each job comes with stat upgrades and varying events that are at their best when they relate to each other: something that happens to one character can have an effect on what happens to another character later. Generally, the outcome of an event depends on whether you made a choice that your current stats will support: physique, finesse, mind, charm, magic, and wealth. Then the Yawgh comes, then there's another round that determines if the group has won or lost the game, and then each character gets their own ending. The writing is really nice, surprising at times, and the music supports it well.You can easily play this game on the couch with up to 4 players, just pass the controller/keyboard around (or connect more controllers), but of course you can also control all of the characters yourself. We did three quite enjoyable couch play-throughs on another account, and they took about half an hour each.It is not difficult to win this game. We wanted to play it more than once because one time is clearly not enough to see all the different things that can happen, and to reach all of the endings would take many more. Events start to repeat at some point, noticably so on our third game, but since there are choices and stats involved, many consequences of known events are still unknown.This is a good game. This game runs on my old Windows XP computer. Since texts are short and only move forward when you push a button, it is suited for learners of English if they have someone to explain the vocabulary (""leeches"", ""lutes"" and ""cantrips"" aren't exactly basic vocabulary).

												Played two complete games in 15 minutes, with a lot of repeat events on the second playthrough. Game is hella short, is what I'm ever so subtly implying. You can basically go through most of the content in half an hour or so, including all the endings.I guess it was advertised as a party game, but it doesn't have online co-op, and are you seriously going to invite people over to play hot-seat steam game? The writing is just about ""passably amusing"" at that.			"

												This game is tricky to recommend. On the one hand, it has about 100 minutes of gameplay, tops. On the other hand, it is an interesting and cohesive use of the medium to convey a specific idea. It uses a ""choose your own adventure"" style to allow each character you play to conduct different activities over the course of 6 turns. These activites grant or remove stats, and the stats you have determine how your character responds to different random events. At the end of the game, the stats help determine various outcomes for your character. It's a very, very simple and limited interface. However, the game is less interested in providing a compelling story than it is in demonstrating how the choices we make in life accumulate and ultimately create a story for us that makes sense only in retrospect. The relative meaninglessness of the stats in the game reflects the meaninglessness of our ""stats"" in our lives. At the end of the day, our lives are equally defined by choices and events beyond our control, and these both with have impacts on our lives and also the life of the community we inhabit. In conveying this idea, the gameplay and themes of this game are in perfect harmony and it makes for a memorable experience.			"

												With a group of the right friends, this game is amazing. We played the game four or five times through in one night, in an attempt to get better endings and I still want to play more. After 10 or so 30 minute playthroughs I've seen a large portion of the game, but I still feel that there are secrets to experience and endings to find. I can imagine that it wears thin once you've seen all of the stories that are possible, but even after that happens I feel like the desire to experience it with new friends might make me pull it out again. The art is great, the music is divine, and the sheer novelty of experiencing an interactive story with friends is endearing. I definitely recommend this game, but keep in mind that it might not be for everyone. It is admittedly a short experience, which makes it perfect to play multiple rounds with a group of friends in a board game format, but might turn some people off. As it is, I feel that it was definitely worth my money.			"

												While my recommendation is to not get this game I had a fun time with it and it is pretty well made for what it is.  the reason I can't recommend it is the price. I purchased it as part of a humble bundle so I got a few games to make the cost not as big of a deal, but I would have been utterly enraged had I bought it at full price. it just isn't worth that, but if you can get it as part of a bundle or at a very steep discount then I would get it.now with that out of the way onto the game, as it stand it is fairly intresting pick upto four characters then guide their weekly activities until their town is destroyed each activity has an event play out at the end of the week and it is random ( to an extent) what that event is.  This is not a bad basis for a gameand in theory it should have a lot of replay value, but since game lasts only seven rounds. the game lasts about five minutes, per completion. because it is so short you can use up the replayablility in the first hour easily, and that is really the big reason I find the full price outrageous. that said what little there is is fun the art is nice and the music is competent. If you like choose your own adventure stories you will probabl get a kick of  of this game, but wait to get it on sale or as part of a bundle.			"

												Damian Sommer and Emily Carroll’s The Yawhg is easily the most beautiful piece of choose-your-own-adventure fiction ever published. Carroll’s indie comics superstardom is immensely deserved and her work here depicts a wonderfully colorful world with a sensitive fairy tale look, defined not only by the setting, but by the flourish of the visual interface and of her distinctive hand lettering. Sommer and Carroll’s writing is whimsical, amusing, and mysterious, all in good measure. Ryan Roth’s shifting soundtrack feels perfectly of this world without being overbearing. As a production, The Yawhg is an aesthetic triumph.As a game, its success is tempered. The Yawhg tells a story that would have benefitted from more prose. Completing one cycle in the coming and going of the apocalyptic Yawhg event takes only a few minutes. The random events are interesting but never deep, always dropping a choice in your lap before you know it. Every encounter is succinct to a fault, eschewing any sort of satisfying narrative exploration for an exceedingly quick presentation. Some choices and events will affect future encounters for other members of your party in different areas of the world, which is quite impressive. Still, the number of possible events is not astoundingly numerous, and given the short length of each “run,” events may repeat themselves as early as the second playthrough, before they’ve even vacated your short-term memory.Playing the game with other people does somewhat alleviate the problems I’ve mentioned. It’s a joy to actually play a choose-your-own-adventure that actually allows for multiple people. Seeing the consequences of certain events weave between characters controlled by different people leads to some wonderful reactions. Chatter will do a lot to lengthen each go-around. As a social game, it’s quite nice. However, hosting or attending the right party that wants to kill an hour playing something like The Yawhg is an uncommon occurrence at best. And when it comes down to it, I prefer to immerse myself in the twists and turns of a good narrative and the beauty of great visuals all by my lonesome.For me, the pleasures of The Yawhg are few – too few for me to heartily recommend. It is not a bad game, but it is a game that caters to a group of people who often play games and experience art together. It’s just not a game for someone like me.			"

												The Yawhg is a fast, fun little game for up to four players.  The game requires minimal resources, playing out much like a ""choose your own adventure"" story, with up to four characters engaging in stat-building activities over the course of six turns.  After the sixth turn, the calamity known as the Yawhg strikes the town, and the characters take on roles in the rebuilding, choosing roles that rely on their strengths.  The game takes about fifteen minutes, making it ideal as a quick party game.Each turn allows your character to spend time engaged in a stat-building activity that grants first a static bonus (for example, practicing alchemy always adds +2 to your character's Magic and +1 to your character's Mind), and then gives a random encounter to which you choose how your character reacts.  The results of this choice may be surprising, and choices you make can come back to effect things for you... or other characters... in future random encounters.  As well as an overall ending for the city -- based on how suited each character was to the roles they filled -- each character has an individual ending story that is affected by numerous factors, including where they spent time and what their choices were.  This gives the game a lot of replay value.			"

												The Yawhg is a game of stories, stories that the player travels through randomly, forever hoping that they will survive the eponymous disaster.I shall not beat around the bush here. The gameplay in The Yawhg is incredibly minimal, with the only real player input being what actions the characters take during the six week ingame cycle. The game instead focuses heavily on the story and world interactions your choices create.The in depth details in The Yawhg are astounding with many in-game events big and small, hidden in obscure event pathways, based entirely on the skills you have bult up for your characters.But because of skill and day limitations it may become extremely tiresome for many players to try and see some of the Yawhgs more inner secrets, as they may accidentally trigger a event to occur earlier than they wished, or even a different event than what is wished for to occur.The main thing to keep in mind though when purchasing this game is this: Do you have any friends who live near you?If yes then The Yawhg is a great game to play as its couch co-op focus can make for a fun and eventful time. If not and you also have no means of streaming events to friends and playing that way, you will find yourself playing a game for four on your ownsome, and as fun as the game can be, playing it by yourself can be a very tiresome experience.Basically buy this game if you like fun storytelling and have friends.

												The Yawhg is one of the best games I played in 2014. It's a rather simple game, on it's face- you have between two and four characters. They have stats. You take them places to do stuff. Stuff raises or lowers their stats. There are eight locations to visit, and two things to do at each location. There are also scripted(but randomly chosen) events that may or may not happen at each place. For example, if you play Mr. Moss and go to the Arena and fight, you may encounter an ex-girlfriend who is dating one of the new fighters. If you handle the situation well, you get a boost in mind and charm. Every event is written impressively well (with a few minor typos here and there) and illustrated really well.It's very easy to want to just dive in, play all four characters, and experience everything in a single run. I've done that twice nown and each time I feel like I missed out something. I recommend if you truly want to experience this game, play two characters at a time and really take your time with it. Contemplate your decisions, from both stat-centric and a roleplay-centric points of view. In general, I highly recommend it. It's rare to me that a game shines in every aspect- concept, design, execution. 9.5/10. would buy again.			"

It's an amazing experience you can relive hundreds of times, and it will always be different, sometimes in small ways and sometimes in huge ways. I used to think that I knew all of this game, then suddenly, I end up meeting new characters that can destroy the entire town. I love The Yawhg, and I always will. The reason this isn't extremely cheap (In my opinion) is because as it's a smaller title, not run by giant gaming companies, it will help the makers create more amazing games with this funding.I love The Yawhg, and would recommend it to everyone.

												I have played a fair bit of The Yawhg and I for one love it though i can see why some people would dislike it. The Yawhg is basically a game were up to 4 people (locally)pick a character and go to a location where you choose an action you would like to do for example pickpocketing. When you do the action some of your stats will increase. As well as you doing the action and getting stats for that you will also have a random encounter for example finding some lost townsfolk. These random encounters can decrease or increase your stats. After you choosing six locations in turns (one for every week) the Yawhg will come. After the Yawhg comes and the town is destroyed you have to choose a role such as builder how well you perform these roles will be affected by your stats. After everyone in the game has picked there role and told how well they did at it you will be told if you saved the town and shouldnt have any more issues with the Yawhg(good ending),survived(neutral ending) or if the town stays in ruin's(bad ending). Surprisingly in my opinion the more unique cool ending's(for your character) come if you get the bad ending for the town.All in all The Yawhg is a fun game to play with friends. It has a unique art style and its replay value is very big because of the countless endings and random encounters. I think it is well worth its price especially if it is in a sale.			"

												I know some people say it costs a lot for what it is, but I have got so much enjoyment from this game. It's an amazing experience you can relive hundreds of times, and it will always be different, sometimes in small ways and sometimes in huge ways. I used to think that I knew all of this game, then suddenly, I end up meeting new characters that can destroy the entire town. I love The Yawhg, and I always will. The reason this isn't extremely cheap (In my opinion) is because as it's a smaller title, not run by giant gaming companies, it will help the makers create more amazing games with this funding.I love The Yawhg, and would recommend it to everyone.

												first of all, this is an excellent game to play with friends! me and my flatmates play it pretty often, and it's always a fun one to play with new people! i have also played it with my 16 year old sister, and 51 year old father, and they both enjoyed it, so it is a great family game, and a nice little diversion for the evenings.the art is charming, the soundtrack is very pretty, and the writing can be quite funny at times! i also love the variety in characters, they're all super cute. i think most of the writing is gender-neutral as well, which is a nice touch.that said, events can become a bit repetitive (although we've played it a fair amount and are still uncovering new events every so often), and the price is maybe a tad high, so it's a good one to get on sale! these are the only real negatives i can think of, though.in all, a charming, fairly quick, funny little game with beautiful art and a lovely soundtrack.

												A short, simple, and sweet game.  It's so refreshing to have a game that you can play through each round of in such a short time.  The random events, artwork, writing, almost everything brought such a smile to my face.  The key to this game is understanding its replayability factor.  It isn't meant to be blazed through and finished once; it's meant to be played again and again, especially with a group friends.			"

												Quick Summary: a quick mainly text game that is best played locally with 2-4 players. I reccomend it to anyone if the price range is maybe $4-6 or if it ever adds more content.So the Yawhg is a fantasy/fairy tale game where 2-4 players play as one of 4 color themed characters. In each round of the game every player takes a turn before control passes to the next player. In each player's turn there is a particular order or structure to the turn. First the player picks a place to go and picks from one of two pre-set actions for that location. For example the player can go to the ""alchemy tower"" and ""brew potion"" or ""clean lab"".  (They are limited by only being able to choose where no one else has gone yet on that turn.) The game then rewards you a stat bonus for your action (usually +2 to one stat and +1 to another) and then generates a particular scenario based on that selection. You are given a choice during that scenario and the game will tell you how your choice went. The outcome of this choice is frequently dependent on your stats. For example, brewing potions give you +2 magic and +1 mind. After that the game says that the other wizards are thowing a cantrip party (cantrips are low-level easily-cast spells). After hearing what some other people do you can decide to do a ""simple trick"" or ""complex trick"". If you don't have high enough of a magic stat and choose ""complex trick"", you end up hurting and embarrassing yourself in the process which then causes a -2 in charm. However successfully completing the complex trick may have given you rank among your peers in the form of +2 charm. Additionally, these scenarios are interlinked and frequently someone may do something in thier turn that causes another scenario to occur in another players turn. This is seen in the demon baby excerpts from the gameplay demo above. After several round of this ""the yawhg"" arrives. Without going into too much detail, your stats and one final choice determine the outcome of the town in this trying time. The town's fate is delegated to one of 3 options, the best of which is easily obtainable. Then the game gives each player a personal ending which is dependent on the town's ending, the player's stats, thier last choice, how they spent their time, and what scenarios happened to them. For example if you get the good town ending and spent a lot of time doctoring there are at least two specific doctor endings. But if you also happened to encounter a supernatural creature at some point, then you may get an ending where you try to wrap up loose end involving that encounter.In the end, the number of outcomes and scenarios are limited and if you enjoyed the game you are left wishing there was more content to the game. (I particularly want an update or DLC). However, even after 7.5 hours on record playing this game, a new event occurred last time and a new ending. And we have yet to explore any of the towns subpar endings. This is a great game to buy on sale and then whip out to play with family or friends. It has easy intuitive menu and allows for any combination of controllers or keyboards. Players can assign both of thier characters to the same device and then pass the controller between them.			"

But playing with new people every now and then will still be fun. With character stats, it somewhat reminds me of D&D but in a very very simplistic wayPros:- Beautiful artwork and soothing music- Story is both amusing and moving at times- No single game is similar, many many potential outcomes- Tons of fun with friends- Takes only ~30 mins to complete a gameCons:- Limited set of occurences, after 3-4 games with 4 players you'll start seeing repeated eventsDefinitely buying DLCs if the creator ever makes one			"

												Just watch a quick-look or lets play of this game to see what it's about. The game offers little gameplay that does not really play much into how the narrative plays out. Once you finish the game once, it offers you with little payoff or feedback about your performance and you're kind of really left asking yourself what just happened.Ultimately, this is kind of touted as a multiplayer adventure game in a short-format but I think it falls flat on all of those fronts. It's an interesting concept that would be better if the mechanics were more in-tuned with what you were doing and the end-sequence could be a little more interactive rather than just an explanation of what happened.Despite all this, I dig the art-style and the music .

Pros:+ The stylized artwork in this game is stunning and a terrific choice for a game which draws on the elements of old-fashioned storytelling in the vein of European folklore.+ The concept of a randomised, co-op choose your own adventure game was an excellent one.Meh:= I wasn't sure where to put this since it's a highly YMMV sort of thing; games last about 5 minutes. For me, this was far too short, but I can see this appealing to other players.= The writing is imaginative and competent, although each plot thread is so short it's ultimately forgettable.= This game has great potential that would probably only be realised through a modding community.Cons:- Repetitive. Hugely repetitive. This became apparent by my second playthrough and only got worse. Since this is the appeal of the game (it is marketed as 'a one-to-four player choose-your-own-adventure game that randomizes a unique story every time you play' I was disappointed by how repetitive it was, especially given how short each game is).- Some of the story elements are not suitable for younger players but I haven't seen any indication of this on the store front (horror elements, specifically).- While the game is advertised as 'story rich' and with a 'fully fleshed out world' I found it extremely simplistic and shallow in those regards.

												The Yawhg is an interesting, if short, choose-your-own-adventure style game. It isn't difficult, but a lot of the game feels arbitrary and over-simple. It is definitely best as a multiplayer experience where four friends decide the fate of the (beautifully illustrated) characters. The soundtrack, while small, is breathtaking, and the illustrations are wonderful. If only it felt me like I had control of the outcome, and if only it went on for more than six turns a game, I would be the game's biggest fan, but it is short, sweet and more than a little random. I still recommend it, provided you can get it on sale so you don't pay ten whole bucks for such a short experience.			"

												This game has absolutely gorgeous art, and very charming writing. My first playthroughs, I was a bit frustrated about why I kept getting bad endings. But I've learned to be tactical with my choices, and I loved seeing the different ways that events will unfold.When it comes to the price-value ratio, I'm slightly biased becaused I'm a huge fan of Emily Carroll's work. That means I was kindly inclined towards this game to start with. But, let's look at it this way -- where I live, movie tickets cost $12, for an hour and a half, to two hours plus of entertainment. I paid $10 for this game, and got an hour and half of multiple playthroughs, where I explored a fascinating fantasy world. I'm okay with that, and I'm sure I'll come back to this game later, just to experience that world again.			"

Rather than a party game where you have mindless fun and game, this is a game where you and your friends take on a role and roleplay together. As such, it is a really good roleplay game, where all of the actions have direct or/and indirect consequences and changes the outcome of the game. With every playthrough, every decision and consequences differs, and so every playthrough is unique in it's own way. The art-style is nice, the music (albeit repetitive) suits the mood, the gameplay is simple and engaging, and when played with friends, i have no doubt that it'll be a fun party game, possibly even better when drunk.As a single player game however, it completely lacks any kind of weight. This is the reason why i cannot recommend this to anyone who does not have a friend to play couch co-op with, because that is the only way this game is meant to be played. 0.2 hours is all that it takes for me to finish one playthrough, and that's with me reading every single text. It's really short, really shallow as well, and does not leave a lasting impression. Like i mentioned before, this game is meant to be played with other people, who will contribute their own depths to the story. Playing it alone however, means that there's nothing much to do, except absentmindedly pick choices and read the consequences, alone.I want to love this game, because this kind of game with choices, branching story, consequences that impacts the story, and character building, but there's not enough for me to love about this gameTL;DR if you have someone to go couch co-op with, i would recommend buying it. If you don't have, don't buy this.			"

												The Yawhg is a choice-based adventure where you must select a character and await the arrival of the deadly Yawhg.I played a little over 80 minutes, and thoroughly enjoyed the game. First, let's discuss it's strengths.The Yawhg is beautiful. The artwork is all fantastic and fits the theme of the game perfectly. The music and soundtrack of the game is haunting and wonderful. The gameplay is interesting and, at first, exciting. The story is enjoyable and satisfying. And now, the negative sides of the game. It's short. Not such a bad thing, but when coupled with the retail price, the sense of worth is a little low. I got 80 minutes of gameplay out of the game, which I did enjoy, though the price is a little high for my taste.  Next up, again, the gameplay. After one or two playthroughs of the game, the mechanics are no longer exciting as you can kind of see what's happening quite easily, meaning completion of the game can be easily ""gamed"" (if you know what I mean). The game also lacks achievements. Woah woah wait, that's not a bad thing right? Actually, I think in this case, it is. Achievements mean nothing, it's true, but I think, had The Yawhg had achievements, it would have added a heck of a lot more replayability as the achievements could direct your play, asking you to complete sub-stories, professions, and multiple side ideas which, after completion, many will not revisit.Either way, a really charming and lovely game. I enjoyed it thoroughly.Nilesy			"

												Provided about 15 minutes of entertainment, more as a curiosity than anything else.  Visual novels are really not my thing, and this game was essentially just picking from a bunch of menus for 10 minutes to see what random stuff happened.  I was glad it ended so quickly, else I might have wondered if the content was just an intro to a much better game.Some people have mentioned that it might be good as a party game, and I hadn't really considered that, but either way it's not worth the £6.99 it's currently available for.

												20 minutes, are about how long one would need to finish a playthrough of The Yawhg.It's not going to rock your world-view or revolutionize RPG genre. But it's the most calming game I have played in a long long time: you are given 6 rounds of free will, in the forms of overworld map and discrete choices, and all you get in returns are artworks and narrations. This is interactive equivalent of a good bedtime novel.No button smashing, puzzle solving or timer countdown. Just you and your simple decisions. For some it's not worth the 9.99 USD, for me, it distills the very core of my interests: game narrative and mechanics.Even if you are unsure about it's short playthrough (and possible repetitiveness), try to get it on sales, and enjoy what The Yawhg has to offer.

												Very fun and interesting concept. I played this with my SO and we had a great time, although the game is rather short (it took us about 15-30 minutes for each play-through). However, the length does add a little to the replay value, since more time went into the different branching paths. That being said, it's easy to start up and get into and each session is different than the last. The game does have controller support and the option to play with up to four people locally.I reccommend buying the game on sale to play with a friend.			"

Replayability is there but probably not more than 10 playhtroughs, which you can probably do in about 3 hours.  Despite having played it several times and knowing what each choice does you still can't be totally sure how your choices will affect other people's choices and how theirs will affect you. Would have been nice if it had Dualshock controller support and D-Pad functionality. Visuals are nice and the soundtrack is great.  Super fun game.			"

												This game...I really find myself enjoying these short non-traditional games that are more like interactive books, more and more. This one is in the vein of choose your own adventure, ah my childhood, and does a great job at mixing up your choices and making the consequences matter. It hard to say too much about the game is its so short, spoiling how it plays out seems unfair.   You basically can play 1 to 4 people, though you can play any of that amount also by yourself.  You have 8 days to choose what to do. There's 8 to 10 locations in the town and each has 1 of 2 activities.  These don't change but the outcome are highly random and you will have to make choices during each daily action that has a stat effect then and one on the overall outcome of the game.  Its brillant, and the music is hauntingly beautiful with it as some of the heart wrenching, funny outcomes.  The fact that i played though it twice in 30 minutes shouldn't disuade you from playing it.  I had a 75% off coupon which is why i bought it today but i think i could still recommend it whole heartedly at much closer to its actually asking price.  The fact that you can replay it many times over and might be a cool ""game"" to play with non-gamer friends or family is kinda a vaulable thing.Like all good games with choices it has sweet epilogues for each characters as well.

												A short, sweet game, reminiscent of a 'Choose Your Own Adventure Book' and the game 'Dangerous High School Girls In Trouble'. It's interesting how the choices of one character can show up in the story of another. Unfortunately, I suspect the replay value will be exhausted over time; on the other hand, it's ten bucks, and solid value for an indie/casual game. I hope my purchase will encourage the developers to write another title.			"

												Everyone grab a drink and gather around the couch; it's time to play The Yawhg.In the vast sea of choose-your-own-adventure games out there, why are so few multiplayer? Why do so many forego gorgeous illustrations and lovingly hand-lettered title cards for plain black-on-white text? Why do so few have the brief playtime that makes for a perfect party game? Why do none of them have you cast the deciding vote in an election for a rat president?The Yawhg succeeds on all of these fronts. It's also solidly, but not perfectly replayable (as you'll run into many events again on repeat plays). I only wish that there were more cooperative CYOAs like it. Developers, take note.			"

												This game is great! It is an extremely well made, short game that is fun to play with 3 of your friends or family members. It only takes about 15 minutes to get through a game but with the different variations there are in the game, you could sit there and play it for hours. Overall, I would give it an 8/10 only because it can only be played with other people that are with you, there is no internet group play.			"

By the end of my each playthrough, I felt connected to the characters I've ""created"" and didn't want their stories to end.

												This is such a fantastic game! Don't you dare be put off by the low price or the people saying it's too short. This is a game that one can simply stop playing.It has a fun, comedy board game style that will make you nostalgic and feel happy. The music is beautiful, and to top all that off there's the one unique point of this game that is done so well:It's not about getting to the end, it's about enjoying what you have whilst you still have it. That, my friends, is a fantastic message about life. You're playing a fable! You simply don't lose the game. Now, people will play it for different reasons. At first, you play it to make sure there's a good ending. Overtime, you get this idea that actually it's not about that. You make moral choices, you choose your fate. What your character becomes is a reflection of how you play it, and trust me, there's some really great twists and turns to the game.My favourite part is that what one player does directly influences what happens to the other, thus making it a team game. Play with your friends, play with yourself, it's fun both ways for different reasons. Top game of the season, game of the year so far for me. So, what are you waiting for? Buy it!			"

Play with one or all four characters and find a way to survive the Yahwg!I really enjoyed this game. So, so much. It's a mix of light, cheerful art; joyful and dark story progression and survival. Beat the Yahwg by building up your characters into people able to take on anything! But beware, while the game is simplistic and seems bright, it's definitely not for kids. ^.^ "

It provides a huge variety of random events so that each playthrough is a fresh new experience. Each game is pretty short with only 6 turns to the arrival of the titular Yawhg after which your choices will reflect the outcome in the aftermath of the Yawhg's destruction. You may play up to four characters at a time, with friends or alone. My only disappointment in this is that the 'multiplayer' option is only local not online.			"

												This game is incredibly story-driven, yet the relative lack of gameplay doesn't take away from the experience. The player still has to think through difficult decisions, sometimes without a right answer to choose from, and the story varies every time it's played. You could make bad decisions early on that affect the whole playthrough, you could ignore your stats and end up with a useless character, or the game could just hate you and force you to fail. Any one of those can give you leeches.Everyone hates the leeches, yet it can be the funniest occurence in the game.I'm not going to spoil anything in this (Says he after warning of leeches), but you can fail, succeed or survive, all of which are based on decisions you make during the initial six weeks and after the Yawhg. You can control the outcome, but sometimes you have to take a chance, do something different, and see what happens.WARNING: This game will either draw you in or make you hate it. I cannot, nor can anyone else, guarantee that you will enjoy it. It's one of those games. Consider yourself warned.I have been anticipating Steam release since this game was launched last year. I very nearly bought it when it was made known that it probably wouldn't make it, but I waited and it arrived. Meanwhile, I have watched hours of gameplay. Yeah, it probably ruined a few of the surprises for me, but I don't mind. I still haven't seen close to all of the endings.---Basically: Get the game, but make sure to watch gameplay videos first. You may regret buying it without doing so first. It's just that kind of game.			"

												A very good party game that's great for developing emergent stories - like the tale of a humble woodcutter who became known for punching fists until they broke, gave to charity, and fought crime, the story of a simple man who kept getting♥♥♥♥♥♥on by life and ended up giving much of his wealth to help his city before living out an entirely ordinary life, or the gadabout socialite who made a million friends and got absolutely nowhere at the end of her life, becoming a drunk instead of contributing to society.It does NOT really work as a single player game, however.  You really need at least one other player for the game to truly take off, and it works best with a full set.  The joy comes out of everyone's choices and motivations and goals bouncing off everyone else's and providing contrast - puppetmastering everyone for some kind of optimal result just isn't that interesting.  Shame it's local multiplayer only, then, but given how complex netcode can be, it's understandable.In short, get this game if you can drag at least one friend in to play with you in real life.  Otherwise, it's much more hit-or-miss.			"

												The Yawhg is a very interesting game, and I think the experience of it far outweighs the gameplay itself. It's simple to play, so I'd strongly recommend playing in the full group of four and simply going from there. It's short and sweet, something you definitely have to experience at least once.			"

												Huge replay value, also a great game if you don't have a lot of time. Each playthrough can be very fast. Control up to four townspeople before and after a massive, mysterious disaster. Events interlock and have causes and effects throughout the town which you may (or may not) discover, depending on where your characters spend their time from day to day.			"

												The Yawhg is a fantastic choose-your-own-adventure game in which you controll two-to-four characters in their final weeks before the ""Yawhg"" arrives.  Each time you play, the story which unfolds is randomized allowing a vast array of different events and outcomes to happen.  It is an anjoyable game on your own, but even more so with others, each controling their own character.  The setting is a unique fantasy world whith many unsettling and amazing wonders.  The ""Yawhg"" is inevitable, but will you be able to save the town from the aftermath of it's destruction?			"

												This game is about multiple playthroughs of short games. It reminds me of FTL in that manner, but much more stripped down.Despite its replayability, it still could be considered a very short lived experience.It requires a couple of things I'd hope to see in a patch.First, Online Co-Op, though I'm sure they are aware of that.Second, being a Visual Novel at heart, it could really use a 'skip seen text' button, like most include.Third, Achievements. In-game challenges and rewards would be ideal, something like FTL has, but even just some steam achievements would really make this game. Usually they're just slapped on and add nothing, but this game could really use something to drive you to see more content. It's really easy to just play a few games, and then lose all the initiative to keep going. A few Goals so that you're not just meandering around town would be really nice.Right now I'm trying to destroy as many places in a single game as I can.Even just % content seen counter would add a lot.So, to truly recommend it needs just a slight patch. Being a little cheaper wouldn't go amiss either.			"

												I did have fun playing this game. The way the events can affect each other is amusing. However, it doesn't take long to see everything available. There's about 2 hours of gameplay here and it's probably best experienced in multiplayer. This makes the 8 dollar price tag a little questionable, I certainly wouldn't pay any more than that. It was an interesting experience but I don't know as I would tell my friends to buy it.			"

By the end of my each playthrough, I felt connected to the characters I've ""created"" and didn't want their stories to end.  The developers did one of the best jobs in creating a meaning full story / experience out of something so humble. And one last thing, the music in this game is absolutely wonderful.			"

												This is such a fantastic game! Don't you dare be put off by the low price or the people saying it's too short. This is a game that one can simply stop playing.It has a fun, comedy board game style that will make you nostalgic and feel happy. The music is beautiful, and to top all that off there's the one unique point of this game that is done so well:It's not about getting to the end, it's about enjoying what you have whilst you still have it. That, my friends, is a fantastic message about life. You're playing a fable! You simply don't lose the game. Now, people will play it for different reasons. At first, you play it to make sure there's a good ending. Overtime, you get this idea that actually it's not about that. You make moral choices, you choose your fate. What your character becomes is a reflection of how you play it, and trust me, there's some really great twists and turns to the game.My favourite part is that what one player does directly influences what happens to the other, thus making it a team game. Play with your friends, play with yourself, it's fun both ways for different reasons. Top game of the season, game of the year so far for me. So, what are you waiting for? Buy it!			"

Play with one or all four characters and find a way to survive the Yahwg!I really enjoyed this game. So, so much. It's a mix of light, cheerful art; joyful and dark story progression and survival.

For ten bucks, it's not worth the cash, but if you manage to get it on sale for less than five dollars, then you should go ahead and buy it.			"

It is very simple in gameplay and style, but it leaves me wanting to play more and succesfully finish the game. Here's how the game works. The Yawhg is a storm that comes in 6 weeks from the start. You are given choices on where to spend a week of time before the Yawhg comes. The characters don't know that it is coming, but you do. In order to survive or rebuild you need to train the characters according to the needs of the town after the Yawhg. It definitely has replayabitiy.			"

												This game in and of itself is fun. Sure, some things get a little repetitive since there's only so many dialogue options once things get rolling, but the game itself is fine. What I was not aware of, however, was that this game is in a fixed resolution and sound quality. What does that mean?? You can't change the resolution and you can't lower or raise the sound. And this is actually a big deal. One of the main draws of the game is using locations around the town to better your stats and wealth before the Yawhg comes. Sounds pretty easy, just have to make some tough decisions. Which is fine. It's good. Except that depending on your monitor, you can't see your base or upgraded stats. And that causes kinks when you actually progress past Week 6, and things get a little more interesting.While over all the lack of different resolutions is mostly cosmetic, it is something to consider and think about before purchasing this game. And if I had known that there weren't any resolution options before I bought it, I wouldn't have spent my money on it.			"

												Pros-Cute Graphics.-The concept is good (execution is poor)-Interesting but really random outcomes.Cons-The game literally is a few minutes long. NO WAY IT IS WORTH $10. I got it on sale for $4.99 and I admittedly feel I got the short end of this deal.-Went for an artsy soundtrack but really it is just annoying.-Don't really see any replay value since the game is like 10 mins long (if you drag it out) and none of the choices really matter it is pretty random. I felt no investment in the story or what happened at all.------------------It could be so so much more but honestly you answer like 6 questions it doesn't really matter how and the game is pretty much done. Then it tells you what the end outcome is (Your character becomes the best potion brewer in the world but never figures out how to brew a love potion). Would be nice if it was longer and actually made you invest in what happens and if there was any strategy or some point to the game, as it is it is like 6 random choices and you don't even care what happens, at least I didn't care.I love indie games and the concept of this one could have really been fun and amazing instead it feels like it is completely unfinished and has basically no point and little to no replay value.No idea how this got so many good reviews. I feel bad leaving a negative review because I am sure the producers are good people and I can see how the concept would work if it was fleshed out but I was just really, really disappointed.Lot of better games out there for $10 or $5 bucks, try those instead.Also steam made me play this game like 5 times in a row to register that I had played for 5 mins and could leave a review.

												While rich in story and offering many different stories to be told for up to 4 players, Yawhg still seems to fall short of the game that it could have potentially been. The game is essentially for 1-4 players, each taking their turn of where to go during the week, what to do at said location, and how you respond to a random event. This process lasts for several weeks, around 6 or 8 I believe, before the ""Yawhg"" comes. After the Yawhg comes, the game sums up your ending randomly. While fun, witty, and comedic, the ""adventure"" that players go through is drastically short and is merely based on week to week events rather than the accumulative story. For $9.99 I would say the game is extremely short (lasting around 5-15 minutes depending on how fast you can read) and I would recommend it as a nice steam summer sale pick up. Other positive notes include pretty artwork, interesting scenarios, and a short-lived entertaining adventure game. I would give it a 5 out of 10.			"

												This is not a game.This is a very, very, very shallow choose your own adventure book. With some pictures.While I have no qualms with ""playing"" visual novels, or other game mediums where interactivity is minimal, those experiences at least make up with a very large amount of narration, music or other aesthetic devices. The Yawhg is not like those things. The Yawhg is closest to a board game, not a visual novel, but as a board game it offers no real interactivity. Your choices are reduced to spending time in a small amount of locations, for a small amount of turns. What you do can only affect others through accidental results, so there's no strategy involved. Your choices only affect a small slide of endings, which are a very small range from totally failing to fix a town, to... fixing a town completely.After your second or third playthrough, you'll realize there's no game to speak of. You tally small amounts of arbitrary points and once you know which location benefits which points, you've figured out all there is to the game. Whether you repair the town or not depends entirely on the whims of individual players, as players can't affect the choices of others in any planned way. At the end, all those arbitrary stat points are ""added"" in an effective or ineffective way, and if the points cross a certain threshold, you get a specific ending.And... that's it. Even tic-tac-toe or checkers offers more interactivity.This is not a multiplayer game. The basic aspect of strategic reasoning is that the choices of others affect yours. This does not happen here, at least not on account of a player's agency. There is no reason to return to The Yawhg once you figure out how it works. And I believe even small children can figure that out in less than an hour.Avoid this ""game"". It's not even worth playing it for free. It's a completely shallow experience. It's only grace is that it serves as a great example of something that -looks- like a game, but is not. In that, it's a great lesson in game design: what -not- to do.			"

												What fascinates me about this game is that each event that happens to one of your characters has no/little inherent significance - the power of each event and the narrative as a whole is whatever the player reads into the sequence.I've had a doctor character lose faith in herself after a failure lead to the deaths of multiple townsfolk, only to regain her confidence out of necessity when the town needs her. I've had a rich socialite who cares for nobody but himself spiral into a depression after seeing the horrors that the Yawhg results in. None of these narratives are explicit - I am able to give them their own stories based upon these modular events that the game is constructed from. A strangely large amount of fun, and fascinating at that.			"

												The game itself is fun, if you've got some time to waste with a couple of friends. The major letdown though is that the developers haven't put in an options menu. There's no way to change the resolution settings of the game and from what I've seen on the forums, I'm not the only one having trouble with those settings.It would have been fun to play this more often, but since the devs haven't done anything to fix these problems, I wouldn't give them your money.

												Ignore the scores; this game is a treasure. It's short, but only in the way it needs to be. It's got just enough light drama to put you in a certain mood. It's offbeat, it's witty, and it's more than a little dark. And, best of all, you'll almost always find something new each time you play, as the plots in each game are cleverly interconnected.Get it, it's cheap. Enjoy it a dozen times, and you've got what you paid for. And still, you'll keep coming back to it when you have a few minutes to spare.			"

												With only 6 weeks (turns) per character to prepare for the Yawhg, the game seems a little short unless you're playing with 4 characters.  That aside, it's really fun to play with others, see what they pick, and see how differently everyone responds to twists of fate and how differently their lives turn out.  Great party game.			"

												The most effective aspect of The Yawhg is how hard it is to not become attached to the characters in the game. The stories you unravel for them are very well-written and gives you a strong sense of ownership and relation to how they deal with the events that occur. The Yawhg really does separate itself from others as a, while short, superbly structured and presented piece.While I can't say whether the full price is worth it; I do very much recommend playing this with a group of friends to share the stories you create with them. It is truly a heart-warming experience.			"

												The term ""Visual Novel"" is usually an annoying term to read in a review. But, The Yawhg is without a doubt a visual storytelling experience that anyone who enjoys 'choose your own adventure' novels or games will love. The gameplay is minimal, you choose two to four characters (best suited for multiplayer, maybe) and choose where they will spend their single week of six. In these six weeks, the Yawhg, a mythical beast who never shows it's face to the player, will attack the town and destroy everything you've become familiar with. Because the actual weeks pass by in maybe 15 minutes, multiple playthoughs are a must. And hard to resist. You can choose to spread out your experience, attacking everything to do, or you can grind out your magic, charm, mind, and so forth at one location six weeks in a row. However, the multiple endings find a way to beat your system faster than you learned to cheat theirs. Spending time bartending for charm, you end up an alcoholic, dead from your own love. Grinding out magic at the alchemist tower leaves you alone, without love, and left to create potions to satisfy your only happiness. This is where the Yawhg becomes a ""beautiful"" experience. Albeit depressing, the levels of endings you can receive give you a feeling that you did what needed to be done. There is no need for guides, builds, playing a game the way you don't usually play just so you can have a completionist ending or a successful character stat build. This is a game that is relentless in experience that you learn on your own, and that you can only experience if you treat it like a real week by week lifestyle. This is your story to create, and it's a doozy.			"

												The yawhg as a game is very much like a board game. Every day you gather stats by visiting many locations of the city, with an immense amount of different things that can happen.  After 6 weeks you choose what you want to do with those skills you`ve garnered, and depending on them, you decide the towns fate.The main meat of the game however are the immense amount of different endings. You might have angered someone you shouldn`t have during the 6 weeks. You might have decided to do something you really shouldn`t have at the end. Maybe you turn into a monster yourself! ...Or maybe you live mostly an ordinary life. The game in itself is best when played as a group. The game allows up to 4 players to go live in the town. The games biggest downfall is the fact, that it doesn`t support online multiplayer, but that is easily fixed with a call with skype as one person reads the choices out loud and does the choices for the other players like a game master.Overall, if you want a fun experience, which most likely gives you an unique ending everytime if you aren`t afraid to try something new, and you like reading, buy the game.

												I have mixed reviews on this game. On one hand I like the art style, the concept and even the short game play, but I also have gone through this twice and I have seen a couple of the same results.  The game play is about 10 minutes tops. The store page says that everytime you play you get a different story (and even though that can never be true, I didn't believe that I would already see repeat pages *that* soon.)  I will give it a thumbs up but only slightly.  a 3.5 out of a 5. If there was a sideways thumb I would use it.  It has potential, but I wish it was more than it is.			"

												Probably one of the more interesting gaming experiences I've had in a while - playthroughs are quite short (anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour, depending on how many of you are playing and how much you discuss the going-ons), but this isn't a game you play once and then forget about, you keep returning to see what other ridiculous scenarios your people encounter.Had several moments of incredible highs and deep lows while playing with flatmates, even encountering a strangely sinister ending for one character while everyone else spent their days making shoes and whatnot.Anyway, if you want a nice experience to have with a few friends occasionally, you can't go far wrong with this - just don't expect to be learning any complex button combos or anything!

Even if you get the same event and make the same choice, the outcome can vary based on your stats, making the game very replayable. A word of warning: This is a basically like a book with multiple choices, not the type of game where you can run around and fight monsters and explore the world. I can see why some people wouldn't consider it a game, but I have found it to be extremely enjoyable.  Great to play with friends, you can make choices to make your character a stong survivor who can help your town or you can get drunk and rob people.			"

												As far as setting a mood through music, storytelling, pacing, the logic of choices and consequences, and the juxtaposition of looming disaster to the characters' blythely going about their lives, the game is simultaneously funny, poignant and a little chilling. In short, this game hits all the right notes in attempting what it aims to do. It's short enough that you can get through the whole thing in one sitting and immediately want to do it all over again to try different scenarios; it's also just long enough that it feels as though what you decide has some impact on the world and you can even see some far-reaching, unexpected consequences down the line. It's deceptively complex, and brilliant in its simplicity.			"

												This game is great for a group of friends who love playing games together.The Yawhg is not your average multiplayer game, however. It is sort of a multiplayer choose-your-own-adventure game. Each person chooses a character and then chooses where they want to spend one of their 6 weeks before the Yawhg arrives. The beuty lies in the amount of variation you can get therein. Will you stay at the bar and get drunk all week? Will you go to the palace and dance the nights away? Will you don a mask and fight crime in the back alleys for the slums? All these options are available to you.After choosing what you will be doing that week, a small story is told to you for that week, maybe while fighting crime you meet someone who turns you into a vampire! Maybe during your work at the hospital hundreds of leeches break free! While they are limited, the story elements of each location are different from each other and highly entertaining. During the story part, your stats will change (Physique, Mind, Magic, Finesse, etc). These will be important after the Yawhg arrives.The most interesting thing about the story elements is that they have a chance of crossing over to other areas. If the aformentioned leeches break free from the hospital, they may spill over into the slums! Or maybe even the lake! The dryad you met in the woods may show up in the arena! The combinations are truely interesting and make the game even more fun to explore.After the Yawhg arrives, you are tasked to rebuild by taking on one of many important (or not so important) roles around the town. Will you band the remaning townsfolk together and lead? Will you try to use your might to build? Will you use your magical aptitued to brew potions? Beware, though, because if you do not have the proper stats (gained from the story parts of the game) you will fail in your attempt to help, and you will hinder the rebuilding.After everyone has chosen a role they are given their last story segment and you are told if the town will press on after the Yawhg or if it will ultimately fall to ruin.I would like to see more stories added or mod support so that the community could add their own stories.The game is overall fun for a group of friends, and trying to get the best ending can be challanging and a true team effort. I would highly reccomend this game with 2 or 3 friends that are will to experiment in gameplay and work together.			"

												For those who enjoy board games, the Yawhg feels familiar. Averything happen in turns and random events, shaping your character's evolution and leading to their sucess or failure at the conclusion.Things to keep in mind if you want to buy this game:1- It's really short. Really, really short. Takes about 7 turns to finish one gameplay.Then you get the conclusion and can start again. Since events are random, you'll probably find new things when playing for the second (and third, fourth, etc) time, but things start to repeat soon.2- It's best if played with friends. Not online, but at your side, using the same computer. You can have up to four players and I could only have real fun with The Yawhg after I invited others to play with me. Like I said before, very similar to a board game.With that in mind, chances are you won't be surprised and will end up having fun. The visuals and songs are really well done too. It's not worth a lot of money and I think would be best as a Ipad game, but it's a nice idea. Not for everyone, though. Makes me wish they would release an expansion, with more events, locations, etc. As it is now, I fear is way too short and might get repetitive too soon. Still, I had fun, and that's what counts.

												I wish the game had more substance but the art and writing keep it from blending into other games like this. First off, no online co op mode, which is weird to want but this would have been perfect for my friends and I to play over skype. The game gives you four characters to choose from, all very unique and different. You have six weeks before this ""Yawhg"" decends onto the world. Each turn you get to choose where your character decides to spend their week. Once you make a choice you then choose between two paths and two paths again, you get text for what your character does within these branching paths but this is the formula it sticks with. You gain (or lose) stats depending on your decisions. Once the six weeks are up the Yawhg appears and you have some choices after it does appear. At this point your characters stats and your own choice determine whether the characters and towns fate is positive or negative. For the price I can't complain, I really need to try some of the other paths. It's definitely unique and something you won't get all too often.			"

												The Yawhg is a great piece of short interactive fiction in a cyoa format with stats progression. If you can get other people to play the game beside you or share your screen with them over the internet, then it's a very cool multiplayer experience. It's a bit like sharing a really good D&D session with your friends.The randomly generated stories are typically funny or creepy in tone. When you first start playing, it'll make you a bit uneasy. Hilariously bad stuff will happen to your characters and the city.If you would like to experience a haunting urban fairy tale that you can come back to a bunch of times, then get The Yawhg.(I bought this from their website at launch. I've played it a bunch of times, but only once on Steam)			"

												This game is great for a group of friends who love playing games together.The Yawhg is not your average multiplayer game, however. It is sort of a multiplayer choose-your-own-adventure game. Each person chooses a character and then chooses where they want to spend one of their 6 weeks before the Yawhg arrives. The beuty lies in the amount of variation you can get therein. Will you stay at the bar and get drunk all week? Will you go to the palace and dance the nights away? Will you don a mask and fight crime in the back alleys for the slums? All these options are available to you.After choosing what you will be doing that week, a small story is told to you for that week, maybe while fighting crime you meet someone who turns you into a vampire! Maybe during your work at the hospital hundreds of leeches break free! While they are limited, the story elements of each location are different from each other and highly entertaining. During the story part, your stats will change (Physique, Mind, Magic, Finesse, etc). These will be important after the Yawhg arrives.The most interesting thing about the story elements is that they have a chance of crossing over to other areas. If the aformentioned leeches break free from the hospital, they may spill over into the slums! Or maybe even the lake! The dryad you met in the woods may show up in the arena! The combinations are truely interesting and make the game even more fun to explore.After the Yawhg arrives, you are tasked to rebuild by taking on one of many important (or not so important) roles around the town. Will you band the remaning townsfolk together and lead? Will you try to use your might to build? Will you use your magical aptitued to brew potions? Beware, though, because if you do not have the proper stats (gained from the story parts of the game) you will fail in your attempt to help, and you will hinder the rebuilding.After everyone has chosen a role they are given their last story segment and you are told if the town will press on after the Yawhg or if it will ultimately fall to ruin.I would like to see more stories added or mod support so that the community could add their own stories.The game is overall fun for a group of friends, and trying to get the best ending can be challanging and a true team effort. I would highly reccomend this game with 2 or 3 friends that are will to experiment in gameplay and work together.			"

												This game has some flaws but is also just brilliant.First off the lack of settings (like turning down volume or monitor settings) and several typos (for example switching ""he"" and ""she"" on occasion) are slight annoyances.It is also quite easy to figure out a ""winning"" strategy which gets you the ""flourishing"" ending almost every time. This would make the game very boring, if that were actually relevant, which it isn't.This is where the game's brilliant aspects come in. The random events through the game provide witty, at times completely unexpected (and being genuinely surprised is something I very rarely experience in games) and simply hilarious moments. You will find yourself just playing through the game (which takes less than 30 minutes in single player) time and time again trying to discover new random events, possible outcomes and resulting consequences. And then there is the ending. All your choices tying together to decide the fate of the village, followed by (perhaps more importantly) the conclusion of each character's own story based on the chosen tasks and random events, once more providing several outcomes to be discovered.In this regard this game, with it's ""choose your own adventure"" feeling despite the preset timeline, is exactly what alot of the bigger RPG titles are lacking realized on a smaller stage.Expecially the multiplayer (which is limited to hot seat, but quite frankly a online multiplayer wouldn't make sense anyway) adds even more excitement and laughter to the game. If you have the option it is very rewarding.All this combined with a lovely animation and very soothing soundtrack in my opinion make this game most definetely worth the time and money.			"

												This game is all about the execution, which is lovely. Mechanically, you are just making choices and some dice are getting rolled behind the scenes. But the the little story twists are delightful, the buildup to the disaster, and the aftermath, strikes a pitch-perfect balance between sadness and humor, and the art is appealing. Great to play through with friends, and it works just fine alone, as well.			"

												A beautiful example of interactive storytelling.  The gameplay is minimal and each playthrough lasts only about 15 minutes, but each one is a wonderful experience.  Somehow the results and epilogues manage humor or heartbreak in just a few sentences.  It may be more art than game, but still it's a worthwhile experience.  Content can be somewhat limited though, and I hope they add new scenarios over time.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys narrative games.  It also can be hilarious as a group activity.			"

												""This game is too short."" ""This game doesn't run on my PC."" ""This game breaks when I alt-tab."" ""This game crashes sometimes for no reason."" ""This game doesn't work with my monitor and cuts off the edges hurting playability."" ""Local co-op only is terrible for PC.""How could I recommend a game where all of the above can be true depending on your system and beliefs?I even encounter some of these problems and I still play A LOT of this game.Because...the game is very very good. Seriously. Yes it only takes 10-20 minutes to run through the game, but the game is setup to be played many times. It is amazing the amount of depth they have managed to achieve with such simple design. This game is an art piece. When it works, it works very well. It is beautiful visually with excellent art choices for the still images. The soundtrack is fantastic with the same song managing to convey both happiness in the good endings and sadness in the bad endings and even horror in a rare combination of events. The mechanics are simple, intuitive, and very effective.The crashes are frustrating, but I'd say they only happen 7% of the time. At least in my case. My family has recieved more enjoyment out of this $10 purchase then they would in a far more expensive movie purchase. I'd say if you are willing to risk the possibility of the problems I listed at the start don't hesitate; pick this up immediately. The developer is active as well and many of the issues may be resolved soon if they are not already.			"

												After two play throughs I can say I do enjoy this game for times when I don't want to get sucked into hours of gaming.It is short if you play by yourself, which is fine for me, but I've been told if you play with others it can take longer and may be more interesting. (If they added online co-op it would be smart, but considering the games simplistic nature I don't expect it.)The folksy music creates a haunting and gorgeous background and really set things up for me. So far I have gotten very different options for characters and none had the same outcome. One was grisly, another depressing, one triumphant, and the final exceedingly ordinary.I would recommend this for people who like casual games or ever enjoyed reading books that let you pick your path.I'm sure the replay ability will wear off after playing it more, but for now it's just a lovely small game.

												This game is really fun and produces hours of fun with your friends or on your own, getting a different story ending every time you play. This is thanks to ""The Yawhg""'s multiple choice ""choose your story"" gameplay. Another great thing about this game is how each action you complete has an effect on a friend you are playing with. [SPOILER AHEAD!!!] For example, if you fail to stop the leaches escaping the hospital, they will infest the pond in the gardens and potentially harm another player. The Yawhg also contains a ""stats system"" which gives it a more ""Strategy/RPG"" feel while you're playing. [SPOILER AHEAD!!!] These stats are important for the end of the game when you choose your new role in the community of your destroyed town.All in all, i have no negative comments on this game and think it is absoloutely brilliant for such a simple and small game made by so few people. Well worth the £6.99 i paid!!!			"

												Where to start?I bought this game months ago, I hadn't heard anything about it but after taking a look at the description at the store I figured I'd give it a try. It's a short game, a regular playthrough might take you about 15 minutes or less, but it has one of the highest replay values I've ever seen in a game. It's one of those games where your decisions matter but it's more like a ""Choose your own adventure"" book turned into a game. Depending on what you do you will get different endings, but getting a good ending for your town doesn't necesarily mean that the characters you use will get a good ending and viceversa. But even when your characters get a good ending there might be something bittersweet about it.The art style is beautiful and the soundtrack is great. The main theme is one of the most haunting songs I've heard in ages. I totally recommend it.			"

												After two play throughs I can say I do enjoy this game for times when I don't want to get sucked into hours of gaming.It is short if you play by yourself, which is fine for me, but I've been told if you play with others it can take longer and may be more interesting. (If they added online co-op it would be smart, but considering the games simplistic nature I don't expect it.)The folksy music creates a haunting and gorgeous background and really set things up for me. So far I have gotten very different options for characters and none had the same outcome. One was grisly, another depressing, one triumphant, and the final exceedingly ordinary.I would recommend this for people who like casual games or ever enjoyed reading books that let you pick your path.I'm sure the replay ability will wear off after playing it more, but for now it's just a lovely small game.

												This game is simple, sweet and to the point. Of course after one play through you can figure out how it works. But, that doesn't take away from the pleasing imagery, music, and ever-changing story.The title song (Oceans) is beautiful and worth the listen. This game is worth every cent.			"

												Short, but sweet.  It's definitely meant to be played with 3 other friends, locally... so quit being antisocial and have some fun!  The art, story, and music are all quite nice.  What else could you want from a text adventure?  It has enough replayability and multiplayer goodness to be worth the full price, but I imagine a lot of people will play this by themselves and be upset by the length.  For those people, wait for it to be on sale!			"

												The Yawhg is essentially an illustrated choose-your-own-adventure, set in a slightly fantastical medieval town where a mysterious threat (the eponymous Yawhg) is fast approaching. It's very atmospheric -- well illustrated and well written, with a moody acoustic soundtrack. Although each game/story is quite short, a lot of content is randomized, so it lends itself to multiple playthroughs.			"

												The greatest strength lies in the simplicity of this game. It is perfect for playing with your family, guests, or anyone who doesn't usually play games. Anyone can get into it immediately as there is very little to explain and the game basically writes a story for you, based on your choices.For the casual gamer, this game can be a refreshing break from routine.In it's current state the game may be a bit overpriced though for what it has to offer, as it is rather short and limited.One thing this game could improve upon is modding support. As of currently it's not quite there yet, but this game has a lot of potential for mods adding new bits of story.			"

												A pretty good concept for a game, but ever after several playthroughs I still felt a little dissapointed.

I would recommend if you're a fan of games similar to dear esther or gone home, though the game is wildly different than those. 6/10, if there was a couple of hours worth of content instead of less than an hour, it would be an easy 8/10 though			"

The controls were simple, but the story lines were good (some were unexpected).  I love the fact that you could make certain places inaccessible based on your actions. All in all, it's a good casual game and one can play it multiple times to find out all the endings without it being too repetitive.			"

I've only tried it once on my own, but would love to try it with more people. Also, the soundtrack and art is distinctive and beautiful.

												If I had to sum the general feeling of The Yawhg up in one word, it would probably have to be “poignant”. On the surface it's a clever, succinct and skilfully woven series of actions, reactions and consequences. The art style is whimsical enough to temper the sometimes brooding prose and the music treads the line between contemplative and melancholic. It's funny and twisted and thoughtful, often all at the same time. For so brief a game, it really pulls you in. Upon nearing the finish you grow acutely aware of the weight of your actions, and the impact your decisions have had on the characters you’ve encountered. The desire to change the outcomes of your latest play-through will compel you to keep coming back. It’s a beautifully made and artfully executed “what if?” trap. For those still looking for the perfect outcome, something tells me there’s no such thing in The Yawhg. But then again, I guess that’s kind of the point?			"

I wouldn't be so upset over it, except that no fix appears to be available, the only news I could find on the forums was a promise from the dev to look into it nearly a year ago when several other players complained. I wish I hadn't wasted the $10. I wouldn't bother unless you feel like taking a risk.			"

												This is a stunning game. I'm a great fan of miss Carroll's work and rushed to buy this as soon as it was out. Not only the art is gorgeous, but the writing and music are fantastic! Sure, it feels a bit short, but even that makes me reward The Yawhg with some longing. The story left my heart aching, yearning to know more about these characters who aren't named - but feel fully fledged in Carroll's art. It's amazing how the varying drawings give them a sense of self despite the way you might choose how to play them. Still, I understand how it serves the purpose of the storytelling here not to give a deep insight into their lives ""prior"" the Yawhg... Which doesn't make me stop wanting to read more stories into this world. It's fascinating how this short game made me feel so many things - I'd kill for Emily Carroll to draw or write more about this, even in form of comics!For those who complain about the price, yes, it's a short game, but it's a short game that manages to pack much more meaning in 10 minutes of gameplay than some do in 42h+			"

The game definitely has good replay value and considering that it has 4 characters to choose from (which can all be played at the same time either by you or your friends (not online though) the game has many possible endings, but even if this game only had one ending, in my opinion the experience of the game itself is well worth it :)			"

												For those who love an interesting narrative and playing games with friends, the Yawhg offers a unique experience that I have found to be very memborable. While the game can be played alone controlling multiple characters, it is best with friends. There  are some very creative stories within this, that I definitely do not want to spoil. A wonderful soundtrack and gorgeous art complement the 'choose your own adventure' gameplay.The biggest question for you will be is it worth the price? I have played the game four times now (roughly 30 minutes per playthrough) and have seen some repeated stories (but not always the same outcome!) but have enjoyed every time. The Steam release makes me want to play it again. For such a memborable experience, I say it's definitely worth the price. If you are unsure, how about check out the start of a playthrough (I have one linked below) but don't watch too much, as the best part of this game is experiencing it for yourself!My friends and I filmed a whole playthrough of the Yawhg, the first episode is available here:

Basically it's a smart visual novel game for parties.Two to four characters make choices, lead lives, and prepare as a strange threat - the Yawhg - approaches.  Doing things raises character stats and affects other elements of the game.  A magical experiment, a won gladiatorial event, an undifused bomb, all affect other characters.  When the disaster does happen, characters then choose their path after, which affects the end of the game.Gameplay is pretty short - the game is meant to be replayed.  Graphics are decent, and the storybook look really works.  Music is great.So the question on buying it is ""do you want an experimental multiplayer story game.""  If you do, this is for you.  Otherwise, its not for you - but I consider it a good game.			"

												Very cool game, but not as story rich as I would have hoped.  After a few play throughs I could accurately plan and prepare for a good fight (yes I would often lose because of random number generators) but in the end it is more like a game and rpg than it is a story and ground breaking.  Still fun, still cool, still recommend it! its just not as ground breaking as I was lead to believe.  "

Unfortunately it all seems quite random and feels like your choices make no difference, that kind of kills a game for me. The ending is abrupt, you go through what feels like a prolongued character creation process and then it just ends. I'm not seeing any point in playing through it again.			"

But on the other hand this was just plain boring. I clicked myself through the text within 10 minutes and it was finished. I mean the game does not even have Steam achievements. I bought the game in a Humble Bundle for like nothing. But this game costs 10 EUR on Steam. Sorry, this is too much.

												A 10 minute game. No volume control (It starts off LOUD). Can't quit from the main menu, have to go to character select for ESC to do anything. Quitting causes the game to crash. And did I mention it's super boring? Get a couple stat points that don't seem to do anything, then just see if you get a good ending. There is no story. You never see that yawhg, or even interact with it. It goes from ""The yawhg is coming"" straight into ""The yawhg left"" without any input from you. You would get more for $10 by buying some TF2 hat. This is the single biggest waste of money on my account.			"

												Spent 4 hours drinking with my friends and playing this game. One of my friends wen't ""Foightin Round the Woirld"" and punched Jean square in the♥♥♥♥♥♥for stealing his old lady.My other friend spent every single playthrough being as drunk and whorish as possible in the tavern and seemed to always turn into a vampire and destroy whatever location he was in without fail.The other seemed to become some sort of a God-king at the end of the game or being surrounded by riches or learned how to summon demons in every game. Overall it was a great time. Half the time was spent choosing the worst possible options only to find us flourishing after the Yawhg. The game can be very unpredictable. Sometimes you try to play it smart and end up drinking yourself to death in the end. Either way awesome game. Definitely worth the $8 spent. Great party game or for a drunken game night with your friends. Highly reccommend if you or your friends have vampiristic, drunken, whorish tendencies and don't mind stepping on a few heads to climb your way to the top.			"

Sure, it has mildy clever intereplay between your choices but it is ultimately too repetitive and unoriginal with every playthrough. This should have been a free flashgame.

												Nice art direction and sound, fairly well written, but even for a pick your own adventure game it is incredibly short and shallow. Just over 10 minutes to playthrough, I managed to get the good ending easily on my second try. Gameplay is very simple, character can go to a location which will raise two attributes with a choice of raising them slightly less and gaining wealth with an event happening either raising or lowering attributes depending or your choice. Compared to a game like ""Long Live The Queen"" choices are quite simple, seemingly not measured against attributes and with very little consequence. It's a cute little game, but sadly far too short and simple. Slightly changed it would probably make a good game for young children.			"

												The Yawgh is a fun ""Choose-Your-Own-Adventure""-type game in which you can control 2-4 characters in a town for 6 weeks as well as build up different character stats which also affect the story.What I Did Like: The story was well-written and entertaining, including all the different story options. It's nice they didn't always make it terribly obvious what was going to happen or what stats you would need in order to have a 'successful' result when making a choice. I liked the art and loved the music.What I Didn't Like: Each play-through is pretty quick, even using all 4 characters - about 10-15 minutes. After 45 minutes of playing, I felt I had seen 80% of the ""event triggers"" if that makes sense, and was ready to play something else for the time being.Overall: I found the game to be really enjoyable as well as relaxing. I experienced maybe half of what the game has to offer, story-wise, and for me this definitely has replay value. Not a bad deal for $10 if you know you like ""C-Y-O-A"" and an even better deal if you can get it on sale.			"

												The Yawhg is not a game you pick up to complete your indie collection or to sit fashionably next to your visual novels. Nor is it one you play for a story. It is a game you play with a bunch of other people whom you may or may not like.  This game is a perfect party game or group joke. The randomly generated events are funny but reppetative and what really makes them work is how you and all of your friends react to the fact that steve has poisoned the water supply for the seventh time and jill stubbornly insists on doing nothing but fighting crime. This game is nothing by myself but with all and my friends together............we were still defeated.9/10 whatever you do stay out ofthe slums			"

The art is good and the storylines are compelling, although the ""epilogue"" is somewhat capricious. If you want to support female/POC playable characters, this is a good game, although the character(s) you pick at the outset do not influence anyof the outcomes.

												I orignally saw Kim from the Yogscast play this game, and although I got the ending about ""What the Yawhg actually is"" ruined for me, I have played this already for a solid hour.Seeing as I already know what happens, I decided to get some friends in a skype call and get them to come on an adventure. Screensharing was not an option at that moment in time, as some of them were using their phones, but that did not take away from the fun and... odd enjoyment that we recieved whilst playing it.This game has fantastic music, which I fell in love with, and an art style which is hard not to instantly adore. Yes, this is a story based game with still images of what happens.. but this is NOT a bad thing.For seven pounds, I am finding so much content in this small gem of a game. If you have seven pounds lying around, then get this game. Do not hesitate in the slightest.If (or when) you decide to buy this game, do not forget that Emily Carrol has not written infinite possibilities of what could happen during a playthrough. Often, you'll come across an instance that you rememeber from your first playthrough, or your fifth, or tenth. However, this does not take away from the charm that this game has to offer.After two play throughs with a group of friends, they unleashed killer rats, deadly leeches and poisoned the towns water supply, all having effects throughout the week.A game like this should be enjoyed thoroughly, but in small doses. If you are fine with repeating occurances, then good on you, play this to your hearts content and find enjoyment in remebering the good and bad that WILL happen to you.However, if you are like myself, then it will be best to play this game once or twice every few weeks.I will never regret buying this game, even if I can memorise every occurance in every location.. SImply because of the feelings of satisfaction this game gave me.9.5/10 - Could be longer, but a definite worthwhile investment for anyone who wants something.. uniquely different and genuinely beautiful.

												I liked the gameplay, but be warned--this game is super short. Like, you could finish a single playthrough in less than 10 minutes.That was my main issue with the game. Blink, and it's over. If it was more like other stats-based strategy games I've played, such as Long Live the Queen and Magical Diary, and covered more time, I think I would have liked it better.I would say that it's a enjoyable game, but I wouldn't suggest getting it at the price it's at right now. Thankfully, my copy was part of a Humble Bundle, so I feel that my money wasn't wasted.			"

The game creates running jokes and themes (such as those leeches).  Fun alone or with a friend or two. A great addition to any library.			"

The music is great and the I really enjoy the art style. It doesn't take too long to finish a session of gameplay, which makes it an enjoyable ""party game"" without it having to drag on for too long.There are also very suttle references within the game itself that make it all the more amusing. I definately recommend giving this a try with friends.			"

												A quirky and quaint little game.  The story lines are funny and rather strange, but that makes them interesting.  They can also be unexpectedly dark.  The art is very bright and colourful, and the music, though only two songs, is pleasant.  Most people complain about it being too short (each round is about 10 minutes), although I think it's meant to be that way so you can play multiple rounds quickly, seeing as it can be difficult to save the town when you're still new to the game.  I wish there was more variation, though; once you've played about 10 rounds, you've basically seen everything, and saving the town becomes quite easy.  There are some typos in the game (I think I spotted about two or three), which is a little disappointing given that it's primarily text-based.  Also, I can't seem to run the game in windowed mode, although I know not everyone has this problem.  You can't skip the credits at the end, although they only last about 15 seconds, so I don't think that's a big deal.			"

												Some games are great for single player experiences, while others shine as a multiplayer experience. I've found that The Yawhg shines best at the latter. Don't get me wrong, I throughly enjoyed my single player time with the game and it can be played with just one person. I feel that The Yawhg really shines brightest when played with a group of people. Hearing your friends react to events in game is an absolute delight (unless said friends are jerks but you might wanna avoid such people). I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a quick party game, or to anyone who enjoys the choose your own adventure games/books. It can be played with both a keyboard/mouse or a xbox 360 controller (not sure about other style game pads). I would recommend playing it with a controller if possible.			"

The game itself is very short, but it's replay value is very high (sort of like a board game.) Each choice you make within the game has randomized events so it won't play the same way twice.

												After the 11 or so hours of playtime here, I guess I should review.So generally, The Yawhg seems to be a simplified (and short) version of DnD which impliments a more story-driven atmosphere. You have only so much time to enjoy the city before it is destroyed by the great Yawhg, then you must either fix or destroy what is around you in the survival effort. This is honestly one of the best games to play with your friends while streaming or otherwise sharing your screen on here. Due to the simplicity of it, there isn't any multiplayer for it (which isn't a bad thing) and forces you to either have more of a social environment in playing, or enjoy your time alone. The game feels and plays much better if you try to wrap yourself in the situation around you, however too many playthroughs in succession will become repetetive. There are many different things to do, however, and you WILL enjoy your time playing this.TL;DR: I r8 8/8 m8			"

												A story telling game where 2-4 players runs around this fair town trying to earn states before a 'spoiler alert' flood. It is fun and enjoyable for sometime until you seen every outcome (which takes like a couple of games) and then it looses it's charm.  On the other hand it will not loose its charm when 3 other players whom never played it before is there with you, then all you can do then is laugh at them.The game is simple and fun but yet it will smack you in the back for a missclick which can change the events in a major way so becaful sticky keyboard users.All in all this game if a nice walk in the park with good controls (up and down keys) and takes litte to no thought to play.....unless you never played it and your friends haven't either then your town is screwed.

												I finished my first game in 10 minutes, so if this very short playing time doesn't interest you, maybe don't get this game. Every ""week"" is only one action, and you play as a minimum of two characters, each taking turns doing an action for a week. So, all in all, there's about 12 actions you make per game (with an amount of extra things that can happen during those actions based on your stats), and because of this, each playthrough isn't very long. It can be easy to sink an hour or so into this game (as you can probably see, I certainly have), but by the second or so playthrough it gets pretty easy to manipulate the game.I really like The Yawhg, but I need to make it known that liking the game is all based on each player's wants and needs in a good game.The Yawhg has really nice art, a unique soundtrack, interesting scenarios, great writing, and it's just all around a clever little indie game (unless you're oblivious like me and don't get it the first time around. Or the second. Or an hour later of playing).But it can be very short, and the four characters really don't offer anything in the way of personality- just well done, diverse physical design. The player wholly decides what the characters are like.I would say buy this game on sale. Because there's no variety in character attributes unless the variety is made (by the player), and the game gets easy to quickly work through (not to mention some scenarios will be repeated pretty quickly), for some people it might lose its charm rapidly. But for some people, playing through all of the choices and getting to know all of the game's mechanisms and fleshing out attributes for a character might be worth many, many hours of playing.However, a little note on the endings (and this is based on my perception and will not apply to everone): just remember that the endings can be a bit general, as the characters are not special unless you make them be. But despite being general and based on your desicions, the endings are very humbling, human, and profound for what they are.			"

												8/10If you enjoy text based adventure games (like Tales of the Arabian Nights) this is the perfect game for you! This game is very interesting, with a dark taste from time to time and a chilling atmoshpere, making it great for playing with friends, or even on your own if you are looking to kill 20 minutes. If I had any complaints, it'd be that after playing this game enough you will eventually get to know every event and ending like the back of your hand. But apparently I read that the creators are working on an update with more events so that could fix that problem. Overall I would certainly recommend this game, espicially if it's on sale.			"

												The Yawhg is not a game you pick up to complete your indie collection or to sit fashionably next to your visual novels. Nor is it one you play for a story. It is a game you play with a bunch of other people whom you may or may not like.  This game is a perfect party game or group joke. The randomly generated events are funny but reppetative and what really makes them work is how you and all of your friends react to the fact that steve has poisoned the water supply for the seventh time and jill stubbornly insists on doing nothing but fighting crime. This game is nothing by myself but with all and my friends together............we were still defeated.9/10 whatever you do stay out ofthe slums			"

It doesn't take too long to finish a session of gameplay, which makes it an enjoyable ""party game"" without it having to drag on for too long.There are also very suttle references within the game itself that make it all the more amusing.

Even my BF liked it, and he usually hates wierd games like this. Now I just need to figure out how to play it as a drinking game...Some replayability, but expect a lot of scenarios to be repeated. Cons: Like I said, it's short. Really, really short. The only real strategy involved is to pick a skill and base your decisions on improving that skill. Then pick a profession based on that skill. Game won. And by ""won"" I mean your character doesn't end up a junkie dying alone in an alley.			"

												A quirky and quaint little game.  The story lines are funny and rather strange, but that makes them interesting.  They can also be unexpectedly dark.  The art is very bright and colourful, and the music, though only two songs, is pleasant.  Most people complain about it being too short (each round is about 10 minutes), although I think it's meant to be that way so you can play multiple rounds quickly, seeing as it can be difficult to save the town when you're still new to the game.  I wish there was more variation, though; once you've played about 10 rounds, you've basically seen everything, and saving the town becomes quite easy.  There are some typos in the game (I think I spotted about two or three), which is a little disappointing given that it's primarily text-based.  Also, I can't seem to run the game in windowed mode, although I know not everyone has this problem.  You can't skip the credits at the end, although they only last about 15 seconds, so I don't think that's a big deal.			"

												I first played The Yawhg at a special game event a few years before it came out at TIFF Nexus, and even though the music wasn't finished yet and the story wasn't completed, I knew it was something special.This is a great casual game you can hook any friend on, or simply play alone. It's a very rich choose-your-own adventure and despite the number of times I've played it, I've yet to see the same story twice. Don't get me wrong, this game is SHORT. If you play 4 characters you can finish in about 10-15 minutes, but then you play again and again. The music is bewitching, the design is lovely and the story is your own. The only thing I wish about this game was that it was longer or had more options, only because I want to be immersed longer.   "

The art is good and the storylines are compelling, although the ""epilogue"" is somewhat capricious. If you want to support female/POC playable characters, this is a good game, although the character(s) you pick at the outset do not influence anyof the outcomes. It's nice in some ways, since you can actually have non-hetero interactions within the game. Wait for it on sale. "

												The Yawgh is a fun ""Choose-Your-Own-Adventure""-type game in which you can control 2-4 characters in a town for 6 weeks as well as build up different character stats which also affect the story.What I Did Like: The story was well-written and entertaining, including all the different story options. It's nice they didn't always make it terribly obvious what was going to happen or what stats you would need in order to have a 'successful' result when making a choice. I liked the art and loved the music.What I Didn't Like: Each play-through is pretty quick, even using all 4 characters - about 10-15 minutes. After 45 minutes of playing, I felt I had seen 80% of the ""event triggers"" if that makes sense, and was ready to play something else for the time being.Overall: I found the game to be really enjoyable as well as relaxing. I experienced maybe half of what the game has to offer, story-wise, and for me this definitely has replay value. Not a bad deal for $10 if you know you like ""C-Y-O-A"" and an even better deal if you can get it on sale.			"

												First of all, never play this alone, you can but the only true enjoyment comes from the mystery and playing with some friends. You bing it, and you basically do almost everything in an hour or two. Then you leave it, and forget. Eventually, with new friends, after you've forgotten what happens, you pull it out again and play it, and hey, maybe you get surprised by some new combination of stats and events and something really cool happens. Moments like that have occured to me. I am not sure if I've gotten 10 dollars out of this game, but I do know I have enjoyed it thoroughly. This is not a binge game, this is a game you pull out every once and a while with some friends an enjoy and have a laugh. In that respect, it is worth getting. Though probably on sale.			"

Thirdly, the game will get repetitive fast if you play it too much, especially with the same people. Mix it up, keep it interesting, change your tactics- this includes moral viewpoints- and most of all introduce newcomers to it constantly. Trust me.And now you know everyting you need to know about one of the best party games ever. Have fun.			"

												Great game for up to four players. Very accessible, very low bar of entry, very replayable, low time commitment. Perfect game to whip out with a few friends over and nothing to do. Music and art are great, plenty of style here.			"

												It is a great game if you play it for what it is. Basically, sometimes when you have a few friends over, use it like a party game for a round or two. It's beautiful, fun, and interesting.It's not great if you try to play it singleplayer, play through it over and over in a row (because you'll get repeats), or expect a traditional RPG.			"

												First of all, I just want to start by saying I love this game! For ten dollars, it's definitly worth the price, that said after you kind of find all the little secrets hidden in the game, it does start to get old, but that said, you will still have a blast trying to find all these secrets. I would definitly recommend, especially if it's on sale.			"

												I liked it a lot. It was a lot of fun both failing and succeeding. I played with 2 people in a sort of, offline co-op, which definitely made it more enjoyable.I really enjoyed the art style, the writing, and the music. The setting was extremely interesting, fantastic, believable and dark but not overly grimdark.At the time of this review, the game is still available on humblebundle.com for $7, which is where I picked it up among other things I was going to buy anyway.

												The Yawhg is quite an interesting game; in such a way that it isn't really a game persay. It's an interactive journey. The Yawhg is about the titular event that will happen after 6 weeks, and what it might be is unclear. It's an incredible storyteller, and I got back into it after seeing a kickstarted game named Monster Prom, which is like the cruder little sibling of The Yawhg.Not to say it's bad, but I couldn't help but draw connections.Each week in The Yawhg, each character (up to four characters, controlled by 1-4 people) goes to one location, and raises one of their 6 stats. Then, a random event will happen, and you choose one of two choices, usually requiring certain stats to be successful. This repeats for the 6 weeks, but it's far from dull. The consequent events are impacted by your previous choices, giving a sense of reality and impact to your choices.I won't spoil what happens after The Yawhg, because it's more fun to find out yourself. The game's only $9.99, it's great with friends, and it's bitesized fun at 20-30 minutes per game. Just go buy it, you won't regret it.			"

												A great party filler for when you have a few friends over. It's playable by anybody, has a strong narrative, delightful consequences, and a solid ending all in a short session. While the first time is always the best, it does have some replayability.If the premise tempts you at all, go for it. If you need more specifics, it's a collaborative short story of small choices that build individual character stats and the groups overall stats affect the resolution of the narrative. No reflex based game play, just menu choices for each player. The game shines with how the narratives collaborate and how some choices come back to haunt everyone.Grab four controllers and play up the dramatic sense of impending doom for best effect.			"

												Nice art direction and sound, fairly well written, but even for a pick your own adventure game it is incredibly short and shallow. Just over 10 minutes to playthrough, I managed to get the good ending easily on my second try. Gameplay is very simple, character can go to a location which will raise two attributes with a choice of raising them slightly less and gaining wealth with an event happening either raising or lowering attributes depending or your choice. Compared to a game like ""Long Live The Queen"" choices are quite simple, seemingly not measured against attributes and with very little consequence. It's a cute little game, but sadly far too short and simple. Slightly changed it would probably make a good game for young children.			"

												9/10Very entertaining game. Each play through is relatively short and yes you do get a certain amount of repetition in the endings. However, the writing is amusing and engaging and honestly, so long as you go in looking for a bit of fun you can get hours of playthrough from this. I quite enjoyed that even if you try as hard as you can to get yourself a great ending, something might pop up and ruin everything. Some people might be annoyed that chance plays a factor like this but I think it just adds to the fun. It's great on your own, it's better with friend(s). I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys CYOA and has a sense of humour.			"

I've never played it alone because I feel the point of the game would be missing, but I've had a massively good time just hanging out on my couch with friends and family alike having a wonderful time exploring this world they have created. I have played this game enough to experience every story (or almost every story) but I still play it with people because I love their reaction to playing it for the first few times. It's such a unique experience that you should not pass up. Worth every single penny.			"

												First of all, ignore the time Steam says I have spent playing this game, I don't know if playing in offline mode affected the number or what but I can assure you I have spent between two and three hours playing this game. For me, this was one of those, great but really only great a couple times sort of games. I found myself wishing there was more to it but it was a very enjoyable experience. You will probably find yourself playing about ten times or so (it is not a very long game) with various characters then dropping it, only coming back to play it ten times or so again with a friend or two or three. Recommended if you can get it on sale.			"

												You and your friends know *something* is coming to lay waste to your town in six weeks. You take it in turns to prepare, week by week, honing your skills so that after that *something* happens you will be able to rebuild the life you once had. Or maybe you'll just contract vampirism and die alone. Whatever works for you.I have replayed this game with many different friends and enjoyed their reactions to the unusual scenarios it threw at them, especially when seemingly minor decisions come back to haunt them. It's a very short game but lasts just as long as it needs to. Soundtrack and visual style work perfectly. Only criticism is the lack of online multiplayer.			"

After six turns the Yawhg arrives, the game ends, and you see the outcome of your choices.Lovely writing, beautiful art by Emily Carroll (who's webcomics I highly recommend), cool mechanic, and enough scenarios for plenty of replayability.I see some posters have suggested you need IRL friends to enjoy the game, but I think it will impress friendless players who enjoy storytelling.

The Yawhg is one of those games where you can see great potential for a party setting. When brought into a party setting however, you find plenty of room for laughs all around as each person(or groups of people if you decide to have characters run democratically) encounters the day to day life before encountering the Yawhg. The unpredictable nature of when certain scenarios will occur, and the probability of having correct scores when these great events arise allow for experimentation with each playthrough. The games taking about 20 minutes, this gives the game great versatility in the party setting. I truly recommend this game to anyone who is often looked to as the bringer of party games during grand rendevous, and those who find games that require multiple ways of thinking quite intriguing. So step into the adventure as blue, red, yellow, or green as you prepare for the coming of the Yawhg.			"

												Nonlinear choose your own adventure.Each game takes about five minutes. Choose a character, choose parts of the city to explore and make choices about the scenarios you encounter. After six turns the Yawhg arrives, the game ends, and you see the outcome of your choices.Lovely writing, beautiful art by Emily Carroll (who's webcomics I highly recommend), cool mechanic, and enough scenarios for plenty of replayability.I see some posters have suggested you need IRL friends to enjoy the game, but I think it will impress friendless players who enjoy storytelling.

												Quick Review:This game has a nice feel of a short story being told where you control the characters in it. The story (for me) was very dark and I haven't experienced a positive ending yet. I would suggest getting it if you can find it on sale for under $3.00.How I got the game:I bought a bundle from another site with this game included.Full review:The idea behind this game is that something is coming called the Yawhg. It destroyed the town before and you have 6 weeks to prepare for when it returns. This is a choose your own adventure type story that can be played very quickly. You are shown a map where you choose an area to go to then you are given another choice of what to do while you are in that area. You repeat this process using 2 characters for 6 turns. At the end of those turns the Yawhg appears.What I liked:I enjoyed the images and graphics used in the story telling, it really gave the feeling of reading a story from an old book. There are 4 different characters and you got to play as 2 of them for one game. The options for what you can have the characters do are limited but they gave some interesting outcomes. I also liked the music playing in the background, it kept me interested in the game and added to the feel of a story.What I didn't like:The outcomes from the choices I made were pretty much the same when I had different characters play the same sections. The game is very short. I was able to play it through twice in about 20 minutes. I didn't receive good endings and maybe it prevented me from extending the game play but that is what I experienced. There is a lot of build up for the Yawhg story line but the game doesn't deliver when it comes to the actual action of dealing with it.Final Thoughts:I like the game and would suggest getting it if you could find it under $3.00. For me there wasn't enough to spend $9.99 on. The lack of content deterred me from wanting to play it again and see if things could be different using another character in other areas or making various choices with the same characters. I felt that even if I did try the reward wouldn't be worth the effort.Other Notes:Let me know what you thought of the review I wrote. I will be writing and re-writing reviews on games I have already played and games I have yet to play. I'm interested to hear if what I've written is helpful or if there are things that people would like to see. I'm also interested in corrections if I have made a mistake about the details of gameplay.Thank you for reading.			"

												Interesting and different casual choose-your-own-adventure story with multiplayer. Seems fixed at 1280x720 resolution. Some nice art, and unique folk music soundtrack that sets the mood. This is not a good singleplayer game, nor really a good party game if you are seeking thrills. It is however a good game to play with your girlfriend who is not so good at fast-paced or busy action games, but who still wants to play games with you. Recommended if you need a casual non-competitive game to play with someone. But not really for kids unless you are fine with some of the more gruesome and sad outcomes depicted. Not a lot of bells and whistles though. Very niche type of game, also overpriced for what it is. Get on sale, or part of a bundle, maaaybe worth $5 but really more like $3.			"

												Looked intresting, so i wanted it, But look at that god damn price tag. So i waited until a very loyal friend bought me it.The game gets very repetitive way too quickly, visiting/working at seperate places doesnt seem to effect anything beyond normal gameplay except 2 events, attacked by a werewolf or attacked by a vampire. when these events happen, the day after, no matter what area you are in, you transform into whatever attacked you previously, and you destroy the area you are currently in, making all 4 characters unable to use that area afterwards other than that nothing effects the actual gameplay. you could drink at the tavern all day one day, and still be able to function at other jobs the next. there is no grey area, you either fail after the week ends, or you succeed, and theres only a few ways to succeed, and even fewer ways to fail. For example,  you could hunt animals every day, and then not choose the right job suited for you at the end  of the week, resulting in a failure where your characterdies of starvation due to the ghosts of the animals you hunted warning away any alive animals that you try to catch. its a unique death, but it doesnt result with a special ending or anything. your character dies and thats a failure. it ends the same way as every other death, with you being dead, and no payoff otherwise.you could experiment with several different choices, but in the end, the game falls flat and has no payoff.

												Played a few times with my wife, but ultimately feels like little control over your actions and the randomness is a turn-off.  Had fun though.  Glad I purchased, but would not recommend at full price.			"

												If it is music, art or gameplay, every aspect of this game on itself is worth the ten bucks. Play it multiple times to unfold the full potential tho.			"

												Based on the glorious artwork of Emily Carroll, this game offers a make-your-own adventure type with some interesting variety in gameplay and character choice.  I wish that the disaster the Yawhg brings would vary and that characters had more options in the aftermath, but this game is still definitely worth looking at.			"

												I love this game. The randomness that you get while playing through it is fun, and playing with friends makes the experience even greater! I also like going through with new people to see their choices and reactions. Especially going through and making voices for the characters like the rats is fun!			"
