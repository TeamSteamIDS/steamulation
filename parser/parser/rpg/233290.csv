												I've now finished the game so i've updated my review.This game is a lot of fun, not sure why the professional reviewers hate it so much. Maybe they're expecting it to be a fast-paced action game or something like that which it definitely isn't.It's a detective game with an interesting story and characters that draws you in. It's also pretty novel in that you're playing a criminal-turned-detective's ghost who's trying to find the identity of his killer. You spend the game collecting clues to figure out your killer's identity while stopping along the way to help out other lost souls in little sidequests where you figure out how they died so they can pass on. There are also lots of collectibles, some of which provide background for the story, such as notes left by the main character's wife, or that unlock stories about unsolved crimes connected to hauntings. You end up collecting a lot of clues and you have to figure out which ones will help you solve whatever crime you're working on. They make sense and its fun. I've noticed a few negative reviews saying the clues don't make sense and you end up just clicking on everything till you get it right. I only did this once at the beginning of the game...and all I can say is, try thinking a bit and paying attention before just mashing your mouse. If you do this, you'll pretty quickly get a feel for how the clues work in the game and figure out which ones are useles. You can also posess the living, and while you can't move them, you can help them remember and eavesdrop on their conversations or thoughts. You can, however, posess cats which allow you to reach places you can't reach on your own. Everything about the game makes sense...you can't walk through the outdoor walls of buildings that have been consecrated, the demons you have to sneak past to take down from behind are souls who never passed on, etc. The mood the game sets just enhances the experience, being creepy and immersive.Overall, this game is a lot of fun. Story is great, gameplay is fun, voice acting is well done. Having finished the game now, the story is a pretty good detective story, with everything falling satisfyingly into place at the end and a few neat twists. There are only a few drawbacks: the graphics aren't the best, but they're still decent (especially the lip synching); sometimes when you posess someone and listen to their thoughts you'll hear the same thought in different people; the parts where you have to sneak behind demons and take them out can be a bit tedious. However, all these are definitly worth overlooking.The other drawback is that the game is a bit short. I finished it in 7 hours, and if you check out my achievements you'll see I didn't get 100% completion. I did all the side-quests and found as many collectibles as I could. You could probably stretch it out to 10 hours if you wanted 100% completion which seems totally possible in a single playthrough. Its up to you to decide whether a 7-10 hour game is worth $60 or if you want to wait for a sale.In short, if you like story-driven games, or mystery/adventure games then you'll probably like this game. If you want this game to be a gritty shooter, then go buy Max Payne instead, because you won't get that with this game. Having finished it, I would now give it between a 7 and an 8 out of 10.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is an adventure detective game, which was released in mid-2014 on PC, PS3, PS4, 360 and Xbox One. The game was developed by Airtight Games; which hadn't released anything worthwhile for a while before this game. You play the role of detective Ronan O'Connor, based in a town called Salem in USA. The story is based around hunting down a serial killer by the name of ""The Bell Killer"". Ronan is killed by the serial killer at the beginning of the game and you are revived as a ghost and must find the killer before he can move on to the afterlife. The game is played in a third person view as you wander around the town of Salem, the town is split into a couple of separate areas, such as churches, graveyards petrol stations etc. As you progress through the story, you learn a few different abilities, such as being able to teleport yourself short distances, being able to possess other living beings allowing you to read their minds or being able to influence their decisions in dialog scenes. The main game play element is solving the mystery of the killer; you do this by investigating the crime scenes for clues on the killer, and trying to predict their next move. This takes on a similar way of doing things as games like LA Noire has done; in that you have to find specific items of evidence scattered, and sometimes hidden around the crime scene in order for you to put them all together in order to resolve the scene. This can lead to quite a few moments of where you need to study all the evidence put in front of you in order to solve it giving it a real detective vibe. On top of these detective scenes, there is a small element of combat in the game - as you are a ghost, living humans are not able to detect you; however the demon souls of the death world can. You have to remain hidden to these ghosts in shadows before being able to pounce out behind them to kill them by pressing a few key sequences in a small QTE - these combat scenes are very few and far between however and aren't really anything to rave about as they become very monotonous as you progress in the story. Visually, Murdered: Soul Suspect looks nice. The whole game takes place in the time frame of one evening, so the darkness of night gives the game a very eerie feel to it. It doesn't have ultra-realistic graphics, but all of the characters are well animated. There are a couple of poor quality textures, however given that this is a sort of open world game, this can be forgiven somewhat.  The story in Murdered: Soul Suspect is something really special. From the opening scene, I was completely drawn into the plot and was able to fully immerse myself in this world being unfolded in front of me. As you progress, you come across other characters who aid Ronan in his efforts to solve the mystery and you grow attached to them too. The story is 100% linear though; there are no game changing decisions which you have to make which disappointed me slightly. But the overall plot which is being shown here is really interesting.As this game is being categorized in the horror genre, I would of expected a little more from the sound effects, but I was let down by the fact that there isn't anything really that scary in Murdered: Soul Suspect; the scariest I came across was the demon's you encounter; and even they are tame and the lack of any jump scares or horrifying scenes was a let-down too. Every character you find in the game is fully voice acted to a high quality though. None of the voicing sounds off or cringy which is always a plus. I found that there was next to zero levels of difficulty in Soul Suspect; the lack of any real combat leaves this game without any skill element, and is purely based on your ability to solve the crime scenes by finding the relevant clues - I was able to resolve all of the crime scenes with a 3 star rating 99% of the time (you are scored out of three). The hardest point I found has to be due to the game's controls which I will go into on the technical issues section of this review. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a vast open world game; you are able to go wherever you want, whenever you want (within reason). There is absolutely tons of stuff to explore and investigate not related to the main plot. There are a number of side investigations you can complete in the early chapters, but these slowly become less and less common as you progress and focus more on the main plot. Another huge part of this game is finding the collectables; this has to be the game with the most collectables in I have ever played - there are hundreds to find.  Each level has its own version of collectable items, and there are also the overall games collectables which unveil even more about the main character's past, and information about the killer. Due to the fact that there are so many of these to find; I felt a little overwhelmed by trying to find them all and just sort of with the approach of picking any up which I come across whilst completing the investigations. I finished Murdered: Soul Suspect in just over thirteen hours; this was with doing all of the side investigations, and collecting over a hundred collectables. I also took the time to playout all of the dialog options with all of the characters and spent a lot of time exploring the town of Salem. Sadly though; there is no reason what so ever to play through this game for a second time; you are not able to change the story in anyway nor are you able to ramp up the difficulty simply because there is no difficulty there in the firstI had a couple of technical problems whilst playing. Firstly I was playing on my high end rig, on 1080p settings and even though the majority of the time the frame rate was over 100 fps, it still felt like it was stuttering at times. I had to play with v-sync off because otherwise this locked gameplay to 30fps which looked horrendous. Cut scenes are also played out in 30fps in the game graphics, which makes the transitions between gameplay and cut scenes feel a little off too. The game's controls during the combat scenes also came across as clunky too; I often found myself not actually completing the QTE presented because it's not clear which buttons you have to press and what you can let go of which meant a lot of running and hiding from the demons due to failed attempts at killing them.  Finally the last issue I had was there are quite a few invisible walls to be found to, these often are in places where you would not expect them, leading to moments where you'll find you are suddenly floating in mid-air because you've walked into a wall and are trying to climb up it - this is something which can affect the immersion of the game and it's a shame that it is still in it given it's been out for well over a year now. I am going to recommend Murdered: Soul Suspect; it has an amazing story which you really do need to experience in order to fully appreciate it, and has an original concept. The linear gameplay, lack of any many action scenes, and a couple of technical issues renders me unable to recommend it more than just that, a recommendation to play. The full price of £19, 99 is also slightly over marked too, so you may even want to wait for it to hit the sales before purchasing.

Murdered: Soul Suspect is supernatural detective adventure thriller game where you are playing as detective Ronan. He got murdered by a Bell Killer a primary antagonist and now he need to solve his case as a ghost.Pros:+ Great main character+ Voice acting is really good+ Enjoyable graphics+ Good story and atmoshpere+ Lots of collectibles + As a ghost you can walk through walls, read people's minds etc.Cons:- Short ( main story for around 6 hours )- Combat is poor ( you basically sneak behind the enemy and do fast QTE) - Only one type of enemy- Most of NPC's are just clones/duplicates- Only 4 optional quests ( to finish them you need like 5-10 mins each)			"

An uncommon title, yet it suffers some shortcomings // Recommended for those who seek a story-rich experience**You'd likely prefer it at sale price+ Voice-acting is excellent+ Facial movements and lip synchronization are above average+ Character makes a ghostly 'impression' on walls and objects as they are passed through; this makes it easy to keep track of areas previously visited+ Mechanics in place to facilitate ones investigation are inventive and refreshing+ Ephemeral bits of Salem's past look fantastic, and work with the mortal world to create a uniquely hybrid environment+ Disposing of demons is a somewhat satisfying experience, and is the only time in the game that really requires situational awareness and a tactical approach+ 'Unfinished business' side-quests are interesting and well-scripted+ While Ronan isn't exactly a unique, well-written character (he isn't), he and Joy are, at least, well fleshed-out and see a satisfying level of development throughout the story+ Successfully creates a dark and unsettled atmosphere; gameplay is very immersive- Choices are meaningless, and funnel into a solitary conclusion- Puzzles/Crime scene investigations require almost no thinking, and the solutions are always quite obvious- NPC models are shamefully copy/pasted- Due to linear story and few 'off the beaten path' collectibles and additions, there is little replay value to speak of- While unique and interesting, the historical remnants of the environment serve only to limit exploration in practiceLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												Let me preface this by saying that regardless of my ""No"" recommendation, I do believe this game is worth playing once. The story is OK and the ending twist is OK. But it is simply not worth the asking price of anything over $10 bucks.You play the ghost of a murder victim in the town of modern Salem, MA. The goal is to solve your own murder...as a ghost! In the same town where the witch trials took place in real life! How could this possibly be bad?!? Well, you'd be surprised. On paper, this should make for an awesome adventure game. Too bad the execution is horrendous. It's certainly not an action game and it's one step above a Fisher Price point-and-click adventure game (and I love adventure games). The world is as linear as the story. The entire game boils down to ""walk around and spam E (maybe R, before E occasionally)"" until you hit the cutscene. It's impossible to fail any ""investigation"" (a very strong word to use in this game) until literally the last mission in the game. And even then, you just repeat it until you get it right. Investigations aren’t dynamic, they never change regardless of what you do. You can't ♥♥♥♥ up investigations in any way. But if you pick the wrong item, the developers decided it would be a good idea to make you re-enter the ""which item is it?"" screen over and over until you get it right. No, it couldn’t just stay open, that would make too much sense. The controls in general are bad. You can’t mouse click anything and the camera sensitivity is high no matter which setting you use.The NPCs standing around are useless. If you're like me, and you like to absorb story in your games, you'll learn pretty quickly to not even bother ""possessing"" them because nothing they say is ever relevant or interesting.There are demons in this game. Demons, in a game about souls....whodathunk. Too bad they're the most irritating part of the game. They are obviously in the game as filler and annoying filler at that because they tend to pop up when you have to backtrack (which you do a lot of, btw). It's like the devs knew this game was short so they needed to find a way to stretch it out. You “fight” the same type of demon throughout the entire game and how you deal with them never changes. They have pre-determined patrol paths and you simply wait until they have their backs turned and then you ""execute"" them during a quicktime event.None of the characters are very likeable. The main character is kind of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it’s very easy to forget the name of the others. In a game filled with ghost, you would think there would be some awesome death or haunting stories, but there really isn’t. Maybe one or two are interesting (mostly in a sick way), but the rest are “waaaaaahhhh, I’m dead! Whhhhhhhhyyy” that you quickly get tired of.And it’s all topped off by credits that are unskippable and seem to go on for 3 hours. Shame, this game had some really interesting ideas that I feel would have been better realized by a more capable studio. The sound effects are really good, and the environment with the old Salem blending with modern Salem is nice to look at. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a game filled with souls, but ultimately, it’s really lacking one of its own. "

												From the first article I read about this game I was hooked. Investigating your own murder and other crime scenes as a ghost? Yes please! The idea seemed so original and any screen shots I had seen looked awesome.  So I get the game and the first half hour is awesome. You'll have fun getting used to the controls and your own abilities as a ghost, but it didn't take me long to lose interest in walking through walls and making printers/TV's malfunction because at the end of the day, you rarely stumble across anything interesting or you get little to no reaction from the living people in the area. I mean come on! if I'm a ghost I want to be able to scare the living. Not just distract them from guarding that door for 20 seconds. So let's get down to the things that really got on my nerves.(1) Gameplay - It gets repetitive. Honestly, you'll find yourself running across the city/buildings where  your obstacles will be either one of  two things.        - Oh there's a demon there? better sneak up on them and extract their soul.        Or       - Oh would you look at that, a fiery pit straight to hell is blocking my path. Luckily for me there's  this person here I can possess, who's sole propose seems to be walking down this hall for the rest of their lives.  Oh which leads me to another thing, if you give us the ability to read minds, actually have the characters think interesting stuff that's personal to them, instead of the same thing like, ""Oh its cold outside"" or ""I hope they find that killer"" Seriously, a little variety never killed anyone. (There's a pun in there somewhere.) (2) Skills/abilities - You will pick up skills as the story progresses, skills like teleportation....eh and umm teleportation. So on top of being able to posses people,(and don't be fooled, the most exciting thing you might get them to do is move their hand from blocking that page you want to read.) reveal the events that lead up to peoples deaths and maybe another ability that I have forgotten about, that leaves you with about 5 (give or take) skills. Not much and nothing that's gonna make you sit up and go F*** Yeah!! with excitement, which is disappointing.   (3) NPC's - If we were back in the early 2000's I might forgive this but there is a serious lack of character models for the npc's (there's about four different character's for each sex, who will either have  one of three different voices, all of whom usually say the same dialogue.) (4) Collectables - For example once you've collected the 15 or whatever amount of saws, a memory is unlocked. Now considering some of these can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ to collect, you'd expect maybe a flash back to the event. You know a cutscene, an animation. No, what you get is one image that is some what relateable to the story, with a bunch of  text in front of it (and I mean a bunch) and possibly the most life draining narration I've ever had to injure. (5) Game length - The game is short! I finished it in under 10 hours and this is coming from someone who went out of her way to find as many collectables and whatever other extras there was. (Near the end I gave up, not caring any more and just wanted to finish the game so I stopped putting in any effort.) So for someone who'd only be interested in the story you might be able to get this game finished in 6-7 hours. (6) Connecting crime scene clues. - Honestly I don't know how to describe this. Once you collect all the clues you'll be brought to a window that asks you a question. You have to click on a clue (or three) that answers that question. Being the generation brought up on CSI you're more than likely going to put on your Horatioto glasses and think long and hard about the choices and outcomes. My advice don't. Pick the clue that when you read it you think ""Nah, that's not even a clue. more like a statement/common sense."" Watch a lets play of one of these, you'll see what I'm talking about. (7) Deus Ex desktop screens - Awesome the first computer screen I saw it on but when every police officer in the station seems to be playing Deus Ex on their work computer no wonder you haven't found the killer. Whoa, okay I've complained a lot about this game. I don't want to come off too hard on it. There are some pro's.Pro's Spooky S*** - There are some legitimate scary scenes and dark deaths and twists in this game. Some that will really make you feel for the characters. Villian - I never wanted to punch someone in the face more. Well done on making a completle d*** of a villian. You get to posses a cat. Press A to meow. Okay I ran out of pro's..... but it isn't that bad. To me I feel that the idea behind the story had so much potential but failed to deliver. The end result is that it seems lazy and half ♥♥♥♥♥, which you will feel while playing the game. It's worth a play through but do not buy this at full price. Last word: If Patrick Swayze was a cop in Ghost and Whoopi Goldberg an annoying emo teenager this would basically be the game adaptation.			"

“Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are.” ― Benjamin FranklinMurdered: Soul Suspect is a one shot wonder coming from Airtight Games; the last game they developed before closing their doors in July 2014. It is a wondrous detective story with a supernatural background that takes place in the timeline of one evening in Salem, present time. Salem? Does that ring any ""bells""?Aside my unintentionally cheesy joke, this game is about Ronan O'Connor, an ex-con and street dog turned his way straight and decided to become a detective to atone for all his past misdeeds, with a pretty gal for him to impress in the mix, of course. The events of our game start with the untimely demise of our main character. We watch Ronan as his life passes before his eyes in a stream of memories - recorded on his body as tattoos representing milestones in his life. The Bell Killer, notorious serial killer who was terrorizing Salem for months now, killed Ronan. But surprisingly, this is the beginning for him rather than an end. Now, he is a ghost, stuck in between worlds until he manages to solve his own murder. Ronan's persistence to seek the truth will take him through an old, dark ordeal in Salem history: Salem Witch Trials.As I continue, I have to note that I loved the character of Ronan O'Connor himself. Aside being an ordinary bad boy, he has vulnerabilities, character flaws and a short temper. His death isn't even heroic as most main characters in video games as we see nowadays. He just ventures out, without having anything to loose and without a thought; and bang! He ends up getting hunted and falling to his death. We are able to read an in-depth backstory for Ronan, with Julie's perception from many collectible memory notes within the game, and put together, it portrays the story of a life. I salute developers for presenting Ronan as an original character, different from any darkened vigilante or street thug. As I was playing, I found myself recalling Mickey O'Neil, a gypsy character that Brad Pitt portrayed in Guy Ritchie's Snatch: a reckless and wild rascal, a swindler with a golden heart. He feels much real than any old book knight in shining armor, at least for me.If we are to talk about the atmosphere, well, sure. It is a success. Graphics and textures are impressive, alongside the modelling of each and every character. The game manages to present you the feel of an open world: the ghostly, dark remains of the old Salem clashing with the modern, physical environment, Airtight presents us a ghost's perception. It is uncanny and impressive. Combined with a successful voice acting for all characters present: this game is basically L.A. Noire quality with less action packed and more on the supernatural side.Gameplay? Sure, it's nothing extraordinary. We run about the town - collecting a huge number of collectibles for either background story, or some independent creepy ghost stories, or trivial facts about Salem history if we feel like so, by the way - and try to predict the movements of the killer. We even gain a living side-kick as we progress: Joy, a snarky teenage who will become our involuntary aid in the world of the living. There are three defining elements to the game: item collecting, demon hunting and investigation. None of these parts are incredibly well-put, but the story being absorbing, you keep playing. Investigations are quite basic, with little to no chance of guessing wrong and combat section consists of a basic stealth kill for some demons in each new area. Could have been much more, but I won't complain.Is it worth your time? It surely is, but still I'd recommend grabbing it on sale, so 30 dollars would be a grand exaggeration for what you're getting yourself. The greatest plus of the game for me, was its story. For one time, I really wasn't able to guess the ending, and the precise position of characters involved. I so hope that Ronan's story wouldn't end here. Would it be so much to hope for? Well, we'll see.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Ah, Soul Suspect. The trailer alone had me clapping my hands from excitement. However, there's a lot to say about the game itself. The concept seems unique at first; a murdered cop who is forced to solve his own murder before he can pass on to the other side, where he can be reunited with his dead wife. It's not an angle you see often. That being said, the game feels empty when it comes to gameplay and the semi-original plot can't make up for it. It feels like all your abilities seem to have huge potential and you have fun playing with them for an hour or so, excited about what more you can do along the way. Then you realise that you're limited to distracting people with flashing lights and walking through a wall (but not all walls, only some walls, obviously) every now and again. You also have the ability to possess people, which seems wicked awesome at first. You can possess pretty much anyone you meet and you have the options of mind reading or influencing them. However, the reality of possession is that you possess a person, read their mind and they're like ""Oh man, it's sort of chilly today"" or ""I hate my job"" and you lose interest pretty fast when that's all you hear. In the end, I'm unsure about whether or not to recommend this game. It's visually pleasing, the voice acting is decent and the idea behind it is worth the time. But the final product is just not satisfying in the long run. Murdered: Soul Suspect is another one of those games that you should get if it's 60-75% off, but it's not worth the full price. Overall, it's like a lukewarm bowl of pudding. It's not entirely done and feels a little lacking, but hey, it's still pudding in the end.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is detective-ghost story told through the interactive-medium of gaming. Murdered is kind of like a combination between a TellTale game, LA Noire, and Alan Wake... But honestly the game is more often than not more like an interactive movie, and I think it's with these expectations that you best experience Murdered.Murdered: Soul Suspect tells the tale of a man named Ronan, who at the game's start experiences his own death. He is pushed out of the window by a notorious murderer, who is known as the Bell Killer, who then commences to shoot him seven times in the chest. Ronan grew-up as a criminal in Salem, but changed his ways late in life to become a detective, partially for the woman he loved, Julia. However, he was torn apart a few months earlier, when Julia's life was taken at the hands of a street mugger. At death's door, Ronan discovers he is a spirit to this world, trapped here until he can move on from something that's keeping him bounded here. He finds out that he can be with Julia again in the world beyond our own if he can resolve whatever is keeping him here, so he goes out to try and solve the case of his own murder.Gameplay is rather simplistic in Murdered. You will spend most of your time exploring around, using your ghost powers, and looking for items and clues in the environment. As a ghost, you can freely pass through human-world objects, which essentially makes clipping a gameplay mechanic, but you might be surprised how natural it ends up feeling and due to some good visual cues and sounds it ends up not looking or feeling weird, and makes sense with everything else built up with the game. The only objects you can't pass through are ghost-world objects (relics from the past which are present in the ghost world, and tell-able they're ghost world as they glow with a blue aura), and into or out of buildings freely (ghosts can only enter or exit buildings through open doors or windows). Other powers at your disposal include the ability to possess people, to either read their minds or influence their thoughts, to poltergeist and make objects (mostly machinery) act up, to teleport around by choice, and a few other underutilized but still interesting powers.The game splits-up between 'stages' (bigger interior areas usually), and a Salem hub-world. The stages I thought generally got better as the game went on, and Salem was a joy to explore... At first. The problem is that not much really happens in Salem, it stays the same mostly for the whole game so you can literally almost do everything in it the first time you enter the hub-area (with only a few things you can only do once you gain the teleportation power).As you explore, there's a variety of content to immerse yourself in the world. There's a lot of side areas and areas off the beaten path. You can approach living people to listen in to conversations they're having with each other, made more amusing you can then possess them and see what they're REALLY thinking. You can approach ghosts, and either talk to them briefly, question them about something they're up too, and very occasionally help them via a side-quest to move onto from this world to the next. However, there are literally only about 3-4 side-quest in the game, and there is obvious content and characters that were left around for more side-quests, but were left-out as cut content. Things like items you can observe for no real reason, characters it looks like you would be able to help but then they cut you short from actually helping them.And then there's the collectibles. This game kind of goes overboard with it's collectibles, but they're pretty enjoyable and expand a lot on the plot, the lore, Salem's history, character background's, additional cinematics, and my personal favorite, ghost stories. Extended from this, the investigation scenes usually have you looking for and going about collecting clues, and then putting together the clues that matter to a particular solution or outcome. These typically were rather simple, and sometimes felt more like sort of mindless collecting to get to the point. However, other times they actually felt kind of rewarding. None were really 'puzzles' I would say, but were a mixed bag.The only other real gameplay mechanic is demons, which are rather underutilized. I didn't find them offensive, and I'll admit there was a few times when their screeches or them detecting me legitimately startled and scared me. However, there's only one type of demon in the game, you only face a few of them in the game, and their encounters are often brief and they're easy enough to deal with (you sneak up behind them to execute them, otherwise they spot you and chase you down, where you hide in things until they lose interest).But then this is a game I'd argue isn't really about winning or losing, it's an interactive film essentially, and on that account it pulls some things off really well.Firstly, the audio design is fantastic in this game. The voice acting for the main characters are all well-done and performed, and even most minor characters are rather well-voiced (though you'll find a few reoccurring VAs). The ghost stories you can get via collectibles deserve particular praise, as the acting done here really adds a lot to the story, and honestly are really well-done.But it's not just the voice acting. The music is very good too, with some good creepy vibes, emotional melodies, and songs to go well to the mystery. The ambiance of sounds in the environment also add a lot, with a lot of attention to detail to help bring the locations alive. And even the game sounds, for solving cases, getting clues, etc., are all satisfying and fitting.The story is quite good, especially if you like detective-ghost stories, ala' The Frighteners, Sixth Sense, or the like. While the writing can be a bit hammy at times, they do have some believable dialogue between characters, the story has interesting developments as it goes on, and there are some rather well-done plot twists throughout.Cinematics deserve special mention. The cinematography is really well-done, with fantastic angles, focus, artistic direction, and were a joy to watch. And the characters are well-realized, trope-ish, but manage to be developed and become more than their tropes and have rather realistic relationships with each other. They have fights and don't agree, but come together (sometimes reluctantly), and there are a few heart-warming moments and real development with each other as it goes on.Graphically it looks good for the sort of niche budget title it is. Some nice attention to detail in environments, some good art direction, and some of the models are rather well poly'd. There's some visual quality dips in certain areas, textures... But not a bad looking game at all.Generally, I would label this as a game for gamers who like story, exploring, and world-building above all else. Gameplay really takes a step-down to the game's other elements, and it will definitely strike with its niche. But its lack of action, focus on making what is usually the 'extra' parts of games the main part, and just the general styling and minimal gameplay make it lack that mainstream appeal. I'd also say it isn't worth its $50 pricetag, but felt it was worth it for the $15-25 range.I'd say if the game interests you, it is worth experiencing... Just maybe not at full price. It is different than your typical budgeted game in this day and age, and is sure to find a cult audience. In some aspects, it's a bit disappointing or under-cooked, but as a whole, this may be one of the best realized classic-styled ghost stories to appear in the gaming medium for years. Like the Fedora or not, Ronan is the perfect tour guide into a very different look at ghosts, Salem, and games with a budget.			"

												7.5/10 Very Good game , but id recommend buying it on sale.A mix of Alan Wake meets LA Noire and has a baby delivered by Bigby Wolf with the whole thing being recorded by Nicholas Cage on a 8mm film, and Jennifer Love Hewitt standing by to help all the ghosts watching cross over.PROS:- Good mystery story and atmosphere- Lots of collecting- Very interesting system and dynamic of game while playing as ghost- Dark undertone of story- Enjoyable graphics and pretty smooth gameplay imo ( had only 1 minor bug fixed by reloading )CONS:- very little and very simplistic combat (might as well remove it completely and add a few more sidequests or even some puzzles)- if you strictly rush main story without exploring or doing sidequests might be a bit short. I did 2 playthroughs first one i collected all except 5 items and it took me 12 hours, second one i rushed to get those few items and it took me 5h to get almost to last part of game ( Judgement house). So rushed probably 6h playthrough.- wish world was more open to explore and more interractive and immersive (ghosts you meet are pretty forgetable after you do quest)- this would work great as a mystery adventure with some rpg progression- not really scary , very little horror.  More of a murder mystery thriller if you ask me.CONCLUSION:Worth playing. Hope there is a sequel and i will buy it when it comes out.			"

												Ever thought about being a ghost?  Pass through walls, posses people, teleporting,  making the T.V. go wild, things like this make it fun to be one. Of course, being a ghost has to be somewhat dark and taken seriously. After all, being a ghost means you’re dead. Murdered Soul Suspect is a game where Ronan, a detective that follows a lead, dies but stays in this world as a ghost and the only thing that keeps him from finding peace is solving the case. The story is very noir like, despite the presence of modern objects, since the dark atmosphere and the mystery  are the things that are unavoidable in this game.  The plot is as it should be,  clear, logic and ended with enough closure to make you realize what a good story it is. In a world where ghosts have many questions, where are mediums that can see that and a killer that hunts those people down, you are the one that provides the answers.  There are ghosts that you can help find peace. There are collectibles that give you a lot of backstory on various topics and characters. There is one murderer that can’t be stopped still loose in this town. All of this is obvious throughout the game and that’s what will keep you hooked.

Gameplay wise, the game is easy. To put it simply, you’ll  take walks,  find clues, conclude investigations with the correct solution, execute demons by taking them from behind and collecting stuff if you feel like it. To put it as it is, things are more complex than that, but not much more.  In order to gain clues, you’ll need to look for them at the crime scene , you’ll need to interact with someone or something to find more, which sometimes mean possessing a person, influencing them to think about the topic you need or looking through their eyes.  The things that present a challenge in this game are the demons, that are very much alike with the dementors. They’ll consume your soul if you are exposed to them for long enough.  You can pass by them, or you can execute them by going behind them and using one of your ghostly abilities. Ronan can hide from them by possessing people or hiding in different entities. At the player disposal is also the ability to see the demon from afar, even through walls.Facing the demons are the stealthy section of the game, but they’re not frustrating enough to make the game challenging at all. For completitionists, there are a lot of collectibles to be found, which contain backstories of characters and places, or a separate story.  They aren’t hard to be found and there are more than one good guides, so you could say it’s easy to get all the achievements. The town of Salem is beautiful, varied but after you explore it all, it feels like a small place.  There is free roam until the last mission, but that is useful for those who want to get back to specific locations to get the rest of the collectibles.  Also, if you see an NPC that looks interesting to you, you can posses him and hear what he thinks.

Is the game a great one? No, it’s simply good. It lasts for about 10 hours, it has great concepts and executes them simply, which may be a fault for it, since many said about the game that it had great potential. Still, there’s no other game that can make you have fun for being a ghost like this one.  Passing through walls, possessing people, talking with other ghosts, potterghasting different object to perturb the living ones, it’s all very enjoyable. The theme is dark, some details are gritty, it’s a game where you solve a mystery which has a solution that isn’t obvious at all(the plot-twists turned out to be mind-blowing).

Short version: 86%Murdered mixes interactive storytelling with exploration mechanics to create a somewhat predictable modern ghost tale. The writing quality, especially the world-building, easily carries the game, despite its sometimes downright terrible (keyboard) controls.Long version:Murdered: Soul Suspect combines one of the most common basic premises of modern ghost tales—solve the case of your own murder—with a buddy cop system, where our titular freshly-murdered detective teams up with a young psychic girl to get to the bottom of a series of strange killings. And to maximise the possible clichés, this ghost story is set in Salem.In many ways, Murdered can be classified as an exploration game, as we spend most of it looking for things. It is divided to several levels (all tied to major Salem landmarks), where we search for clues or specific (otherworldly) objects. The clues are used in simple matchmaking minigames to draw conclusions and push the plot forward, whereas the collectibles eventually turn into a series of long backstories.Interestingly enough, these backstories supply the bulk of the content, as this is where we can learn the most about our protagonist, the game world, and the many tragic stories it hides. Since the central plot is painfully predictable, sometimes these stories are the biggest reason to continue playing.Although Murdered could have worked perfectly as an adventure-like game, apparently the developers were worried that the console generation’s attention span would run out without enemies to kill, so we have shoehorned action sequences against a bunch of wraith-like apparitions. To kill them, we need to play short stealth sections with mandatory quick-time events. These QTEs are downright impossible to do on mouse and keyboard, so, in the end, even with these tacked-on parts, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game, but only to gamepad owners.			"

												I was fairly dissapointed with how this game turned out. The concept was interesting, and I love the genre; however, the excution of the game play mechanics was lacking in any real dept. All of the crime scenes were a fixed camera angle away from being a point and click adventure, and putting the clues together could be done by random guessing without penalty. The characters felt forced, and fell deeply into non-relatable stereotypes that were hard to really care about. I really wanted to like the story, but I kept finding myself just grinding through everything to see it end. I couldn't see me much functionally wrong with the game, and didn't encounter many bugs; however it just got down right boring. The stealth/combat whatever they were going for with the demons, ended up becoming an annoyance, and half the time I could just run by them without worry. The voice acting, music, and ambient atmosphere were excuted well, and they created the emotions the story was trying to encourage. Unfortunatly the writting its self was too forced, and anti-climatic at best. I completed the game in about 7 hours without collecting everything, but I did all the side cases I could find. It wasn't a completely regrettable expierence, but for the price you're better off waiting for a good sale as this is a play once and uninstall title. I hope this helps someone from being stuck with a $50 dissapointment like I am.			"

												I am here against all odds to recommend this game to everyone. You will like this game if you are like me and loved reading those detective novels. The Good Very Cinematic Approach, with a 1st person narration and 3rd person navigation.Quite an intriguing story.Even though the theme is supernatural it doesnt talk about religiousness or any other stupid stuff instead focuses on the characters that are in the game instead.The background score is great along with good voice actors.Very simple controls nothing too fancy considering the fact that this is a ported game from a console version.The BadThe Story is so condensed that the entire game takes place within a single night. In a sense it is a fast paced game but it doesnt feel like a fast paced game at all. The only other comparable game would be Fahrenheit aka The Indigo Prophecy.You are a ghost, there are a ton of fun stuff you could probably do as a ghost but this game doesnt allow you to fulfill your Hollowman dreams.The Story is very linear, there are no alternate endings, hence its very predictable considering it is a AAA priced game there should have been alternate endings.Limited exploration of the surroundings, you dont get to go everywhere you want. The only reason you get to explore is because you have to collect certain artifacts and items -again- the reward for which is negligible and has no direct relation to the game's storyline.In a way the game does try to teach 'children' about a moral about fulfilling your debts and being honest & things like that, but the developers forgotm kids dont get to spend 50 bucks. Teenagers and Grown up gamers do. You do get to snoop around a little to help a few other souls to 'move on' but it is nearly not enough.I am a DOG person why are there so many cats here and no DOGS in Salem ??The UglyThere is no denying the fact that the game has a very sloppy game engine. The quadruped animation quality of the cats are less than okay.I was stuck in a limbo / mid air within the first 5 minutes of the game.The lack of action. Despite what the trailer had me believing there is absolutely NO action game play here. The Cut Scene sequences are fun to watch but thats it.There was a million different ways how this game could have been made way better than what it is, the story, the interactivity, the side missions everything felt too little and too less.My rating 3.8/5 "

												Mudered: Soul Suspect left me wanting in almost every aspect of the game. I expected an engaging story focused 3rd person game with puzzles and minimal to no combat and in a way thats what you get here, just not well executed.Graphical Fidelty is mediocre as you would expect from a Console Port and i wouldnt mind if the mechanics and story were up to compensate for that. The Main mechanic of conducting an investigation is for them to designate an area where you look for a set number of clues to tell you what happened. This almost plays like a hidden object game and its really not interesting. At the end you are supposed to select some of the clues to conclude your investigatoin into a story and a little cutscene tells you what you gathered from that. Sometimes you can possess a witness where you can peek through his eyes to find a clue on a screen or notepad, influence his memory by selecting a clue you found so that he reveals more information about that or you can eavesdrop on a conversation. The Problem with all this is that you do it maybe 5 times in the game with some effect while the rest of the time, it doesnt do anything at all. Mindreading in Salem is really boring and i hope the real inhabitants have more going though their head than these NPCs.The Game has two types of collectibles which reveal some lore about your former life or a criminal story. The lore bits about your former life or you girlfriend reveal information one at a time which you can access by going into a horrible menu where you have to click on each piece individually to see what it says. And the Navigatoin of the Menu is horrible, the most basic pc-conversion where using your mouse is a pain, they put no effort into adjusting a system for pc which is badly designed from the start. Why dont you let me just click on this! You just dont want to navigate through this to get 2 sentences about the meaning of your tattoos, or how you met your deceased wife.The second tye which reveals a little story is even worse, because these are collectibles in a major areas which only reveal their story after you collected all of them. This means you can run around the levels for ages looking for that last piece which extends the game time in a very boring and artificial way. Only some true OCD guys will suffer through that. And they even have more ideas how to prolong their game time. Sometimes there are areas with demons which can end your undead life unless you sneak up behind them and press a button+mouse combination to ban them. So you jump from hiding point to hiding point to get behind them and banish all of them. This is neither challenging nor interesting, its only annoying because you want to get through this part which adds nothing to the game.All in all i am very disappointed and if i had payed full price for this i would be furious. The game doesnt know how to tell its story through its mechanics. the mechanics are uninspired and boring and there is a lot of filler to prolong a game wich doesnt have much to offer. I took 7h for the main story line and there was an infuriating bit at the end, where i had a lot of respawns right on top of these black spot which draw you into the abyss. So i got to spawn found myself  dying and reloading several times in a row before i could continue to the end.I am Sorry but A resounding: Dont Buy! from me "

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a third-person supernatural mystery-thriller where you play as Ronan O’Connor, a thief turned detective, who gets shot to death while trying to prevent a murder by the notorious Bell Killer, an enigmatic hooded man who kills his victims in different ways around the town of Salem, Massachusetts. Waking up, Ronan discovers he is a ghost stuck in some sort of a limbo, referred to as Dusk, but eventually figures out that the only way to free himself and meet his deceased wife is to stop the Bell Killer before committing further murders.The story in Murdered: Soul Suspect is all about Ronan’s journey of redemption. Each new finding leads Ronan to a new destination and at one point he even ends up partnering, out of necessity, with a medium by the name of Joy Foster, a punk-looking teenager, who can see and talk with ghosts. Joy is looking for her mother who is assumed to be followed by the Bell Killer. The chemistry between Ronan and Joy is legitimately good. As a murder mystery story with supernatural elements, it is fairly decent but I hardly think it rises above the average. It does not deviate too much from tropes, so it may feel very familiar to fans of this genre. While it may start off like an original story, by the end it is hard not feel like you might have experienced a similar story in games such as Blackwell (Rose and Joey), Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father (witchcraft) and Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller (Cain Killer). That bugged me a bit. There are enough genuine twists to keep you invested in its very short story (6-7 hours) though, even when the game tries too hard to fool you, but the ending is underwhelming.Now Murdered: Soul Suspect has a very strong presentation. Visually, it genuinely reminds me of Batman: Arkham Asylum/City. The story unfolds during the same night, so it is always night time in the game. Character models are generally well made, including their facial animations, although there is a noticeable difference in quality between the protagonists and civilians; the former being more detailed. In general, the performance is solid as well.The world, or the town of Salem, is a sinister semi-open-world similar to Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines where the streets are narrow and split between a few regions. NPCs are present on the streets of Salem, although most of them have fixed positions while others seem to follow the same walking path. Shockingly, at the first crime scene, two civilians have the same character model which, at the time, made me laugh. The more I played, the more I discovered the lack of variety in the NPCs roaming the streets which is rather disappointing considering a good effort was put into the presentation.The voice acting is also one of the strong points of the game and the voice actor of Ronan brilliantly gives the protagonist a Clint Eastwood vibe. Bluntly, Ronan O’Connor is one badass character without losing his credibility in the process. Furthermore, the soundtrack of Murdered: Soul Suspect suits most scenes and creates a fitting atmosphere that is quite chilling at times. There are even a handful of occasions which throws in a few questionable horror-oriented scores, as for the most part, the game is not much of a horror game. However, the soundtrack does tend to become very same-y over time.Where Murdered: Soul Suspect falters is in its game design and gameplay. Even within the first few minutes after you wake up as a ghost, I decided to venture outside the perimeter of the crime scene, just for the screen to fade to black and teleport me back to the crime scene. For me, this triggered a red-flag. Thankfully, this only happens at the first crime scene, as the game world opens up later on. Well, sort of. As a ghost, Ronan can walk through walls and objects, but not all of them. This is explained in the story, something about purgatory houses and whatnot. There are also many pre-rendered cutscenes (locked at 30fps) in this game which gives it more of an interactive movie feel than a traditional adventure game.Now, one of the things which makes the game appealing at first is how investigations work. At a crime scene, you look for clues to solve the puzzle. The more clues you find, there is a better chance of finding the right solution. More interestingly is Ronan’s ability in ghost form to possess people (or cats) and read their minds, or jolt their memories of a particular event, peek at what they are looking and influence them as part of your investigation. On paper, this sounds superb, but sadly the game misses so much potential by its lackluster execution. The problem here is that the aforementioned supernatural abilities are very restricted. You cannot always use the ability to peek whenever you desire. You cannot influence people whenever you want. No, you can only perform these actions when the game tells you. This is utterly stupid because it makes the game even more restrictive and linear than it already is. On the other hand, you can read any NPC’s mind at any time, but they barely give any useful information except when you are at an important plot point.Additionally, the investigation puzzles rarely give you an “A-ha!” moment because there is no challenge. When piecing the clues or connecting the dots, so to speak, you are not punished (fairly) for any mistakes you make in your deduction despite a rating system showing how well you performed. Later on in the story, Ronan gains two new abilities: Reveal and Teleportation. Both are self-explanatory, but they are criminally underused in the gameplay for trivial activities, with the latter being used mainly to get to a secret room with a collectible. Yes, throughout the game, there are 150 collectibles for the player to collect, at their leisure, which provide the backstory of the pivotal characters, the history of Salem and some ghost stories. Side missions are also present, albeit not too many. These involve helping out other ghosts stuck in Dusk and take about 5-10 minutes to complete. They are really easy to solve and optional. Sadly, most of them are not really that interesting as subplots and are not even connected to the main plot.The game has some stealth sections where Ronan has to either avoid or take down Demons once in a while at certain plot events. Contextually, these Demons are corrupted souls which stayed too long in Dusk and their only purpose is to consume the souls of other ghosts to regain humanity. Again, the problem here is down to the execution. There is no depth to the stealth, and frankly, I would barely call it stealth. Ronan can hide from them through soul fragments scattered around the area or by possessing a human, but all this is useless as the Demons can be taken down easily by sneaking behind them and performing a basic QTE. Not only that, but the Demons have an absurdly short line of sight. Even when you get detected, escaping is easy too. Worse, the Demons have a fixed path. There is also a stealth section involving smuggling Joy through a police department and an asylum, but again, the lack of depth in distracting the guards is laughable. In the end, the “stealth” works, but it is lazily implemented and these  sections become more of a nuisance. Thankfully they do not take too long.In conclusion, Murdered: Soul Suspect is a very difficult one to recommend mostly because it is neither utterly bad nor substantially good. It sits perfectly in the middle. It has the looks of an AAA game but the heart of a mediocre indie game. I strongly feel the game could have been better if it were a standard adventure point ‘n’ click game with a longer story, tighter mechanics, challenging puzzles and less emphasis on a cinematic experience. The story on its own, which is only decent at best, cannot carry the game with its current faults this time around. You will not be missing out much by skipping it, hence why I am not recommending it.			"

And as I get further, and experiance this more, I will keep updating my review.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a third-person adventure game, in which you play the role of a ghost, who needs to find out about his mysterious murder.You're playing Ronan O'Connor, a detective, who gets murdered right at the beginning of the game. The Murderer itself gets away unidentified and you're staying in this world as a ghost, to find out what happend, why and who did it.The game itself is very story-driven. You're walking (or running) around the different hubs, interacting with items or persons, trying to find clues (and combining them) about your murder or the victims of the serial killer, which you were after at the beginning.There are also various collectibles to be found, which will keep you occupied (if you like things like this).Graphics are pretty neat and i liked the atmosphere of the game, though, even as you visit different scenes and buildings, the overall look doesn't change drastically. A bit more variety could have been better.The story kept me entertained quite well and had also some nice twists throughout the game.There is one part, which could be frustrating: from time to time demons appear on your path, which you'll either need to evade or destroy. THis only happens at certain points in the game (not often) and if you kill them, they'll be gone forever and won'T reappear.It's not *that* hard, but if you don't like things like this in an adventure game, then you might have a little hassle here.Apart from that, i can recommend this to all players, which like fairly easy, story-driven adventure games.

												If you like games such as L.A Noire and Sherlock Holmes this should be right up your alley. It is different from those games though, because this is you solving your own crime. That means your a ghost, wandering around the town looking for clues. I would say this is a very unique game, and that's rare these days.Gameplay wise it's simple, look around for clues, draw a conclusion and go to the next place. it's very interesting because you are a ghost and you can simply walk through walls. However you cant go through solid buildings, unless someone opens the door for you. You can also use abillities like poltergeist, mind control and even take over a cat. This game is extremely story heavy, and the story is really intresting. It kept me coming back until I was done. Even the simple sidequests really intrigued me and made me want to collect every little collectible I could find.About 1,5 hour of the game is cutscenes and the others are gameplay. It's not that long of a game, but I would actually say this was the perfect lenght. It didn't overstay its welcome and drag out for to long. The story was exciting all the way through, and you could never figure out who it was until the end. A lot of plot twists in this game, which reminded me of Heavy Rain. The story is great thanks to impressive cutscenes and good voice acting. Any downsides with this game? Only that the demons and the elements were quite repetitive, but that isn't that big of a complaint since the game didn't go on for that long, and I can clearly see that they put the work on cutscenes and story instead. I really enjoyed my time in this dark and gritty town. This is a game that everyone should play at some point in my honest opinion, it's that damn good. I really hope they will make a sequel or something along those lines.			"

At the moment of this review I have played for 13 hours. Didn't like it some time ago but now... oh yeah.Do I think this game is good and can I recommend it? YES, absolutely. I bought it on steam sale, but believe me, this game is worth at full price. A few words about this game? You have to be in mood to let the story trap you. Are you familiar with Occam's razor? If you are not it's ok, because in this game, that theory doesn't work.

Graphics: If you have a mid/high graphic card you can force to downsampling to play 4k at 30fps. If not, you will play very smooth with everything high. Also, i recommend to use a sweetfx filter because like vanilla, the game is like be inside a soup. The air is grey and you are trap into it. I suppose that the purpose of it it's to remember you that you are dead but hey!! I can go through walls and I have 7 bullet holes on my chest, I know I'm dead! Some of the npcs are clones, you will find the same face sometimes and even when you posses them, some of them will think the same but Salem city is big and alive enough to seem a real city that is under the siege of a murder.The most interesting I found is that the game mixes the past and the present into the same place. You are a ghost and you can see the ""memory"" of the city, pieces of walls, canons, gallows, sunken boats... places where something (not necessarily bad) happened and are still here somehow, into the spiritual plane.Music: Tension, suspense, horror... I really don't remember the music itself but I can remember the feeling that it provoked ot me, so yeah.... good enough.

Story: Murdered: Soul Suspect will transform you into a detective trying to resolve a case about murders which are happening into salem city. This is important because if you are not in mood to do that role, you won't like this game and it's a shame because it really worth. You will be Ronan, a police inspector with a dark past, who has been murdered during the investigation of the murders (this is not a spoiler) and here is the reason why Occam's razor can't be useful here, because you are a ghost investing the murders... what ghost can see...The story ""is"" the game. You have to follow the clues, going deeper into the case because like a ghost you have acces to where humans don't have and that's the best bet of this game and at the end is why it traps you until you finish the game.There are some secondary stories that are really good enough to try to resolve them.Gameplay: You can walk, run, posses npcs, and use some ghost powers to boldly go where no man has... well, to try to arrive to new locations and escape from demons. The way you can resolve the different cases you will find is easy and you can think that even boring but the real purpose of it, it's to make you think about the murders and step by step, think like Ronan. You will find yourself thinking on the case, the clues, the main suspect... and just by this the game would be good enough Negative point: You can't save or customize the controls. Demons are supposed to frighten you, but when you realize that they move inside a path, always the same patron, you just sit, wait and ambush them. Some repetitive npcs models, even their thoughts are the same Versión en Español Tenía mis dudas pero el doblaje es francamente bueno.			"

												Bought this game on sale not too long ago, and I'm glad I bought it when it was cheap, as I feel the $6 tag was about right. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a crime drama about a murdered cop on the hunt for his killer. The story ended up being pretty good, a lot of twists and turns throughout, very well done and well written dialogue. If you're looking for a decent story that doesn't drag on, an interactive movie, this is a good purchase. However, if you're looking for more game elements? You won't really find it here. Gameplay is abysmally easy, the hardest parts coming in quicktime events, which are no more than two button combos. The puzzles are no more difficult than ""Which one of these reminds you of a cheese sandwich?"" *picks the picture of a cheese sandwich*. The setting is great, if albeit a little heavy handed (Wait... Salem... has witches?!), and the graphics are nice. The rest of it... just isn't really there. I completed the game (not 100%... like 75%, maybe) in about 10 hours, and do not feel the need to replay it or go back and hunt for the avalanche of clickies throughout. Unless this drops to about the same amount I paid, I would give it a pass, but $6 feels about right.			"

												Good:- Ghost Trick + LA Noire- Audio- MC is a ghost detective, and seems levelheaded and cool- setting is coolBad:- ""Combat"" is a qte that keeps changing- Textures on max are AWFUL and inconsistent- compressed cutscene video after compressed cutscene video. WHY??- Level design is lame- Have no idea what the MC's name is- ""puzzle"" answers are so obvious that I tend to go ""no it can't be that"" and frequently get them wrong, until I get the right one and realize I was thinking too hard- Investigation is kind of overly tedious, Phoenix Wright did this better years ago. This is like Miles Edgeworth investigating. - Can't seem to get steam screenshots to work properly and I'm not sure why.Got it for around $22, I feel like I paid a little bit too much. Absolutely not worth $50+			"

 One of the most surprisingly good games I’ve played in a long time. It manages to sell its bizarre premise and builds a solid, moving story out of it, and the plot-propelling investigations add immensely to the detective feel. Walking around as a ghost is clever and entertaining, and it even manages to inject variety into some of gaming’s most overused elements.  9/10  "

												Well, just finished the game and i have to say that I liked it a lot! The story was pretty satisfying and nice, the main protagonist was one to remember and this made you into the game, which is pretty nice.Pros: Nice storyI liked the Ronan as detectiveNice plot twist in the end, but if you have played taht many games you can find out shortaThe feeling of completing a sequence Posses and use a cat, i wish I could do more as a can into the game.Cons:The image was freezing from time to time, the game play wasn't so smooth the most of the timeDemons, i mean ofcourse there had to be some difficulty into the game, but for people like me who sucks at synchronization to use the right keys it was a hell for sureThe areas, I would like to find more pieces for the short stories into the game, but withdemos around I wouldnt like to go back and check. Youtube is my friend now :PIn general lines it was a pretty solid and nice game, not too short, not too long but it created some feeling into me, which is always a good thing for a game. I recommend you to get you on sales , or in a banndle. I got mine from humble bandle and i think it was the best money i would have spent into the game. Anyway, go guys play it, it is a good game, some times annoying, but you will feel nice when it endes and will feel that you lost the case in person "

												This a fairly classic noir story -- with a supernatural twist. I've seen the reviews that put the game at around a 5-6 (mediocre) and on one hand I can see that. The graphics aren't anything amazing and for fifty bucks I'd like to have spent longer than 8 hours to finish the main story. On the other hand, what a fun (if somewhat predictable) story. I especially enjoyed the investigation elements; they're reminiscent of games like L.A. Noire or Condemned: Criminal Origins. Even more, the game is focused exclusively on the storytelling and there's really no combat or action -- it's all about the mystery and puzzles. What little combat there is in the game is mostly based on sneaking around and running away from enemies (you can only attack them from behind).Where the game really shines is in characterization and story development. The two main characters, Ronan and Joy, have a great odd couple vibe that had me laughing in spots. Most of the character development for everyone else (and even backstory for Joy and Ronan) happen through collectibles but provide really deep storytelling that is (occasionally) historically accurate and interesting. I'd recommend this to mystery or noir fans but suggest you wait for the price to come down since the game is so short. I finished all the main story, the ""interactive"" sidequests AND managed to collect about 75 percent of all the collectibles in my 8 hour play through.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Murdered: Soul Suspect Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: Adventure; Mystery; Third-Person; Detective My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-12 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamers REVIEWMurdered: Soul Suspect is a story-driven adventure game with a strong focus on collectibles and “detective” work, and very little action/combat. You play in 3rd-person adventure style, progressing the story and moving throughout the game world from one spot to the next.  You collect clues and make deductions in the case you are working on in the primary story arc.  The game is pretty linear, which is to be expected for something so focused on story telling; but there is some freedom of exploration.  Much of the backstory and lore can be learned about through the extensive amount of collectibles scattered throughout the levels.The graphics are pretty nice at max settings and the atmosphere of the game is fitting and done well.  The voice acting is among the best you will find in the realm of video games, which is important since the whole appeal of the game is the story.  It’s a pretty short game, perhaps medium-sized if you decide to get all the collectibles— but it is paced very well, and wraps up right around the time it starts to get stale.There is really only one mechanic to the game, which is to move around and pick up clues or artifacts... and maybe use a few bland abilities here and there.  The combat is rare and one-dimensional and never evolves into anything more.  So it feels a lot like a show/movie where you control the main character.  To keep you busy, you can explore the levels to search for collectibles as you play through the campaign.So in conclusion I would posit that I enjoyed my playthrough of this game.  It is pretty minimal in terms of gameplay mechanics; but if you are one who enjoys good story-driven games with atmosphere, and who enjoys collectibles in a 3rd-person adventure setting: then you will probably enjoy Murdered: Soul Suspect.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												I am judging this review based on its full price and therefore cannot recommend it. I would only recommend getting this game when there is a deep sale. The pro/con section will be at the bottom of this review .Murdered: Soul Suspect is a detective adventure game where you play as Ronan, an ex-con badass who became a cop to atone for his wrong doings. You get killed by a man in a hoodie and become a ghost. You learn that you need to find clues to figure out who killed you in order to complete your ""unfinished business"" and be at peace. This game had so much potential to be something great but fell short and left me with an unsatisfactory experience.GameplayThis is a detective game where you play as a ghost in the mortal world. Think about all the things you can do as a ghost, it's going to be awesome!.. Or at least that's what you are led to believe. You start off the game learning that can you can walk through walls, only to realise that there are ""ghost walls"" all over the town Salem that you can't walk through. These walls are just there to hinder you from exploring the town of Salem and become extremely annoying after a while. Next you learn that you could possess random people and read their minds, only for it to get boring and repetitive after 20 minutes. The people around the town were bland and shamelessly copy pasted and the only thing you get from reading their minds were always something along the lines of ""Oh dear a murder, that’s terrible"" or ""I wish it wasn't so cold"". It's the same thing over and over again and eventually you just won't bother with the possessions. Their scripted dialogue with each other is pretty interesting to listen to though.The core gameplay has you travel from place to place in order to investigate scenes and solve puzzles. You have to find a couple of clues and then come to a conclusion about what the killer was doing or where he was going to next, much like the crime scene investigations in L.A Noire . However the puzzles are so painfully simple and boring that it doesn't take you long to come to a conclusion. In the end it just becomes a sort of glorified find the object game with an extremely obvious ""which one of these objects are related to the crime?"" conclusion (seriously, a spoon , a fork, or a key that belonged to the killer? I wonder which of these are relevant). The combat system is an extremely basic stealth system where you have to hide from patrolling demons and then execute them when they weren't looking at you. However, like most of the game, demons pose little to no challenge and are just there to hinder you and fill time. The combat didn't evolve over the course of the game and after the 4th or 5th time I heard the demons arrive I just thought to myself ""ugh not again"".You also have several dialogue options to choose from during the story, but these have no effect on the story at all. There are also side quests where you go about helping other ghosts to finish their business and these quests are rather interesting.There are collectibles hidden all around the map for you to collect, these will allow you to learn about the town of Salem, Ronan's background as well as give some insight on the killer. Unfortunately there is no map function and also no way for you to check which collectible you already have and which ones you still need to find.  I enjoyed listening and reading the stories about the artifacts I collected and make exploring the town enjoyable, I just wished the damned ghost walls weren't so restrictive and annoying.GraphicsThe game is quite good looking and the town of Salem looks great. The ghost structures and mortal buildings complemented each other well to give this dark and gloomy feeling.The main characters looked unique and well designed. There is a 30fps when you have v-sync on, but you can turn off v-sync in game and use v-sync from an external program such as Nvidia's control panel and the game will run at 60fps.SoundThe music in this game was pretty good. It set the mood really well and occasionally the music would go eerily quiet to build tension. The combat music also tries its best to build excitement and tension but was unfortunately unable to complement or help the poor combat system.The voice acting in this game was superb and was one of the only reasons why I could finish this game. I enjoyed listening to the conversations between the main characters and especially liked listening to many of Ronan's monologues.Pros+ Town looks great when the ""ghostly"" and ""mortal"" buildings are mixed together to form a unique hybrid look+ Voice acting is superb+ Interesting lore and backstory about the town as well as the protagonist+ Good chemistry between the main characters+ Interesting storyline+ Side quests are a nice change of paceCons- Basic and boring combat system- Core puzzle solving is too simple and repetitive- Extremely linear game- Ghost walls are a hindrance- Somewhat clunky controls- Choices make no difference to the story's conclusion- No replay valueIn conclusion this game is an overly simplified detective game with a boring stealth combat system slapped on it. It fails to impress, and with a price tag of $30 I certainly cannot recommend it over other detective games such as L.A Noire			"

												Ronan is a criminal-turned-cop who is killed by the mysterious Bell Killer. Playing as Ronan's ghost, investigate a series of crime scenes (sometimes with the help of teenage medium Joy), searching for identity of the killer. Many supernatural elements come into play – ghosts, witches, demons – and some flashbacks of the witch trials are pretty gruesome (drowning, burning, hanging). As the investigation progresses, you'll explore a graveyard, an apartment house, an old mansion, a police station and of course the obligatory asylum level. While the game world is small, it is open, with the ability to just wander around the town of Salem. It's a gloomy place – the game occurs entirely at night – but is well-dotted with NPCs and collectibles. Obtaining collectibles can unlock other stories (usually brief, narrated cut-scenes), and some NPCs will provide side-missions. There's a decent amount of stuff to do, but most collectibles were easily found as I explored the town or a level. Investigations require exploring a a crime scene, finding evidence (“Press E to analyze”) and sorting through the collected evidence (“Press Q to conclude the investigation”). Walking (or later, teleporting) around as a ghost feels fun; Ronan can walk through walls, possess people (mind-reading), and turn on random stuff to mess with the townsfolk (poltergeisting). Especially cool were the impenetrable “ghost walls” from past times that can block Ronan from exploring – or even provide new hazards (watch out for the ghost train!). Oh, and you can possess cats, too. This is actually crucial to progress through several stages of the game.The demon sections, though, dragged the experience down a bit. Demons will sometimes spawn after completing an investigation. Their existence does have a crucial part to play, and they're easy enough to defeat with a little patience. Given that this is a supernatural tale, it would be rather weird if demons of some kind weren't in the game, and having some stealth sections added some variety to the gameplay. But after a while the demons became annoying distractions from the story.And the narrative is where Murdered: Soul Suspect stands strongest. There is a lot of backstory to be found about Ronan and his wife (via collectibles). Sometimes collectibles are merely annoying, but they are worth pursuing here. Jason Brooks (as Ronan) and Cassidy Lehrman (as the medium, Joy) provide stand-out vocal performances. The graphics (Unreal 3) are great – murky and dark. Jason Graves' score provides a classic horror-story undertone. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a well-crafted detective game with a few quirks that holds its story aloft as its best attribute. If that sounds good to you, then go ahead and get this one.			"

„All those street brawls. It’s amazing I lived as long as I did.” ~RonanMURDERED: Soul Suspect is a new game made by Airtight Games, known from their other, warmly acclaimed production: Quantum Conundrum. This time, instead of a puzzle-adventure game devs made sure to provide us with a polished action-adventure suspense story backed with a supernatural mystery. Although professional reviewers are mostly critical about this game, I’ll try to convince You that it’s actually worth both its price and Your attention.The Game starts on a high note, with our protagonist – reformed cop Ronan - falling to his death after brutal fight with a mysterious murderer haunting the streets of modern day Salem. Soon he comes to his senses, only to discover that death itself was just a beginning. We end up being trapped on earth, but in a new ghostly form, with our mind set on a one simple goal: to complete our unfinished business, and finally move on to the other side.Unfortunately for Ronan, this unfinished business involves solving this one last case, which ultimately led him to his own demise by the hand of a dreadful Bell Killer. Luckily our hero is a fast learner, and easily adapts to the new state he’s woken up to. On our quest to hunt down the killer we’ll be using Ronans wits and experience gained as a police detective to find new leads, connect evidences and even access past memories imprinted into the ghost-realms fabric.The game consists of two different gameplay modes – first being a free roam explorations, during which we use our ability to pass through objects, summon or cast away solid fragments of the past Salem, and later even teleport to pass beautifully designed locations while finding as much collectibles as we can, and second being much slower ‘investigation mode.’The investigations are the most iconic moments of the game, and thanks to their presence many players felt obliged to describe Soul Suspect as “L.A. Noirish”. I’d argue with this opinion, because although in both games we progress through solving some cases the feeling of those is definitely different. In Soul Suspect we conduct our investigations with appropriate supernatural twist by correctly influencing possessed people, linking uncovered evidences or even accessing past memories lingering in the ghostly Salem. In turn Soul Suspects system feels much more simple, and dynamic in comparison to L.A. Noires ‘adjust and question’ model.Leaving gameplay behind, the strongest point of the game is definitely its scenario. With perfectly written characters and interesting plot twists, Ronans crusade against Bell Killer will be a memorable experience appealing to every gamer. The locations inspired by some of the Salems most iconic buildings are recreated in a great detail, and greatly contributes to the games spooky atmosphere. The whole experience is polished by believable voice overs and sounds, with only minor flaw being games music which felt somehow nonexistent.The only serious drawback of the game, is the large amount of collectibles, that makes even ‘Alan Wake’ blush in shame. It’s actually hard to move more than 5 ft without stumbling upon some new note, item or a graffiti flooding us with new information either related to our investigation or the Ronans past. All those stories are pretty well written, but the sheer number of those papers seriously affects immersion preventing us from fully diving into the games world.Murdered: Soul Suspect is definitely worth getting and trying especially for its captivating story. The game is definitely a must have for every supernatural events enthusiast, shining brightly in comparison with other productions picking up this subject. And if after reading the above review You're still unconvinced, I'd like to tell You that in this game You can possess a cat, and fool around in its body!Pros:- Agitating suspense story with supernatural twist.- Smooth controls with both mouse/keyboard and x-box controler.- Lots of witty puzzles and logic investigations.- Interesting ghost-powers affecting gameplay.- Clever world design with parts of the past Salem overlying its modern streets.- Really spooky side stories to unlock.- Can possess a cat!Cons:- Game’s a bit short, with full play through taking about 8-9 hours.- A high number of collectibles seriously affects immersion.- Due to its nature game is linear.

												Well, I did not know who Airtight Games was up until now but doing 2 consecutive walkthroughs of Soul Suspect will certainly make me remember them for a while! This is a third-person view adventure game that employs some stealth elements and lots of crime scene investigation gameplay mechanics.The story follows Ronan, a con-turned-detective who has just been murdered and whose soul - for some reason - cannot leave this world and proceed to Heaven where his wife awaits. We soon learn his killer is the one he was originally after - a couple of cutscenes later his memory is refreshed and he is certain he needs to solve the mystery of the Bell Killer who has been haunting his residential town for a while so that by solving the murder case he can peacefully enter Paradise.Now, when playing this game I was constantly thinking of the adventure games released by Telltale Games. Why? Because the puzzles are easy and there is a great emphasis on the story immersion. Unlike those Telltale adventures Murdered allows you to control the protagonist and freely walk around in Salem. Still, I wouldn't really call this an open-world journey as many places are only accessible if the story demands it - the ""hub area"" is mainly for collectibles and a couple of side missions where you help other ghosts finish their business and ascend once and for all.Then come the demons. Certain sections require you to hide from the beasts and approach them while they turn away - execution is not mandatory but collecting evidence and other ""artifacts"" in the areas require you to rid Salem of them for good. While the game is not difficult, at all, and lacks any real combat it does have a great story. I almost completed it in one sitting as I really wanted to see the antagonist dealt with. Murdered has a great atmosphere which is accompanied by a great score and very well done voice acting.To summarise: if you are in for a great story and for something new and you do not mind that one playthrough gives you all the experience (a 2nd should only be done for the collectibles) then Soul Suspect is an easy grab - especially with a discount!

												Vou tentar ser meio breve aqui, mesmo que não consiga. Os trailers do jogo deixam qualquer um muito ancioso para jogar, porém, dependendo do tipo de pessoa, possa vir a se decepcionar com o que encontrará dentro do jogo.Para quem espera algum tipo de luta, velocidade, tiros, qualquer tipo de ação em geral, não vai encontar isso por essas bandas. O jogo é quase que um livro animado, para quem é acostumado e gosta de ler bastante, vai adorar (Assim como eu gostei bastante). A história pode não ser perfeitamente feita e maravilhosa, eu particulamente achei que o motivo de toda a confusão poderia ter uma explicação mais interessante, ou melhor dizendo, o motivo de tudo poderia ser outro, essa parte da história poderia ser mudada para algo melhor ( Só minha opinião por sinal, não deixa de ser interessante. )''Murdered - Soul Suspect'' não é um jogo de muitas horas, se você seguir direto para o final da história principal ( Deve durar mais ou menos 8 horas, algo assim.) Mas caso não o faça, tem muito o que explorar, muita informações escondidas pela cidade de Salem, além das sidequests, que basicamente é onde você, Ronan, faz uma boa e manda os fantasmas presos a terra para o céu, aliviando a dor que eles tinham devido alguma dúvida.Pessoalmente falando, o que mais gostei no jogo foram as informações pelo mapa sobre tudo, todas as histórias que faziam a atmosfera da cidade ficar ainda mais sombria.------------------------------------------I'll try to be brief here, even if I fail. The trailers of the game let anyone excited to play, however, depending on the type of person is likely to be disappointed with what you find in the game.For those expecting some kind of fight, speed, shots, any kind of action in general, will NOT find it for these bands. The game is almost an animated book. For anyone who is used to and likes to read a lot, you'll love (Just as I quite liked). The history is not that perfect and wonderful, I thought particularly the reason for all the confusion could have a more interesting explanation, or rather, could another part of this story be changed to something better ( Just my opinion by the way, it is still interesting.)'' Murdered - Soul Suspect'' is not a game for many hours, if you go straight to the end of the main story (should last roughly 8 hours, something like that.) But if you do not, have a lot to explore , a lot of hidden information by the City of Salem, besides the side quests, which basically is where you, Ronan, is a good soul and sends the ghosts trapped in the earth to heaven, relieving pain because they had any questions.Personally speaking, what I liked the most about the game was the information about the map everything, all the stories that made the atmosphere of the city get even murkier.

												So you investigate your own murder, your investigation skills are enhanced since you're a ghost ( in a very nicely done way) This game has amazing story worth making it a movie The investigation scenes are brilliantly done makes you think, connect things, follow leads and        reveal the story in an interesting way, and they're not that hard   Graphics are good  Sounds are not badThis whole ghost thing mechanism is done in a very appealing way, I like to see more games like that.My problem was with the 100% ashievements, codex are a ♥♥♥♥♥ for instance, and if you finish the game without getting all the ashievements you need to start all over again, and it would be nice if they told you how many collectibles left in a certain area so you know when It's done and move to another.Such a great game.

												This is a fine example of style over substance. The voice acting is solid, the writing is generally okay (it's cliched at times, but has some decent moments) and it looks good. Unfortunately, it is hampered by gameplay which ranges from mediocre to bad. On the mediocre side, you are given a mere handful of skills, which are used remarkably infrequently and only in very obvious situations. The detective aspect has some good aspects, but while it mostly avoids LA Noire's tendency towards arbitrary and frustrating sleuthing, it does so by making things terribly obvious and having no consequences for failure. My favourite was a scene where you have to find a key. Not only does the game tell you how to go about getting to the key, it then presents you with a puzzle to pick it up, where you have to choose between the key, a fork and a spoon. Spoiler: the correct answer is the key.As for the bad, the combat is hideous. Awkward controls, very limited options and overwhelming noise make for a frustrating experience.There's plenty of collectables in the game, some of which are at least a mild challenge to get, but unless you're really into that aspect of it, you're better off just watching the story on YouTube.

My favourite was a scene where you have to find a key. Not only does the game tell you how to go about getting to the key, it then presents you with a puzzle to pick it up, where you have to choose between the key, a fork and a spoon. Spoiler: the correct answer is the key.As for the bad, the combat is hideous. Awkward controls, very limited options and overwhelming noise make for a frustrating experience.There's plenty of collectables in the game, some of which are at least a mild challenge to get, but unless you're really into that aspect of it, you're better off just watching the story on YouTube.

												8,5/10+ nice presentation, although graphics are not next gen, the locations and character models are well done and the atmosphere is creepy as it should+ runs great on highest settings+ nice sound, excellent voice acting+ dark, original story about you trying (as a ghost detective !) to catch a serial killer + gameplay wise it's more of an adventure game, with lots of exploration, tons of stuff to collect and notes to read, main progress is done by investigating scenes, that is finding clues and piece them together+ fighting demons on your way by using stealth and then using qtes to kill them are the only action sequences that can be considered in the game (that's fine for me)+ nice diary that tracks everything- gameplay feels monotonous through the end, they could add some more gameplay mechanics to keep interest higher, but still you will want to finish it for the very good story- technically it could use more polishagain the reviews for this game are very unfair, maybe it shouldn't be rated as high as i have done, but it's a genre i love (creepy adventure in heart games)			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is an amazing game in its own genre, not a 10/10 one but still fun and enjoyable, especially for those who like supernatural games and enjoy solving puzzles. It has a really unique and unusual gameplay which makes the game special. There aren't car chases, weapons and other ""ultra modern"" stuff, the only enemy whom you will face are the Lost Souls aka Demons.The story isn't that long, but if you keep looking for artifacts and doing side missions it will take a while till you finish it and I swear it won't be boring.I highly recommend this game for everyone, if you don't expect anything , you will be suprised how awesome is it.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a detective puzzle(?) game, with some action(?) elements. You play as Ronan O’Connor, a cop whose wife died. That's all the back story the game has to offer. Though there was a bunch of collectables, each one had around 2-3 sentences of boring info. So I never bothered to read them, as it wasn't engaging or well wrote at all (much like this review). Ronan is murdered at the start of the game by the Bell-Tower Killer, who Ronan was hunting down. He soon discovers he is a ghost, and he must solve his death to move on to the afterlife. The game is open world, in the sense it has a hub of sorts between missions. It's literally just filler to add time to the game as you walk a short distance to the next area. The hub is littered with collectables to find, but they glow up so it's easy to get them all quickly. Investigations are poorly done. The only game I could compare this to is L.A Noire. But this feels like the poor man's L.A Noire. It's a total cheap knock-off. Asians are not only making fake American clothing, but games now too. You are thrown into an area and must walk about looking for clues. There is no indication of what might be a clue, so sometimes you could be spending upwards 10 minutes looking for the final one. Only to stumble upon by sheer luck, Whereas in L.A Noire, the controller would vibrate, or a jingle would play. The clues are also really badly thought out. Most of them are just one word, or a little phrase. Instead of finding proper evidence, you'll get one word like ""damage"", or ""scratch"". It's as if no thought was poured into the game. The only action in the game consists of you running up behind demons and holding a key, then pressing a QTE prompt that's displayed. There are no more than 20-30 demons in the entire game, so this was very lackluster. Concluding investigations was poorly done. You'd be shown all the evidence you have found, and must select 1-3 different pieces you think are most relevant to the question asked. But this could be rather arbitrary. As the clues were poorly explained, it was hard at times to figure out the most relevant ones. There are 3 badges displayed at the bottom of the screen. I at first assumed these were lives, and that if I messed up 3 times I would have to start again. But it turned out they are not. There is no failing. If you get it wrong, there are no consequences at all. As there is no point/scoring system, or achievement for getting all 3 badges in every case. Overall, the story was pretty meh. There was not much to it, and it was rather cliché. Nothing was really explained either, or made much sense. The main focus was figuring out the murders, but there were random things to do with other people tacked in, which seemed silly. Gameplay was pretty bad. Being a ghost was cool, but there were issues with walking through walls. Investigations were poorly done. Again, if you expect another L.A Noire, you're gonna be seriously disappointed. Most actions were performed with pressing a key or two, and there was just nothing to it. You walk up to an item and hit E. There was no examining it, or any of that jazz. Action was non-existent. The whole demon business was stupid and pointless. The game takes around 9 hours to complete 100%. Rushing the story and ignoring the collectables will probably reduce that time by around 3-4 hours. I do not recommend this game, even on sale. It was a drag to play, and I only did so because of the Playfire Rewards.			"

 Overview  Murdered: Soul Suspect is a mystery adventure game played in the third-person perspective of Detective Ronan O'Connor a career criminal turned cop, who is hot on the trail of the notorious ""Bell Killer"" in the quiet town of Salem, Massachusetts. The opening scene will introduce you to an elusive killer, Detective O'Connor and an unknown teenager. The failed capture of the Bell Killer leaves Detective O'Connor dead, the girl missing and the killer still at large. It is now up to you to solve your own murder and find out what happened before your soul can move on.It should be noted that none of what I mentioned above is, in any way, a spoiler. This occurs minutes into starting a new game. However, it stands as an interesting premise, one I honestly can't recall playing in the past. With that being said, Murdered: Soul Suspect has been a very difficult game to pinpoint. I found myself motivated by the main storyline, but often pulled astray by lackluster side missions and shoddy combat junctions. The end was worth the time invested, but getting there was one of uncertainty; let's start from the beginning.For those that don't know the history of Salem, Massachusetts, it is infamously known for the capture, trials and executions of accused witches circa 1692-1693. The game takes place entirely within a small suburb of Salem and the lore of the game is derived from such [so much so it practically beats you over the head with it]. While previous knowledge of these events aren't necessary, as the game will give you over two-hundred collectables that provide details of such events, it is interesting to see what was influenced from the town's history or forced to make deductive conclusions from seemingly illogical perspectives.During the course of your investigation you'll meet others [both dead and living] that will help you on your journey, providing clues that propel you closer to the truth. Here is where I had mixed feelings about the game. You see, the main story I found compelling and the script did a wonderful job of teasing you with tiny, minute details without giving you much of anything to go on. Then, however, you're side-tracked with boring side missions and dreadful combat. As you were warned, you must occasionally fight demons whose sole purpose is to consume your ghostly essence, but luckily Ronan has the ability to banish these demons with the power of obnoxious QTEs; where he gets these powers is never explained. Whenever I was forced to fight these demons I found it painfully annoying. These encounters felt forced, stuffed into the fabric of the game where the suspense waned and a hole needed to be plugged. I hated the combat to the point I chose to simply die each time I got caught and reload as opposed to actually killing the demons.Demons aside, Soul Suspect suffers from several other shortcomings: repeating dialogue between NPCs, useless abilities like ""Poltergeist"", which gave me the ability to possess electrical devices during plot convenient sequences, the ability to read minds when it was necessary and the ability to teleport. Even with all of these powers I still felt like a poor excuse for a ghost, the store brand product of something better. The game gives you these abilities, but then severely limits you to what you're able to do with them. Even as a ghost, I couldn't indiscriminately walk through walls, forcing Ronan to avoid ""ghost walls"" or spiritual residue from old structures and objects, all of which prohibited walking through; Invisible walls for ghosts you might call them. It is never explained why they exist or the reasoning behind them.The strangest thing about the game isn't the main story, which is surprisingly solid, but the extras the game throws in to expand its own longevity. The side missions were dull, the collectables were seemingly unnecessary outside achievement hunting and the combat was utterly pointless. Woven between these shortcomings was a tapestry of mystery that could have been so much more if the effort was put elsewhere. Instead were given bits of possibility only to be disappointed. Forgo the extras and put that effort into Ronan's murder and you have a great murder mystery to solve. However, you never really feel like a true ghost, nor really even a mediocre detective. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a case of trying to do too much and spreading your content too thin. The phrase ""less is more"" fits this game all too well.  Pros  Voice Acting - I was surprised by how good it actually was done. Atmosphere - I really liked the environment, music and background effects of the game. The creepy, ""ghostly"" vibe never let up.Main story - It kept me hooked until the end. Cons  
The combat is forgettable, the demon portals just stand as roadblocks if nothing else.  The ""stealth"" aspects are impossible to fail, even if you try. Zero replayability. Overall, Murdered: Soul Suspect is good, but not great. It has a lot of hiccups that, if you can look past, has something interesting to offer. The story is intriguing, the voice acting is well done and some of the characters are interesting. I'd cautiously recommend it if you can find it on sale, but don't except a masterpiece if you pick it up. Case closed.			"

Same goes for voice actors. There's one part in the game where all the cops said the exact same lines with the same voice despite being a different model =Gameplay is very linear, especially when it shows you what to do exactly when you possess someone=A little priceyThe Bad Stuff-Combat seems very unnecessary and kind of a nuisance.

												I will make this one very simple for you: Do you love collecting ♥♥♥♥? I mean, really REALLY love collecting ♥♥♥♥? Is all you ask of a game that you push a button, hear a pleasing jingle, and see the ""X out of Y"" counter increment? Because if you do, you will love this game. And if you don't... well, let's talk.Murdered is the tale of the tragically-named Ronan O'Connor, loose cannon of the Salem PD with nothing to lose. The game opens with him getting ventilated by the world's least-subtle-slash-least-catchable murderer, the Bell Killer, and you spend the rest of the running time trying to figure out why. Well, that's a lie. You spend most of the running time wandering around Salem, ghosting through walls and people in search of the 242 collectable knick-knacks scattered throughout the city. While some require your ghostly powers to reach or reveal, most are just sitting out, waiting for you to mash X on. Each one gives you a tiny snippet of backstory on the characters or Salem if you bother to open the menu, and a few let you hear a cute creepypasta story if you collect the whole set.If you're wondering why I haven't talked about the core gameplay yet, that's because it's dogshit. No lie, the investigations in Murdered are probably the worst of their kind. At every major story beat, you have a crime scene you need to investigate for clues to answer a specific question. Around the scene you'll find plenty more doodads sitting out for you to mash X on, each giving you a clue. After finding all the clues, you have to pick the clues that are the most relevant to answering the question at hand. This is where it all falls apart, because the expectations of the developers in picking answers ranges from so obvious you'll miss it to absolutely non-nonsensical. You're either going to breeze through every investigation or stumble over every answer depending on how well your brain is wired like the developers. Not that it matters either way, because there is literally no penalty for ♥♥♥♥ing up an answer, you just try again.So that's how Murdered plays, terrible detective sequences broken up by fits of collection-sperging. If that was all, we could flip it the bird and move on with our lives. The weird part is, everything else about the game is fantastic. The graphics are gorgeous and detailed, bringing the town of Salem and its residents (living or dead) alive. Sound direction is on point with satisfying effects and a moody, fitting soundtrack. The characters are charming and memorable despite what seems like every effort to make them obnoxious. Bad-boy Ronan is vulnerable and compassionate, manic goth-girl Joy is plucky and nuanced, and the entire supporting cast is interesting in their own ways. Your ghost powers also keep things fresh, allowing you to possess people to intrude on their idle thoughts, or poltergeist their appliances to freak them out. There's even some stealth combat against some pretty horrifying demons that's simple, engaging, and a welcome break from the running and collecting.I'm not going to pretend Murdered is a great game, or great for everyone. But even after identifying its flaws, I had a blast with it. Full disclosure, I watched my buddy stream the entire game months ago, and still had enough fun with it to play through the whole thing myself. A lot of your enjoyment is certainly going to hinge on the collect-a-thon aspect, but if you get into the story and learn to love Salem and its characters, there's a perfectly good game to be had here.

Product received for free
												The game is a supernatural detective thriller, where you play as a detective who was working at the Salem Police Department. The game takes place in the city of Salem, Salem is known as one of the most famous witch trials in the United States. In the game you are a detective who tries to find out who his killer was, Ronan. The killer is known as: The Bell Killer. The police has no clues, no leads and no links between his victims. In the game you have the freedom to explore the modern-day town of Salem. Except trying to find out who his killer was, you can also solve the other side quests from another ghosts like you. They also wants to know something, like: how they died or did my boyfriend cheated with another woman before I died?When you first play you start with a cutscene that tells you the most important things you need to know at the beginning. After the cutscene you fell of a window and tells the most imptorant things of his past. After these cutscenes you can play the game, but the soul of your body got out after the incident. So you'll be trying to get in your body, but after getting shot by seven gunshots at your chest. Your body dies except the soul. He became a ghost, because he tries to resolve who his killer was. Normal people can't see you, except mediums. But there are also purposes of becoming a soul, you have abilities that you never had before like. Some of them are: Teleporting, manipulating- and to influence people. Souls can only die by Demons, whoa are trying to eat your soul and you die also by a red/black creepy hole. My Impressions of the game:The game is really amazing and I had most of the times fun. The game looks in my opinion like The Wolf Among Us and L.A. Noire. In The Wolf Among Us you'll fall from a window too at the beginning, coincidence?The Pros and Cons.Pros- The game got good graphics- The game has besides a good main story, also good side missions- The game has trading cards- The game audio is well-madeCons- Sometimes there are too much demons in one room- The normal price is a little bit expensive This game is definitely worth a shot if it is discounted for a reasonable price.

												I can't recommend a game where the developer refuses to address a game killing bug for two years.  That tells me all I need to know about the developers.  This game has a bug where the keyboard interface simply stops working in the investigate window resulting in your having to manually shutting down the game and lose all progress since the last save point.  It is a known bug since launch and the developers have done nothing to address it or even respond to it.  Save your money and don't support developers like this.			"

												I can't believe how much I liked this game, considering all the negative reviews it got. It's like some bizarre mix of Condemned, LA Noire, and Ghost Trick. The only combat you're exposed to are simple exorcisms, and the rest is investigation, story, and mystery. The only down side is that it doesn't run so well at times. Entering new areas make you lag & stutter on any setting I tried (and I spent about two hours combining different settings). If you can have a little patience while it chugs a bit in new areas, then you're in for a treat. I would have paid for this (won it in a contest), but I wouldn't have paid full price. Worth a grab if you see it discounted on g / 2 / a or greenman gaming, or even on steam if they get it £15 or lower. This is a really, really good game.			"

												Murdered :Soul Suspect is a refreshing new concept for a game and it sure does deserve a metascore of more than 60 % .Gameplay  7/10 Yes there is no real combat system , no hordes of various enemies , no grenade launcher  , none of that .But it was never meant to be a Resident Evil clone , it's more like a playable thriller /detective movie . You play a ghost ( Ronan O' Connor ) who must  who must solve the mystery of his own death and you have ghost like abilities , like mind reading , warping and you can possess humans and animals . Also you can collect various artifacts to uncover the city of Salem's dark secrets or uncover the backstory of the main character e.g.Finished the game in around 12 hours, so it's best to say it's kinda short . Story 8/10 Very unique and with a little twist in the end , like a good thriller .I won't go into detail , because this would surely spoil the story .Music  7/10 Okay , nothing spectacular . Just good background music and noise .Voice acting is okay too. Graphics 7 /10 The graphics are kinda outdated . They look more like  PS 4 /Sbox 360 . Character models are not very varied . You got like 4 different ones , only the main protagonist and important side characters are unique. Definetely a must buy if it's on sale . "

												Inspired by 1996 classic The Frighteners, Murdered fails to provide Michael J. Fox's film main value - FUN.Technically and visually the game is smooth and pleasant and if you're not planning on getting every collectable, you probably won't notice it's flaws. The gameplay is ridiculously easy and sometimes even silly. The puzzles where patronising and never prompted me to think.The mediocre story of the game is very well presented and can even surprise with the ending some unspoiled player. But everything in it, especially characters, is so cliche, that I wouldn't recommend the game to people familiar with the Peter Jackson's gem.Despite everything, I tremendously enjoyed possessing cats.

												I bought this game when it was on sale for only $3.00, so the price was not an issue for me - but now having played it all the way through I can genuinely say I would not have regretted paying $30.00 for such an enjoyable, atmospheric experience.Storybuilding was phenomenal - from beginning to middle to end, there was never a dull moment as I was deeply engaged the entire time. I grew attached to the protagonist Ronan O'Connor fairly quickly, especially as you begin to uncover clues about his past. I bought everything the developers sold me about the ""ghost realm"" and how it functions (such as there being consecrated ""obstructions"" that ghosts can't pass through - perhaps not the most realistic idea to some, but considering we're dealing with a video game, I found it to be a very reasonable and clever excuse to keep the player's area of exploration streamlined but not restricted). The way that one investigation would lead to the next felt natural and smooth. Towards the end of the game I started to grow fearful that I would be disappointed by the conclusion, but I absolutely was not. From start to finish the plot was well-thought out and brilliantly executed.The worst part of this game to me are the demon-hunting sequences. In all fairness I've never been much for destroying enemies, but even moreso than usual I found them to be an annoyance. Luckily individual demons follow their own path on a loop, but when there's more than one to an area it can become much trickier to get the timing right. Really, though, it just takes a lot of careful planning and mapping out your steps in advance.Otherwise, for negatives, the autosave feature is a bit of a pain because I had to leave the game up & running at all times until I finished. That is, you cannot save your game on your own time, the game chooses when to save FOR you. So then if you exit & reopen the game, you'll be started back at the beginning of the last area you entered instead of specifically where you left off. Also, there are some parts of the game where you have to select the ""most useful"" clue(s) and while I got most of them easily, there were a few where the logic was simply lost on me.The 38.9 hours I spent on this game only accounts for 1 playthrough - I know the average person doesn't take NEARLY as long to finish, but I'm a born-again explorer and spent a ton of extra time scanning the environment in every direction, every corner, every wall I could pass through and even revisiting areas I'd already been to in case I missed anything. So if you enjoy being thorough like me, it is possible to make this game last a long time which adds to its value.Also, there are multiple occasions where you can play as a cat. A+++			"

												So. I really wanted to play this game since a very long time. I usually play games for the story and I mostly play point and click adventures, I am to unpatient and unskilled for anything else.What I like:- great characters- many stories you can collect and listen too (that's great)- awesome storyWhat I didn't like:- the fights...they were awful, you have to sneek behind the demon and that execute him with some stupid quicktime event. There are a lot of fights. Story. Demons. Story. Demons. Story. Demons. Demons. Story. As soon as you get some clues and you now something important, they just pop out of nowhere!!!!! They're evrywhere!!!! And they're at least three in each area.It would be a really really great game without these stupid demons. I hate them. There the reason I don't want to play it a second time. - It's very short? But that's okay, I got the game 50% off.I would recommend it, without the demons. Why is there no maybe button by do you recommend this game? "

But it turned out to be a barely finished game. Repetitive as anything, and the ""combat"" was a waste of time and should have been better implemented or scrapped. I would stay away from this game and save your money. I know I regret buying it. At most I could see it being worth $10 on sale, but no more. Trust me.			"

NOIRE"", you will love this Game, its pretty similar.Pro:StoryGraphicSkills (manipulate, mind reading and more)Fights are different (not always the same Button to press)Gamepad works well (XBox360)Open WorldQuestsTreasures  (you have to collect things to hear a unknown Story of the House, City ect.)City is never emptyA lot of Ghots, some need your helpA Pro is also, I didn`t had any bugs at this Game for now. What is realy rare since the new Games are sometimes unplayable and full of bugs, so that is a ++ for this Game.Contra:It seems a bit easy but maybe it will be harder later.No option for ""Easy, Normal, Hard"" gameplayVoices are sometimes hard to hear (to much echo)For now I give that Game a 8 of 10 Points. And can recommend this Game if you loved L.A Noire or Sherlock Holmes and other Detective Games.			"

												I gotta admit, I did not expect this. This is a unique game to be honest, because it surprised me, a whole lot.Imma do it like they all do, cus it's easier to understand reviews, so here:PROS:-An unique experience (for now)There aren't many games with it's concept being you die and become a ghost solving your murder (not really a spoiler, because the title spoils it all then), and this one is from my perspective done exceptionally well.-Voice QualityI can't say this is the best voice quality I heard, but the voice is mixed and put together, doing its job of keeping you on your toes, really well.-GraphicsFor the graphics maniacs and the graphicsrexics this is a meet down the middle. For its scenery and location, the graphics fit really good, since it gives this dark, mysterious vibe with a dash of detectiveness.-StoryOh. I absolutely loved the story (I haven't finished it yet (at about 7,5 hrs right now) but I know I'll be too lazy to edit this review, but I know I'll love it, so y'know), and some moments in it are a really well done,unique, some other important adjective of a moment. It's what it is - great.-DemonsWell, I wasn't really expecting them and I was scared sh*tless at first (still am at times ;D), but you get used to them. They offer a new type of enemy, but in an interesting form, making it something you probably won't see soon.-CluesThese little sons'a'b*tches are tricky but fo' real entertaining and I think that with time I started enjoying myself, when I got the answers to various questions about, ''why this happened'', ''why that happened'' and them putting them together, reminds me of Sherlock Holmes in a way, yet unclear to me. Checking IGN guides on where stuff is also happens quite often (often being almost everytime).-CollectiblesA lot of em. A lot. Which is good (?), but what's even better is, that at any time when you're in the town, you can go to various interiors (since collectibles are more or less spread out across interiors), and collect the ones you might've missed.CONS:-There aren't any consI enjoyed it, and the achievements make for some work, but you get the hang of it.Also, when this first came out, I was oh-so-not interested in it, but after time (time being about a year later), it was on sale and I said ''why not''.P.S I don't think I regret it.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect has a really cool premise. You're dead, a ghost, and you need to figure out who killed you. You can walk through walls, do poltergeisty stuff, read people's minds, woo!In reality, the game is mostly just wandering around surprisingly small maps, picking up a seemingly endless pile of collectables that serve as plot-filler and as a source for some spooky ghost stories. Also, since you're a ghost and still cannot walk through some doors (because the writers of the game wrote themselves into a corner) you need a living person to help you, and that person is one of the most annoying 15-year-old goth-teenage girls I have ever seen in a videogame. Yaay for cringe!Beyond walking around, touching things and reading people's minds, the only form of gameplay is avoiding and destroying demons in an oversimplified stealth minigame followed by a QTE. On the whole, the gameplay is not very engaging and solving some of the scenes flawlessly requires you to do quite a bit of the old ""what was the game dev thingking about here"" -mindgames.For a murder mystery plot, the game has way too few characters and the clues are too obvious to keep the game interesting.The game also seems to have a low number of voice actors, resulting in samey characters, and for some reason it also seems the game devs made precisely four character models: ""man"", ""woman"" ""girl"" and ""scary little girl"" (five if you count the demons) and went with those, so all the people in the game have the exact same body types and... It feels weird. Like they're all clones, milling about endlessly.All in all, Soul Suspect falls flat despite a cool premise and the game isn't really very enjoyable.Playtime: 6+ hours (Single playthrough)Ratings (1-10)Visual: 6Audio: 7Story: 4Gameplay: 6Overall: 5			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed  Murdered: Soul Suspect. Let me start by saying if you are looking for action, adventure, and shooting in a run and gun style look elsewhere (You don't shoot a gun at all, not even once). If you are looking for a solid game with a great storyline, reading, thinking, and a great mystery plot that keeps you guessing look here. Is the game scary? No I would not say it is scary, maybe creepy or atmospheric. The Dev does a good job of making you feel and realize that you are not among the living. There is the occassional disappearing ghosts and scary music but nothing like silent hill, dead space, or amnesia. The point of the game is not to scare or freak you out. It's to tell a great story and for you to solve a mystery.On top of figuring out your own mystery there are about 6-10 little side quests. None are very long, but they are each enjoyable and have a little story of their own. There are also hundreds of little collectables to find and to keep you busy. I am not usually a fan of finding and hunting for hidden objects; but for some reason in this game it does not seem to tedious or difficult. The style of game just seems to lend itself towards finding lost or hidden items.All that being said I would recommend this game overall score 8/10. I picked it up at 75% off and am not disapointed. I think for me even %50 off would justify the purchase. If it's on sale and you are a story driven gamer I would strongly urge you to pick this one up at some point.Oh and if that's not convincing enough did I mention you have the ability to posses cats, and you have a never ending cigarette?! Yup see I knew that would help you make the right decision!			"

YouTube™ Video: Murdered: Soul Suspect Review

			We take a look at the detective horror game Murdered: Soul Suspect! http://noobsthatplaygames.com/		

Remember those God awful Nancy Drew Detective games that were sold in the bargain bins at Best Buy and Walmart?...Well swap out adorable Nancy with a buff, gritty, tattoo covered, cop and you have Murdered: Soul Suspect. The game puts you in the shoes of a recently deceased detective who becomes trapped on earth as a ghost until he can track down his murderer and solve his own case. While the general idea of the game sounds very interesting, the gameplay doesn’t hold up strongly enough to back this promising premise.The game offers fairly solid visuals; they aren’t anything that will knock your socks off but they get the job done and provide an immersive, bone chilling, spooky experience. The game is fittingly set in Salem Massachusetts, but you won’t be exploring much of the town, as the game is designed to give you the false sense of free roam when it is in fact painfully linear. The game has a fairly expanse world, however due to the ghostly limitations the game places on you, you are unable to enter any buildings unless the door or window is already opened for you. This leads to the game being extremely linear, with what appears to be a vast explorable world turns out to be an empty ghost town in and of itself.The core gameplay mechanics consists of incredibly disappointing “Detective Work”. Detective work is conducted by entering the crime scene (which usually consist of about 3 fairly small rooms) and meandering about the room pressing the interact key on all the shiny clues that are sprinkled throughout the crime scenes. The game requires that you find a painstaking amount of these clues for each question and at some points you may find yourself spamming the interact key repeatedly hoping you will blindly click on the last elusive clue that you need to proceed, imagine it as the Easter egg hunt from hell. The game does introduce some fairly interesting puzzle mechanics on certain clues, such as word association deciphers where you are presented with an image and around 15 words and have to pick the 3 or 4 words that are most related to the image to crack the clue, however these interesting tidbits are never truly fleshed out to their true potential.Don’t go into this game expecting any form of combat whatsoever, the combat is almost nonexistent and consists of walking behind the demonic enemies and performing a series of simple quick time events to eliminate them. The demons themselves look genuinely terrifying and if you do happen to mess up the quick time event then you will be chased by the demon and have to escape by quickly transporting through preplaced ghostly rifts that allow you to hide until the demon gives up on searching for you.  The only thing this game really has going for it that makes it worth playing is the intriguing, twist filled story. The stories pacing is done very well and at times you almost wish Murdered: Soul Suspect was a movie rather than a game. The voice acting is pretty solid and one of the best aspects of the game; being such a story driven game it benefits greatly from making sure that it has some good quality voice acting. While there are many cut scenes, they are enjoyable and emotion filled. It’s just a shame that the rest of the game feels like such a grinding chore just to get to the next cut scene to watch the story unfold.Overall Murdered: Soul Suspect seems like it has so much potential but never truly takes advantage of anything that it has going for it. The game holds your hand through a painfully linear environment and offers absolutely no challenge or difficulty. The only thing that makes Murdered: Soul Suspect even remotely worth playing is the fairly enjoyable story delivered through the cut scenes. The game plays out like a very good movie with obnoxious, tedious, burdensome, gameplay in between. What seemed like a very promising premise wasn’t strongly supported enough by the overall weak puzzles and lack of difficulty.I would only recommend this game if you get it at a ridiculous sale pricehttp://noobsthatplaygames.com/ "

												I really don't know what to say about this game..I mean the story is great, the graphics are good and the voice acting is also decent and the area where you're playing in is also really well done.I personally don't really like the demons, I mean I understand why they are there but they are just kinda annoying, though they are super easy to kill and you can easily lose one if it happens to come after you.And sometimes finding those glues can get really frustating because some of them might be hidden really well.I paid about 7€ for it and I think it's worth that but I really wouldn't pay more than 10€ for this.So if you can get it for really cheap, go for it!

												Short ReviewThe Good:- great setting and very spooky atmosphere that pulls you in- the story is very good and will keep you attached till you reach the conclusion- solving puzzles and putting clues together is really fun- graphics, sound and voice acting are all great ( if you want more than 30 Fps you have to change that in the .ini file)Nuetral:- there is no combat in this game, i liked that but i guess some people won't like it, the only combat in game is just sneaking behind few spirits and kill them in a quick-time event- the length of the game, it will take about 8 hours to finish and most likely you won't be playing it again unless you missed some collectables or achievements i really enjoyed this game and i hope more people would give it a chance and don't listen to critics' reviews.

												I had this in my library for a while. I just played it because it was already on my HDD and I wanted something to entertain me while other game was downloading. Aaaaand I just finished it in one go. Completely ignoring freshly downloaded game.Game is locked at 30fps, which is a little bummer, but I got so into it, that I did not want to waste time to look for a way to bypass it. It's a good detective story with mechanics that don't hold you back. It was fun to uncover secrets, recreate crime scenes and gather clues. If that isn't good enough, there is a ton of side stories. A lot of other ghosts, who are trapped in the same place as Ronan. Interactions with them felt so authentic, I genuinely wanted to help them. Places with their own history. Great amount of detail was put into it, it's coherent, it's interesting. And best of all, voice actors did amazing job. I think they contribute greatly to the I fact I liked meeting other characters so much. I found myself slowing down the investigation just to roam around and find out more about the place I was in, see what other ghosts are doing. I even feel like I want to go back to find everything I missed.Overall, it's a great title. Good story, fun mechanics, exploration, voice acting. Now I feel bad that it took me so much time finally play it. "

												I like this game. Yes the combat with the demons is simplistic, be glad it is cause any lumping of more than one will kick your b*tt. It's challanging. Nice atmosphereric. Good story. Sort of semi open world after a bit into the story, so that's nice. Wouldn't pay full price for it but worth snatching up if it's over 50% off.			"

												7/10.   If you enjoy story driven games, this game is a good fit.  A well fleshed out storyline with excellent voice acting, cinematics, and live action gameplay.  I didn't find any silly time wasting quests or non-sensical gameplay at all.  		I had no idea what the gameplay would involve, and it's an interesting mix.  You are a detective who becomes a ghost and needs to find out who killed you and why. So, lots of investigations.  To me, the investigative parts of the game are most like a hidden object game.  You walk around a small area and find the clues to solve the inquiry.  Very straightforward.  There is a bit of action involved with demons to dispose of. You play stealthy while sneaking up on them.  Later in the game, it gets more intense with up to 4 demons simultaneously and can be a little challenging to sneak up on.	There are clues, letters, special bad guy info bits, historical parts, human mind reading, and some side quests too.  I didn't enjoy these as much.  They just aren't interesting and add little to the game story.  Mostly, the human mind reading gets boring to the point where I stopped bothering to read minds one third of the way through the game.  There are also ghost stories to unlock.  Some are good, some are so-so.  I liked the asylum one best.  Those are optional and require going through the rooms quite a bit more to search out hidden unlockables.  If anything was time wasting, that was it.  But, it's not mandatory.	To me, the story dragged up until about halfway.  After the cemetery I was hooked and kept on playing without any lack of interest. Before then, I was getting a bit bored, so slow gameplay and story up until midway.		Two things that stood out to me that may interest others: 1) It's not an adventure game.  Don't go in expecting an adventure game of any kind.  This wasn't clear to me from the onset until I had been playing a bit.2) If you like action or fast paced horror games, this may not be for you.  This game is laid back, not terribly scary, and takes it's time.  More for the detective story fans IMO and fans of hidden secrets.	The ending is good and don't watch a vid of it please or it really ruins the experience.  If the initial half of the game wasn't so slow and a bit scarier, I would probably rate it higher. Still a good game, lots of love went into it, and it's optimized very well too.  "

												I liked the game upon the moment demons appeared in the game and it became a demon hunt and hide&seek game instead of a detective game.  This was basically the thing for me to stop playing, those demons and 'that' whole gameplay felt like it belongs in an other type of game.  Other than that the game was promising and good quality. Sadly a thumb down from me.Edit: To clarify a bit further, I didn't like the whole hide & seek thing with the demons, it changed the gameplay from the first +1 hour that I did like. It began as a cool detective story with looking for clues and observing things. When the demons becomes a part of the game it turns into a surreal horror stealth hide & seek game and it puts the whole detective lore and theme to the background. Besides that, even the 'ghost reality' is far a part from  the normal after life reality you normally see in games/movies so that demon gameplay made it lose connection to that 'detective' atmosphere for me. When I bough the game after looking on the store page and seeing the trailer I didn't expect that gameplay. I didn't refund the game and might give it an other few hours as the design and graphic quality was good, but yeah, I would have skipped this game if I knew the gameplay would be like that.			"

												This game narrowly scraped through with a positive rating. Soul Suspect has a great aesthetic - the ethereal world interactions/ghostly events look great. There is a fair amount of freedom and exploration of Salem available but the game still feels incredibly linear. There isn't much deduction or detective work and the 'combat' serves more as a hindrance than an excitement. I still gave it a positive review because I enjoyed it enough to play through 100%, but there is zero replayability. If you're interested, I recommend picking it up on sale.			"

												An excellent game. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a story rich detective game. Your character is murdered at the start of the game, and now as a ghost he has to solve his own murder by following the trail of a serial killer.The game takes place in a dark urban setting, giving the atmosphere of danger and hopelessness the entire time. In addition to the crime mystery element, it also includes a lot of paranormal concepts, particularly relating to ghosts and mediums. The story is paced very well and does not drag out or include any filler content. Every area you visit is another jigsaw piece in the grand scheme that helps you get closer to uncovering the mystery behind the string of murders happening in town.Most of the gameplay consists of you searching around the area for clues and then putting them together to finalise on what happened. Most times it's pretty straight forward. It plays like a point & click game, but without overly convoluted puzzles. Everything you find makes logical sense. In addition to that, there are also other collectibles scattered in each level, each of which provide some information on characters or the town's lore. Some also let you uncover special hidden ghost stories, which is a nice reward, as some of those stories are pretty chilling.At times there are stealth sections where you have to avoid being seen by soul-eating demons. They add a bit of challenge to the game, but overall I was not much of a fan of these sections as they felt unneeded and often got in the way of you exploring. A lot of the time the demons would come in groups of 3 or so, meaning you'd be spending some time trying to figure out how to get past them. You can't fight them, and the only way to kill them is via an execution from behind, if you're brave enough. Gladly these sections were few and far in between. Most times you'd only come across 1-2 such sections per level. So if this aspect is putting you off, I'd still recommend to try the game, since most of the game is spent putting together the clues.Don't expect challenging gameplay or anything of that sort. This is a story-driven detective game at heart, and I think most critics who have slammed the game have missed this point.I'd highly recommend this game if you like games about solving murder mysteries or anything with a dark, gripping plot for that matter.

												Well, nearly made myself to finish it. This one started as a promising story-driven atmospheric paranormal detective about ghosts and investigation of death of your own character while actually being a ghost: walking through walls, spy on citizens, possess them and read their minds, do stuff in yout favor, collect evidence and make conclusions... Yeah, very promising. And this all also wrapped with pretty good graphics with good visual art and detail, good score and voice acting. As a fan of atmospheric story-driven games I was really looking forward to Murdered: Soul Suspect. And at the beginning it was good. But it failed for me eventually.The catch? - Dull story and mainly boring and repetitive gameplay.The story had a good potential but authors were unable to pull it off. Eventually it slipped to so trivial and dull finale, that I began to regret for my wasted time. Authors tried to fill it with the notes of Salem's history, Ronan's personal story and love tragedy, but it didn't worked, something was missing and the main story felt... shallow. The ending of the game is plain ridiculous both gameplay- and storywise.Throughout the game there is almost no progression in gameplay: after you learned how to discover things, collect evidence, solve the case, possess people, counteract the opponents - you'll do it till the end with almost no diversity or new meaningful mechanics. The investigation part is very dull and making conclusions is not particularly interesting - especially when doing it dozen of times.I know this might look silly to blame a story-driven game for lack of gameplay (it's not Dear Esther though), but we're talking about the game with also sort of 'open' locations for your discovery, where you can freely go and explore it, solve some side-quests (they are also trivial and repetitive). On the contrary, I never got bored in story-driven Spec Ops: The Line, even though it's mere third-person shooter, because of its constant progression in fascinating story, locations design, changing circumstances, obstacles and gameplay.In Murdered, besides that you can wonder around the locations doing side-quests, looking for collectibles (fun at first, become boring and useless later) or navigating your way from point A to B there are a lot of times during the second half of the game when you forced to revisit old locations and more often than not run through it from one end to another.The locations themselves are not very distinctive and did I mention you can't run through every wall? At first that part with looking your way through the labyrinth of real and paranormal walls was OK, but quickly faded since they all looks the same, same blurred bluish corridors all the time. This is an unnecessary protraction of the game - you simply getting bored and 'felling off' the game's reality and story.The enemies? Man, I wished that part of the game's 'features' never ended up in final version. It's just wrong, unnecessary, badly designed gameplaywise, and... oh, that console port QTEs... Quickly press W+RMB / D+LMB... etc.No, I don't recommend this game, because I don't want more games of such quality of game design.			"

												You play as Ronan, a freshly deceased cop who's trying to figure out his own murder. Because of this unfinished business, he gets stuck between hell and heaven, wandering in the world of living, invisible to the naked eye, only able to interact with human mediums. As you learn the ropes of this supernatural world, you start collecting clues and putting all the stuff together. The ending blew my mind, really. Some people may say it's too short for a fully priced title but I think the time was appropriate for the told story and filler missions would only ruin the ambience of certain urgency in the air. Perhaps this should have been something episodic, one murder story - one episode. But we all know that is not happening anytime soon.Murdered: Soul Suspect has an awesome story and I enjoyed uncovering the case in L.A. Noire-ish style. Playing as a ghost? Very nice, not a common thing in games. Possesing people, reading minds, communicating with mediums? Sounds awesome, seems like these devs are taking the ghost business seriously. Being a murdered detective investigating his own murder? I'm sold.These ideas are great but something went wrong and they were kind of poorly executed. My guess is the developers either got lazy and told the janitor to put together some pieces of the game because they were busy actually working on the main storyline and side quests that really got some love. Or they were rushed by the greedy publisher, what do I know. But some details are just like whatever. Details so strong in numbers that I couldn't just ignore them after a while. For example: Reading minds of the entire city - extremely few lines that keep repeating even between different people. Musicless, slow, unskippable credits. Overdesigned main protagonists while other models are just copy pasted - even in the story, totally destroys the overall pleasant graphics. Some controls are weird, whole main menu and ""press start"" while using k+m. And a few more.Even though I needed to vent my frustration with this game in here, it was mostly because of the lost game of the year potential. (For me) I still enjoyed it. There is nothing like it on the gaming market and I very much like originality. Mixed with amazing story makes a great, underdeveloped game. I feel bad to rate it 6,9/10. I'd smack the people responsible for the lazy/rushed details.			"

												THIS is what's wrong with the industry. Reviewers and websites want to insure business, They do that by ""pleasing"" the majority, and they do that by guessing what the majority would and wouldnt like and let that bias affect their own review of the games. This works sadly. But that is also why many who would enjoy a game such as Murdered Soul Suspect won't even try it. Sad reality.This game doesnt have ""action"" it doesnt have shooting, stealing cars, and destruction. And it is better for it. In its own genre and taken as a separate entity, this game shines.It is a mix of old school adventure atmosphere, smartass detective work, it is slow but it is great. The Story keeps you interested, the acting is top notch, the relationship between the main character and his partner is akin that of Booker and Elizabeth in Bioshock Infinite. This game is fun and funny, ok in some areas and amazing in others. It is a relaxing experience, and one that should be experienced. You'll feel like you are watching Ghost (the Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze flick) at times, at others it'll be a Tex Murphy experience.It is a fun and enjoyable experience, I am more than glad I bought this game, and if this genre is your cup of tea, you will be quite glad you had this adventure.

												n my humble opinion:Played 2-3 hours and it feels like a Point and Click, just more sophisticated. It also feel a little bit like someone is holding your hand and telling me to look behind the door or under the bed, wish was a bit more complicated or more cerebral. At one point at I was at loss because a clue was not interactable until you solved something else, and didn't thought of trying again - which is tpical of Point and Click. Personally I love Point and Click so it is not a deterent for me, it's all about the story and its twists.There isn't anything revolutionary but there is some original concepts where you you can possess someone and read their mind or influence them, demon trying to get you though so far it was really easy to defeat them and not scary a bit, I think they are scared of me at this point Now the story is intriguing and I hope will develop into something original and surprising and maybe a lil scary ? Will definitely play again tomorrow after some sleep .. oh and after work (darn).			"

												I don't know how this game has so many people liking it.It's nothing like LA Noire, everything in this game is a forced QTE, the stealth parts where you take out the demons are awful and feel out of place, and the game is just all around boring.In LA Noire, I felt like I was actually solving crimes and interacting with the evidence and finding out who had done the deed. In this game, it's all done for you. All you have to do is press E and it will go to some cinematic crap and just put it down in your ghost journal which will fill up with crap you will never care about and utterly just be a cluttered mess of writings about stuff not pertaining to the fedora man at all. The console port is just awful, it's so hard to control the UI and the camera when hiding from the demons will ♥♥♥♥ you up and utterly get you killed, and oh god, the demon fighting is just horrible, absolutely horrible.1/10 for fedorasPlease, do yourself a favor and save your fifty dollars.

												It's linear mystery, horor, detective, hidden object game with no decision making and with some frustrating controls at times. What you are doing most of the time is running around and collecting things and stuff. Then you move to new location and start over again. Pros: - voice overs- semi interesting story- it's short- lot of collectibles if that is your thing- there is one likable characterCons:- controls (bad object targeting)- stealth passages- detective work has no impact- there is not much of the gameIt is not a bad game, but you miss nothing by not playing this one.

												Oh dear, I'm dead - pretty much the main mechanic of the game.  MURDERED: Soul Suspect starts out with the death of the main character who goes by the name of Ronan, a local Detective investigating a murder. It's not the most unique premise out there, but it handles it in such a way that makes it intriguing, but can ultimately fall a little short thanks to the way the game itself is structured. A Clean Cut GhostWhile Ronan and the other main characters look pretty good and the environments themselves look pretty top notch, I can't really say the same for the NPCs. I noticed they re used qutite a LOT of NPCs without as much as trying to hide it somehow, which can definately break the immersion this game tries to set in with it's dark and drab setting. The lighting is top notch also, and really helps give the game the sense that you're in some ghostly world in an already dark setting.The environments, as stated above, look very nice and I really like how they themselves tell their own stories because of the way the game places just random objects in an area. You can have, for example, a train inside a museum to let the player know that in the past, where the museum stands now used to be a regularly used train track and the game's chock full of little things like that, as well as it uses flat and ghostly images that sorta just fade out as you get closer to them to help accentuate that you are indeed in a ghost world. It's really good. Even greatly influencing the atmosphere the game has, is it's sound design. You can occasionally hear ghostly wails in the backgrounds, and the game is very light on music, only really playing it during tense moments like when there are Demons around, it knows when and when not to play music and it handles it pretty well. Voice acting is pretty par for the course, Ronan and the main characters sound decent, but some of the VA's for the NPCs can be pretty hit or miss. Solving the Case   Murdered: Soul Suspect  is pretty much a glorified adventure game. The very linear structure the game has is done to help accentuate the story, making it feel actually more like a 3D Visual Novel than an Adventure game. The game is pretty much divided up by ""stage"" sections and an overworld (The Town). Each ""Stage"" has it's own set of collectibles that, once fully completed, gives you insight into a usually very dark and grim backstory into those items you collect as well as having it's own story section and more in general collectibles. What can feel detrimental to the game's pacing, is the way each stage is handled. It always ends up being a straight up Move from Point A to Point B sort of ordeal while exploring through every nook and cranny to find collectibles. As far as mechanics go, the game can sometimes feel a little messy since there's no map to indicate an overall layout of the area you're in, thankfully, no one area looks exactly like another so it's usually easy to tell when you're going the wrong way - you can also walk through certain walls, and railings on stairs but not all of them. You can also posses people and read their thoughts (random NPCs) but sometimes they just end up repeating lines, other times, for story purposes, you can posses people to get over obstacles, you can posses objects to cause noises and distract NPCs and you can influence people to think about certain events by using clues. Clues are items you inspect during an ""Investigation"" phase which can be used occasionally only during said investigation, or sometimes long term throughout the whole game. That being said, the only challenge this game does bring, is some half baked stealth sections involving ""demons"", creatures that live to suck out a spirit's soul and re-kill them I guess? These sections can be very tense thanks to the musical cues and the great wails they tend to do, but they merely serve to give the game padding and often can break up the pace of the story. The demons are also never used in any meaningful way to complement the story.   Murdered is a pretty fun and short adventure game that can clock you in anywhere from 4-12 hours depending on how much you decide to focus on collectibles. There's no real punishing methods the game uses outside of demons catching you, it has a fairly uneven pace that can otherwise dull a pretty nice Murder thriller story. Pros + Amazing atmosphere   + Great sound design accentuates further the atmosphere  + Decent Voice Work + Interesting and fun story  + Fun mechanics that makes you feel like a ghost.Cons - Uneven Pacing  -  Game is on the short side, story alone clocks in at about 4 hours or so  - Repeated use of NPC models can break immersion.  -Demons serve no purpose to the story and are used as padding.Overall, if you can pick this game up at a decent price range, it's definately worth a playthrough if you enjoy Murder/Crime Thrillers, outside of that, this has very limited appeal.

												I will try to make this review as short as possible, and list a few pros and cons.You play as Ronan O'Connor, an ex-convict that found love and got married to a police officers sister, Julia. Which got his reputation cleared  criminal records hidden  and allowed him to be accepted into law enforcement. Shortly after Ronan marries Julia, she attempts to stop an argument between two men that didn't end too well, she got stabbed by one and dies in Ronan's arms. Shortly after Ronan loses his cool and basically turns into Batman.  He goes in alone and tries to stop the Bell Killer, but is quickly over powered, thrown out of a window, then shot seven times.  now you are now stuck in limbo and have to find out whom killed you before you can go into the vast world beyond. This is where your story begins.Pros. Great voice acting, almost no loading screens (I only got 3 during my whole play through.), a great cinematic story (7 hours of gameplay for most users), a very pretty game. Graphics don't always matter, but I still have to throw this in.Cons. Almost no real fighting in this game.  The Demons are too easy. , very linear story, little to no replay value, cliffhanger ending. I never liked them.TLDR. It's a great game, if you like playing a cinematic story. The $20 price tag may actually be worth it, but I always go for game when they are on sale or in a bundle. Got this little gem in Humble Bundle myself.			"

												I have been looking forward to this game since it showed up at E3...In which i honestly say it was not worth the wait or the money. It took me about 7 hours to beat the game with 33/48 achievements when i was not even trying to. keeping things short, the only major flaws would be that investigating can become a ""click on everything"" moment due to it being difficult at times to tell if something is useable or a pointless object, and the gameplay gets incredibly repetitive after a while and feels like it was added to keep players busy.....Also, the big ""twist"" to the end of the game wasn't a very good one, so please consider waiting for it to drop in price before a purchase.

												Seeing as how the only 2 options here are ""Would Reccomend"" or ""Would Not Reccomend"", I will give it a thumbs up, but whether or not I would recommend this game to you really depends on who you are and, more importantly, what you are looking to get out of a video game.Are you looking for a challenge?- This game isn't for you.Are you looking to shoot some bad guys?- Nope, keep looking.Are you looking for action of any kind?- May want to skip this one.Are you looking for something story-heavy?- Getting closer.Are you looking for a mystery with some twists and turns along the way?- You can definitely scratch that itch here.Are you looking for a game that is basically a movie that you are more involved in?- Ding!  Ding!  Ding!  You found it!This is a lot like a Telltale game, but with less dialouge.  Its basically an interactive story.  Think of it like Heavy Rain with a supernatural twist.  The story itself is really not bad, and the ending was, in my opinion, pretty clever.  There are definitely worse ways to spend 6 hours.7/10P.S. - Don't go into this expecting something as good as Heavy Rain.  I really enjoyed Murdered: Soul Suspect, but Heavy Rain is a hard act to follow.			"

												There are many flaws with this game, still I quite enjoyed it (at a discount purchase).- There are way too many collectibles (nearing 200). You need to collect a random number of things to unlock a story (e.g. 14 chainsaws). That's way too many and after collecting the necessary collectibles in the first section of the game I never did it again.- Sometimes you need to collect clues and the prompt for them are very precise. You need to angle the camera in just the right way which is very annoying for a game that's focused on that.- You need to battle demons in this game. It's by far the worst part which consists of teleporting between safe spots and trying to sneak up behind them. When I had the opportunity, I just ran by them to enter the next section.- It can be hard to find your way. This is partially because you can just walk through walls which is disorientating. At a later point in the game you learn to teleport which makes it even worse.- There are stealth section in this way where you need to guide your human partner while distracting guards by ringing the phone and other poltergeisty stuff. I didn't mind this is as much since it's easy and you don't seem to be able to fail (which I consider a good thing).- You sometimes posses a cat and run through vents because... you're in Salem?- There are (near) instant death traps and you die so incredibly fast, it's kindof funny? They just consist of black spots on the ground and are easily avoidable.I enjoyed this game the best when I ignored the side stuff and just focused on the main case where you're trying to solve your own murder. I bypassed the demon battle sections as best I could. The cat scenes were ok but unnecessary. The stealth sections where you guide your partner was kindof fun. The main meat was the investigation stuff where you collect clues and try to figure out what precisely happened at the crime scene. I completed this game in 5 hours which is probably not worth it at full price but it was for me and I found that the story didn't drag.Go buy it in a sale!			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is supernatural detective adventure thriller game where you are playing as detective Ronan. He got murdered by a Bell Killer a primary antagonist and now he need to solve his case as a ghost.Pros:+ Great main character, Ronan is really likable and unique.+ Voice acting is really good+ Enjoyable graphics, as long as you play with V-sync+ Good story and atmoshpere+ Lots of collectibles + As a ghost you can walk through walls, read people's minds etc.Cons:- Short (main story for around 6 hours)- Combat is poor, if you can even call that combat (you basically sneak behind the enemy and do fast QTE) - Only one type of enemy- Most of NPC's are just clones/duplicates- Only 4 optional quests ( to finish them you need like 5-10 mins each)Maybe they're expecting it to be a fast-paced action game or something like that which it definitely isn't. It's a detective game with an interesting story and characters that draws you in. It's also pretty novel in that you're playing a criminal-turned-detective's ghost who's trying to find the identity of his killer. You spend the game collecting clues to figure out your killer's identity while stopping along the way to help out other lost souls in little sidequests where you figure out how they died so they can pass on. There are also lots of collectibles, some of which provide background for the story, such as notes left by the main character's wife, or that unlock stories about unsolved crimes connected to hauntings. The mood the game sets just enhances the experience, being creepy and immersive.Overall, this game is a lot of fun. Story is great, voice acting is well done. The story is a pretty good detective tale, with everything falling satisfyingly into place at the end and a few neat twists. There are only a few drawbacks: sometimes when you posess someone and listen to their thoughts you'll hear the same thought in different people; the parts where you have to sneak behind demons and take them out can be a bit tedious. There's a lot of repitition and it seems like they re-used a lot of stuff.The other drawback is that the game is a bit short. I finished it in 7 hours, and if you check out my achievements you'll see I didn't get 100% completion. I did all the side-quests and found as many collectibles as I could. You could probably stretch it out to 10 hours if you wanted 100% completion which seems totally possible in a single playthrough.In short, if you like story-driven games, or mystery/adventure games then you'll probably like this game. If you want this game to be a gritty shooter, then go buy Max Payne instead, because you won't get that with this game.TL;DR: 6.5/10, fun detective story, don't expect a lot of combat/action, very short.

												Ronan is a criminal-turned-cop who is killed by the mysterious Bell Killer. Playing as Ronan's ghost, investigate a series of crime scenes (sometimes with the help of teenage medium Joy), searching for identity of the killer. Many supernatural elements come into play – ghosts, witches, demons – and some  flashbacks of the witch trials are pretty gruesome (drowning, burning, hanging). As the investigation progresses, you'll explore a graveyard, an apartment house, an old mansion, a police station and of course the obligatory asylum level. While the game world is small, it is open, with the ability to just wander around the town of Salem. It's a gloomy place – the game occurs entirely at night – but is well-dotted with NPCs and collectibles. Obtaining collectibles can unlock other stories (usually brief, narrated cut-scenes), and some NPCs will provide side-missions. There's a decent amount of stuff to do, but most collectibles were easily found as I explored the town or a level. Investigations require exploring a a crime scene, finding evidence (“Press E to analyze”) and sorting through the collected evidence (“Press Q to conclude the investigation”). Walking (or later, teleporting) around as a ghost feels fun;  Ronan can walk through walls, possess people (mind-reading), and turn on random stuff to mess with the townsfolk (poltergeisting). Especially cool were the impenetrable “ghost walls” from past times that can block Ronan from exploring – or even provide new hazards (watch out for the ghost train!). Oh, and you can possess cats, too. This is actually crucial to progress through several stages of the game.The demon sections, though, dragged the experience down a bit. Demons will sometimes spawn after completing an investigation. Their existence does have a crucial part to play, and they're easy enough to defeat with a little patience. Given that this is a supernatural tale, it would be rather weird if demons of some kind weren't in the game, and having some stealth sections added some variety to the gameplay.  But after a while the demons became annoying distractions from the story.And the narrative is where Murdered: Soul Suspect stands strongest. There is a lot of backstory to be found about Ronan and his wife (via collectibles). Sometimes collectibles are merely annoying, but they are worth pursuing here. Jason Brooks (as Ronan) and Cassidy Lehrman (as the medium, Joy) provide stand-out vocal performances. The graphics (Unreal 3) are great – murky and dark. Jason Graves' score provides a classic horror-story undertone. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a well-crafted detective game with a few quirks that holds its story aloft as its best attribute. If that sounds good to you, then go ahead and get this one.			"

												MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT is not a bad game & not really THE BEST game either. The characters & voice acting are great/impressive. The story were actually good & mind blowing, but what ruining it is the ending made no sense.Like this guy said on a story discussion : *WARNING SPOILER ALERT* ""If abigail can possess and control anyone, why didn't she simply possess the father in the church to kill/capture joy the moment ronan led her to her? (she was following him probably the whole game as seen in one scene) or when she was interrogated in the police station? or when joy was sneaking through the police station or mental hospital, there were so many cops or nurses which abigail could have instantly possessed to finish the job (as seen with the 2 poor cops at the end of the game)or when she can summon these demon hands at any time, why didn't she finish ronan earlier?""   source [www.playstationtrophies.org] This games have so much potential with their unique atmosphere & the devs should've add more things to make it perfect/complete but too bad they didn't add too much things. (this is the reason why it's not really THE BEST game) The combat system is too simple. Bugs/Glitch can occur everywhere & anytime. But in the end, I still enjoyed it & I'm glad I played this game.

												Despite an interesting premise and a promising start, Soul Suspect suffers from some significant problems.The game is good at setting an atmosphere and the lead characters background is interesting - if a little hard to belive.It struggles, however, when trying to be a computer game.  The puzzles are interesting, but their internal logic is inconsistant - you end up having to think like the designer.  Unfortunately, it's obvious that each of the puzzles had a different writer each time, meaning that every time you approach a problem it's sometimes hard to know what it is that is being asked of you.  This is a problem as the game has a rating system that punishes you if any mistakes are made.  The punishment is only the loss of a points on a system that doesnt seem to have any real bearing upon the game at large, but it is irritating to feel that failure is more due to an inconsistant mechanic than a mistake.The worst aspect of the game is undoubtably the action sequences involving the hunting or avoiding of deadly shades, trapped between the our world and the next.  Sound intersting? In practice, it's not.Unfortunately, these sections feel rushed; a knee-jerk attempt at introducing some action into the otherwise slow pace of the game.Not a bad idea in principle, but the problem is that these fights vary little from the start of the game to the end.  The shades don't do anything other than follow very short, pre-set paths which occasionaly pass something that may be used to distract them.  The ""challenge"" comes from the fact that as the game progresses increasing numbers are put in your path - not exactly imaginative. Mistakes result in dashing about trying to hide from the shades that hunt you more aggressively, which would make these sequences more exiting, execpt that some areas seem to lack an appropriate number of places to hide.  This leads to you dashing between the few available, never quite caught but still unable to shake the shades off.  In the end it becomes nessecery to let the shades catch you, just so you get the opportunity to try again from the start.I  would often find myself wishing that I skip these sections so I could get back to the story, which is far more interesting.  If - of course - you ignore the feeling that the check-list of horror settings is being almost audibly ticked as you progress from graveyard to asylum to church, etc.It's worth a go if you see a deep, deeeep, discount on it but I wouldn't recommend it at any other time, the feeling that the game is constructed of hedged bets is just too prevelent.

												Ronan a criminal turned cop dies and becomes a ghost. Now he must figure out who his killer is with the help of a young girl, and the abilities to investigate crimes and possess people. He can't move on until he finds out truth....This is a really fun horror game without the jump scares. It does have a creepy atmosphere, but there's nothing particularlly scary about it. I loved how the invesitgations are set up, how you can search for clues, and I love possessing people to hear their thoughts. If you gather enough clues you can even hear ""ghost"" stories, and even help fellow ghosts. The stories are well written and thought of. I don't usually like going around collecting items, but I didn't mind in this game so much. The only thing I would possibly change in the game is the annoying demons that you have to avoid and banish. I realize that most people like their games to be challlenging but I hate ""stalking"" my enemy waiting for the perfect moment, only to foil it and have to restart from the latest checkpoint. Overall, the game was entertaining, medium length, and well written. Investigations are fun and not too difficult. Its more of a good storyline game above all else.			"

												I am recommending this game as I personally like it. I will give my reader a huge WARNING before purchasing : the game play isn't super immerse, it's more the genre of the game. The controls/abilities are a bit limited. The game itself, however is comparable to a beautiful painting. Murdered : Soul Suspect follows a detective who was pushed out of a window and then shot repeatedly as he was trying to get up. The (bell tower) killer is an unknown assailant who has been attacking random individuals. After being shot, the detective is now a ghost and has to figure out why he's still roaming the Earth and hasn't passed on.You are in third person view of Ronan (the detective) and have identical controls/movements (not actions though) to Hitman Absolution. What is probably the most outstanding feature in the game is the fact you can walk through walls. Of course, you cannot walk through any wall you wish. This will be made obvious with a solid white fill on a few walls or other ""ghostly"" objects will appear that will not let you pass. None the less, something completely different I have never been able to do in any game I've played yet. The combat is quite minimal. I should add if you are looking for a cop fighting action game, this isn't it. The most you'll be able to do is pull lost souls from demons that roam nearby areas. Demons are to be approached from behind when they cannot see you and soul extraction happens when you press RT. Again, not much to it but there is a rush associated with it. If you are seen, you will be chased and killed. You may hide in ""ghost remnants"" (small ghost cracks in levels) and can fast travel to each one in an attempt to evade the demon. There will be other obstacles in your way such as demon traps in which you require to possess a person while they walk across it. Being a ghost, you are able to possess literally anyone. NPC's will have general thoughts you can read while certain characters (usually for missions), you're able to ""peek"" (see what they're seeing) or ""influence"" (use a clue to job their memory in an attempt to force an action). They made jumping/possessing person to person quite easy to do. The game even goes as far as allowing you to posses a cat (with a purpose of course). Over time you will acquire new skills such as teleportation, poltergeist (setting a printer or phone off) and detect mode which lets you see through walls. You may also run in game but you do not have the ability to crouch or jump. Most of the time you will be free roaming until you come across a crime scene. Once in investigation mode, you will be looking around for clues and sometimes need to hit RT to reveal the complete evidence. Often times than not, you will need to find certain clues in order to find other clues (meaning intervention or possessing others to get a complete answer). Once you think you've found enough, you can conclude your investigation with the clues you've found. The game basically follows one crime scene to another and in between there are small side quests. Doesn't really sound appealing (which I'm sure is why people don't like the game) but it appealed to this extremely picky gamer. The visuals are pretty good (not super fantastic but good). I have an AMD card and have tried to get more than 30 FPS. The graphics really resemble those of Hitman Absolution. They do have a lot of symbols and ghost writing that does pop up which enriches the environment. The sounds are suitable to the environment the game provides. It's not super over the top but I would assume it's hard to imagine what a demon would sound like. Overall, I enjoyed the game. I think it's cool to play through but leaves the player with no replayability. I got this game on extreme sale in a bundle. I would say it was worth it for what I paid. I would highly recommend people do their homework before buying such a game. I like to play it, you may not due to it's lack of actual gameplay activity.

												Very interesting game, you are the detective and was killed by this ""Bell Killer"", you are about to know his identity by investigating(solve the puzzles). There are also side quest you could solve, every puzzles has a good cinema/movie on it. There is also combat in the game and the demon souls of the death world are your enemies. You have to remain hidden to these ghosts in shadows before being able to pounce out behind them to kill them by pressing a few key.  Demon souls are only destruct in your path, they aren't really anything to rave about as they become very monotonous as you progress in the story.in the end, it's really disappointing•the game is short•not replayableIf you want to get all the achievements, you'll need to get it in 1 whole game straight, if you ever finished the game, you can't replay it back. You'll need make a new game and find all the objects.Buy this game only on Sale/discount.			"

												The game is good, worth a shot, but still hardly worth the full price considering that the main story can be completed in about 7 hours. Yeah, there are side quests, but there's little motivation for anyone to waste time trying to complete them, except maybe for achievement hunters, since they're not connected to the main story too closely. Since the combat, the action part of the gameplay is very simplistic (just attack the enemy from behind and press some key combinations), the exploration part could've saved the day if it weren't just as simplistic as well. Anyway, if you're like me and care more for a good story than sophisticated gameplay, Murdered: Soul Suspect will be a nice experience.Pros:- the story is complex and captivating, the ending is pretty unexpected- the visuals are nice- good voice acting- interesting characters- nice noir/dark atmosphere- interesting basic concept (some kind of ""walking dead"" but not the ""usual"" kind of ""walking deads"" :)  you die right in the start and then just play as a ghost  )Cons:- kinda short- the gameplay is quite simplistic, in terms of both fighting and exploring- there's only one type of enemy to fight- horror is hardly a good keyword to describe it, there's pretty much nothing scary about it- the full price doesn't seem very reasonable considering the gameplay's length			"

WARNING!
Avoid it if you're looking for a game.
Get it if you're looking for a visual detective/supernatural book. This game is heavily story driven. It's so story driven that you can't even call it an adventure game!Monkey Island has more gameplay in it than this game.All you do is walk around and press X where needed (I use an Xbox 360 controller). It's not a third-person action/adventure game or hell, it isn't even a ""detective"" game like L.A Noire (another epic game) is.Nope, in here you just walk around and press X. You don't solve puzzles, you don't shoot, you don't...you don't do anything but walking, really. It has an ""open world"" sandbox city that you're free to roam but there's nothing to do in it. Sometimes you stumble on a collectible and press X. That's all there is to it. The minimap shows you where you need to go in order to ""progress"" in the game and well, just walk on over there and you get a new cutscene.Other games that lack in gameplay, such as The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us, let you choose what to say or do in certain situations. This adds some replay value to both games.However, the story in this game is linear and you can't make any choices. No choices at all!So why am i recommending this game ?It has a good story! A very good story! If you don't mind watching a movie with a controller in your hand or sitting in front of your PC/laptop then this ""game"" is for you. "

Firstly, I have to say that this game has a great story and is the most unique one I’ve played in a long time.I never played a game where you play a ghost and the protagonist is dead from the begginging. The primary goal of him is to find his murderer and be released from his ghostly form.Secondly, the setting is pretty believable and rich in detail. There are so much innovative things I only can scratch the survface of it in my review: The trains of thought to find out the truth are pretty great depicted: There are a bunch of clues which you have to find and then you have to find the link between them by clicking the most important one or figure out the right order of events. Only game of this type I played was The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. You can posses people and read or influence their minds to get clues. You can posses cats (This is pretty cool) and climb/jump around in trees. The atmosphere is pretty dense and unique. Outstanding voice acting!!!!  Great story telling (This is no action game!).  The only action element of this game is that you get hunted by demons. This is sometime kind of intense but nothing extreme scaringThe only thing which spoils this game a bit are the darn bad technics of this game. You notice every second of playing that it’s a console porting. You can’t change the assignment of keys. For that’s unacceptable: sprinting on shift..WTF?! Another thing which bothered me is hat you can‘t disable 30 FPS lock with V-Sync enabled. So it’s either ""tearing"" or no FPS over 30! Sometimes there are some strange glitches, too. One time I was falling into nothing (see the video at the bottom), the other time there was no background sound and one time I got stuck in the menue. Only solution was restarting the game. Well, sometimes, when you go back to the desktop via Alt + Tab, the whole game just gets stuck to your screen and the only thing to do is restart....Again!All in all, a great and very unique game with some technical glitches and confounding factorsPS: Thanks to khay★jeet ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/blaybleet/ ) for gifting me this game!!

												It was a bit boring in the beginning, but it gets better once the story starts to pick up. The gameplay is kind of repetitive, so you have to either be in it for the story, or you have to like the whole LA Noire crime solving thing. Overall, Fantastic game. I'd wait for a sale, though, and it'll definitely be worth your money since it's relatively short. Also, if you plan on going for 100% completion, *DO NOT LEAVE THE MUSEUM BEFORE YOU HAVE COLLECTED EVERYTHING!!* You can't backtrack there, and I ended up needing to replay the game just for the 2 collectibles I missed there.

												-All you do is collect things, walk around and watch cutscenes. There is no combat system. You can sneak past demons in some instances and control a cat to reach certain areas which is frustrating and annoying. You can't fail solving anything because if you mess up pointing to the wrong evidence or clues the game allows you to try again until it's corrected...so what's the point on solving anything if the game does it for you? The story is the only thing that made me want to continue playing or walking through literally. In the end it wasn't worth it.			"

												7.5/10Overview: AdventureWatch the movie Ghost, replace Patrick Swayze with an ex criminal cop and replace Whoopi Goldberg with a teenager, throw in some supernatural elements and you have the basic foundation for Murdered Soul Suspect. The gameplay is a mixture between investigating areas for evidence and stealth sections. Investigating areas is basic, you walk around until you get to item/object you can interact with. A few times you are given a list of clues and must select the right clues in order to advance, as far as I can tell there is no way you can fail any of these. No matter how many times you get it wrong the game will always let you keep choosing until you get it right. As a dead man you have a few tricks which you can use, such as possessing people to influence them or causing disturbances in the environment to distract people. The second portion of gameplay involves stealth which can be a bit frustrating at times but it does help break up the gameplay a bit. Every once in a while you will have to hide from demons, luckily, if they see you, you can easily run and hide in hiding spots until they decide to stop searching for you. Sneaking up from behind and pressing the appropriate buttons will kill them. The game is also littered with collectables that give back-story to characters or provide history of the surrounding locations. There are a few side quests but they are very basic and amount to nothing more than investigating an area until you found everything. This is not an action game. If you enjoy point and click adventure games you will find this somewhat enjoyable. The problem is this game offers very little puzzle solving and the entire game can be completed in 4-6 hours. I do however commend Square Enix for publishing a game like this.   "

												This is going to be a bit of an odd review.  I DO recommend the game when it's cheaper - just for the experience, but with several caveats mentioned below.  Before starting, I should warn you that this is a HORRIBLE PC port.  It has been designed for the gamepad, and any game that opens with ""Press START to continue"" is always a bad omen.  It's a frankly horrible and frustrating experience with keyboard and mouse (it really hasn't been converted very well).  I resorted to my trusty XBox 360 gamepad to save myself the headache...Sorry about the long review, but for tl;dr, just scroll to the very last para..._________________________When I started this game, I was pretty wowed by the concept.  Think back to the late, great Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldburg and the film Ghost and you basically have the plot of this game - sorta (no Demi or Whoopi-alikes, and no Swayze personality).  You play Ronan, a rather bland, non-uniform detective who is murdered in the opening scene (great start!) and in that typical way (of ghosty-films) his soul rises out of his body and he looks down on himself, realising the very worst has just happened!  And it's a BRILLIANT start!  It really is.  I was so excited that I couldn't wait to throw myself right in the game.  Cops soon arrive at the scene of your murder, and there are priceless scenes like someone leaving the building in front of you, happily unaware of a ghost who slips out right behind them and then vanishes.  Absent-mindedly, you walk THROUGH a cop who suddenly shudders as you pass through them, and if you have a rumble feature on your gamepad, it too mimics that shudder whenever you pass through objects and people - fabulous!  I thought: ""this is going to be GREAT!""So, you're a ghost.  You quickly learn that you are to remain behind to catch your murderer (Swayze theme again).  You learn that you can 'possess' people and read their minds and, on occasion, influence their decisions.  You can enact 'poltergeist' activity by making phones ring, switch on desk fans and the like.  You can even possess a CAT!  That alone is beautifully done - exceptional animation and effects.  The game style is closer to a 3D point-and-click adventure with some action parts, and it's mostly themed around collecting clues and solving the ""Bleeding Obvious""...  There are side missions to collect odd objects, like 9 rifles, or 5 boilers (yes, boilers) and if you collect them you will be told a very short spooky story about that area.  It's a novelty, but it could have been improved by some quick-time spooky movie to watch instead of listening to a blind reading.What started really well soon goes downhill and I just want to scream about the potential this game doesn't quite reach!!!  It could have been so BRILLIANT but it fails pretty much throughout.  At the beginning, instead of flailing and wailing and trying to understand what's happening, you instead walk off happy as anything to just be a ghost as if you'd been a ghost for YEARS!  You died literally two minutes back but you're already fine with everything - off to do ghost-business right off the bat!  Remember Ghost where Swayze had to learn to touch things, who encountered other ghosts of very different kinds, who badly wanted to make contact and to find his way back to life and love, dear Demi Moore?  Ronan is not like this at all.  He's now suddenly and happily engaged in not only his own quest, but solving everybody else's problems - everybody else being people who have presumably been ghosts for much longer than our dead-2-mins hero who can magically solve problems (find clues in the immediate vicinity) of these other apparently clueless ghosts who are much more experienced ghosts than he is - surely.  But they're all stupidly incapable and you must gather the clues blatantly laid all around them.  Not good for a concept, but it's doable (he's a detective after all, and maybe only detectives can spot clues on the ground around the victims' feet...).Moving on, you will see ghostly apparitions continually.  The vast majority just do nothing.  They're not even animated - just 2D transparencies that shimmer to fade out when you approach the image.  At first, the early ones are done well, like a girl in a shower who simply vanishes whenever you try to get closer, quite eerie and clever.  But after a while you realise they're all merely static images that don't even move (very obvious when looking top-down at one from a stairway) - and often it's the same image repeated.  It would have been SO much better to have some background ghost characters just lurking around, some of them sad or lost, some angry or frightening - all of them at least moving.  Your ghostly powers are okay, though the game explains to you right away that external walls are ""consecrated"" so ghosts can't pass through those (ergo: the boundary of the map!) but what is SO disappointing is that, beyond the opening scene hardly anyone ever reacts!  Switch on their TV, ring their phones, WALK through them!  Mostly, they notice absolutely nothing unless you reach a case where you must distract people (in which case they react predictably to you triggering a phone or vending machine).  Mostly though, your haunting torments make no difference and cause no reaction.  It would have been such a greater game to be given a moral choice whether to haunt or help, but for what it's worth you hardly need to be a ghost really.  It's a shame - it would have been FUN to cause some haunted-house things.   Possessing people soon loses its fun too when you realise that most characters only have two lines to 'say' (always about not feeling safe or the murderer being at large), and only a couple of times do you influence them.  No Watch_dogs random thoughts here!  It gets to be boring after a while.You will encounter 'demons' for the action bit - nastly brown/orange things that will 'suck up your soul' (ie game-over - go all the way back to that ages-ago checkpoint...) and demon-holes (where they come from, of course).  You can hide from the demons in areas where past spirits wandered and left a timestamp (ie a blue foggy area vaguely shaped like a ghost).  You become invisible from demons when you are in these, and you can hop from one ghost-space to the next until you are behind the demon, and you can dispatch it with a quick-time event that, in a split second, expects you to register a thumbstick direction AND a button press.  As for the demon holes, they're nearly all just used as pathway blockers to force you along another route.Finally, there's Ronan himself.  It's impossible to empathise or feel this character at all, or sympathise with his story.  A dude in a fedora, cigarette permanently hanging out of one corner of his curled lip and a cocky swagger, and as is video-game fashion, he's the gruff, growly white male as always, but not even likeable.  You will uncover snippets of his story and wonder why on earth he was ever a cop at all.  It's difficult to be interested.  He should have been confused, angry, frightened and determined, but he is for all the world like a regular guy just sauntering along to the corner store.  ________________It's a relatively short game, and for the full price I really can't recommend it, but if it comes down to a more casual-game sensible price (the $15/$10 mark) then yes, I would say it was worth buying just to experience where the game NEARLY goes, because it is such a clever and original idea!  It's worth it just for the opening 30 mins.  It's worth it just to possess the cat, for crying out loud!  But it's not a game with any real replay value, and it's certainly not LA Noire ghost-style.  It should have been, and it could have been epic, but it misses the mark in every direction and fails to deliver on everything it hinted at when the game first opened to your murder scene, and that's such a shame.

												While the storyline of the game and the characters of this game provide an interesting few hours, the actual gameplay itself is not the best.

												I like this game for the reason that it's a sort of interactive movie, like you're the actor running around the movie scene, being able to do whatever you want. I like the storyline, it's interesting as well as full of action. You can do side-quests, which I enjoy a lot because sometimes you're just done with the main storyline. It's also fun to help every ghost to find what  is holding them from ""the light"" and bring them there. What I don't like about this game is that there are a few bugs, where sometimes the sound doesn't play in cutscenes but it does in the rest of the game, but this is easily fixed by restarting the game. I bought this game in a Steam Sale and it is definetaly worth it's full price, and works on 60fps even on my pretty medium pc.			"

												This game is fun for the first couple of hours. Over time though it slowly gets boring and you can't really do anything with your new ghost powers that really makes them fun to have. You don't even get the really cool powers tell about half way through the game. Overall I can't put into words the amount of disappointment when I finished the game. I dont feel like this game lived up to the hype it had going behind it. This game is not worth the $29.99 it is labeled at. If you find Murdered: Soul Suspect at least 75% off. Go ahead and pick it up for some short fun. Just because I did not find it to my liking doesn't mean you won't.Overall I would give it 6.5/10 - It is a good game but I think I was expecting more from it.			"

												Despite having its flaws, Murdered: Soul Suspect is quite possibly one of the most enjoyable single-player games I've played this year.The Pros:· A unique story that feels like a combination of Silent Hill and L.A. Noire, and the beginning does a great job of introducing you to its atmosphere. · You start at the point where Ronan O'Connor (the game's protagonist, of course) starts the hunt on his murderer, the Bell Killer. This makes you feel like you know as much about the afterlife as Ronan himself does and creates a sort of connection, right from the get-go.· The town of Salem is pretty small, but its yours to explore... and it's worth exploring. Tons of side missions and collectibles can be found in Salem, and the eerie mood that constantly lingers around really immerses you into Ronan's role.· The atmosphere is incredibly unique and satisfying. The ghostly white glow around certain object make the bridge-world connect with the world of the living. Seeing the flickering souls of dead children sitting next to a swing or a dead corpse dangling from a tree by its neck is oddly disturbing and makes you feel uncomfortable, which a bridge-world should.· Pretty cool characters. Ronan is your typical rebel-turned-cop tough guy, but his tattoo's reflect his life and the sins in it, and the detail to him is quite impressive. Even though he's partially see-through (because you know, he's a ghost and stuff), the orange bullet holes give Ronan a distinctive look from the other ghosts in Salem.The Cons:· The mechanics feel a bit underused at times. As a ghost you could be able to do so much more, like possessing and controlling others for example. Sure, you can influence people and read their minds and control a cat (10/10), but it limits the player.· For a detective game, it doesn't really require too much thinking. You have to find clues and connect the dots (sometimes those dots connect in an unlogical way), and that's basically it.· The NPCs are mostly the same. Salem doesn't have many people walking its streets, but two of the same people might be sitting a few feet from each other. Plus, they have the same thoughts, which is weird. Like freaky weird.· The combat is there, but its simplistic and repetetive. You hide in lost souls, sneak up to a demon and quickly rip him apart. It's satisfying and it even feels as if you're helping those tormented souls, but it's just too much of the same.The Visuals:· Most of its atmosphere comes from the visuals. Ghostly white silhouettes and detailed environments may not look next-gen, but they're stunning none the less.Final Verdict:· Murdered: Soul Suspect sure has its flaws, but it's a unique and highly enjoyable experience and easily one of my favorites of the year. 8/10			"

												Not a bad game, don't know why reviewers are hating it.The game is pretty good. Not a masterpiece of course but it's a decent game. It has a pretty unique gameplay, nice graphics, interesting characters and a good story. You play as a dead detective's soul and you must solve the mystery of your murder and find the killer to be able move on in other world. But story is not only about you, it's much more and the ending is really good. The biggest downside is the price. It's not worth the full price. But at 80-90% off it's a good buy. The game is only 7 hours long, no replayability value but those 6 hours are really fun.			"

												Classic case of good idea, bad implementation. I found several glitches on my first playthrough, most were graphical, but one where it was a bit stupid. There were several instances of objects(both real, physical objects) were clipping together. At one point part of the storyline is hindered by a locked door, however you can simply pass through the wall and open it while the NPC still believes the door to be locked with their hands inside the door's model trying to get it open. Many issues also exist with the port to PC. I'll be honest, I am a PC gamer and haven't played this game on console, however I expect game ports to be decent. On numerous occations I found myself in one of the game's many menus and interfaces with my mouse unable to correctly interact with said menus, I then had to go keyboard-only with the arrow keys to navigate and exit the menus. Character animation is also a bit sub-par, especially when characters are talking. Unfortunately all of the bugs and glitches I've noticed could have been fixed with patches yet have not been.If you insist on playing this game I highly recommend a gamepad.			"

												You can play a cat! ...For that matter alone the metacritic score is a joke. ...The storyline is thrilling, it feels a bit like The Darkness. The charcters are expressive, especially the main character and his companion are likeable which is comparable to The Last Of Us. The Settings of the different places deliver a good variety and some of them remind me of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines and some of them of Alan Wake. The cases are exciting but the way you solve them is just as repetetive as in L.A. Noire.Its really one of the best games i played in a long time (e.g. i prefer it to Bioshock 2, which i played right before) and it's definitely not too short if you explore the town and absorb all the stories and sidequests. And its also remarkable that you don't fire a single bullet in this game and you don't even miss it and realize that good games don't need to be about killing thousands of wretches.			"

												Murdered is a detective game with unique gameplay ideas such as the ability to walk through most objects. It's set in Salem, which is the American city known for its brutal witch trials, and this historical aspect is fully incorporated into the game.The script writer clearly has done a great job because the game has you hooked until the very end, making you want to figure out what's to happen. The main characters are explored in depth throughout the game, with their stories and relationships being interesting and relatable, which can easily allow you to establish an emotional connection to them and even make you tear up. The good voice acting definitely contributes to that as well.There are some genuine horror elements to this game, although it's mostly about exploration in the dark, noir, relatively small but detailed world with a lot of paranormal elements.

												It's closer to the visual novel rather than the adventure, but it's ok and setting is pretty neat.It's the rarest example of the game i realy wished to finish lately.Detective mechanics are undeveloped, but your score doesn't change anything, so you can simply retry your answer with no consequinces.Rudimental stealth takes so little time it's no obstacle to the story and has no way to grow into something complex.The story's good, the world's neat, it's a good time killer. The only drawback is you can't return to the finished areas to huntdown achievements.			"

												I will premise this by saying that I have beaten the game and have all of the achievements completed. The metascore has you doubting, doesn't it? Well, don't let it. This game has some good and some bad, but the good wins in the end. First thing's first. Play this with a controller. I started this game with my keyboard/mouse and I immediately hated this game. The controls are a joke. The FOV is WAY too sensitive (even after changing settings). I was almost ready to give up on this game when I decided to try my Xbox controller. This choice saved the game for me. The Bad- Crappy save system. You can browse the discussion boards and find people have issues with the autosave. You can't make your own save and have to rely on it... trouble is, it's not that reliable. (you can however copy the save file from your steam folder. You have to look up how though. I think it's titled 233290. So it's a random number, not a name)- Limited action. This game is a walk around and talk to people and find clues game. There is only one type of monster (demon) and you have to sneak up behind him to banish him. So it's all about timing. I think there are probably less than 20 of them in this entire game. - Collectables. There are a lot of clues to find. Some are necessary, some aren't. The necessary ones will be located in a limited area, so you can eventually find them. The other collectables are scattered around and you have to find them. This is going to either be great because you love these kinds of things or frustrating because some of them are hard to find. Each one tells a little bit more about the story and it's characters.  The Good- Cutscenes. There are a lot of them, and I found them to be good. I know some folks hate games with lots of cutscenes. If that's you, look elsewhere. - Story. I really enjoyed the story. It's a dark mystery that you just can't help but want to solve. I felt the characters were engaging. They felt real and their struggles were believable. - Easy achievements. You will get most of the achievements without trying. There are some for collections too. Those ones I used a video walkthrough to help me find them all. - Simple investigations. So your job is to get clues and solve a mystery. This isn't the kind of game where the answer makes little sense. You collect as many clues as you can find and pick the answers based on them. You can solve a mystery without finding all the clues, but I recommend you find them all. - Time. This game didn't take long to complete and to get all of the achievements. Overall, I would recommend adding this to your wishlist. It's a really good game as long as you know what you are getting into. If you want an action packed game, this isn't for you. If you want to sit back, relax, and listen to a really cool story -- this game will be perfect.			"

												""Killerman is Killerman""MURDERED: Soul Suspect is the Square-Enix murder mystery blockbuster that you never knew you needed in your life. Or afterlife. Whatever.I'm writing this after just having finished the main storyline. I'll admit I didn't grab all of the many, MANY collectibles in the game, nor did I ace every investigation with full badge power, whatever that's even supposed to mean (it was never made clear by the game as to what exactly those badges represented, if anything), so maybe I didn't get the full experience from this title. However, I'd like to make a few notes on what little I did have the pleasure of going through.Much as I'd like to ramble on at length about specific instances ingame, I do think it's poor form to spoil what passes for a plotline in this game... So I'll try and keep this as general as possible.The investigative portions of the game are awful.The stealth/combat sections that break up the investigative portions are also awful.The interrims between major investigations, where you wander around town picking up collectibles and taking on side missions, are probably the most fun... But, ultimately, still awful.No, really. Investigations are broken up into two main parts, one being ""pixel hunt around the room for CLUES(tm) that are either lying on the floor or on top of a table"", and the other being ""poke inside someone's brain with the correct CLUE(tm) so that they give you the last CLUE(tm) you need to open up the next area"".Pixelhunting is pixelhunting, and for the most part it's pretty tame. The game's nice enough to not require you to find every piece of evidence in a scene before coming to the correct conclusion, but it's also sneaky enough to WITHHOLD further evidence from you until you make a kind of halfway-conclusion. If this sounds confusing, good.It's the parts where you possess someone and try to kick their memory into gear that things get truly miserable, because I made the dreadful mistake of trying to be clever and think of actual clues, evidence, or events that might stand out in someone's mind and unlock a larger memory. No, that is not relevant to an investigation. What's relevant to an investigation is squeezing into someone's head and straight up asking them ""WHO IS KILLER?"". Need to work out where the suspect went? Just activate the clue ""SUSPECT GOING SOMEWHERE"", and you'll get all the answers you need.It's not so much an exercise in deduction, so much as a quick test to see if you remember why you're in that particular room.  Failing this repeatedly doesn't seem to have any greater consequences than not unlocking some achievement, since you just keep trying things until you pick the answers that the game wants.Okay, so the investigations aren't all that great... But maybe that's all worth glossing over in the face of an intriguing and suspenseful story?No, not really. The story is laughably predictable. I spent half the game waiting for the main characters to get on my level regarding an understanding of what was going on.  There were several points where the character was making a frustrated rant about ""What does it all MEAN?"" and I just sigh heavily because he's literally just read exactly what it all means.  But, hey, I guess that's what you get from the kind of genius who carefully steps over fallen debris as an incorporeal spirit.Also, yeah, psychics are totally normal and work with the police department, our first encounter with the police force shows an officer picking up forensic evidence and wearing it on his head and the creepy standoffish ghost girl who absolutely doesn't look exactly like Wednesday Addams is TOTES INNOCENT, BRUH.Oh, right, I mentioned stealth sections... Well, they're bad. Just... Stupid. Unfun. Not even difficult, they're just tedious and blatant padding with completely inexplicable mechanics. Why can our ethereal hero Mr. Fedora McGruffinsmokes banish the zombie goasts by giving them atomic wedgies? Why are they there in the first place? What even are they? Why do you have a set number of floating ghost smears you can hide inside of by rapidly bouncing back and forth between them? These and many more questions add to the mysterious mystery of MURDERED: Soul Suspect.So, yeah. Do you like sleuthing and crimesolving? Don't get this game. Do you like stealth and/or action? Don't get this game. Compelling story that makes sense and doesn't leave half of the everything unexplained? Yeah, no.Do you like backtracking repeatedly through cramped environments to pick up a staggeringly huge number of tediously hidden collectibles filled with unrelated backstory? Well then, this might very well be just the game for you!...but even then, wait for a sale.			"

												I don't know why the Metascore is so low, this game definitely deserves better. I have seen good metascore on games that sucked and vice versa such as in this case. And so obviously, Metascore is not a thing to be trusted.As for the game, this was a really good and intriguing game. The things you find such as books or side stories which have lots of text to read to follow up but you can skip on it, this is one of those games that made me want to read every bit of text i found. The back stories for characters were really good, the plot is fine and unique, the animation and the artstyle is spot on. The voice acting for all the characters is damn great. This was like an adventure game following a story with no action or shooting as one might maybe expect. A game with story and interaction that not even for a moment felt boring or made me want to rush through and end this.The gameplay in this consists of looking for clues and collectibles and evading demons at times while in the story, you're chasing your own killer trying to solve your own mystery from one place to another. This is a free roaming game and gives you the liberty to roam around the Salem city which is filled with collectibles and cats and other spirits whom you can help and set them free by solving their deaths.As for my recommendation, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone even mildly interested in this. This game might not appeal to everyone, certainly not to ones looking for an action/shooter. 7/10.			"

												Just finished the game.  My thoughts are as follows:GOOD:Unique concept with some cool abilities - passing through walls, posession and teleportationTONS of collectibles reveal more of the characters' backgrounds as well as history of the cityDecent voice acting, characters with believable motivationsInteresing blend of spirit world into the material world.  Ghosts are a nice touch, add to atmosphereEducational - I learned a lot about Salem and its history and locations - and enjoyed learning it (gasp!)BAD:RepetitiveEasy - no difficulty setting, no incentive to replayGraphics are.... meh.  I know it's nighttime, but expect LOTS of grays, browns, and fogDEMONS! Not scary, not difficult, just.... annoying.Fairly short.  Took me longer because I was hunting down collectibles, but expect much shorter completion timesif you're just following the storyUGLY:FOR GAWDS SAKE!  Would it have hurt to include an in-game map???  So.  I liked the game, yet I can't help but feel it doesn't really live up to its potential.

												This is a great game. As per usual, the crappy port from console tends to hamper the gameplay (damn you ubi/enix). If you are alright with paranormal themes and a L.A.NOIRE-esk detective game -- then you're going to enjoy this one. I've played about 1 hour and I find it fascinating and interesting both from the story's perspective and it's got me thinking about the afterlife in a logical and interesting way - it's neat.I encountered a glitch, my character walks / shudders at half/quarter speed as if he's walking in slow motion. He runs normal with L.Shift but goes back to painfully slow without it. I'm about to restart the game and see if it's fixed.So far I'd give this game 6.3 / 10Story                               7 / 10Mood/Emotion                6 / 10Graphics                          6 / 10Sound                             8 / 10Gameplay Mechanics      7 / 10Technical Mechanics       4 / 10 *glitchy movements			"

I don't see a reason why it got so bad reviews from everything I've seen.It plays great, the story is great and if you have brain the investigations are pretty easy.There is a lot of stuff for collecting too, so you can one time just run around and just discover stuff, make some side quests or just play around while transforming yourself into a cat that is just sitting on the street.You will also meet some demons, but that's nothing, just be careful they scream a lot.I've bought this for much chapter price in my local store and i would recommend anybody who's interested to wait for sale.

												It's like watching an episode of CSI (minus the puns) except you're the smart ♥♥♥ peicing things together. It's pretty fun and the entire enviroment is filled with scary stories. Finding collectables is easy and upon completion of a set you get a decent horror story narated to you. Which is the kind of vibe the entire game has, horror. But not scary horror, more like classic horror.It's an extremely easy game, ""combat"" is just pushing the right button to kill an enemy that only floats back and forth. Gamepley is heavily based on looking for clues and picking out which ones are the most important. Which is refreshing because solving the mysteries requires a type of thinking that I haven't seen in any other game.Extremely well made, but too short for its price when it doesn't really hold much of a replayability value. I would reccomend it as a $25 dollar game, maybe $30 but not at $50. I was fortunate enough to get it as a gift.10/10 GameplayUnique puzzle playEasy as MarioEnjoyed myselfTL;DR: You're an invisble man that can run through walls but no one is ever naked.			"

												so i just finished the game, thought i check out the user reviews and was suprised they are so positive.First off, i dont hate the game, it was entertainig. But not more then that. When the game starts a girl explains you the game mechanics and tells you you can go into every building, which is not true. you just can go into a couple that are related to the story. The investigation part is pretty fun looking around for clues. and killing demons is also pretty fun, but also very easy. Other then that you're just looking for easter eggs. and when you hit the final chapter you cant return to look for them. It's pretty easy to figure out who the killer is since there are like 5 characters. I admit they still gave me a little suprise something i didnt see coming the entire time. Finished the game in 13 hours.To some it up: I'm happy i bought this on sale. Fun game when you'rew bored, but dont spend 30 euros on it because you'll be disappointed.			"

The story itself isn't that long, but the added collectibles did add to the playtime and back story.Very simple gameplay. Killing demons was okay, seemed out of place though. Finding clues sometimes became annoying.In regards to the final boss fight, it was more annoying than anything.

												Wonderful game! A great story, good plot, decent acting and pretty graphics add up here nicely! The game is a bit short (about 8-10 hours finishing most things). Combat, if you can call it that, is a bit odd but very unique. An in-game map would be nice. And the system specs are GROSSLY overstated. I played this game maxed out on my laptop with an AMD A10 5750 APU (2.5GHz quadcore) with a 2GB Radeon 8970M and an Xbox controller on my 55"" HDTV. All things considered, if you are more about story and less about action this game is excellent. Take your time and explore. Experience the stories and histories. Sadly, having said all that, I can not in good concience recommend this game at $50. It's WAY too short. But if you find this gem on sale or at a reduced price ($25 or less imho), then snag it! I promise you, you won't regret it ;-)			"

												Loved, loved, loved the game... You run around solving different aspects of a serial killers murders, and along the way you collect items, for little side stories, on your own account... Sometimes it is not always obvious, how to solve some of the problems, but for the most part, if you follow the story and read the clues, it's quite logical... One part, I was not too fond of, myself, was the demons you have to fight... Mostly because I panic, and press the wrong buttons, and then I have to do the whole thing all over again... And cause they freak me out! I'm a panicky person, so the whole fighting/stressful aspect of that did not really tickle my fancy... The map you're running around on, is not that big, to be honest, but because you can run through walls, and into every little nook and cranny, the world just seems so much bigger... And of course there are the cats, that also helps make it bigger... (When you play it, it will make sense) Story wise, it was a good story... Sometimes a little predictable, but when it was important, it wasn't... Or maybe my story predicting skills failed me for once... In all accounts... Great game... I loved it...			"

												I got this game when it was 1st released, completed it and then didn't play it for nearly 2 years.. Until now, on my second play through I really enjoyed it.. Again. As people have said the puzzles aren't difficult but I think that's the point, you search the crime scene for clues and then piece them together, plus there's no punishment for getting them wrong either, you can just try again, so it just makes a good casual play through.The developers did a very good job with this game, I was hoping for a second, but I doubt that will happen now, with the company gone and all, unless another developer gets the rights to it.I would recommend this game (perhaps when it's on sale, if your not sure) although I had no problem paying full price for this, and maybe not everyone will play it again, but after reading some positive and negative reviews I thought I would, IMO the second play through was better than the 1st!

												This is a game that needs to be approached with the right mindset in order to be fully and properly understood. Murdered is an interactive movie with a story straight out of the best 90's b-reel supernatural horror flicks that dominated the video store of an era long bygone. The challenge level is extremely low but the mood and nighttime atmosphere the game evokes are hard to deny. Destined for Steam Sale must-buy status, Murdered is a game that will engage you and take you back to a simpler time, even as it celebrates its b-movie heritage and paper-thin actual gameplay.			"

When you play it, it feels a bit incomplete, as if other features were planned but they couldn't get around to embbed them in the game. What is here is interesting and solid. I specially enjoyed the stories hidden in every level that you have to unlock by finding the collectibles.			"

												A really fun adventure game where you chase a notorious killer through Salem, but have many side-missions where you help ghosts move on by revealing what happened to them and why they were dead. Ontop of that, the collectables you find reveal horror stories based around Salem and they are VERY creepy and sound like real horror stories with the first one with the water boilers sounds similar to a real creepy story I heard about recently.The detective parts are somewhat irritating with what peice of evidence contributes to being ""Most Relevent"" and some it feels like ""Duh"" much like the main story where half-way through I already realised what the Killer's target was before the character did, but the twist at the end I never saw coming, but should've.Highly recommended for any fan of the paranormal and detective TV series too.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a nice game, that perhaps falls short if you are a fan of Square Enix games.Graphics and animations are smooth, complemented by a nice interesting story with characters personalities that make you get to know more about them.Nevertheless it feels as if it did not achieve its full potential. The combat feels shallow and the final developments of the whole story do not add up nicely as one would expect.Overall it is a nice game, which I would recommend and definitely give IMHO a 8/10.

												★★★☆☆ - ""Worth a try, but only on a discount"" PROS:- Original idea, hooray. The idea behind this game is totally unique and works pretty well. You play a ghost and you solve murders and eventually yours with other things along the way.- Good solid storyline which is easily transferable to a decent horror movie.- Collectables everywhere.- Nice dark supernatural style to the game.- Cool demonic enemies which look as if they're inspired by the Azkaban guards from Harry Potter.- Ghosting through walls and the use of shadows in the environment is pretty well done.CONS:- That ending, what a disappointment. In terms of story it's fine but the gameplay for the final level is just pointless.- Gameplay overall just lacks something, I mean the combat is a little lame and became a chore having to evade demons and its a little quick timed in a way.- Detective? Okay so clue finding isn't as good as it should be. You uncover shadows, look at objects which just describe what they are and then he tells you what's happened. Sometimes it's okay cause you have to link to a past clue using initiative but it's far too easy! - Possession isn't utilized well enough, you can occasionally influence people to uncover something or use them to move, or peek at things but this is too few. Most of the time you listen to absolutely pointless thoughts which are uninteresting, irrelevant and sometimes repeated.- Graphics, not sure if I think they're up to AAA scratch. Whilst it's a good port this is no biggie.- Too short with no replayability. Yet it can be found cheap.VERDICT? Decent game if you enjoy mystery games like me, I enjoyed the story, game play is easy and not too thought provoking so suits a casual gamer but this game could have been a lot better for sure.			"

												I absolutely love this game and it's concept; the idea is unique and very interesting. Can easily call this game one of the best ones I've played of it's genre. Tremendous atmosphere of the game, quality of graphics, characters and the story itself are truly fascinating; though it can get pretty harsh at some point, especially that crazy plot twist at the end and some murder scenes. >.>  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes detective games with a good story, supernatural elements and a tiny bit of spooky things.

												I just finished the game in one and a half sittings. I'll go through some pros and cons that I came across while playing through the game quickly.Pros:+The concept. It is so extremely interesting and makes for some great gameplay. Ghosts are cool. :3c+The deduction segments. You actually have to remember stuff that you uncovered way back in order to advance, which I found enjoyable and realistic. No need for a pen and paper though as the game keeps your previous discoveries and presents them when needed.+The collectibles. These withhold some very interesting bits of history, character development and a few creepy-♥♥♥ ghost stories.+The setting. Salem is a town with an extremely rich and interesting history, which is uncovered through the collectibles.+Cats.Cons.-Character development. There isn't any really, apart from some of the collectibles.-The story. You will either like the story or be disappointed. You are kept in the shade until the very end, despite all your detective work. The ending is also Shayamalan levels of twisty,-The collectibles. Yes, these were both good and bad. The good thing is the info they contain, the bad thing is they are way too easy to collect. On my first playthrough, without using any walkthroughs and not stopping to explore every square inch of every area, I found around 80% of everything there is to be found. Most of them aren't even hidden in any way. Really cuts down on replay value.-The game is very short. My very first playthrough, which I went into completely blind, only took me 6 hours from start to finish while getting 80% of all the collectibles <_>. This is also the main reason for the lack of character development. The story takes place during just one night though, so I guess the plan was to make the game short from the get-go.-No new game plus. After finishing the game, if you continue from the last checkpoint you are placed right at the last scene, which the takes you to the credits again. The only other option is a new game.-The enemies. Too easy to get rid of. They pose no real challenge and don't even really slow you down.-The town. It is way too small to really bring that feel of exploration, and the various areas are split into separate zones.Overall the concept delivered really well. The game really puts you in that fantasy of being a ghost. I would've wished for more varied gameplay and more gameplay in general. The shortness of the game really destroys it. I wanted to love this game with all my heart but I just can't. The flaws are too numerous and too big to ignore.I feel it deserves to be played, but the price right now is way too high. Definitely grab it when it's put on sale			"

												A game in which a Yahtzee Crowshaw cosplayer gets killed by a man and then, as a ghost, follows a fairly predictable plotline to find out who the killer was.  Also the killer kills some other people and there is ghosts hanging about the place.  If you, for whatever reason, struggle to follow the story, just think of it as Ghost, the 1990 film about a ghost, but in a video game.The game starts out in media res after showing the protagonist getting lots of tattoos.  Apparently this is important, somehow, because he was a criminal but is now a cop?  Dunno.  The game then moves on to demonstrating just how bad of a PC port it is.  When I first use my ghostly powers to possess someone, when using a keyboard, I got stuck and was unable to move.  The controls were unresponsive and I had to end the game’s process in task manager.  Definitely use a controller for this one.Shortly after you will meet the game’s deuteragonist, Joy, who is a young girl able to see Ronan, the player, even though he is a ghost.  She isn’t too happy about that because she is always seeing them.  She tells you to ♥♥♥♥ off even after she is informed that you are able to help her find her mother who’s buggered off somewhere (it really is just “somewhere”, you never find out where).  Eventually she resigns herself to helping you if for no other reason than to get Ronan to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up.  What a great partnership.Ronan himself is a fairly likeable character.  If you can get passed his ridiculous attire, plethora of edgy tattoos and the Phantom Cigarette which he never seems to stop smoking, he’s kind of alright.  He reminded me a little of Bigby from The Wolf Among Us; rolled up shirt sleeves, nasty smoking habit and devil-may-care attitude.  His hat is still stupid, though.  He’s basically a modern time discount Cole Phelps.The game itself is quite short.  While I am not usually bothered by the time it takes to complete a game, I was somewhat miffed when I played for around four and a half hours, went to bed, woke up the following morning and managed to finish the game off in about half an hour.  The game’s ending itself appears rushed, scrambling to tie the plot together by showing various scenes with aspects of the story being finalised, but at least it tries.Like many other developers, Airtight Games felt compelled to shoehorn in combat any way they could.  This means that occasionally you’ll come across Demons which you must kill by sneaking up behind them and performing a QTE.  This serves to do nothing else by distract the player and ruin the pace of an otherwise good gameplay loop.  Fortunately, there is a way to edit one of the game’s .ini files in order to stop the Demons spotting you.  They will still spawn, but ignore you completely.  Some may see this as cheating, I see this as an improvement.SPOILERS AHEAD: The ghost girl you meet at the beginning of the game, Abigail, is the killer.  This comes as absolutely no surprise.  It is quickly established that the people stuck in what is ostensibly Purgatory may only leave if they resolve and move on from a key event in their life.  Ronan’s problem is that he never figured out who the Bell Killer was.  And what about Abigail?  Well, Ronan has a very basic possession ability, allowing him to go inside the mind of living beings (and control cats).  But Abigail’s are far more advanced than that.  Yes, she possess people and then kills other people.  Well, mediums, specifically.  Because they’re, like, witches or something.  Her motives are flimsy at best, completely balls-to-the-wall ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and ungrounded at worst.Unlike a similar game, L.A. Noire, I found myself always one or two steps ahead of Ronan in the story.  Many times he would receive sudden clarity on something, and I would be sitting there thinking “Really?  Well, duh.  How did you not already figure that out?”.  At one point, when Ronan finally figures out the thing I’d already clocked onto hours before (the killer’s identity) he asked “But how did she do it?”.  BECAUSE SHE IS A GHOST WHO CAN POSSESS PEOPLE.  YOU CAN DO THE EXACT SAME THING.It might seem like I completely hate the game, but I don’t really.  It’s flawed, but it’s also quite compelling.  While the story’s conclusion was foreseeable, it was still enjoyable to watch the characters make their way to it.  I still haven’t figured out why the ghosts could pass through walls, but not fall through the ground, though.  ‘Tis a mystery which plagues many stories like these. "

												I was looking forward to this game a lot, as I love anything to do with ghosts as well as crime. But I was let down by the fact that the developers have neglected to allow for keyboard customisation within the game, so that we can't change from having to use the default WASD keys. There are people that are left-handed, or have lost part of their left hand and can no longer play that way for games. It would have been nice if this was mentioned before some of us went and wasted our money.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is an adventure game with stealth aspects. The storyline of this game is what makes you want to keep playing , there are alot of broken or just bad mechanics in the game - inspecting and collecting things seems to be very hit or miss whether u get the button prompt based on camera orientation on the object. They tried to add in a aspect of danger to the game via ""demons"" in my opinion this was only a negative aspect as the combat system is very unfullfling and tedious , i found my self just running past most of these parts of the game ( which i suppose is the stealth aspect they were trying to include). The storyline isnt exactly ground breaking and its probably what you expect from a game set in modern day ""Town of Salem"" it does try to have a few plot twist and turns to keep you immersed in the main story though. There are also side quest investigations in the town which really dont advance the main story and only serve to distract you for  a few minutes. The Graphics and art style of the game are very well done and do a good job of setting the atmospheric scene in the town/game. There are is fair amount of people living in this town the only down side to this is alot of the characters are duplicated which really takes away the immersive feeling the game is trying to capture with its graphics and storyline.Its a Short game but worth a play through ( Definitely worth a purchase if its on sale )			"

												The best thing this game's got going for it is the voice acting and MAYBE the story.  The story had me very interested.  Maybe that's because I'm a sucker for detective stories?  Either way, the game itself is... very standard.  The ""battling"" of the demons is literally a repetitive quick-time palooza.  I felt stressed throughout the entire game because I was more focused on trying to find the collectibles moreso than solving the mystery.  Some may argue this is a great addition to the game, but you get nothing except acheivements for completing this tasks, and it felt less-rewarding then usual.There is no newgame+.  Once you beat the game, you restart from your last checkpoint, which happens to be a point of no return.  If you happen to miss some collectibles after this point: tough ♥♥♥♥; you're going to have to restart your entire file.I, personally enjoyed playing the game and getting involved with the characters and the story, but I CANNOT support the outragous price Square-Enix is asking for on this game.  I managed to spend 20$ on this bugger and I still feel like I might have overpayed by a small margine.Give or take, I'd pick this up in the future for like, 5-15$ to give it a try.  Skip it for now.

Don't you love spending money on a game and then the game ♥♥♥♥ slaps you by telling you it won't respond? The game does not respond as if we have been married for twenty years. All I know is, I wish I could get my money back so I don't just have a steam game lying in the library taunting me with its broken and money whoring ways. I just wish technology was kinder to me in my online pioneering whilst searching for decent games. I was looking forward to this game and everything it would incorporate, but ♥♥♥♥ that. Maybe after a few years the game will lighten up and let me enjoy it. This game could be awesome, but honestly as long as it is sitting there mocking me I will despise it until the day I die. I may never be the same again after I saw that first ""Isn't Responding"". I started to doubt myself and all my purchases; I looked back on all my steam games; I contemplated emptying my library on steam and resigning as a gamer. This game disgraces every other game before it in history because IT DOES NOT WORK! I would rather be forced to play the entire ""I Wanna Be The _____"" series and all of its rage-inducing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t then sit at my damn computer just jerking it as this game does not respond as if it's on its period or something and is not in the mood. I pray to Allah that this game one day fixes itself because otherwise that was just a waste of stripper tipping money. Thank you Murdered: Soul Suspect - you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Love,Yours Truly,BL0ODEYES			"

												I wish there was a middle of the road button in Steam, not just the basic yes or no.When i first saw this game i was really impressed and 100% in on the first day as far as picking it up goes.I've stuck a no on this, but my last comment is pretty much a yes, just for the right price.One of the problem's with this game, is that i perhaps didn't find out enough about it before buying it.I do like my puzzle and mystery games a lot, i sort of had it in my mind that this would be a bit of a hybrid.(Which it is, just not fully developed i think)The whole marketing side was gearing you up for playing an epic murder mystery, but what you get instead is just very linear.I'll point out the bits that really were poor, and then some of the bits i did like.1) Fighting enemies - This is both a chore, and yet few and far between too.It's almost like you ""could"" fight enemies in some areas as there are hiding spots and things to possess -There just aren't any.(When i say fight, basically all you do is sprint up behind them and do a poor QTE)2) Uncovering evidence - Not really uncovering, much more like clicking on things in the vicinity, with a running tally telling you how many you are missing. (This also leads into the next point)3) Detective score - 0 reasons for this to be there, every investigation will rank you out of 5 stars.Trying to jolt someones memory in the game? Well ignore the stars and just click on everything, as you wont get penalised.(Same with the uncovering evidence, just get the main parts you need and move on, the only reason to listen and view all parts is for the story - i have a positive for this later as well)4) Bugged side quests - Meet a ghost and solve their tale, only for the large amount of times that you exit and reload the game for them to be still wailing on about something when you return.(They are supposed to go to heaven... i think after you do the mission - Though it never really says, they just get ingulfed by a white light and float off)5) Masses of the same character models all throughout the game.6) Map hub world -  I can see what they were tryng to convey, what with the ghost buildings... almost like a tear in time.It's just a shame that theres not much acually happening, just a lot of weirdo human NPC's hanging around in parks and on benchs in the middle of the night complaining of a murderer hanging around (Your in a park in the middle of the night... errr)7) Lack of locations.8) Possessing people - It wears thin, especially when they only have two lines of internal monologue to listen to at best.(Most people also have set paths if they aren't just sitting)Ok, what i liked 1) Character development to a degree was pretty good, the main characters are fairly well fleshed out throughout the game.2) The story, although you know it's going to be a supernatural sort of tale, it actually just ignores most of the witchcraft side of Salem until about 70% of the way through.3) The ghost stories and tales are fairly well done.4) What little locations are in the game are nice enough to look at.5) Some times the random ghosts freaked me out a bit.What could have made it better - 1) More sections with the whole ""Cat"" possession :-)2) The ability to scare people and freak them out with possessions.3) More locations and places to explore.4) More... way more, NPC's and things to interact with.So, thats all i got, i think when i was playing it i came up with a lot more negatives, but the story was pretty engaging.If i had to give a score and some final comments i'd say - 6/10 - Only buy if you can pick it up for less than £10.00			"

												I haven't felt the need to review for a while, but I can't help but talk about this game. For those of you who have played the Blackwell series (look at my review), I feel that Square Enix programmers played the games and thought, ""Hey, we can make a non-P&C, grittier, updated graphics version of Blackwell!"". In some respects, it really feels that way. A ghost needs to solve his own murder, plus help lost ghosts solve their issues so that they can move on with the help of a medium. Only instead of Roseangela we get a whiny teenager by the name of Joy. The crime solving isn't that difficult, but when the story is this enjoyable who really cares? The game takes place in Salem, and I feel that the town is one of the big stars of the game. The developers knew they had a lot to work with and they did a great job. You get to discover artifacts that uncover Salem's dark history, uncover artifacts that reveal haunting stories, and help ghosts piece together their untimely end. The main characters are a mixed bag. Ronan, is a detective who spent most of his life on the wrong side of Lady Law before joining the force. He's a great character. His sidekick is a gothic emo of a teenager named Joy. I see why they think she needs to be here, but I just didn't like her that much. Luckily, she only appears as much as she needs to, leaving you free to take your time between levels to explore Salem and backtrack for achievements or artifacts if need be. For you artifact and achievement junkies, there is a ton to find. Most will be able to find a lot of the stuff, in the first playthrough, but it is worth playing again. I highly recommend this supernatural detective game.			"

												Murdered Soul Suspect won't blow anyone away, but it's a fun game with some good ideas that are unfortunately poorly implemented at times.To be honest, I was a bit excited when I first heard of Murdered, but the lack of advertising and previews always make me worry about the final product. By the time it released it seems the studio was already closing down and no effort was made to promote it and that way try and earn some extra money with it. This was already obvious by the unusually high amount of discounts, months ahead of its release date. This game wasn't going to win any awards, and they knew that for quite some time then.Graphically the game isn't the best, but it isn't the worst either. Models look nice and detailed, as well as the vilage. There are plenty of people walking around, ghosts and human, and there's a nice mix of still standing buildings and buildings that were destroyed in a fire a long time ago (and, like all the other ghosts, are being shown with a ghostly aura around them).In the beginning it's explained why you can't just enter any building you see which sounds ridiculous when you hear it. It's obvious things were changed because of its low(er) budget. Still, it's more disappointing than it is frustrating. It would've been nice if you could go anywhere you want, but ok, that's just my opinion, of course.A nice touch is the addition of static ghosts in the backgrounds that disappear once you get closer to them. Nothing eery or scary but cool evertheless (and maybe even underused).The voice acting is actually very good, especially that of Ronan and Joy. I also can't complain about the music and sounds, which range from very decent to very good.As far as the story is concerned; it's ok-ish. I was hoping for a mysterious story and while you keep guessing until the end it didn't have the payoff I was hoping to get. About three quarters in, the story becomes clearer and your expectations will probably change. Some might like it, others might like it less. I am part of the group that liked it less. The story became less personal near the end and I was disappointed by it.Ghosts can also be found standing and hanging around certain places. They have some creepy stories to tell, and this is one of the things the game does right. But talking to some of these ghosts will give you a conversation tree to choose from. These are absolutely worthless and add nothing to the story or game. Again a case of wanting to add too much and where it's obvious they eventually had to cut it out because of time/money constraints.The real sidequests have deeper stories than the other ghosts found in the game and solving these is fun and worth the time.The gameplay consists of walking around and pressing context-sensitive buttons. Solving cases usually require you to search the area in search of items or people and press a specific button. Once you have enough evidence to solve a case you can do this, again, by pressing a button. You then have to click a memory (which basically is a piece of evidence you found) or click on memories in a certain order (like; how something may have happened).Stealth is also used but it's so minimal that it's barely even worth mentioning. I think these can be counted on one hand. Still, it adds some variety to the game and it's something that makes the games a little harder. They should've used it more frequently because it works well.There are a few groundbreaking bugs in the game. Mine started with the first investigation when things are still being explained to you. The buttons and tutorial overlays didn't work so I couldn't trigger anything. After a few minutes I reloaded the checkpoint and this time it worked just fine. This happened 3 or 4 more times during the course of the game. Annoying bugs that shouldn't be there because the other elements of the game work fine and even feel polished.Murdered Soul Suspect isn't the game I originally wanted to have but it's still fun if you like ghost and detective stories. Don't expect a hardcore game here, but something a bit more casual; a game that anyone can play and finish.It's not a great game, but not something mediocre either.[Rating: 73/100]			"

												+: For me it had investigations as part of environment exploration, which i didn't have enough in AC Unity, and ghosty spooky theme I got compelled to after Beyond: Two Souls, and also nice story and fitting location.-: But action gameplay is meh, stealthing for ghost wedgies gets tedious after first dozen times, and then I just curse at raven placement I didn't notice. And some other stuff gets to hidden, doing 100% would be quite painful, so it's uninstalled right after ending.There's Ghost Stories worthy set of bonuses for collecting, but you can just watch it here and not waste time on looking for bloody final piece:

Overview11 hours until the end36/48 achievementsI am not a great adventure fan, so for one of these, things might be different.This game has some of the worst aspects of adventures, the very reasons why I do not like most adventures.There will be spoilers, so if you don't want them, stop reading.The good clues:I like the graphics and the sound. I like the idea about being a ghost who searches his murderer very much. Mindreading people is fun for 10 minutes until you realize that it is good for nothing if you are not currently searching for clues.The bad clues:It starts with the bad experience in the first scene, you have to search for clues. You are even told how many there are and how many you already have.You think, ""cool, searching a murder scene for clues"".You saw in a video what happened, you were thrown through a window from high above. So why is broken glass a ""clue""? Why? Why is your gun a clue? You have to find.. don't know 7 or 9 clues and you get NO new info out of these clues. And it is really as bad as in my first adventures, more than 20 years ago. You have to find the pixel which is the clue. But is worse than 20 years ago, because you do not just move your mouse, you move a character and the character has too look at the pixel.Next scene, you have to find x/y clues. After a while you realize, it is again moving around until you get the info that you are looking at a clue. Cool...not. It gets worse. You don't believe me? It GETS worse.You will get no hint in that direction, but sometimes, for example in the second scene, you will not find all clues, but you have to conclude from your already found ""clues"".These conclusions are the worst you can imagine. Nope. That is not true. They are worse.There is NO logic (no human logic at least) behind the decision which picture is the right to chose. Then, after this is done, sometimes you have new sensitive pixels in the scene. Somewhere.Sometimes it is so bad, you KNOW that there, at exact that spot has to be the pixel you want to ""find"" (google, walkthrough or load game), but you have to move and turn and snake around the pixel until you get it.So, what have we until now? Pixel searching, clues which give you no clue and missing logic in the conclusions you HAVE to make.Can it get worse?It can. But at least it is a taste thing. Some - adventure lovers - will see it as normal, some - as me - will start to hate.You see, there will be puzzles. These will be of the kind: ""I am a ghost and have no clue, help me"". Then you search a radus of 5 meters around the ghost for x/y clues (you remember that one, right?) and will come to totally unlogic conclusions and ""puff"", the ghost is happy and goes away to heaven. Yeah, real police stuff, you know.And then, then there are the demons. In a game about ghosts, why should be there no demons you ask?Because they are used as action/stealth elements which make the game longer, have you die and get you to curse a lot.If you find in the steam forum some message about ""how to disable demons"", then you know, you are not alone with your frustration. These demons do not really make sense for the story of the game. STOP! NO THEY DON'T!They just get in your way when you want to continue with the story.Oh oh. The story.I have to say, the story is kind of good and interesting. But had I known how brutal the game (what is told and what you see in backflashes) will become, I would not have bought it.I do not like brutality or sadism in my games. And I like really happy endings in my games.I was sad when the story ended, not because the game was finished, I was so happy that I was done with it, but I was sad because the story told about horrid fates of young friendly girls who just had wanted to help others.ConclusionIf you a an adult adventure lover, get it. You will love it, I fear.For all others, keep away, don't get it, not even cheap. Just DO NOT GET IT!And do NOT give it to your children to play it. I think, the story is just too brutal. At least for me.Do NOT buy!			"

												I wanted to like this game, but then I played it.  Pretty much every mechanic in the game is handled poorly.  Most of the puzzles in the game consist of you searching the crime scene to collect a pool fo mostly useless clues and then picking the correct one out of the list when prompted.  Hmm, which clue is related to the Bell Killer?  Could it be the one that just says ""Bell Killer""? Yes, yes it is.  Every time.   90% of the ""puzzles"" are exactly this.  No creative or deductive thought is required to finish this game.  The only other major mechanic in this game is demons.  They are one of the worst mechanics of any game I've ever played.  Basically they are like wandering sentries that you have to sneak up on to destroy.  If they spot you they chase you around for a couple of minutes.  They are never fun.  They are only annoying hinderences that stop you from continuing the story.  They were obviously slapped onto the game to make things more ""difficult"" and drag the game out.  Without them you could probably finish the game in a couple of hours.  Most of which is walking back and forth between the various crime scenes in the absolutely tiny town of Salem.  There are a bunch of collectibles to find throughout the game, but unless you collect all of them of a given type you don't get anything out of it.  And when you do finally get them all you are rewarded with a crappy little short story about someone's death.  The overall story of the game is ok I guess.  It has some serious problems, but relative to how bad the rest of the game is, I guess it gets a pass.  It does not however make slogging through the rest of the game worth it.  I'll give the game some credit though, the title is sort of clever.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is the game where walking through walls and objects is no longer a bug but a feature.First of all you should realize that this game is basically split 50-50 between gameplay and cut scenes. If feels more like watching a movie than playing a game. You get to play as detective Ronan O’Connor. Objective - solve your own murder, and save the terrorized Salem from The Bell Killer. Murdered: Soul Suspect offers a compelling story with several twists, and manages to entertain till the very end. There are also some side quests you can complete by helping several ghost you'll encounter during the game. These ones are optional, but are recommended to complete in order to get a better perspective of the game and your detective skills, especially since the main story is quite short. If you decide to buy it i would advice not to put much hope in the gameplay. It's quite repetitive - explore the location, gather clues on the case, escape the demons, watch the cut scene, and over again... Overall, it somehow felt intriguing and mysterious, also quite different from most of the adventure games i've played. However, even after the recent price cut from $50 to $30 i still find it a bit overpriced and would recommend to get it on sale since it's too short, and has almost no replayability value, except if you're an achievement hunter and would need to play it a second time to get the ones you've missed.

												An enjoyable game with an interesting story.  Is it perfect? No but did I have fun playing it? Absolutely.  The story and graphics are good and as with some movies you can predict how the story will unfold you'll be able to do the same here but with some well placed plot twists that I believe the majority of people won't see coming.  .  There are some nice spooky elements to the game like the demons and the random disappearing ghosts.  Folks have complained the game is short - I don't have a problem with that personally - the duration of the game seemed to fit with the nature and timeline of the main story and doesn't have you spending hours doing something for little reward.

												You’ve been murdered, it’s a real bummer. But now you get the chance to find out who it was and seek justice from beyond the grave. Or you would if you played this.Enter Ronan a bad guy turned good trying to stop a murderer on a killing spree but wouldn’t you know it you wind up just another one of their victims. But with unfinished business to attend to you hang around for a while and haunt the halls of Salem city searching for clues that could lead you to solving your own murder and ascending to heaven. Or at least that’s the plan but as the recently departed not many people will talk to you. Enter the one witness to your death Joy who also happens to be psychic, after a lot of convincing the duo team up and take down the evil together. The story is certainly an intriguing and unique one. I have not seen a murder mystery from a dead person’s perspective before and with the amounts of twists and turns that come flying at you as you progress it will get you enthralled right to the end.The game is stacked full of collectables, over a hundred of them to be precise, each with its own story. They all fit seamlessly into the town of Salem with its terrible past and not too stellar present. The world is more or less open world with you being able to travel from one location to another through the hub of the down town area. Each part of the world is beautifully designed and looks great mixing an old ghostly past with the present to make something new.The game also features a huge amount of side quests and cases to solve. Speaking of which the detective mode is also something of an oddity, find a crime and solve it with clues found in the environment and placed together like pieces of a puzzle, I found a lot of pleasure recreating crimes to try and figure out what had happened and who the culprit was.Now onto the main meat of the game combat…. There is none. Well that’s not true, there are a few enemies and by few I mean around 12 in the whole game and the only thing that happens is when they see you a QTE begins, win and you can proceed, lose and you have to start a short ways back. I would classify this more as an interactive novel than a game. Not that it’s a bad thing, but just be sure that’s what you are looking for before you delve in.This game offers a lot and is a great distraction if you are looking for a unique experience that’s heavy on the narrative but light in most other places. At full price I can’t really recommend it but on sale you should pick this up and just enjoy your time in purgatory.Have Fun ^_^			"

												Is this a good game? No. Is this a Bad game? Again no. This is a middle of the road game that doesn't do much new, but does try for the most part. The story is maybe 6-8 hours long it's padded by a lot of side quests some good. The helping other ghost asend. Some bad my god they went overboard with the item collection.  Persoaly I enjoy clue based mysteries, but the clues were all stright forward so not a lot of abstract thought will be needed here, And the game give up about half way though. Those good side stories where you help other ghosts dry up about mid game. Which is sad because it's clear there were plans for more they just dropped them for some reasons. The special item collection is also kind of boring collect 6-20 of this area items and you unlock a short ghost story. Do I recomend this game in the end? Yes IF and only if you like clue based mysteries and exploreing for pointless items. Try to get it on sale i would not recomend it at full price.			"

												This game surprised me.As the player you assume the role of the ghost of a deceased detective that is trying to piece together his own murder. You are invisible to most of the civilians, you can pass through walls, you can possess people and eavesdrop conversations.Let's talk about the game strong points:- Excelent presentation: graphically the game looks great, there is great attention to detail and the PC port is quite good.- Decent plot and interesting lore that keeps the game interesting until it's conclusion.- Original concept for an adventure/investigation.Factors that greatly detract from the experience:- The investigation mechanics are flawed and dull: there are no branching investigation paths, the interrogations are linear and you have no other choice but to follow the game's script.- There are stealth/action sequences involving demons. They feel like a simple filler, rather than something valuable. After the first or second encounter, there's nothing new to these encounters.In summary: an excellent concept is marred down by some crucial excution flaws which detract from the core experience. However, it is still worth the investment at a discount.Veredict: 7/10			"

												A good story game that has some interesting hooks in it and several stabs to your back.Gameplay could have been more, it is on the low side of things - unless you consider collectible hunting to be a highly fun activity. It was decent at best.Graphics, in Direct X 11, its quite pretty - even though its mainly night blue and dark grey - due to the subject matter.Audio does a good job, nice atmosphere it provides.The story is quite good, as you follow the trail, it gets more and more interesting. Even the ending is rather unexpected, even though it was nagging at the back of my mind - I just was't 100% positive.My only REAL complaint is just the lack of real variety amongst the (living) NPC's.The level of lazy we are talking about, is the LACK of many NPS's to begin with. Its roughly 6 for male and female.Even the dialoge for either gender is repeated amonst different types of NPC's. It really annoyed me.Is it worth the sale price of $30?oh nooo.Wait for a sale or to be bundled up with either games. "

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a third person thriller detective game where you will be exploring various locations in Salem for clues on your case. This game feels almost as if it were an interactive movie, which is a great thing; in addition the graphics, sound and voice acting are all superb. The game has tons of collectibles which add a lot of background information to the stories, locations, and characters. It took me 10 hours to complete the game and collect everything.  If you are a fan of thriller or mystery games, I highly recommend this one!			"

												Fabulous game - enjoyed the story with lots of twists and turns.  Very cleverly put together.  Graphics were good also as well as the background music (although sitting in the dark playing this in the house alone is not reccomended!  Very eerie!!).  Although I did enjoy the concept of the demons and figuring out the best way to strategically defeat them, this became tiresome and detracted from the main storyline.  Enjoyed the side cases also, as that added more variety. I was totally engrossed in the game and hoped it had continued for longer!  Would love to play more games like this one.			"

												Surprisingly enjoyable. A not so long adventure game with an original idea but plagued by an average execution.The positiveMurdered takes the interesting concept of playing a dead man stuck between two worlds and having to solve his murder to be able to get to heaven. I really love this idea, you're investigating in two embedded worlds : the living and the dead. You can clip through most environment from the world of the living but get stuck against the environment of the dead. The setting is very well made with ghosts appearing and disappearing as well as people in an alike situation as yours : unable to let go and go to heaven. There are 4 side quests where you're helping someone to understand his/her death.I personally loved the aesthetic of the game, a mix of color and black and white. The game also is very well optimised and runs flawlessly on my laptop (i7 4500U, Nvidia GT750m) @ 900p/1080p. The story is enjoyable for the most part and the collaboration and interactions between Joy and Ronan are well-executed. Finally, the game has a lot of collectibles (242 to be precise), this can be either a positive or a negative point depending on the player.The negativeThe gameplay is below average even for an adventure game. Every step of the story involves you looking for clues in a small area, when you have enough clues you are able to link a few of them to each other to solve one question.... and that's it, for the whole game. The clues are either stupidly obvious or stupidly useless and the solving questions are terrible. The combat system sucks terribly too, it's simply about sneaking behind enemies and doing a simple QTE. Murdered won't be remembered for its gameplay.The story is very unbalanced. The first hour is basically setting the story and characters, the pace is slow and isn't very compelling. When you start seeing a bit through how the investigation is going to take place, it becomes enjoyable and that until the end of the game where you are faced to a completely stupid and abrupt ending. The ending feels rushed and I hated it because of this, the last chapter is like 5 minutes long... The rest of the game isn't very long either, count between 6 to 8 hours depending on whether you want to find all the collectibles or not.ConclusionIt might seem that the game is terrible but I personally enjoyed it anyway despite all of its flaws. The aesthetic and most of the story felt original. Many good ideas, poor execution but still worth it in my opinion. I wouldn't recommend it at full price though, buy it on sale.			"

												I enjoyed it tremendously.  Absolutely a unique experience.Playing as a ghost was well implemented in my opinion.  They used what I found were convincing concepts in order to limit your navigation where needed, establishing clear rules from the outset.The mystery-solving was great.  It reminded me of L.A. Noire some (but I much preferred L.A. Noire I must say, as a game and specifically in its mystery-solving methods).  My one problem with it is that there really isn't a penalty for being a poor detective.  It's up to you to challenge yourself by not selecting all the answers until you get it right.  Of course, your 'ranking' is lowered for each incorrect guess but that's not a gameplay penalty as much as a pride penalty.The story was compelling and the voice-acting was brilliant for anyone with a name you learn in the game.  Unfortunately, most of the NPCs with names you don't know, are comically wooden and not remotely human.  I loved Joy, notable given I thought I'd hate an angsty teen written by someone that's not an angsty teen, moreover one that's meant to be comedic and have an attitude; the media don't seem to be good at that in general, so this was a nice change.Then there's the voice acting in the ghost stories.  That was phenomenal.  The stories were well written and well performed.  Absolutely a brilliant touch.I really felt connected to Julia, your wife in the game.  She's hardly in the game, but you can collect her memories, and they're written.  If you read them, you begin to develop a real sense of who she is.  I have to commend that sort of characterisation.The main character is believable.  Probably someone I'd laugh at in real life (even though I'd still like him; he's a good person and he certainly takes things in stride), but I can't say I haven't known people like him.  And the writing and acting make that believeable.Speaking of taking things in stride, that's one flaw in the writing; too many people take too many things in stride.  But that's negligible in the face of everything else.The combat system isn't much of a combat system, but I felt it worked well.  In fact, had they called your one move 'exorcise' or something instead of 'execute', you could have had a true example of a great game utterly devoid of combat, where overcoming your enemy isthe best thing you can do for them.  There's a nice stealth element alongside the one move you have.The dæmons are extremely creepy in design.  I love it.The music is great, but I wish that in a place where it becomes tense for enemies, that it would become less tense once the enemies are neutralised.  It doesn't.  A minor flaw I suppose.The game feels like an indie game and was developed by Airtight Games, who were apparently independent according to Wikipedia.  I say this because the graphics are rather poor compared to contemporary games, and like many indie developers, the engine used was the old UE3 engine, rather than what was most current.There's a lot of history in the game.  Old Salem bleeds into the modern Salem as the main character (and all ghosts I imagine) sees things.  You can collect snippets of history, which were probably all accurate, as the ones I was familiar with were all correct.Bonus:I'm a linguist, and I liked that a lot of the accents were notably correct.  The game takes placein Salem, which isn't too far from Boston.  I'm very familiar with the Boston accent as it's rather high-profile in dialects of English, and moreover as it has a significant Irish influence.  I'm not terribly familiar with Salem's accent but a lot of characters possess Boston traits so I assume they were trying to localise the accent at least as Massachusetts, which is really interesting to someone like me.  Also, a lot of Irish turns of phrase are used, which on looking them up are apparently common in that area of America, from Irish emigrants.  Nice.  Not only that, a lot of people have Irish names, which is rather realistic and once again interesting.Oh, but the old-time Puritan accents were cat.  Absolute rubbish they were.Speaking of cats, you can possess cats and meow and climb things and jump on things.  Another nice touch. "

												You’ve been murdered, it’s a real bummer. But now you get the chance to find out who it was and seek justice from beyond the grave. Or you would if you played this.Enter Ronan a bad guy turned good trying to stop a murderer on a killing spree but wouldn’t you know it you wind up just another one of their victims. But with unfinished business to attend to you hang around for a while and haunt the halls of Salem city searching for clues that could lead you to solving your own murder and ascending to heaven. Or at least that’s the plan but as the recently departed not many people will talk to you. Enter the one witness to your death Joy who also happens to be psychic, after a lot of convincing the duo team up and take down the evil together. The story is certainly an intriguing and unique one. I have not seen a murder mystery from a dead person’s perspective before and with the amounts of twists and turns that come flying at you as you progress it will get you enthralled right to the end.The game is stacked full of collectables, over a hundred of them to be precise, each with its own story. They all fit seamlessly into the town of Salem with its terrible past and not too stellar present. The world is more or less open world with you being able to travel from one location to another through the hub of the down town area. Each part of the world is beautifully designed and looks great mixing an old ghostly past with the present to make something new.The game also features a huge amount of side quests and cases to solve. Speaking of which the detective mode is also something of an oddity, find a crime and solve it with clues found in the environment and placed together like pieces of a puzzle, I found a lot of pleasure recreating crimes to try and figure out what had happened and who the culprit was.Now onto the main meat of the game combat…. There is none. Well that’s not true, there are a few enemies and by few I mean around 12 in the whole game and the only thing that happens is when they see you a QTE begins, win and you can proceed, lose and you have to start a short ways back. I would classify this more as an interactive novel than a game. Not that it’s a bad thing, but just be sure that’s what you are looking for before you delve in.This game offers a lot and is a great distraction if you are looking for a unique experience that’s heavy on the narrative but light in most other places. At full price I can’t really recommend it but on sale you should pick this up and just enjoy your time in purgatory.Have Fun ^_^			"

												At first, I wasn't sure what to expect. Picked up the game just because of couple of good reviews and interesting video. Gosh, I went for a treat. The story of the game grabs you like a great book, and you keep on going like ""Oh boy, oh boy! What will happen next?"". Characters are likeable and well modeled. Level design is top notch too. In general the game goes easy on you, it want to tell you a story and not irritate you with too much logical puzzles or advanced combat system. Which can be a good or bad thing depending on what you expecting from a game. Anyhow I am sure that being able to  'posses' a person and catch a glimpse of what they thinking is a big turn-on for a lot of gamers.

Exploration is not forced but recommended if you want to know a bit more about the world around you and lore is not that hard to find. the fights are few and far between but you won't mind as thegame itself is engrossing enough.

												Great game on sale, got it dirt cheap not expecting too much but it ended up surprising me.  Would not buy it for full price though.  The only thing that sucks about the game are the demon encounters, they just feel out of place and unnecessary.  The game has a good enough story and investigation/exploration sections that it doesn't need the demon sections at all.  It's a real shame because the idea had potential too.  I was hoping for something in the vein of demons being disguised as regular ghosts trying to trick you into making bad decisions via dialogue options to steal your soul but instead they're patrolling enemies that you have to avoid and stealth kill.  The most annoying thing is when they detect you for no reason whatsoever or when you are in exactly the correct position to execute them and get no prompt to do so.  These sections are a pretty small portion of the game though and there's only a handful of them.  Anyone whose played any stealth oriented games will have no problems with them outside of the issues mentioned above.  Overall, it was a great story with a couple twists on the end that I just didn't see coming.  The game is worth a playthrough if you're looking for something different that's story driven and not action packed.  Voice acting was great too, Ronan and Joy are both likable characters with tons of personality.  Will probably play this again at some point to get all the collectables and do the side missions that I missed.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is actually a really good game. Okay, maybe that's an overstatement, but I really enjoyed it's approach to detective work and solving the mystery of your own murder as well as the recent string of murders in Salem in a single night.You play Ronan O'Connor, a former petty criminal/turned detective who is hot on the trail of the Bell Killer, only the opening cutscene is your own death. The game picks up right from there as you search for clues and get used to being a ghost. The devs handled the ghost mechanics rather well as far as being unable to walk into buildings from the outside unless there's an open doorway or window. But you can move through walls, bushes, benches, etc.The story is really intriguing and it seemed like it was going to be predictable, but I was wrong. I didn't know who the killer was from the get go. So, I tip my hat to the devs for pulling a decent M Night Shamalamadingdong. Sound design is eerie, as it should be. Unnamed NPC's that walk around Salem that you can possess, well, a lot of them looked the same and had the same responses when reading their minds, that bugged me. And for being an open world town, it seemed more restricted than anything because of the ghost walls that you can't pass through. It just made the town section of the game seem a lot more linear, but like a maze.The graphics were decent enough, but it's clear that the game was held back due to last gen consoles. I mean, some of the modeling and textures look like games from 2010.The mystery work was a lot of fun though, searching for clues and whatnot. Good game.7.5/10			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect was a game I've been heavily anticipating ever since I saw it in action. I expected something along the lines of Ghost Trick mixed with L.A. Noire. What I got instead was essentially a much better Beyond Two Souls and that in of itself isn't a bad thing.Taking place in Salem, Massachusetts, you play as the deceased Detective Ronan O'Connor. Murdered by a mysterious serial-killer, he finds out that the only way to pass on to the afterlife and reunite with his dead wife is to figure out the murders identity identity so he may leave this mortal plane. It's a decent Whodunit story with a lot of interesting side-stories unlocked through collectibles.My biggest problem with this game is the gameplay or lack thereof. For what it's worth, I did enjoy Murdered: Soul Suspect when you realize the game isn't trying to be Ghost Trick or LA Noire, but this is something you'll notice more and more as you'll go along. I actually think it starts out pretty well. You walk through walls, talk to fellow ghosts, discover their stories through detective work. It all seemed fine until you find out that's that where it stops. It never gets any harder, better more complex, better. The game doesn't offer much depth and at worse, becomes less interesting for the player. All you do is press X to evidence. There are no fail states in the investigation sections. There are no incentives to actually think logically and not randomly guess at what the game throws at you besides meaningless tokens and even then the game is incredibly easy. ""Oh, I wonder what memory will remind this witness of the killer. Hmm... could it perhaps be this thought bubble right here called THE KILLER?"" I admit, sometimes possessing a human and hearing his thoughts can be kinda cool, but it really doesn't enough with the concept. You never manipulate their actions unless it's for something incredibly mundane, never use them to walk around, there are no puzzles to solve, it just feels like a missed opportunity.Besides there's not really much to talk about. You can occasionally posses cats to find a new path to your objectives, you can try to find these loads of collectibles or.... fight random demons? Yeah, even though it's not relevant to the plot at all, you have to sneak past these dementor-like creatures or take these things down from behind stealthily, the latter being the most common. This isn't even a rare occurrence, this happened more then I could count. It's not all bad and sneaking past them does sometimes work, but why is this even here? This has no point other then to waste my time! The combat in this game couldn't be more tacked on even if you tried. I also thought using quicktime events to defeat them was incredibly annoying, because the buttons you need to press are randomized every time, but at the very least, you're given a surprisingly large amount of of time to get the right ones down so if there's one thing to praise them for it's that.It's with this that I realized that the game isn't trying to deep in terms of gameplay and that it's going for a specific audience who don't really want to put much thought into their gaming. With that said, I still had a good time with Murdered: Soul suspect. Like I said before, the story is good and that's really what they wanted to tell here. The lightning effects and shading are some of the best I've ever seen in a computer game however this comes with the unfortunate side effect of your game for thirty seconds just to load the next area. This isn't exclusive to the PC version, even the next-gen versions suffer from frame rate drops, stutters and others but technical hiccups aside, I'd say the game is still worth a purchase, but not for full price obviously. If you're still not convinced: all I'm saying is that I'll take a Murdered: Soul Suspect which simplifies a lot of aspects about its genre then the latest 6 Final Fantasy games or so.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is an Action (Hide & Seek?) Adventure RPG game set up in modern Salem.You are Ronan O’Connor, a badass detective chasing the infamous Bell Killer, but when you find him, seems he was more than you could chew, so you end up dead, finally you can rest in peace... Or so you thought, until you realize, you're now a ghost that can't move on, because of some unfinished business, but, what could that be? You can only think on finishing your last case, so you start tracking down your killer, now that you're a ghost, how hard could that be?Do note, real men don't need a map. But nobody is going to look down on you if you use a guide.★★★☆☆ | It was OK "

												If your dream has always been playing an undead fedora-wearing douchbag neckbeard solving criminal cases like some try-hard Maltese Falcon reject who can't come to terms with the fact that he neither lives in the 1940s, nor understands the actual era (dress code included) - this might just be the game for you. Douchehat McNeckbeard might be laughably slow in how he connects clues, but he comes with a full package of mangst in the form of a fridged (of course) Manic Pixie Dreamgirl wife, and the attitude you'd expect from a 40-year-old basement dweller. If that is what you enjoy in a game, this will be a dream for you - albeit an admittedly short one, since the game is as the most 10 hours, and that's when you take your time as I did.On a more serious note, this game did have potential, and I really wanted to like it. Tuning out the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ protagonist and his ridiculous and frankly embarrassing fashion sense (which is explained away in the most ridiculous 'didn't even try' manner possible in the game), parts of the gameplay, particularly in the beginning, were fun. Sadly the really fun parts are tragically underused, and for the course of the game following the opening mission, you experience practically nothing new. The first bigger investigation was fun especially through learning all the things you could do to get clues - connect existing clues in your head for new revelations, possess people and prompt them to reveal what they knew by triggering the right clues in their heads, seeing through their eyes into computer files, etc - but there it ended. You acquire a few more fine-tuned skills later on (teleporting, most notably), but nothing that really stands out. The fun experimental trying and testing which witness might have seen what and respond to which clues turns into a tedious button-smashing 'where's the one tiny object in the room that I keep missing?' adventure. Gameplay stagnates and turns into the same thing over and over and over again, only for Mr Fedora to finally come to a conclusion that quite frankly you could have told him after or even before entering the building.The worst part by far is the writing. Not only are the main characters (most notably the supposed 'tough cops' who only come across as petty, ♥♥♥♥♥y, and whiny) utterly unlikeable, but the main story itself lacks any originality. For the sake of avoiding spoilers if you are for whatever reason still interested in playing, I won't go into the details further, but whatever 'twists' were apparently thought up by the writers have been done before and repeated to death, were foreseeable to the point I don't even want to call it foreshadowing anymore, and - due to the absolutely flat character writing - lacked any sort of emotional impact. I never thought a game centring around a murder investigation done by a GHOST in ♥♥♥♥ing SALEM could be boring, but this is. It's plain and simply boring, with slightly awkward, incredibly repetitice gameplay, and with the added disadvantage of the most obnoxious, annoying, self-centred, whiny wannabe-tough guy fedora-wearing neckbeard Gary Stu of a protagonist I have ever seen. It's like a bad '40s film noir rip off (BUT IN SALEM, WOOO SUPERNATURAL THINGS) gone completely wrong. And not even spectacularly wrong, just underwhelming, tedious, and most of all - disappointing.There are worse games, of course, but this game stands out mainly because it doesn't - it's all been done before, been done better, and there is literally nothing that this game has to offer. It's not the worst, not a spectacular train wreck, but it's poor, and it's sad. Good for a few minutes of fun, and if you really have to kill time and have absolutely nothing else to do.Overall, 2/5, and that's me being nice, because I enjoyed parts of the early gameplay. Suggested time to buy: at 90% off.			"

												Being an old-time fan of the venerable Scapeghost by Level Nine, I grabbed this one with high expectations. And it's all there: You get to walk through walls, read people's minds, interfere with TV Sets and solve your own murder case. All that with Unreal-Engine powered graphics, a teenage punk medium and evil demons chasing you - what could possibly go wrong? The intro sequence showing the protagonist's past being inscribed as tattoos on his body was nice storytelling as well, so I was really, really ready to like and recommend this after like ten minutes.The setting is also fitting, with run-down buildings, a creepy cemetary and, of course, an asylum, all set within Salem which drips with atmosphere all by itself.And then it feels like the guys or girls with the nice ideas went to do something else, or got fired, or had no more time left.First, after being introduced with a rich background and ambiguous personality, the characters put all their dimesions aside and do exactly what you'd expect them to, in a mildly stereotypic way that makes them feel like copies from a couple of similar movies you just can't remember right now. This is especially true for side characters. No one expects brilliant writing for every single one-line (to be exact, two-line) character, but whatever chance for creepy, humorous or kinky or otherwise interesting background was given by the setting, nearly none of that was taken. And apart from five relevant persons and a couple of side-quest givers, everyone is a two-line character.Second, the game mostly progresses through you doing ""police work"". In itself, that wouldn't be much of a problem, as ghost stories and crime stories usually go quite well together. But this game relies more on your stuff collecting skills than on any form of crime puzzle solving. Any hint you may find has a generic one-line description but you won't ever read one, as you get an informative clip once you found 9/9, 15/15 or 20/20 hints, I think you can guess the mechanics. Any combination or deduction is done by the game itself by letting you choose from some heavily hinted options.Apart from the main story, there are bonus tidbits scattered everywhere. Once you found x/x of these, you get told a ghost story and go on. Some of the tidbits require jump-and run episodes, some the use of ghost abilities, but there is no other interconnection between them and the rest of the game. Same goes for side quests.The plot actually does not feel that bad, but the shallow, ""consoley"" approach to it, repetitive gameplay and thin dialogue, the tedious fights, the linear progression and the lots of walking didn't do it for me. It is an action game without action trying to be an adventure without puzzles. Which is a real pity because it does have production value. "

												This game was one I wanted to play when it first came out. I loved the game don't get me wrong...was a great game...just not worth the full price. Its a game you will want to pick up on sale. If you love collecting everything, there is plenty of that in here. Many small items to be found all over the city, and in each of the main spots you have to travel too to progress the game itself. The story is great, even though you may see most of it coming a mile away.  My one downfall I felt on it was the demons. They weren't used often enough, with that being said it made it feel they were more to just in your way, as well were the only enemy you had in the game. When trying to kill them it puts up different button presses, so be quick, or you will need to start running then play a game of musical chairs hiding till they go away. I do wish as well that your ghostly powers were more so needed to be used, but it was a bit of a let down as well.  Other then that I do hope that there will be another game, just hopfully they will add more too it. It was a great concept, but more could have been done. Once again its one I would say buy, just wait till its on sale.			"

												The game is great, the mechanics are ok. But the concept of walking through walls wasn't something easy to grasp in my first few hours of gameplay. The STORY IS GOOD, I got hooked to it like a rat to a trap, it's very rich in story. Has history of the setting where you play at, very good direction when it comes to the story and I can't deny that I wanted more, the game just gives you a new atmosphere, surrounding, gameplay that isn't really common. Though I liked the stories about witchcraft in Salem it has a linear story line. But it's a good linear story kek. I REALLY WOULD WANT A SEQUELThe gameplay is a bit meh-ish, the demons weren't really that hard, puzzles were just too easy. But the thing that got me the most is the new environment, mechanics, and overall theme of the game, I wish they make a DLC or sequel eh, I recommend you to buy this.An intriguing game where it makes you think about what happens to a person after death. Very story rich like square enix's mangas and animes kek.			"

												So, by this time I'm done with the game. Having done most but not all side missions. Worth mentioning that I got it via the Square Enix's mystery box for March which was 10$. For those looking for the punch-line of the review on if it's worth your money or not (29,99$), here it is guys and gals: If you like point and click adventure games, sure, go ahead, it's one of the better of it's kind, you don't see tripple A point and clicks that often. If not, I'd wait for a really good sale. Also keep in mind that the replayability value is low, if any.Now, into the depths: *The Plot* : You're a badass detective under the department of the Salem area, an active serial killer is around and you just happen to pick to have your badass moment going-in without back up moment in the wrong place and in the wrong time, getting killed. Surprise, you're now Casper and you get to be a detective in the afterlife trying to solve your own murder while trying not to get killed (again) by demons in the ghost town. The concept in itself is marvelous- who wouldn't want to be a ghost detective? But the execution.. Don't get me wrong, it had it's moments and a few great twists, but for the most time the story felt predictable, the characters felt very shallow and generic and they certainly  did not make me to want to know more about them. I really wanted to buy into the world, but I just could not feel it. Overall, the world building felt weak, if not rushed. It's like reading one of those books that you thought they were okay, but you just wished there was more to them because their description made you expect more. In short : -Average*The Gameplay*: As I mentioned earlier, the gameplay is point and click for 90% of the time. Those interested in L.A Noire/Sherlock games are out of luck, no observation needed what so ever, your only penalties are that you lose 'ranks' each time you make a mistake, that's pretty much it. Outside that, you go from area to area, you point and click at clues, you get clues, you point and click clues into a sequence and tadam, you're the Sherlock Holmes of the Underworld. Is it repetetive? Very. Is it a criticism? Not in this genre. Outside the point and clicking, you'll get to jog around the world for quite a bit from place to place with occasional simplistic puzzles that for the most part -you guessed it, require you to click on something and see magic happen. I gotta point out that the navigation after some point gets tiring and as a result of the world not feeling very lively, the game would have benefitted greatly from a fast travel option at some point. The devs put some interesting 'invisible' walls around the game so that as a ghost, you cant go through everything, you gotta go through the simplistic puzzles, of course and on top of that, those invisible walls and obstacles which make the world look 'cooler', also make it harder and pointlessly longer to traverse. The side missions around the world although they sometimes have an interesting backstory, are not very engaging for the most part. At some point, the invisible walls get very frustrating, especially once you get your teleport power as they get nonsensical. The weakest part of the gameplay is the combat. It's tedious and clunky. I wish I could demonstrate. There are demons, chasing you around, you have no weapons to fight so you have to hide and execute them from the back. The number of times I was spamming the execution button till it responded  but I left it (you gotta hold it) and failed the quick time event (YES, QTES BOIZ) which most likely resulted to my death or running around for 2 minutes as a result is immense. Not only that but the execution animations remain the same every time and its the same, over, and over, and over.. If you're adding combat, even stealthy combat into your game, you gotta be more creative. A huge spike of irritation comes in the last sequence of the game which becomes unforgivingly hard and 'timed'. I got so frustrated at that point that I finished it on another day. But that's literally the last 5 minutes. Overall, the gameplay, aside from the point and clicking is very average, with the combat being a gigantic unpleasant pain for the player.*Graphics* : Unimpressive. Although the main character model looks good, the world itself looks mostly uninspired and bland. The textures are pretty outdated and the effects were generic mostly. The character models outside the main character are mediocore. Your enemies are always the same kind, looking exactly the same like someone performed a kage bushin no jutsu (Yep, a Naruto reference). This unfortunately is the same also for the peope around you such as cops and even some ghosts are just so, so uninspired. Overall: Average (probably) for it's time, below average for what it is now.*Sound, Music, Voice Acting* : The sound of the game is actually good, I found myself enjoying each cutscene after an investigation was over as a result of the robust sound they provided. Its not ground breaking, but it felt more effortful. The music is very repetetive, its definitely not getting any 'extended' remixe's anytime soon, if ever. The voice was okay, the lip syncing was fine but if you were expecting L.A Noire, well, that's not the one.Is it worth your buy? For 29.99 I'd probably only recommend it to die hard point and click fans that wished for big publishrs to release point and click titles. For the rest, just wait for a good sale. The only thing the game has going for it is it's story which is not as interesting as the cover makes it to be. It's a missed opportunity for a game that would have great potential if you added better combat, a more fleshed out world and made people care for the characters.			"

But this game doesnt need that, you are supposed to figure out your murder and other murders aswell, And thats done really well!!I also enjoyed the story alot, i love how you walked around and found story about the city, Ronan himself and his wife.I didnt feel like the game was scary but i did have alot of goosebumps playing through this game, and that for one thing tells me it was an amazing game!!This game is a 10/10 for me.

												Good procedural detection sim. The gun in the detective's hand is not part of the game, fyi. This is about exploration and storytelling, not shooting things. Walking through walls is fun... when they let you.The story is alright. Nothing too moving. The metaphysics are wonky - while they give the Catholic Church a good character in the priest, they clearly didn't worry about keeping the theology of life after death in the traditional understanding. Took me out of the game a bit as your character tells lost souls to forgive themselves and they whoosh off in a bright light lol. Also, I wish the detective was more likable instead of some fedora-wearing clown. The graphics are ok, basically what is expected nowadays. However, some of the character models are pretty bad and voices randomly match up to models to hilarious results. I didn't encounter any gameplay issues. All around a competently made game. I had fun completing it, but would not buy except on sale at least half off.			"

												I was excited to try Murdered: Soul Suspect out as it had an interesting concept and Square Enix is one of those publishers whose name is a guarantee for a good game (well, most of the time it is). The game received average scores from critics upon its release, which is probably due to some false expectations. Worry not however, Murdered: Soul Suspect is a very good game, just don't make the mistake of expecting something it cannot provide.It features an 'over the shoulder' third-person view (as seen in Resident Evil 4 or Dead Space) that might lead you to believe that Murdered: Soul Suspect is an action orientated game. It isn't. It is an adventure game that focuses on collecting clues and coming to conclusions with a pretty good story unfolding as we progress.The introduction is one of the most unique in video game history: we witness our own murder. The protagonist, Detective Ronan O'Connor is killed by a masked assailant, who turns out to be the Bell Killer, a serial murderer who's been killing the citizens of Salem (a fictionalized version of an existing town in Massachusetts, USA) seemingly randomly. As a ghost, Ronan meets Julia, his dead wife, who informs him that he is stuck between the world of the living and the afterlife and cannot join her until he solves a mystery connected to his life that binds him there. It isn't hard to guess, that this is related to the Bell Killer case and we'll have to unravel it if we ever hope to leave this passageway between life and death and join our wife.First we have to get used to what it feels like being a ghost (similar to what Patrick Swayze experienced in the movie Ghost): we can't directly operate objects, can't even open doors, but we can pass through them, if they aren't parts of Salem's Old Town, where houses were christened in order to keep ghosts away (it's a clever way of creating barriers, restricting where the player can travel). There are several ghost specific skills we can use, including the ability to see (and talk to) other ghosts, telekinetic powers and even teleporting (most of these become availabe at certain points of the game). The best and most useful thing however is the ability to possess others, so we can mildly influence them and - even better - read their minds. There are parts where we can also possess a cat (!), which allows us to to reach otherwise inaccessible areas.There are several cases we can solve throughout the game (these are optional) besides our own and they are worth completing. In these cases we can help other ghosts by uncovering informations about their deaths and these side-quests are responsible for probably the best - both touching and satisfying - moments in the game, The old woman with the hair rollers, seen from the intro, for example is responsible for killing a girl who was partying too loud.Also there are little ghost tales (basically urban legends) known from horror stories. As soon as we find the given number of related objects (for example 7 pieces of boilers) we can listen to the narrated story related to that specific item (boiler -> A Watery Grave, in which a tenant finds out why the water coming from the local boiler turns brown). It's a nice little touch and adds much to the eerie atmosphere.The main story is interesting as well of course (of which I'm not going to tell anything about, for obvious reasons). Besides trying to figure out who the Bell Killer is we can find memories which unfolds the background story of the main characters (Ronan and Julia): we come to know how our hero, who had quite a criminal record, became a police officer and fell in love with Julia, the sister of one of his colleagues. It's like reading through Julia's diary, learning about her feelings towards Ronan, how she struggled with her own mental issues and how she finally said yes, when he asked her to become his wife, despite still not knowing much about Ronan. In the end Murdered: Soul Suspect provides us with a love story as well.As I mentioned before, the gameplay consists of collecting evidences and clues, talking to other people/ghosts (surprisingly the game doesn't punish us for jumping to wrong conclusions) and is occasionally interrupted by action/stealth segments. This is probably what might have confused some people deciding what genre this game is. In these parts we'll have to hide from or dispose of demons who are hunting ghosts like us. They come in 2 varieties: the floor demons (stationary, can be easily avoided) and floating demons. The latter type is far more dangerous, because they can quicky catch and kill us. In order to kill them we have to sneak behind them and press the right combinations of buttons. They can be lured away by possessing nearby crows or we can hide in ghost residue and - as strange as it sounds - inside humans, waiting for the ideal moment to strike. This is the part that received many criticism, because it goes against the regular gameplay of the game. In my opinion though it just gives some thrilling moments to the adventure. If you fail and die, nothing happens, the game lets you retry from the point the demons appeared. The end of the game also contains timed events, you'll have a limited amount of time beating your enemy, something that wasn't common until then, but it does make sense (it would feel odd, running around while irreversible events occur).The game features some amazingly well designed characters, from which I'd like to highlight Joy, the teenager medium whose facial expressions and acting are almost as real and good as of a real actor. Unfortunately the antagonist is not so memorable and it deducts from the overall value at the final confrontation. I personally also didn't find Ronan that interesting, They tried to made him unique with all the tatoos and extravagant clothing, but for me it just made him distant, someone who is hard to identify myself with.The visuals of the game are simply amazing: it uses Unreal Engine 3 and it really shows what this engine is capable of. Eveything looks amazingly beautiful and the eerie, foggy and dark (the whole game plays during nighttime) environment is especially noteworthy. You might want to turn bloom off and pick normal AA (anti-aliasing) instead of the other modes though for better quality (something which I figured out late in the game).

The sound is exceptionally good as well: the environmental audio is remarkable, finally a game where it pays off having a surround sound system. I remember playing Baldur's Gate and Thief the first time in 5.1 and the difference in sound was amazing. It applies to here as well. The noises in the cemetery, the owl hooting really makes you feel like you were there. While the music isn't memorable (actually I don't remember any of it) the characters voices are amazingly good, thanks to the great voice actors. Again, I have to mention Joy, whose voice actress, Cassidy Lehrman does an outstanding job.Overall, Murdered: Soul Suspect creates the impression of a game made with love, by an unknown developer, Airtight Games. It takes you on a memorable adventure, that's certainly not too long (took me 36 hours, but I explored every nook and cranny, something I usually do in good games) and unusual (an adventure game where you have no inventory - you're a ghost after all). Just don't make the mistake of confusing it with an action game (despite the over the shoulder point of view) and you are guaranteed to have a good time. On the other hand 29.99€ might be a bit too much for it (because of its relative shortness), so try to grab it during a sale.PROS+ very beautiful visuals+ good, enjoyable main plot, very good sidequests+ lots of investigating+ emotionally movingCONS- some underdeveloped important characters- might seem odd for lovers of classic adventure gamesRATING8/10			"

												How to say that and not to repeat myself? Well, what a pleasant surprise!This game is a mixture of L.A. Noire, Alan Wake and Heavy Rain, but it took only the good from them. If you are a fan of adventure, stealth, detective and mysterious games, this one is exactly what you look for.This game has great story, quite original plot twist, brilliant and believable characters and more than satisfying ending. Plus, graphics is eye-candy, music and sounds are anxious and the atmosphere is exactly how you would imagine in game like this.I finish this game almost in one turn and I enjoyed that since the beginning till the very end.Unfortunatelly, although this game is long enough for this kind of gameplay, the replayability is probably a no-no as it is common for the most of story-driven games. Even if you are a collector freak, you will probably not get over 12 hours of gameplay. So it is up to you if it is worth of 40 euros . Also, this is just another fast-cooked PC port, and even I haven't faced any technical issues like crashes, glitches and bugs, inability to remap your keys is a crime against humanity in 21st century - I strongly suggest gamepad.Last but not least, this game is not for everyone - if you are an action-oriented player, this is not for you. The pace is slow and it requires focus on details to solve the investigations. For someone like me it is an advantage, for others it can be a disadvantage.But for me, along with Wolfenstein New Order, this is another big ""YES"" this year.8/10 "

												A truly great game.  An engaging story told through a unique play style.  The only negative thing I'd have to say was that, for me, trading cards didn't work.  Other than that I couldn't put the controller down and finished the game in one sitting.			"

												Story starts mediocre, but keeps you interested.Possesion of people to find clues is fun.Helping other ghosts out is also fun, (something to do besides the main story).BUUUUTTTT the demons, oh my god. The demons kill this game, patch them out and you have a fun detective story, but as it is, it's a frustrating finger twister.Only because of this stupid enemys the game sucks.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is an interesting game. The gameplay mechanics are quite unique but the premise is fairly typical of a story with paranormal themes; a ghost partners up with the living to solve a series of murders. It's not mind-blowing but the way its handled in Murdered works quite well, mainly due to the decent voice acting, the supernatural abilities, and the clever art style that blends reality with a ghostly dimension.The majority of the game is quite fluid and offers little challenge (in a good way) but I have to say that the action sequences feel forced and really bring down the quality of this game. They break the flow of the story and the combat itself is often imprecise and sloppy for what are essentially quick time events. I figure that what happened to Murdered is the same as with Deadly Premonition in which this is something that the publisher demanded of the developers, who reluctantly and haphazardly complied by shoehorning in some janky action sequences in the final hours of development.If you're aiming for 100% completion I suggest collecting everything BEFORE entering the abandoned and decrepit house near the end of the game, as the final sequence will prevent you from collecting any more items within its level and there is no free-roaming afterward. I found this out the hard way, fortunately you can start a new game, collect what you've missed, and the relevant achievements will still unlock even if the collectibles counter has reset to zero.

												NOCLIP - The Game is a game about the ghost of a man who attemps to solve the mystery of his own death.Story - 9/10 Fitting uncountable cliches but is very well written. Being a mystery story, I suggest that you avoid spoilers. Atmosphere - 10/10 Very tight and immersive atmosphere.Graphics 9/10 - Looks like it should look in 2014, but a little edgy at some details.Sound 10/10 - I have nothing to complain about. Excellent voice acting.Playability 9/10 - No plotstoppers for me. NOCLIP - The Game has some minor issues, but does not desperately need a patch.Gameplay 2/10 - That is the reason for all the scathing reviews. In NOCLIP - The Game you play as a ghost. You can walk through walls and people - hence the name. You can also possess people to read their thougts, solve some puzzles and get your clues. You can even possess the cats and control them to access some areas. Later you get the ability to teleport.Clues - they are basically just collectibles with an occasional tiny puzzle attached to them. You cannot fail the puzzles, it is always just trial and error. Each investigation just consists of getting all these clues.The game is full of other collectibles. They unlock some background info and additional ghost stories.In attempt to make NOCLIP - The Game a bit challenging, there are fights against demons. You can beat them with a QTE or sneak your way around them. These fights are very repetitive and annoying. And that is basically it. No other gameplay elements. This is not an adventure game, this is just an interactive movie with a boatload of collectibles.At least the level design is very open and nonlinear, partially due to NOCLIP. You can also return to old levels for the collectibles you missed. Sadly, you cannot do this if you complete the game. there is only one save slot and the last savepoint is just after a point of no return, luckily the only one in the game.Conclusion: Do not buy NOCLIP - The Game for the gameplay, buy for the story and the atmosphere. But you can get that as well if you watch a decent walkthrough, which saves you some money. Actually playing it only benefits you with achievements and trading cards.Frankly, To The Moon has the same issue as NOCLIP - The Game: excellent story, but awful and repetitive gameplay, kind of like collectible hunting as well. Yet To The Moon is praised by the press. I understand the bad reviews for NOCLIP - The Game, but I can hardly understand the difference.			"

												An excellent game! It's short like people have said, but it was satisfying nonetheless! The game is priced correctly for such a short game (~8 hours), at 10 dollars off a normal priced one. It's not something you'll be playing for weeks and I am actually refreshed by that. It's totally story driven and doesn't pretend to be something it's not. The creepy atmosphere always had me wondering what was around the corner (or what was through the next wall!). I tried my best to guess who the killer was and by all accounts I failed at that. If you want to take a break from that FPS and sit down with a good story-driven game, pick this one up! Totally happy with every aspect!			"

												I really wanted to like Murdered: Soul Suspect.  The pun in the name alone gives it a couple of points straight off and I found the story enjoyable, with a well constructed supernatural mystery.  While the plot doesn’t break any new ground, it does make good use of its setting and archetypical characters.  But the game side of things really holds the experience back.  The puzzles are rather boring and quite easy, with most of the challenge being little more than a pixel hunt.  But what really ruined the experience for me were the tedious stealth sections that become longer and more frequent as the game goes on, without any variation to how they play out; they really interrupted an otherwise enjoyable story.Honestly, I wish this was a TV show or movie as it unfortunately doesn’t make for a terribly good video game.

												Absolutely no spoilers in this review.*Edited review now that I have finished the game. It took me about 7.5 hours(played it offline and steam doesn't track offline play) to complete this game and that is including time spent searching for collectibles and finding probably about 85-90% of them. So the complaints that the game is short are pretty valid. Had I skipped the collectibles I probably would have completed it in around 6 hours. That said, I loved every second of this game. The game probably doesn't have a lot of replay value either unless you want to go back through to finish the collectible stories or help any ghosts you passed up on your original playthough (there are only 3-4 of them though I think unfortunately.)So I played this game until 3 am and could barely drag myself away from the keyboard to go to sleep. I am absolutely enthralled by this game and I love it. If the rest of the game is as good as the first 4 hours I've played of it then it will easily be contender for my GOTY.The voice acting is awesome. A lot of the random civilians share the same voice actors but thats a minor thing. I recognize most of the random civilian voice actors from other big budget games. They are all great voice actors. So it seems the devs went with quality over quantity.The visuals are great. I feel like most unreal engine games have models that look like they are made of clay, but this game does not. The ghostly effects are really cool. The way the demons move is absolutely terrifying. Animations are great all around with the possible exception of some lip syncing here and there on the minor characters.The gameplay is fantastic. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the demons and being forced to run and hide until they lose your scent is pretty terrifying. Finding collectibles is awesome because once you find all of a set you unlock an audio short story with a piece of art and the stories are really REALLY good so far. Your ghost powers are pretty freaking awesome and the game rewards exploration with collectibles littered all over the levels. Helping other ghosts solve questions regarding their deaths and helping them move on is a great feeling. These little side mission stories are very well written and acted. Finding clues is somewhat similar to but much more enjoyable than it was in LA Noire. Once you find all the clues you do a little solving... puzzle I guess. You get three attempts to solve the puzzle. I don't know what happens if you fail all three attempts yet. But they are generally pretty self explanatory for the most part. It asks a question on the screen and you answer it by selecting the proper clue(s), sometimes in a certain order too. The game actually makes me feel like a ghostly detective. And the story itself is amazing so far. The 63/100 metascore completely baffles me because this game is great and easily one of the best gaming experiences of the year so far.I loved the ending. It wraps everything up in a smart way. I immensely enjoyed this game. If you have any interest in ghost stories or detective mysteries then you will love this game.			"

												Although I do like this game, I would not recommend anyone to pay full price for it. I purchased it from Humble Bundle when it was part of a $1 bundle and that's honestly about how much it is worth.The gameplay is okay. While the storyline is interesting, general mechanics of moving your character around can be quite a pain. You only play in third person and the camera moves way too fast; apparently mouse sensitivity only seems to affect cursor movements on selecting clues. The demons, though 2spoopy5me at times, seem like an unnecessary add-in to the game. Also, your LMB/RMB and any keyboard function will randomly stop working. The game also only auto saves, so if you end up having any issues like that, go ahead and prepare yourself for any progress you may lose when you have to restart the game.			"

												Spoiler Alert: The main character dies. The good news is that it happens right at the start of the game. Then the game gets going. However, unlike some God of War clone this isn't a revenge fueled bloodbath of carnage and destruction. There isn't an ocean of ""enjoy to destroy"" cannon fodder to kill/loot on the way to the final boss. This is a supernatural redemption story in the vein of Ghost or Always with a dash of The Frighteners thrown in for a bit of fun.The bulk of the game will be exploring mutliple crime scenes as you piece together not only the reason for your own murder, but the deaths of many fellow spirits that you encounter along your main quest. In some regards I am reminded of the forensic analyst role from Heavy Rain. Once you have gathered enough clues in the crime scenes you can attempt to discern the next location that your journey takes you. The good news is that, unlike Heavy Rain, this game does not rely on timing based quicktime events to tell the story.However, the only real combat in the game does rely on a tried and true quicktime mechanic. This involves sneaking up behind the occasional demon and performing a stealth kill sequence to banish it. This involves a random quicktime sequence where you a flashed a direction to press along with an appropriate button/key. Not that deep.TL;DR version: If you are a casual gamer that isn't looking to mindlessly button mash your way through a plotless demon horde this is a nice change of pace. If you want some thing procedural like the Kings Quest, Monkey Island or Quantic Dream created games (Indigo Prophecy, Heavy Rain, Beyond) then you'll enjoy the storytelling. It would really fit in nicely with that friend that owns all the Telltale Games titles. Just don't expect a lot of white knuckle fragging.			"

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Murdered Soul Suspect

			Murdered Soul Suspect proclaims to be an deactivate game while being a ghost with a rich story. Available on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/233290/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if...		

	Murdered: Soul Suspect is a console port detective game with a horroratmosphere that plays more like an interactive movie than a game.  Right off the bat, I was unimpressed by the whopping 30 frames per second that this game runs at, followed shortly by the delayed lineup of subtitles to speech.  	The story was cheesy and doesn't fit with the objective of the game;  starting out by stating that your ultimate goal is to reunite with a lost love,but then not mentioning that relationship for the bulk of the game.  As for the gamebeing a detective game, I would disagree with that and state that it is morelike a hidden object game that requires you search out 'clues' in a predeterminedlocation.  There is no deduction needed; all the clues are in one place, and the game holds your hand by leading you to the next clue and askingrediculously obvious questions.  	The ghosts, while contributing to the atmosphere, did absolutely nothingto add to the game.  For the most part, they were all from the same time period,and were supposed to add a spooky element, but as you are also playing as a ghost, and they disappear when you get close, they were more of a waste of timethan anything else.	I enjoy watching movies, but I buy games in order to, oh I don't know, play a game!  This game played like a cinematic movie, with about 20-25%of the game actual gameplay, and the rest being cinematic movies or dialogue.  Being made to move all across the mapp to get to the next action point does notcount as gameplay;  it is wasting time.	If you are interested in the story of this game, I would recommend goingto YouTube and watching the cinematics strung together rather than buy this game.It treats you, the player, as if you are an idiot that can't figure out anythingfor yourself.  Graphically the game gets by, as well as the level design.  The story is acceptable, but what little gameplay there is designed for thosethat can't deduce anything for themselves.  As a game, I cannot recommend this, if it can even be called a game.For more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of what I cover in my video.

												- Investigating a murder scene involves picking up a certain amount of clues (walk around and click) and then pick out the 3 most relevant ones (Why yes, 'Dead Girl' is indeed a good clue in said girl's murder...). TL;DR: short, boring, doesn't make you feel like you solved anything.- Some people in this game get killed for the dumbest reasons.- 'Fight' sequences with demons are nothing more than QTEs that will slow you down and don't add much to the game.- Even though this game is only 5-6 hours long, I've had to convince myself to keep going and finish it.

												Got this in the humble bundle so I don't regret it entirely BUT within 10 mins I experienced two glitches that meant I had to restart from checkpoints. Other than that the game is basically a long cutscene with gameplay elements strapped on to make you feel like your doing something. The most annoying thing as that crimescenes can be pretty easily figured out but some mockingly require for you to locate every peice of evidence no matter how completely useless.Do not buy unless you like pressing 'x' when you're told to press 'x'			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a story-driven third-person investigative adventure game with some stealth elements. You take the role of Ronan O'Connor, a former bad boy turned good guy. Everything begins seconds after you've just been thrown from a fourth story window by the game's primary antagonist. The fall almost kills you and the subsequent bullets to the chest finish the job, meaning you play through the entire game as a ghost. Murdered: Soul Suspect plays out like a puzzle game along the lines of L.A. Noire. As a detective Ronan must uncover clues and evidence to track down the Bell Killer. As a ghost in limbo, Ronan has a number of abilities at his disposal. Although he cannot walk through external doors unless they are opened by someone else, once inside a building Ronan can walk through walls and other obstacles. He can fall great distances and not get hurt and he is able to possess people to read their thoughts, influence their actions and peek at their notes or at their computer screens. He can even possess other creatures such as cats to get to hard to reach areas. In addition to the primary plotline being very interesting, the game generally has a very well-designed backdrop, numerous side quests, and superfluous opportunities to discover more about the characters and places featured in the game.Another part of Murdered that works pretty well is the look of the game. When Ronan walks through the streets of Salem, he sees a mixture of how it is now interspersed with what it looked like during the witch trials of the 17th century. The modern Salem is in full color, but the old Salem is in blue and white, and the contrast is striking. The character models and cut scenes are also rendered well. Really, the production values for Murdered are about as good as you’re going to see in a game. The audio multiplies the eerie feeling as well, with some haunting background music. The music, combined with the sound effects works marvellously.I really liked the look, the atmosphere, and the story behind Murdered: Soul Suspect.Although at times the pace of the game can seem a little slow, I have found that Murdered: Soul Suspect to be an enjoyable detective experience – even if it is somewhat simplified detective work.If you’re a fan of mysteries, Murdered: Soul Suspect would be a worthy purchase. Overall 8/10.			"

												The best way to describe this game would be to say it's a mix of Ghost Trick and Silent Hill with a little Ace Attorney in there.  I enjoyed my time with the game, mostly to see how the story unfolds. The gameplay is nothing too special and mostly linear unless you are going for collectables (there are a lot). The writing is good for the most part but the delivery can be a bit strange sometimes. It took me just under six and a half hours to beat the game and I would recommend if you enjoy the games mentioned earlier. I also recommend going in without knowing too much about the game, which is why I don't want to write too much here.			"

												Right....first things first, this isnt a title you should get for full price but at least it was only half of that when it came out so I can respct that....but still think its not worth the price unless its on sale. This game has alot of mixed reviews but none great ones, this is because it falls very short on some expectations gameplay-wise because its freaking boring and empty. What isnt boring and empty is the story....I could go so far as to compare this as a story driven game. It can be very much enjoyble if you are not bothered by the ""run everywhere and pick everything up"" <basicly all the gameplay in a nutshell for this game. Of course there are some ""detective"" work though its basicly click on the words or events which are related (somehow) or that describe this scene by clicking words like ""Panic"", ""Begging"" or ""Happy"". Its impossible to fail the game, you could get caught by demons, click on all wrong ""detective"" events and it will just keep giving you chances to try again unles you do it. For my overall opinion I guess I can call this a relaxing game with basic puzzle-solving elements that you can stare at and let your mind go blank, its not a bad game even though its no challange and one time I nearly got stuck possessing a woman walking outside of a gas station. I enjoyed the story and there is a hell of alot of stuff collectables you can pick up and read. Thought its always worth finding all the collectables to unlock a ""ghost story"" audio, they can be a little cliche but damn they are entertaining to listen in. Oh and one last thing, sometimes its hard finding stuff to click on like clues, the detection on some of these are really small but they are always in the tiny area you search in....though just a heads up for the last thing you do near the end of the game where you only have 3 seconds to find something to click on... clue: ""hand"" Literally impossible with the 3 seconds you have to click on this tiny ♥♥♥ thing, I had to google it after clicking everywhere. >.<			"

												4/10  Murdered: Soul of Garbage CollectorI rated the gameplay with 5 and the story with 5. This game got 1/5 for gameplay 3/5 for story.-The game basically holds your hand through the whole game. There is no punishment for getting anything wrong, and some clues are really stupid. I figured out the run button long ago and the game tried to teach me that after a while.-Gameplay sucks, basically you run around and collect garbage. That is what you do, the only thing that made it even get that score was the story which isn't that great.-Characters are all have the same faces with the same thoughts. Salem had too many people with the same faces that if the killer was one of them, we wouldn't find him.-Demons are just in the way, they didn't make the gameplay any better. It made it worse since the design for the Ghost things to hid in was far away from you, or covered by a wall, or all of them in the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ room which the demons don't even go in. Ravens that supposed to help you are either far away or the range of their screams doesn't reach the demon that you wana kill. And quick time event is not my idea of a fun game. Wish they didn't created the so called demons because they always delayed me from continuing the storyline. Boring @ss obstacles on the ground, forcing you to go around them because they are demon pits or something.-All the cats have the same color which is black in Salem.-Some places you think it should be possible to teleport to but you can't even though you did it during a story mode.-Some escorting missions are stupid and  HOW the hell would July sneak into the church without the police even noticing her?- there is a Ghost train, so how the hell does an object have a ghost? Why doesn't animals get ghost too, since objects with no soul can have ghosts.  Throw the logic on the ground when you play the game.- You can't recollect the other stuff once you reach a check point in the game. I tried to see the story about the (Need Gas) but with the game desgin you MUST reply the whole thing once you enter the Judgment house. Another example of  terrible game design (wish they had the chapter saving to return to the point you need to finish any achievement you missed during your first play through) instead you have autosave.+ The only thing I liked about this game was the graveyard thief story and nothing else.I pre-ordered this game and just got to play it. Wait for a sale to buy it, and don't waste more than 10$ on it.			"

												I rather enjoyed this game. I enjoyed the story, and the level of player engagement seemed spot-on for this quick, story-driven game.On the other hand; I did encounter some repetitiveness in the dialog after a bit. The puzzle solving felt a little forced, and didn't have alternative scenarios if you chased down the wrong lead.Gameplay: I usually don't like the over-the-shoulder gameplay style. I found it gave me some issue when trying to interact with some objects, but it wasn't too obtrusive. Combat: The enemies were laughable, all you had to do was sneak up behind them and perform an action - a random button/mouseclick which is a direct port over to the button/paddle on the console. I found these enemies to be more of an obsticle than an actual challenge. But I belive this is intended, as to keep the game story focused and not combat driven. I actually salute the developers for remaining story focused and not bogging down the player with ubsurd mechanics or prolonged battles... or health bars for that matter (You're already dead! No health for you!)Collectables & Achievements: Many players have complained that they were unable to go back and complete the collectable achievements, as this has a very linear progression in the story. This will often require a second playthrough, stopping at each location, and clearing the zone to ensure you have collected everything. I kept catching myself thinking in normal gameplay rules, where I would walk around walls and objects. Just remember, you can walk through that. There are still barriers - ghostly walls and santified buildings - that prevent you from passing through everything.Due to a bug in the final fight, I didn't finish the game. After many many attempts, I kept starting the scene in a void zone, where I couldn't escape, or didn't have enough time to complete my objective after I escaped. I have not read of this bug happening to other players. YMMV. I did see alot of weird, creepy stuff in this game, but this is the only only thing I would call buggy.			"

												You're a cop, you just got killed and you have to investigate your own murder and the case of the serial killer 'The Bell', who's going around killing young women in barbaric ways and slaughtering anyone who gets in his way. You'd think being dead would put something of a cramp on your investigative abilities, but no, it seems all the best cops are the dead ones. Maybe it's because it's late at night, but everybody except you seems to be doing about as much police activity as can be accomplished by standing around rubbing their noses.You run into a teenage medium called Joy who's looking for her missing mom, and she comes in really handy for opening drawers, crossing glowing holes into hell that try and suck Ronan down, and so that Ronan's musing is cut by about 20%. The rest of the time she's a regular whiny teenager you have to play daddy wolf to and pretend you give a pooper about her mom. The game revolves around investigating crime scenes - yours and other people's - talking to the many ghosts in Salem, uncovering lost memories, being the cause of poltergeist activity and posessing people to read their minds.Occasionally to try and make you feel like there's more to the game than prodding at a crime-scene and musing over a cigarette, Demons spawn. Since they just float around on a set path looking for something to kill, and you creep up from behind to kill them, it feels very tacked on and a really crappy attempt at adding any challenge to the game.All in all, the game feels a lot like an interactive horror movie, but it's a GOOD movie, and it feels like worthwhile interaction. Voice acting and character animation of faces is great. Is it worth full-price? That's a personal thing, seeing as it's quite a short game. But if you can get it at a discount, it's definitely a worthwhile way to spend some game-time.Get it if you like: Detective games, Violent murder, Interaction, Creepiness, A good movie, Collecting stuff.Don't get it if you like: Action, Challenge, Long games.7/10			"

												I was really surprised with this little gem. It wasn't the most amazing game I'd ever play but it was unique for its genre. Square Enix does a good job of finding games that aren't like every other game you find. The story was good, I liked the characters, the collectables are good. Just remember that if your going for 100% guide then don't forget to get to use a collecable walkthrough for the museum level as you can't redo that level. I almost went for all the collectables but decided against it at the end. I like the mystery elements mixed with the ghost side. The combat system was a bit dull but at least it doesn't affect the game as a whole. The mystery could have been better but the ambience of the whole thing was still good. All in all, a good game for the 4 bucks I spent on it.			"

												I wouldn't go as far as to say this is a game, it's more of an interactive movie that involves you, finding clues and piecing them together. Reminds me of Heavy Rain but without everything being a quick time event. It's pretty short it only took me 5 hours to complete and that was me collecting stuff and doing some of the side quests. If you can pick it up cheap enough I'd say go for it.			"

												Its still as amazing as ever! I had originally gotten this on my Xbox360 and it was a ton of fun. I saw it on sale during the Halloween 2015 sale and picked it up pretty cheep, considering the original price. I love ghost stories, horror, and killing demons (Diablo). This game has ghosts and demons (which you can choose to avoid or execute, depending on where you are), I found I actually had to execute them to continue at some spots further in.The game begins with Ronan falling through a window and narrating a bit, you also get to learn more about Ronan's (life/ backstory). Considering the fact that he's the main hero and the playable character thats a good thing and its also important.Gameplay is what really got really got me hooked. The town of Salem has areas for doing detective work and its freeroam in the Hub section and the areas (To an extent, its not Final Fantasy or anything, but you do get to explore). The character is always seen in the third person point of view (camera is behind the character).Interactive- You can go around and talk to certain people or listen in on their conversations. You can ""investigate"" and search for clues- which you'd then use to solve a case or continue on in the story. Collectables are always fun, but can be a pain to collect as they are actually hiding and not always in a typical spot. Cutscenes are interactive! You can usually choose what you want Ronan to say or ask next. Nothing major, but heck its something.Powers, well you get to do a lot of stuff later, but when you just start off you can already possess people and cats (no, seriously). You can also mind read or try to manipulate their thoughts. Story? Spoilers! You die first thing and become a ghost- woot! You're also a detective of the Salem police department. You also have to try to solve your own murder and many others. The game is great and recomendable, but I do have one problem. I had chugging/ lag while on my Xbox and was hoping that'd be fixed on the pc version. That was not the case, and I still have the same annoying chugging/ lag. Its not always while going to a different section of the Hub town, but it does happen a lot in the Hub area. It also happens in other spots, but it rarely happens in places like the graveyard or appartments. So, thats a bit of a bummer, but its still a great game.			"

												Don’t purchase this game if you expect a lot of gameplay. It’s a narrative gaming experience which involves looking around for clues and solving a few simple puzzles. Overall I had fun and when I wanted a break from action-packed games I played Murdered Soul Suspect. Let’s see the pros and cons.Pros:* The game engine: the game was developed using Unreal Engine 3, one of best engines there is. The game never crashed and I was able to play it with maxed settings and 60fps.* Visual: even though the textures aren’t exactly top notch, the motion (especially the particles) and the lightening are great.* Original concept: a detective solving his own murder, passing through walls and talking to other ghosts and mediums. That’s gotta be enticing.Cons:* The “mind reading” feature: I was expecting that every NPC would have unique thoughts and a lot of embarrassing things would be exposed to the players. That’s not what happens. By using the “mind read” in several different NPCs you might end up hearing the exact same thoughts. It appears they are randomly generated and distributed amongst the NPCs. That was definitely a disappointment for me. What’s the point of mind reading if they don’t appear to be real people, but rather randomly generated walking robots that spurs platitudes?* The linearity: it is not possible to leave an area and return to the investigation later. I reckon this is a game based on narrative, but other developers managed to create narrative games without recurring to such strict storytelling (for instance, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter).* Looks like the developers tried too hard to make the game “PG-13”. The NPCs don’t do anything interesting. You never see them doing anything out of the ordinary (unless you find a ghost. Apparently everyone who is naughty ends up dead too). It’s like the whole town of Salem is composed of boy scouts.Other than that the game is fun. I hope to see a sequel that will address the abovementioned flaws. There’s a lot of potential for a series.			"

												This game was fantastic! Yes, it's linear. No, you don't use your ghost powers to do anything especially interesting. Yes, it's basically a supernatural Heavy Rain. But HOLY CRAP is it engaging! The storytelling is 10 times better than David Cage could ever hope to get. You'll think you know where the story is going about 2 hours in, but the way it uses it's red herrings are a twist that, while not mind blowing, is certaintly entertaining and worthwile. It's a noir-tinged, funny, and soaked in a delicious horror atmosphere. If you liked any of Quantic Dream's output, you'll adore this.			"

												Pretty cool game, but veeeeery short. Worth no more than $10.Let's make this quick, eh?Good Stuff-Neat story.-Likable characters.-Actually have to pay attention/look for clues.""Eh"" Stuff-Combat/stealth (if we can call it that) is subpar.-Somewhat repetitive after the first couple chapters.-Minor glitches, but nothing game breaking.Bad Stuff-SO FRIGGEN SHORT. Finished after only a couple hours.-The ending. It's horrid. Could have been so much cooler, but fell short.-Little to no replay value after you beat the game.Overall, it's a neat game with a cool concept. Definitely not for a hardcore, challenge driven gamer, but it is something to show to your non-gamer pals. I give it a thumbs up, only because Steam doesn't have a ""so-so"" option. The cons aside, it may be worth picking up if you've got spare change and want a new game to fark around on.			"

												If you like the Blackwell series (and I would heartily reccomend the Blackwell games, I bought them on GOG not Steam), you will likely enjoy this odd beast. I got it in the half price sale and consider it worth the 12 some quid, but I wouldn't reccomend buying it at full price since it's a fairly short game and like most adventure games, low on replayability.This is a good game with some terrible game mechanic design decisions.Pros:Decent storyEnjoyable charactersInteresting ideas explored throughout - enough to overshadow the cons, for my money.Cons:Clatty interface, probably made worse by poor porting to keyboard and mouse. If you use a pad on your PC, you may have no issues.Some really annoying QTE's bracketed with unskippable cutscenes - especially the finale which should have been exciting and ended up being an exercise in impotent rage management.Unskippable end credits that run for 15 mins  - laughably bad decision.

												A very nice take on the point and click adventure games. It has what make those a games great. A great story, with plenty of supernatural, and creepy atmosphere to pull you into it. The acting is fenomenal, you do want to know what happend to this cop, and what will be the end. Sadly like most adventure games, suffers from the same weeknesses, and I am talking about the gameplay, just like other games of this kind, like The Walking Dead, great story but not much gameplay. The same thing happens here, I think that the game would have seen more success as an episodic game. Even with these problems, and it depenps if you consider this issues a weekness, you will enjoy the game. The story is more than capable to drive you  into it. If you still have doubts, wait for a price drop, but don't miss the chance to play it. Too bad  the studio behind the game, Airtight Games is no longer around. Hopefully there will be some sort of sequel, one can hope, after all, hope dies last.			"

												For those, like me, who enjoy problem solving games, this was great. It wasn't an intense action game, but simple observation which I enjoyed.Over the course of the game, you can uncover ghost stories as well that aren't even critical to the gameplay, just bonuses. That little mechanic made it feel more immersive considering the story wasn't riding on backtracking or extra digging.Something that stood out for me in the way of dialoge was that everyone who speaks doesn't necessarily talk one at a time. Characters will get cut off and complete their thoughts later in a way that doesn't sound like a script nor rehearsed, with exception to the protagonist's classic-detective style inner monolouges.However, the quick-time controls felt awkward, the game was too short (beat it within twelve hours with a majority of the achievements done), and many ""clues"" didn't seem to make sense when trying to piece crimescenes together. The promise of unique abilities (""personal strengths becoming abilities) was limited to maybe one or two involving revealing information (which felt closer to the protagonist's job rather than his actual strengths). Even only one other ghost displayed only one unique ability that didn't seem to connect to their character. All of the other abilities you gain belong to the other ghosts you find as well, making the protagonist (and the other ghost with a unique ability) possess very cookie-cutter characteristics.Very little direction is taken towards obstacles you run into like the demons, spiteful cops, or paranoia plaguing the area, thus leaving much more to be desired in character development.""Extra"" characters aren't even kept within the game for very long, making it feel as though there are only four real characters, and many filler characters.I ""did"" enjoy the game and do recommend it for those who enjoy dark, investigative, or easy-paced games. Sadly this has little to no replayability and would wait for it to go on sale for $15 or under given it's short story and neglect to several details I mentioned earlier.			"

												If your entire gaming life does not evolve around; no scoping, noob tubing, running and gunning and you would like to play an adventure game with a dark side then you will enjoy this.Its one of those games that you can kick back with a controller, play it and get some enjoyment out of it. The game does have an eerie feel to it, but nothing that’s going to ruin your trousers.The cases are a little easy to solve. But I think the goal was to make a game that was fun to play and not something that you would get frustrated with and stop playing half way through.  "

												The main problem with the game is that it tries to be a bit of everything. I hated the demons, because I was interested in the investigation and doing the side quests and finding about about the other ghosts. Still, despite the problems, I liked the game. The story was interesting and I liked exploring the town. It would have been fun to have more chances to play as a cat. Not having a chapter selection in the menu was a really bad choice from the developers, so if you're aiming at 100%, make sure you have everything before the point of no return where the final act starts (the game warns you about it).

												This is an amazing game. It felt different from other games I d played mainly thanks to the ghost walk through normal walls mechanics that create a unique path. Overall time to beat is probably shorter than mine, I have replayed quite a couple of levels to hunt for collectibles, some of them more than twice. I highly recommend it: it s got ghosts, witches, demons, murder solving. Why play this game: you wont get to shoot anything, but you ll get to destroy a handful of demons (damn these QTEs)			"

												Get it when it is cheap - it is short and has no replay value beyond collecting things, and you cannot revisit earlier areas after reaching the finale. Overall, it is a pretty decent unfinished business ghost story. It comes equipped with the ex-con cop, lovable scamp sidekick, some plot twists, and posessing cats and people to get to locations your short-range ghost teleport can't reach. The setting was interesting to me, and there were some small jokes in a few levels such as ghost hunters in the cemetary, and a ghost right in front of the camera smiling and waving - that nobody can see.The levels are fairly well designed, although some clues require more accuracy in placement with how close to other clues they are. The demons were interesting at first but quickly became just an annoyance once you near the end of the game. Most areas are once and done, although you do revisit one of the opening areas as part of the plot and can return to areas up until the finale.This is mostly an adventure game - the only notable action sequences are exorcising demons, a single section where you have to deal with a ghost train ( which was pretty neat ), and the finale, and even then they are more or less quick time events. The rest of the game is spent navigating the hub You are unable to change the controls if you use the mouse and keyboard. The game itself doesn't have too many poor performance spots aside from some area transitions and, at least in my case, antialiasing smoke/fog during the opening sequence.The collectables were mostly pointless - the story parts, such as the water tank, rifles, saws, gas tanks, etc. were brief ghost stories - generic, but not poorly written.Overall, I feel the main issue is how short the game is - the entire plot encompasses a single night and will only really take three or four hours at most, and feels like a large chunk of that time was exorcising demons and getting to the next area. If you remove the travel time and scavenger hunt, it was rather short and would probably fit inside two hours.			"

												Just wow.This game is such an amazing and unusual experience. A grim detective story with such a vivid characters, voice acting and visual style. This is a great game, which contsits a half of exploration and a half of interactive movie. Exploration, even if limited, is done in really interesting plain - you're a ghost, and thus you can walk through walls, collect and read ghostly notes and hints, learn about places and their stories. You will investigate some simple problems by collecting evidence, looking and listening. The 'movie' part is done nice. The plot is pretty interesting, although so simple. Sometimes I was wondering, when my character will figure out the killer. I mean, I partly looked through it before the game called the killer. However even by figuring out what was happening I've never seen who exactly was the one to blame. And there was yet another unexpected twist. So even if plot is slightly predictable, It's written dam-good. Definitely a movie I liked to play.I loved cats in this game. Just like cats should be in games. Fast, black, agile, a little glitchy. What I didn't like about them was how people react them. Like zero F-s were given that night.I loved that monitor reference in police station. You'll know when you see it. Square Enix, oh you.Now to the downsides:1. This is a game best played with a gamepad. I mean it. It wasn't made to be on PC, it was made to be cross-platform. So even if it supports keyboard+mouse, use a controller, if you have one.2. There is no free roam after you've reached the last checkpoint. The main menu will offer you to continue, but this is merely a last checkpoint, no way to collect something you've left for later.3. Not sure about the reason, but sometimes I've experienced minor graphic glitches while ui showed/hided collected piece of evidence. Might be just my laptop.4. Repetative faces of pedestrians. There's something like two or three models for each gender. Nuff said.5. Really strange placement of hiding spots. Some places have plenty of them, but never needed. The others feature but a few spots, but you will need more if you need them. And some are too far to jump between them.6. Font. Handwriting fonts in games never work as easy-to-read fonts. And this game has tons of handwritten text. Although I managed to read without problems, some might have them.But in the end, I really enjoyed this game. It's certainly a great experience.			"

												Writing this review immediately after finishing the game.Murdered: Soul Suspect is a third person adventure, with quite a few aspects of the horror genre. The game is rather short (Roughly five hours), and the combat in the game is simply sneaking up behind the enemies and pressing a combination of buttons. Although the combat was a bit repetitive, the story itself was rather interesting for me. You play as a recently murdered detective named Ronan, who is has been left behind as a ghost in the mortal world, because he has unfinished business, which won't allow him to join his wife; who has already moved on. In order for Ronan to move on he has to find out the mystery behind his killer. As he is a ghost, he can only tamper with very few things in the mortal world, so with the help of a young girl named Joy, they work together to unravel the mystery between the Bell Killer murders, as well as the identity of the killer.7.5/10			"

(+)Interesting fact in this game is the lead character, whom you identify yourself with - or try to, has a kind of standardish background. (-)For me this background thing is the only negative critics I can tell you about this game, because the riddles and cases to solve redeem the background.(++)Cases: Logically, not frustrating.Clear recommendation to buy !Thank you for reading.

												THIS GAME IS BROKEN - I really like the game. The atmosphere is great and some of the mechanics are very clever but it simply does not work. On one side quest I left the ""area"" before completing the investigation and now it does not function. From researching the problem, the only fix is to START ALL OVER AGAIN. Due to this being a fairly pathetic console port, there is no option to save, so any glitch gets you starting from a checkpoint at the beginning of an area at best. True problems and you are done. The thing that really did it for me was a glitch in the main story line at the police station. I could not finish a scene because (after researching what I may be doing wrong) I discovered that an event was not triggering properly to let me continue. So I restarted at last checkpoint but the event still did not trigger. The only solution? START THE GAME OVER AGAIN.Sorry guys. This game had great potential and even solid execution in many ways bit if the game does not work FIX IT! "

												I have mixed feelings about Murdered: Soul Suspect. I enjoyed the game with it's very unique style, and the story full of twists and turns, so I do recommend it, but there are a few issues that prevent this from being as good as it could have been.Some of the puzzles require you to choose ""most relevant"" clues, so you might pick 3 from 10, but it often feels like guesswork. Not guesswork into your character or the story, but guesswork into the developers minds. This can lead to frustration, but doesn't prevent progress.If you miss a clue earlier in the game, even though you can return to that location, the clue isn't always there. A lot of people get stuck on the 15/16 issue with Apartment 4A, for example, and that was the one clue preventing me from a perfect score. The final area does give you a warning message, but once you enter it, you cannot return to a previous save to hunt down any remaining clues. As soon as you enter the area, you are either choosing to give up on side quests, or planning to replay the entire game again. Those issues aside, it's a great experience and worth playing if you can pick it up on sale.			"

												So you are a tattooed loose cannon detective that no one likes and with some chips on your shoulder. You get killed early in the game and you become a ghost with a ghostly cigarette that never extinguishes; The point of the game is to solve your own murder.Has a Quantum Leap feel about it. As well as doing your own stuff you help others solve their murders too so they can 'move on'.The graphics are perfectly fine, quite good actually. Voice acting is good. Dialogue generally pretty decent. The story is just about interesting enough... sometimes its a bit weak. The 'ghost lore' that you are introduced too early on is quite interesting.Some gameplay elements are dull, such as the collectables (are they interesting in any game though?) You do a lot of walking around considering your ethereal. Although the exploration is okay mostly, and you are rewarded usually by a collectable. Collectables are all blocks of text that I didn't bother reading - Some collectables actually give you a spooky short story not related to the main game but related to the town it's set it in, which are actually quite good to listen to. The story about a man complaining his shower water was a brown colour to his landlord for months, when they eventually find a rotting body in the water tank was my favourite.The exciting (or what should be exciting) gameplay elements are not used enough or not done that well. For example, you can possess cats, which allows you to get into different areas but this is presented to the player on a plate - As in the area you need to get to is ahead and here is a cat purrfectly placed next to it so you can just possess it and move on.... Developers could have expanded this and purrrhaps forced the player to think for themselves a bit and actually go find a cat.The detective investigations.... I can only compare it to LA Noire as its similar but its no where near done as well. Clues are obvious and all you are doing is walking around pressing a button on every clue - The game even tells you there are 7 clues or 8 clues so you know when you are finished and can conclude the investigation, unlike LA Noire where you may have overlooked a vital clue and actually ♥♥♥♥ up the investigation entirely - So there is no risk for the play basically - So investigations are boring and are purely there as plot lines.Then there are some fun gameplay elements. Walking through walls is brilliantly done. Hiding inside people, listening to their thoughts (although many NPC's only have 2 thoughts in their head at any one time) poltergeist-ing TV's and radios.Banishing demons is quite a nice break from the normal walking around too - Although its just a quicktime button press (which you get ample time to do) it at least slows you down and makes you think a little bit about how to progress.So even though it doesn't challenge the player at all, or break any gaming barriers down I'd still recommend it to anyone who likes a story driven game with a mildly disappointing ending.

The story about the city makes some links between facts in the game (now days) and the past. There are a few combats, but all are easy. I got a very few bugs ( one or two, I think), but nothing important. An easy game, easy cases to resolve. The game runs in AMD Eyefinity very nice w/o any mods. The end of game is very reflexive.

												This is really a different type of game unlike any I have played before.  Basically you go around collecting items (alot of optional items) to get stories to read and unlock.  Often times you have to find clues and piece them together so the evidence tells a story helping you in your search for the serial killer.  While the game looks pretty decent graphically, there are times where things just fell off.  For example the killer could have just murdered someone in the town yet some of the peoples mood in the town does not reflect that.  There are times when some townspeople say the same exact thing by the same voice actor or actress.  One time near the end of the game I read this old ladies mind and had the voice of a teenage girl.  There are somel moments in the game where you have to be stealthy to avoid demons and you do have the option of killing them .   As the game progressed I was more interested in how the story would develop and there was a nice plot twist towards the end.   Its a fairly short game which was the main reason I played this game after reading alot of less than positive reviews.  I'll give the game 5/10  and recommend buying it if you can get it really cheap.			"

												Although there are many issues with this game, I really do recomend it. It's not great, but it is worth playing.The main problem of the game is that it feels really underdeveloped.The story is short, I think you can finish it in around 5 hours if you rush through the game and skip all the collectibles.There are some pretty useless mechanics included, like, for example, reading people thoughts. At first I was quite excited that I can possess pretty much any NPC and read its mind, but I quickly discovered that most of the thoughts are repeating itself and they are absolutely useless.There are enemies in this game. One kind of enemy to be exact. Demons are annoying addition that doesn't introduce anything to the game except from dull idea of banishing them. You just walk behind a demon, hold R to start banishing and then press mouse button + direction key that pops up on screen. It's excatly as exciting as it seems. Not at all. No thrill, no fear, not even a startle from some jumpscare. They appear, you banish and move on. They could remove them completely from the game as they pose no threat at all and only thing that they manage to achieve is to annoy you.Controls are pretty bad. Especially menu controls. You can use mouse only to point the option you want, to select it you have to use your keyboard.Many technical problems, bugs. Sometimes gamebreaking.The game is faaar to easy.What I enjoyed about the game is the story itself. However short it is, it was really entertaining for me. I love the atmosphere of Salem. Conducting the investigation even though it could be more complex. That's what basically makes the game worth playing for me: the story and the world presented in it. I do recomend the game, however not for its full price. If you see it on some good sale go for it, but else just wait for the price to go down.			"

												As the game begins we find Ronan exploding out of a shattered 4th story window after a confrontation with a shadowy figure.  He awakens to find himself temporarily disembodied but that state soon becomes permanent upon the arrival of the Bell Witch Killer.  Shot 7 times with his own gun, Ronan must now solve the mystery of his own murder and in the process uncover dark secrets that have haunted Salem for centuries.Quite a build up eh?It is and it's worthy of it.  The story is intriguing with twists, turns and dead ends to thrill any devotee of the mystery genre.  Add in a tastefully done horror component supported by an eerie backdrop of a dark and gloomy Salem complete with lost souls, haunted houses, and frightful demons.The game is gorgeous even on my creaky old gaming laptop ( circa 2008 ) and the controls simple.  You're led on a path similar to the Call of Duty campaign modes on the hunt for clues to your own murder.  On the way you'll find ample opportunity to complete side quests but be warned if like me you seek to earn all of the Steam achievements you must be methodical in your approach.  For me it took 2 playthroughs as there is no quicksave nor any way to go back once you've completed the final chapter of the game. It's a casual game but it can be maddening at times.  For one, you have no onscreen map nor any way to mark your progress toward achievements.  Meaning you'll spend a lot of time running in circles to find the way forward and backtracking for that one elusive clue.Then there's the demons.  I understand that a game in the horror genre has to have some kind of threat but they're all over the place.  It breaks the flow of the narrative and it's jarring to go from a casual detective story to a flurry of button mashing every 10 minutes.  Still, even with the more ""gamey"" aspects, it's still more ghost story than game which explains some of its mechanical shortcomings.  My first playthrough was simply for the sake of taking it all in.  The second was purely for my own desire to see everything and in the process earn every Steam achievement.All tolled I've spent a bit over 30 hours and enjoyed every minute of it.			"

												just finished the game and got to admit, it got me addicted to the story like a drug. Couldn't think of anything but wonder what the next clues will add to the story. To sum it up:Story: 9/10Although it's a typical murder investigation, playing as a ghost trying to uncover clues makes the mystery more interesting. The side stories obtained by finding all the hidden objects on each map are very spooky and a good bed time story to wet the bed.Gameplay: 6/10Although it's nice to find clues and unfold the mystery, it's veeery repetitive and lacks diversity. Not much you can do but run through walls, teleport short distances and kill a few demons. other than that, you get bored fast from gameplay and you just want to finish the story faster.Graphics: 8/10I can't say it's bad, i can't say it's good. For a 2014 game, objects are edgy, characters lack emotions, but still, it looks ok. It's the bad textures from clues that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.Overall, i enjoyed the game very much, considering i got it on sale. I recommend it just to unwind from stressful multiplayer games and submerge in a story filled with mysteries. PS: could play a cat.			"

												This game has a great concept, a captivating artstyle, and a fairly interesting story. The voice acting is good, the characters are overall quite believeable, and you get quite invested in the game's narrative.On the negative side, the game gives you a huge sandbox to play in with a bunch of new toys, but what few activities you are able to complete within this open world are fairly lacklustre and are basic extensions of the same game mechanics you use during the main story. It would have been a lot more engaging if you were free to roam within this world, and had interesting things to do in it. Overall, recommended for its mechanics, artstyle and interesting story.

												Enjoyable story-driven murder mystery. Not really exceptional in any way, but the story and mechanics are interesting. You play a detective who becomes a ghost and thus can walk through walls and do other ghostly stuff while investigating a series of murders. While item collection is heavily featured, it doesn't seem simply shoehorned in to increase the game's length. Each item you collect contributes in some way to the story background/context. The only part that got repetitive and predictable was the demon mechanic: I felt it only interrupted your progress while you dealt with them essentially the same way in every level.

												I have mixed feelings about Murdered: Soul Suspect. I enjoyed the game with it's very unique style, and the story full of twists and turns, so I do recommend it, but there are a few issues that prevent this from being as good as it could have been.Some of the puzzles require you to choose ""most relevant"" clues, so you might pick 3 from 10, but it often feels like guesswork. Not guesswork into your character or the story, but guesswork into the developers minds. This can lead to frustration, but doesn't prevent progress.If you miss a clue earlier in the game, even though you can return to that location, the clue isn't always there. A lot of people get stuck on the 15/16 issue with Apartment 4A, for example, and that was the one clue preventing me from a perfect score. The final area does give you a warning message, but once you enter it, you cannot return to a previous save to hunt down any remaining clues. As soon as you enter the area, you are either choosing to give up on side quests, or planning to replay the entire game again. Those issues aside, it's a great experience and worth playing if you can pick it up on sale.			"

												Once you get past the fact that this is a port and has no configurable controls (stuck to wasd), its a very enjoyable game. I played it with the xbox controller in the end. The story is interesting, though maybe let down a little at the end. The collectables add little bits of information and stories on their own which I enjoyed finding. Playing as a ghost, you are able to walk through most walls and furniture, possess people and read their thoughts (the latter not as good as it sounds, basically generic two liners for each person, not all different), find clues and piece it all together. The bit I enjoyed most was helping other ghosts discover what had happened to them, collecting the clues and setting them at peace. I wish there'd been a lot more of that. I enjoyed every minute of it and will undoubtedly play again.			"

Not terrible, but it's something you'll definitely pick up on from time to time.- Even though there are plenty of citizens walking about and interacting with the enviroment; there is a lot of dialogue that's used on multiple people.  Also once you decide to read their thoughts and the voiceover starts; you have to wait for it to finish before  you can listen to the next or disposses them.If you see it on sale definitely pick it up.

												First things first: the game is really short. You can get 100% without any guides in about 10 hours, even less if you just rush the main story. Yet the game (or should I say ""the movie""?) is also fun and well made. Not an AAA-title, but it's definitely a game I sincerely enjoyed.I liked the dark setting, the overall style and visuals and all the little details here and there. Also the detective story is not bad. The first half of the game is the best because you don't really understand what is going on. After that the rough outline of the story becomes more and more clear which made it a bit less interesting for me. This game may also be for you if you like to just wander and see all what there is to see in the world (though it's definitely not Skyrim).Also it is an easy game. You can't fail even if you try really hard! The gameplay is linear as a stick, the investigations can be brute forced (although they are not difficult anyway) and there no story choices to make at all, even cosmetic ones. Action sequences (the demons) become a chore rather quick. Overall it was not a problem since I played not for challenge but rather for relaxation.			"

												For those, like me, who enjoy problem solving games, this was great. It wasn't an intense action game, but simple observation which I enjoyed.Over the course of the game, you can uncover ghost stories as well that aren't even critical to the gameplay, just bonuses. That little mechanic made it feel more immersive considering the story wasn't riding on backtracking or extra digging.Something that stood out for me in the way of dialoge was that everyone who speaks doesn't necessarily talk one at a time. Characters will get cut off and complete their thoughts later in a way that doesn't sound like a script nor rehearsed, with exception to the protagonist's classic-detective style inner monolouges.However, the quick-time controls felt awkward, the game was too short (beat it within twelve hours with a majority of the achievements done), and many ""clues"" didn't seem to make sense when trying to piece crimescenes together. The promise of unique abilities (""personal strengths becoming abilities) was limited to maybe one or two involving revealing information (which felt closer to the protagonist's job rather than his actual strengths). Even only one other ghost displayed only one unique ability that didn't seem to connect to their character. All of the other abilities you gain belong to the other ghosts you find as well, making the protagonist (and the other ghost with a unique ability) possess very cookie-cutter characteristics.Very little direction is taken towards obstacles you run into like the demons, spiteful cops, or paranoia plaguing the area, thus leaving much more to be desired in character development.""Extra"" characters aren't even kept within the game for very long, making it feel as though there are only four real characters, and many filler characters.I ""did"" enjoy the game and do recommend it for those who enjoy dark, investigative, or easy-paced games. Sadly this has little to no replayability and would wait for it to go on sale for $15 or under given it's short story and neglect to several details I mentioned earlier.			"

												Really good game. You are Ronan O’Connor, detective in Salem, who was killed during investigation of case, and he cant go to other side, till he not finish his case. In that helping him a girl Joy, who is medium and she is only who sees him. During a game you are gathering clues and helping other ghosts stuck in our world, but you must be careful, because there is a danger from demons, which are coming for every ghost and you must from them. Even i enjoyed the game, i was dissapointed with lenght of the game which could be longer, ending, which was too simple and screwed and inability to track missing artifact, but i still recommend this game if you love some good detective story.Pros:StorygameplayVoice actinggraphicsConsgame lenghtbacktrackingend			"

												What does it feel like to be staring down at your own dead body, lying helplessly in the street? To see police agents discussing what might have happened to you, without being able to tell them? The first thing you might notice is that being a ghost actually renders you painfully limited in your ability to interact with the world. Thankfully, there are advantages as well. And, as you will soon discover - what you can't do, someone else might be willing to do for you.I imagine some people are holding off on buying this game due to the moderate-to-bad reviews it has received. I'd like to argue differently. It is by no means perfect - I ran into a few bugs and the game even crashed on me in the final chapter. I was also not happy about not being able to change the key bindings. But the story and its two main characters made it easy to overlook these issues. A unique idea for a video game - not perfectly executed, but more than well enough to warrant a playthrough.			"

												*Review edited for release... still nothing but good things to say about it!*There is tons more I could say about this game and how much I enjoy it than what is in this review, so free to message me on Steam if you have any questions. I highly recommend this game if you're looking for something new in your roguelike/dungeon-crawling experiences... it was *the* most polished Early Access Alpha I had ever played, and is even better now that it is released.GraphicsVery nice and consistently styled, even in the character screen. The choice in what a friend of mine put as ""playful yet macabre"" is spot-on, and a very nice change of pace from other roguelikes (not that those are bad, but FMR is a unique breath of fresh air).SoundEverything from the music to the effects is lovely and fitting to the visual theme. Moody, atmospheric, ethereal, magical, mysterious, spooky... that is what comes to mind while playing and it's a joy to listen to! Some of the tracks really remind me of the greatness that was the soundtrack for Psychonauts (my favorite game of all-time).ControlsSmooth and intuitive when using the keyboard+mouse (controls are customizeable as well, so you can play however you want). I don't play games this twitch-reliant with a controller, but feedback about it in general has been very positive.GameplayThe randomization, pin/item/relic/Loa/leveling ""build"" system works really well but isn't so random that you're screwed if you get bad drops. Since your core setup is however you want to do it (and very easy to experiment with), there is enough consistency to do theorycraft and gameplay mastery... a *very* nice change from the *completely* random roguelikes. I love randomization, but it's nice to have something to play that is a good mix of random and static.The variety in gameplay is great, giving a pleasurable dose of strategic fighting and completely chaotic shmup-style play. Because FMR has this kind of variety, you never really get sick of it. Just when you're tired of one style, you roll a level that's totally different. I'm over 125 hours into it as of this writing, and I'm still not even close to be tired of any of it.Progression is incredibly satisfying, but I'll speak more to that below.GenreWhile the game is most commonly categorized as a roguelike (or rogue-lite), I see it as a mix of roguelike, bullet-hell/shmup, and dungeon-crawler. It's a fantastic mix, and adds a ton to the scale and variety of traditional roguelikes.DifficultySome may find their intital play sessions to be too easy, but the difficulty curve is not even remotely a cakewalk later on. If you feel it's too easy, just keep playing... later difficulties/quests are *much* harder and varied. You'll soon find yourself cursing (joyfully) at failed runs. Because of this, I do *not* consider this game a rogue-lite... if anything, it's just one that isn't ultra hardcore in the start and eases you into the insanity. A perfect game to introduce someone to the genre, but has enough hardcore craziness to keep even the most experienced of players happy.Difficulty in this game is where the real progression and satisfaction resides. Leveling/etc. is a nice way to ease the player into the various mechanics of the game, but the meat of it all is in the variety of difficulties you unlock. Don't expect to be carrot-and-sticked the entire time with pointless leveling and unlocks... instead, expect to get your satisfaction from mastering incredibly difficult situations that (in the later difficulties especially) require perfected playing skills.ContentLevel modifiers, difficulties, level palletes, mission objectives, mobs (and their variations), bosses, items, Loas, etc. all have a great amount of variety already, and further post-release patches are planned which is just icing on the already delicious cake. I was already very happy with the content amount in the early alpha, and that has far more than doubled between then and release. Because of the amount there is, and because of how it's sectioned out between the different quests, you always have a ton of choice depending on your mood and a helluva lot to experience, master, and be surprised by.A quick note: I am in the credits for the game for the QA work I was voluntarily doing (a nice surprise, so thank you devs!). I am not a developer or paid contractor for this game and have no bias in that regards... I just love testing, and the community was silent during a time when they really needed feedback so I stepped up. My review would be exactly the same even if I hadn't done testing for it. "

 A solid crime and investagative experience   This game is not for everyone, but delivers a fascinating investigative thriller The story and approach is very unique and anyone who has an interest in the Salem witch trials and history will like this game.  I found it interesting as I have read the Crucible and enjoyed wandering through Salem.It's not very scary but does have an eerie atmosphere at times.The graphics are good and does help the player to feel immersed in the game and story. Investigating can feel repetitive at times but does continue the story and create more questions for the player. The game length fits in well with the story and it doesn't get dragged out.[/b] A good game for the ""point and click"" crime franchise 7/10 [/b]			"

												Murdered is an interesting yet flawed game. It has some good ideas but fails to execute them in a coherent fashion. Like all games created by numerous development houses spread across the globe it lacks a singular vision. Triple A games need painstaking pre production in order to succeed. Apparently the Ghost theme was pitched at Airtight by one of Square's creative directors.The game isn’t unholy bad. It runs well on my basic PC. The voice work and plentiful cutscenes flesh out the story. Which is an standard detective yawn with Salem trial overtones. There’s a whole host of collectables which unlock side story narratives. These are a strong point of the game and pad out what would be a rather limited experience.There is one striking feature / bug that the game has. Once you finish the main story arc, you cannot go back into the town and complete / solve any of the side missions you may have missed without starting a brand new game. This soured my overall opinion of the title. A shocking oversight that could have been fixed by a small patch. Unfortunately this will never happen as Square shuttered Airtight soon after the release of the game.Its a pity Airtight aren't around to make a follow up. I enjoy a good adventure story and for the most part Murdered delivers.			"

												I just finished this game yesterday and it was pretty much everything I expected. It was story rich with some nice cut scenes, interesting plot twist and wasn't very difficult. Perfect since I was sick in bed all week with the fever, and this is the perfect game to play when you're not completely there. If you're looking for anything of a challenge though this is definitely not the game for you. There are also no choices that you can make that influence the game; so no replayability.I thought I would finish all side quests since I had read that they only add about 10 minutes extra per side quest. Actually now that I think about it I did finish all the sidequests, I just didn't find all the items that tell you some extra stories from salem. Unfortunately the game has a sort of battle system in the game with demons that look for you and try to eat your soul or something like that. Personally I hated these areas of the game the most, it didn't feel scary or add anything to the game, it actually just seemed really annoying, so I always rushed through the demon areas executing them as fast as possible (which just means walk behind them and press the execute command that was on screen). For me they could have just left the demons out and I would've enjoyed the game more. Or they could've made it hella scary and borrowed the run and hide system from ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"". Oh well there aren't that many demon areas so it was ok.Conclusion: It's a fun, easy, detective game that lasts about 6 hours  (10+ hours if you want to 100% the game) filled with fun cut scenes and an interesting storyline. However if I look at the price this game is goin for in the steam store (30 euros) I can't recommend you get the game for that price even though I do understand why they market it at that price. If this is the type of game you love it's probably worth it since the cut scenes are well done and yeah theres enough of salem to discover/investigate. But let's be honest, once you finish this game you will never pick it up again, so you're probably better off waiting for a sale. I paid 6 euros for this and other games (Square Enix 2 humble bundle) and I think games are worth it as long as you get 1 hour per euro. This game fits that rule for me so I give it 4 stars out of 5. If you paid more than 10 euros for this game however, I can imagine feeling screwed, so be smart and wait for it to be cheaper than 10 euros or get it in the humble bundle now! while you still can :)			"

												As a HUGE adventure fan that almost always prefers a classic 2D click'n'point adventure, Murdered: Soul suspect is a breath of fresh air to everything the adventure genre has to offer. The graphics are just amazing, and thanks to the Unreal engine, the game runs smooth as butther with everything maxed out.V-sync limits the game to 30FPS, but you can switch that off and just enable V-sync in your GPU options (Catalyst Control or Nvidia center) which gives you all the smooth awesomeness of 60FPS.The story of this game is brilliant, and the spooky atmosphere just adds to the overall setting of the game. The way you interact with your surrounding and figure out the clues is great, but I was hoping getting stuff wrong would give you a penalty of some kind... Then again, it is an adventure game and most of them are very linear.There is no combat apart from banishing demons witch can be really difficult at some parts but nothing an average gamer can't figure out.I was afraid that the ending will be a dissapointment compared to the massive build up of the story (and the bodies murdered) but the game really delivered. After YEARS of trying to find something different and new in the adventure game genre, Murdered: Soul suspect finally brings tons of new mechanics, great voice acting, an amazing story and a beautiful engine to finally burst life into a slumbered genre.Hats off to the devs and the writters.

												This game points out that no matter how great the storyline is, the gameplay MUST be up to scratch.While providing a mostly innovative way of story, characters and objectives, the game falls awfully short by providing tedious searches of clues, aimlessly running around the map and a finale that was anti-climactic and dissapointing.A recommend due to the fresh insight in the story, but only at a 50% discount price (at the moment E40,-)			"

												Having only played it a couple hour, I don't feel that I can give the game a fair shake. I can say, however, that the premise is very interesting. The system that is used to play the game does leave something to be desired, as you are mainly just running around looking for objects in the enviroment to push the story forward. One of the mechanics in the game revolves around avoiding demons while moving between the various investigations. As early in the game as I am, I have quickly found this mechanic tedious as all you are doing is running from them if they see you. Overall, with my limited time playing the game, I am enjoying the story, which appears to be the main driving factor to this game.			"

												A very unusual detective story where you try to solve your own murder. The gameplay isn't very strong (they could've done so much with what they had with some effort) but the story itself is quite. Not wasting time trying to get 100% completion, I didn't feel any part of the game overstayed its welcome or that I was grinding. Some of the investigations seemed to require answers that were contradictory to what was asked though, which was the biggest gripe I had besides the final confrontation which was very much a trial-and-error thing compared to the rest of the game.Can't really say I recommend this at full price as it's a bit fiddly around the edges that likely won't be fixed post-release with patches, but if you can get it for 20€ or less, I can recommend it for anyone who wants more a story than a game (it's not completely devoid of being a game like Dear Esther tho).So there. Thumbs waving up here. Liked it. Probably around 4-6 hours long for those who get things right fast and just ignore the side stuff completely, 10+ hours for those who try to get 100% without guides maybe.			"

WELCOME TO SALEM, THE CITY OF THE UNEXPECTEDI had high expectations for this game, and even though it disappointing me for being kind of linear to play, actually the mystery involved in the game, and the way the narrate it, its quite good and it will make you wish to finish it till the truth is discovered. Pros: - Amazing plot.- Very cool narrative.- Ghosts stories about how they died, its quite human and realistic. A pleasure to read.- Good voice actors.- Music its ok, but I think it should been better.- The ending, if you are clever maybe you will figure out at some point of the game who is the culprit. But when you discovered the truth, there is some shocking stuff you will not foreseen. Cons:- The game its kind of linear, it gets easy sometimes. - The game have some bugs, so far I experienced the follow bugs:   * The game froze out of the blue sometimes.   * Sometimes the bots get stuck when they are supposed to move.   * The game closes by itself, just because. - _-Luckily, this bugs happens just rarely, but still, a game which was released a year ago, should've all of this already fixed.8/10, I had a lot of fun with this game. but I recommend to buy it on a sale.

												Enjoyable story-driven murder mystery. Not really exceptional in any way, but the story and mechanics are interesting. You play a detective who becomes a ghost and thus can walk through walls and do other ghostly stuff while investigating a series of murders. While item collection is heavily featured, it doesn't seem simply shoehorned in to increase the game's length. Each item you collect contributes in some way to the story background/context. The only part that got repetitive and predictable was the demon mechanic: I felt it only interrupted your progress while you dealt with them essentially the same way in every level. Recommended for its enjoyable story and original mechanics.			"

												I have mixed feelings about Murdered: Soul Suspect. I enjoyed the game with it's very unique style, and the story full of twists and turns, so I do recommend it, but there are a few issues that prevent this from being as good as it could have been.Some of the puzzles require you to choose ""most relevant"" clues, so you might pick 3 from 10, but it often feels like guesswork. Not guesswork into your character or the story, but guesswork into the developers minds. This can lead to frustration, but doesn't prevent progress.If you miss a clue earlier in the game, even though you can return to that location, the clue isn't always there. A lot of people get stuck on the 15/16 issue with Apartment 4A, for example, and that was the one clue preventing me from a perfect score. The final area does give you a warning message, but once you enter it, you cannot return to a previous save to hunt down any remaining clues. As soon as you enter the area, you are either choosing to give up on side quests, or planning to replay the entire game again. Those issues aside, it's a great experience and worth playing if you can pick it up on sale.			"

												This is actually quite a fresh and intersting idea for a game. You play a cop who gets killed by the serial killer he is investigating only for him to become a ghost. Even worse for him he can't move on until he finds out who the serial killer is and then stop him. Playing a ghost is actually quite fun as you can walk through walls and objects as well as possess living characters and listen to their thoughts and influence them. The gameplay is a bit lacking though as most of the game involves investigating by searching for clues and then concluding the investigation by picking the most important clues thus moving the story along. The only enemies you encounter are demons which are easily dispatched by sneaking up behind them and killing them and the encounters with them are too few and far between to be a problem. The biggest dissappointment with this game is that they could have done so much more with the ghost stuff to make the gameplay better.The Good:-Interesting idea for a game and it works quite well.-Decent story which is the games main strength. Also the setting of Salem is brilliant and the atmosphere is great.-Playing as a ghost is quite fun even if they could have done so much more with it.The Bad:-Game is really easy and doesn't provide much in the way of a challenge.- Pretty short and padded out with having loads of collectibles.Overall this is a decent game if not perfect.Worth picking up on sale.

												Just finished the game and I really enjoyed it. While it doesn't take long to play it through (I needed 8 hours and I took my time) it was fun while it lasted. I am not sure about the replay value, though. The game heavily relies on its thick atmosphere and the story twists to drive you along and I imagine it will be less fun the second time around. If you don't care for pages after pages of story or lots of cut scenes or do expect a certain amount of fighting in your games you should skip this one, though. There are a few ""fight"" scenes but you have to solve them through misdirection and stealth. No open combat. Still, if you do enoy a good story and an atmospheric game you should give this one a try. I recommend playing it at night or in a darkened room - both for the atmosphere and to see all the details on the screen. You should also take the time and gather as many clues as possible, especially for the small side quests. The stories are delightfully spooky.			"

It doesn't pull punches when it comes to death cut scenes however, so if you're adverse to gunshots, spontanious screaming and the like, put it on mute and turn on subtitles.The only complaints that I have is the fact that there is no adjustable difficulty level, which isn't super important unless you are playing on the PC and find it hard to properly exorcise demons. Pressing and holding R plus A and right clicking all at once while only being given less than 5 seconds gets super frustrating after a while.  "

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a great story. It's a mediocre game but I enjoyed the story so much I have to recommend this.It has great atmosphere, very nice graphics and a very appealing main story. It's a unique take on detective stories with a supernatural flavor. The investigations are easy but the findings are not trivial and kept adding real new information throughout the game. Only when I was very close to the end of the game was I able to figure all the pieces, meaning the game keeps the tension very well.However, Murdered: Soul Suspect also has linear progression, too trivial investigations, many collectibles which I did not find interesting and sort of bland side investigations and strange stealth combat.For me the game really picked up when I stopped trying to collect everything and doing every side mission. So, I recommend this game with a suggestion to stick with the main story. "

												I personally liked the story. It was my jam if you will. I also enjoyed the short stories that you can find along the way.There is also a pretty convincing reason why you cant move through specific walls and stuff. Nice touch.The only things that annoyed me a little were the demon fights. I dont like those kind of press that and that to defeat that demon.The other thing is that for my taste there were a little too many collectibles.All in all a nice game that I can recommend to those people that like investigating a little crime, want a decent story about Salem and fairly easy going gameplay.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a different kind of game, but that doesn't mean its a bad game.  I never got around to playing it when it came out, money reasons mostly, but I was able to play it through a friend's library.  The game is based in Salem and follows the story of a cop who dies at the very start of the game (not a spoiler).  The ""combat"" in the game is mostly stealth based, there are demons, who you have to sneak up on to kill, and if they spot you, you must flee until they resume their normal patrols, but asides from that there is no real combat to speak of.  That is not a bad thing though, as the story is really nice and has a few pretty good twists in it.  The sounds in the game are really nice, and the screech that is made when demons pops up could catch you off guard, I know it did to me a few times.  There are papers, and different things to collect throughout the game, including area specific items that unlock hidden ghost stories to flesh out the town even more.  I played with my xbox one controller so I don't know how good or well the key binding is, but the controls were really nice.  I was actually quite surprised by this game, as I wasn't expecting the good story that I got.  This is not a game for everyone as there is not a whole lot to speak of for combat.  I really enjoyed the story, the somewhat unique combat system and the atmosphere.  Not much in the way of replay value, as I am not sure if there is a difficulty option, unless you wanted to 100% it there is not a whole lot of reasons to replay it.  8/10			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is engaging and enjoyable.  The atmosphere and graphics are great.  You explore Salem and 'ghost Salem' as a ghost and as a detective, solving your case and many side cases along the way.  Ghost Salem physically exists for ghosts, as a barrier which prevents you from accessing areas of Salem too easily and as a mode of access to collectables in areas you wouldn't have access to in normal Salem e.g. ghost stairs.There is a lot to engage with: collectables (too many, in my opinion), stories to unlock, ghosts hanging around (they say the best things in the graveyard).  It does get repetative and there isn't a challange.  The game is easy to beat but there's still a small amount of action such as dealing with demons.  I find the game satisfactory for entertaining, easy gameplay but I wouldn't pay $30 for it.  Maybe if it was more challanging, everything down to the puzzles are simple.			"

												My expectations weren't extremely high but the concept behind the game made me curious. Bought it at a sale and it was well worth it. I do however feel that the game could have been so much more. It could have been a lot more difficult to figure out however. I think most players felt a lot more competent at detective-work than the protagonist.If you don't mind a linear game about mysteries and supernatural events then you should give this game a go. It has a great atmosphere, looks good and the voice acting is top notch. I liked that the game doesn't care much for combat and having crazy encounters. There are some enemies but they are more like decor than obstacles. The game lets you focus on the mystery.You can also possess cats and use them to solve puzzles. Major plus.			"

												During my time with Murdered: Soul Suspect, it felt like a spark of unique features in the sea of games that feel like we are recycling the same ideas and concepts over and over. It was definitely an interesting title combining LA Noire's use of interacting with objects and no hand holding while you piece the scene together and choose the correct action from a list that is revealed once you reveal parts of what happened. However I would have liked to see more of a choice in how you progress making some choices lead you down the wrong path and some that if you dig deep enough into the scene it could progress you closer to the killer. To a trained eye a lot of the story becomes easy to pick up but still has some twists like any good murder mystery would. In all I enjoyed my time with the story and ghost/investigation mechanics even if it felt a little short (I think an extra 1-2 hours would have been about perfect for time spent in the game).			"

												This game is quite a jewel, I'm happy to have it in my library.It's simply the best detective game you can have. You get cool ghost powers, that don't do much when not used in the time you should... Yeah, that's a bummer.People do stand around and seem just placed there... Yeah, bummer.Combat mechanics are...

												Just finished the game and I really enjoyed it. While it doesn't take long to play it through (I needed 8 hours and I took my time) it was fun while it lasted. I am not sure about the replay value, though. The game heavily relies on its thick atmosphere and the story twists to drive you along and I imagine it will be less fun the second time around. If you don't care for pages after pages of story or lots of cut scenes or do expect a certain amount of fighting in your games you should skip this one, though. There are a few ""fight"" scenes but you have to solve them through misdirection and stealth. No open combat. Still, if you do enoy a good story and an atmospheric game you should give this one a try. I recommend playing it at night or in a darkened room - both for the atmosphere and to see all the details on the screen. You should also take the time and gather as many clues as possible, especially for the small side quests. The stories are delightfully spooky.			"

Sometimes i started overthinking the clues and got them wrong because so many could be interperated as viable information for given murder.I was dissapointed in the problem solving, it didnt test me nor did the combat (if you call it combat). The story did have me interested, but mostly i was too distracted searching far and wide for the many MANY collectable side story items/collectable intel.Loved the idea of being able to walk through walls, i've never played a game with that kind of mechanic and i liked it.

Short version:+ Amazing detective story + Background stories of characters to uncover+ Possess cats and never ending cigarette+ No need to use doors, just walk through walls- Obviously made for consoles-- Boring and linear gameplay-- No action, apart from demons= 6.5/10Long version:First of all, this game has a Metascore of 59/100 and I can kind of understand why. This is not about the story or the characters, but mainly because of the gameplay.WARNING: minor spoilers (not really spoilers, but just in case, you know). Marked them.Story: The story is simply ah-ma-zing. In my opinion, it’s a great murder mystery in which you have to solve your own death (and prevent others from dying too). The whole ghost-idea is greatly elaborated in the story and makes the whole thing quite original: you’re not the usual cop who has to solve the usual murder mystery. The game has some great (and by that I mean unexpected and mind-blowing) plot twists. And, honestly, I didn’t expect the actual murderer to be the murderer, if you know what I mean.Characters: I LOVE how the characters’ stories become clear throughout the game. Most of the characters’ stories are quite vague when you start the game, but as you progress and collect artifacts, you learn more about each one of them. It made me want to keep playing, not only to know who my killer was, but also to know more about other people’s lives and deaths (and Ronan’s tattoos, for example). The side quests are nice additions to the story; they aren’t very long, but quite interesting, too. The main characters aren't really stereotypes, in my opinion. For example, the fact that Ronan was a gangster himself while he was young, doesn’t make him the stereotype cop (not really sure if spoiler, but marked just in case). It makes the game much more interesting than your usual detective story. The side characters, on the other hand, are much more flat and typical.Gameplay: Not great. Even boring, after a while. You walk around in Salem, investigate surroundings to find clues, possess people (and cats!), hide from and defeat demons, poltergeist stuff, and, well, that’s about it. It’s the same thing over and over again, for the maximum of 15 hours of gameplay the game has to offer (one playthrough). No real puzzles, just looking around and finding things. No real action, I believe there’s a maximum of 20 demons to defeat throughout the game. The combat is boring: you have to sneak up to them and kill them with nothing but your bare hands. You have no defense apart from some hiding spots. The demons are in my opinion unnecessary and only a burden to the game. The game’s pretty linear, too. You have no choice but to follow the storyline. Between cutscenes, you can walk around freely in Salem and the areas you’ve already visited throughout the story.Also, it’s obvious this is a game made for consoles, not for pc. I mean, “Press START”? You’re joking, right? You’re unable to change the controls, so if you’re playing with an AZERTY-keyboard, you’ll have to change the language settings of your pc. I really recommend playing this with a controller, if you have one: it suits the overall gameplay much better.Other: Great graphics. The creepy music fits the atmosphere and story perfectly. Good voice acting. Achievements are relatively easy to obtain, apart from some artifacts. Also, DO NOT ENTER THE MUSEUM IN THE END OF THE GAME before you’ve collected all artifacts! You won’t be able to return, or play the whole game from the start to collect the missing ones.Conclusion: I was doubting whether I would go for recommended or not, since the gameplay is such a disappointment. I did go for recommended, because I haven’t seen such a great and original detective story in all my life.I wouldn’t recommend buying this game if it’s not on sale: €30 ($37.5?) is way too pricey in my opinion. Like detectives, murder mysteries and story-driven games? I guess you can give this a shot. Want action, adventure and shooting? Not the right game for you.			"

												To be honest, I feel that this game got a lot more flack than was deserved. Is it perfect? No, but I think the criticisms were a bit extreme. Mind you, most of the criticisms I read were during the time that it was initially released and some of it had to do with bugs.I'm guessing that by the time I bought the game (4 months after release) all those bugs were fixed because I didn't really have any of the issues that they were talking about. There were times, however, I noticed that the narration would cut out. This happened in maybe 3-5 different cutscenes were there was just no sound at all - the only way I knew what was supposed to have been said during the scene was because I always have subtitles on.I think what hurt the game more than anything else was the story. It was okay, but I feel that it could have been better - more developed maybe. Also I feel like the characters were poorly written.I say this because I felt no emotion towards any of them whatsover. The wife was annoying, and there were too many random collectibles of her memories with him - I'm guessing like finding pages of her diary or something scattered around. I felt myself annoyed with all of these and couldn't care less about her or their relationship.The friendship or, partnership I guess, between Ronan and Joy felt really shallow. Since Joy is the character Ronan interacts with the most throughout the game, I was hoping for more development in their friendship.  Also the way Joy treated Ronan after he saves her from The Bell Killer is ridiculous. I'm not expecting her to want to help him right away but it was a bit much imho I couldn't even find myself caring about Ronan himself. None of the characters in the game were developed enough for me to root for them or care about them in anyway. Also I felt it was strange that all the events in the entire game takes place in one night. Why on earth was that one couple getting married in the middle of the night / wee hours of the morning? The demons in the game were laughable. It felt like it was just thrown in at the last minute to give the game some kind of combat in it. They should have either given the combat more diversity or taken the demons out completely, in my opinion. I didn't play the game with combat in mind so I wouldn't have cared if there was no combat in this game. There are perfectly good Adventure Mystery games with absolutely no combat in it (the majority of Sherlock Holmes titles for example).With all that negative out of the way now for the positives: I appreciate the game trying to do something different. I'm a big fan of Adventure Mystery type games and one that approaches it from the perspective of a ghost is innovative and interesting. I enjoyed walking through walls and possessing adorable felines, as well as the people around town.It would have been great if they expanded a bit more on this - more animals to possess, control over individuals in town like how Abigail was able to control humans to do her killings  , as well as being able to poltergeist more items.To sum up my review, I would recommend people to give the game a go. It's enjoyable and fun and I definitely don't think it deserved 59 on metacritic. I would rate it more of a 6/10. It's worth a play through to get to play and experience something different. The mystery is also relatively engaging.I just wouldn't get this game at full price - wait for a sale. I was able to scoop it up during one for 4.99.			"

												I can see how this game might disappoint others, as there is so much more it could do as a survival horror and as a detective game, but for what it is, I think this is a brilliant game, and there are enough items and secrets to find to give it replay value. I guess because of the different path options of another certain ""poltergeist simulator"" if you like i.e. Beyond Two Souls it is often a shame when I play games like this now and there aren't multiple endings (even Silent Hill 2 had different endings on replays), but I guess we are a little spoilt, and this isn't trying to be a David Chase or a Deus Ex game. The idea itself was so novel and appealing I knew I had to grab this eventually, it reminded me of the basic premise of the old PS2 game Shadow of Memories in which you travel back in time to solve your own murder. In this moody, supernatural almost LA Noire style of setting I knew I couldn't resist. It wasn't until I played it I realised it's all set in Salem, so given that the backstory and local folklore have a large presence in this game, this was one hell of a bonus for me given my interest in the witch hunts and magic. The music and atmosphere didn't disappoint. The backstory and tragic history is incorporated into it very well, and the way in which this game combined supernatural elements with crime scene investigation was really inventive and original.  As said, there are things you can miss as well, but this is mostly side missions. I guess few games if any have really matched LA Noire in this department. The graphics look great, can't fault the voice acting either. In terms of the horror elements, as a puzzle game it's challenging enough, but seeing the same ghouls everywhere gets very repetitive very quickly, and it just becomes a chore of running, hiding and timing. It's different enough but just has no variety, still I can see how hard it is to do something really novel and inventive with the ghost-themed survival horror format. Especially if you are a ghost yourself. Overall great game worth getting, worth experiencing and worth playing again, just don't be too disappointed by the length and lack of variety in gameplay....Salem does allow for some exploration, though.

												Although there are many issues with this game, I really do recomend it. It's not great, but it is worth playing.The main problem of the game is that it feels really underdeveloped.The story is short, I think you can finish it in around 5 hours if you rush through the game and skip all the collectibles.There are some pretty useless mechanics included, like, for example, reading people thoughts. At first I was quite excited that I can possess pretty much any NPC and read its mind, but I quickly discovered that most of the thoughts are repeating itself and they are absolutely useless.There are enemies in this game. One kind of enemy to be exact. Demons are annoying addition that doesn't introduce anything to the game except from dull idea of banishing them. You just walk behind a demon, hold R to start banishing and then press mouse button + direction key that pops up on screen. It's excatly as exciting as it seems. Not at all. No thrill, no fear, not even a startle from some jumpscare. They appear, you banish and move on. They could remove them completely from the game as they pose no threat at all and only thing that they manage to achieve is to annoy you.Controls are pretty bad. Especially menu controls. You can use mouse only to point the option you want, to select it you have to use your keyboard.Many technical problems, bugs. Sometimes gamebreaking.The game is faaar to easy.What I enjoyed about the game is the story itself. However short it is, it was really entertaining for me. I love the atmosphere of Salem. Conducting the investigation even though it could be more complex. That's what basically makes the game worth playing for me: the story and the world presented in it. I do recomend the game, however not for its full price. If you see it on some good sale go for it, but else just wait for the price to go down.			"

There are some things that you can collect around the map that tell you some stories from salem and some such , it was a chore for me , but maybe youd like that(its not like you need 2 do it). The combat is kinda lacking , the story is very very interesting tho. i REALLY liked it. All in all 7.5/10 , the games averages a 5/10 on everything exept graphics/astetic and story , but man do they carry it bythemselves.			"

												I picked this up on a sale for 1,99€ and it was worth the money.It's a point and click detective game with a supernatural story.It's not much to the detective part in the game, you mostly answer questions by clicking on clues you have found.The game have some kind of system where if you guess something wrong you lose a ""badge"" and you have three badges for each mystery but it will not effect anything in the game as far as I could tell.It feels like it was meant for a achievement but they never put it in or that the detective part was supposed to be more complex but got scratched later on.The game have a nice old detective movie feeling to it and the story keeps you interesting.The story is about a detective that have to solve his on murder as a ghost to move on. The two main characters are good written and works well together. It's a nice spooky feeling throughout the game even tho it's not a horror game.In addition to the main story you can solve a handful of side cases for lost spirits around the world to give them peace and in addition to that there is a lot of collectables scattered around.The collectables tells you about the town, the murderer, your character and ghost stories. The ghost stories is a really nice addition, I appreciated them a lot.It took me around eleven hours to finish and I did most of the side stuff, I missed some collectables.If you see this game on a sale I would recommand you to pick it up but not for the current pricetag (29,99€).

												Was a gift from a good friend of mine (Humble Bundle)A mix of adventure, detective mystery solving game.  Seriously, just don't hover near the spoilers if you haven't played the game yet Pros :  - Interesting storyline - The town looks great with the mix of  a past (ghost) and present theme  - Voice Acting - Plot twist!  - A game that  lets you play as a cat   - Being a ghost is somehow fun - Unique playstyle Cons :  - The story is too linear.  Putting routes on stories and additional mini quest is fine  - Demons  Stealth in a detective mystery game sounds good but really, screeching demons who chase you but they leave you once you move in a specific spot. Also, sometimes annoying...  - Save slots would be fine. You have to replay the game once you finish/restart to the last checkpoint (A bit of a hassle when it comes to achievement farming) - Point and click. Investigations are kind of easy since they already tell you where the clues are. You can just spam E in the map and you'll probably find the clue   - NPCs - just remove some of the  mind reading  or just  keep them silent . It's confusing  when you're looking for clues   - Locked to 30 FPS....  - Cutscenes...  A skip button would be nice if you die or restart from another checkpoint  - Too short (Finished within 9.6 hours - including breaks)Needs a lot more improvement still. Would buy a sequel if there is one Better buy it on sale.Rating : 7/10			"

Game exhibits few interesting quirks, that are unfortunately not played to their full potential (reading people's thoughts, possesion, poltergeist activity).

												What does it feel like to be staring down at your own dead body, lying helplessly in the street? To see police agents discussing what might have happened to you, without being able to tell them? The first thing you might notice is that being a ghost actually renders you painfully limited in your ability to interact with the world. Thankfully, there are advantages as well. And, as you will soon discover - what you can't do, someone else might be willing to do for you.I imagine some people are holding off on buying this game due to the moderate-to-bad reviews it has received. I'd like to argue differently. It is by no means perfect - I ran into a few bugs and the game even crashed on me in the final chapter. I was also not happy about not being able to change the key bindings. But the story and its two main characters made it easy to overlook these issues. A unique idea for a video game - not perfectly executed, but more than well enough to warrant a playthrough.			"

												Used to love the trailer, until it released and played it I believe lot of flaws in this game is making this game less fun that it was supposed to be.1. Investigation mechanic is dull, while you're investigating in the game by looking at clues all over the place, you didn't actually investigate anything. Unlike games like Sherlock Holmes or LA Noire, you just look for items and press the action button.2. Open world mechanic wasting time too much. While I like walking around the place to know more about it's world, Salem is the city that's seriously flawed in time and space. While it looks like a big city, you can get anywhere in just few minutes. And why there's lot of people in the creepy night potrayed in the game. Even the presentation of some people dating in graveyard just plain creeping me. (In a bad way)3. Story just making non sense, I believe I supposed to find the clue about the klller... In 1 night? I don't think I can laugh more after looking people are just pushing their activity in 1 night.4. Fighting demon is stupid.5.

Overall; a good game.Only let downs were the 'hostiles' that seemed to be added as an afterthought. The game would have done better as pure explorative narrative.

Rating: 7.5/10Short thoughts:Overall, I very much enjoyed playing Murdered: Soul Suspect and would definitely recommend it for those who are looking for a cool story about a ghost detective in the town of Salem looking to crack the case of his own murder. Longer thoughts:The story is based around a murdered detective named Ronan who is a pretty cool and has the outfit to match (and never ending cigarette). Ronan travels around the town of Salem investigating his own murder case as well as those of other townsfolk. Main story was enjoyable, as well as the side mini-stories fueled by the collection of 'evidence' around the town. The ghost aspect was neat, as you could walk through walls, possess people and animals, influence their thoughts and more of that nature. Could have used some variety in the options of interacting with NPCs, but I didn't mind it much. The game has a simple combat system which I found to work out great in the end as it allowed you to continue focusing on the story rather than get distracted and spending hours sneaking by monsters as some other games have you do. In the end, I am very satisfied with how this game played out and do not regret purchasing it one bit.

												Playing Murdered: Soul Suspect is akin to watching a tugboat wreck into a freight train.  It shouldn't be happening, it's the most ludicrous scenario you could possibly imagine but somehow you just have to watch the tragedy.  This game is FAR from perfect and a once n' doner.  IMO it's absolutely not worth the 29.99 price tag and I find it hard to believe it was going for over $50 for quite sometime.  I got much more value from budget games like Curse: Eye of Isis or Hard Reset than I did from this disasterpiece, yet Soul Suspect is enjoyable and I couldn't seem to put it down for the 8 and a half hours it took me to reach my goal.  I think the game performed so poorly with professional reviewers because it's simply not what you expect.  At heart, the game is like an old school point and click, detective adventure with some demonic combat and fetch quests thrown in.  In the game you play as Ronan O'Connor; a sleuth murdered at the hands of the Bell Killer...a sort of Jack the Ripper type serial killer stalking the infamous town of Salem.  The plot of the game is interesting if not somewhat predictable, mish-mashing together a bit of ideas from film (Seven, Silence of the Lambs) with the hard-boiled whodunnit atmosphere of LA Noire.  Some of the plot twists you can see from a mile away, but there's some that were at least somewhat of a surprise.  The story is told at a brisk place with cut scenes between present and past (the Salem Witch Trials) with the voice acting being strong enough to keep you involved and invested.  Ronan is voiced well enough, but sometimes the writing is a little untentionally cheesy.   Thankfully, in the context of a hard-boiled, noir style mystery it works and causes a chuckle or two without being too too flat.  Gameplay/atmosphere wise you run around the town of Salem which is setup as a mini-sandbox.  If Airtight Games had more time and money to put into the project, one could only wonder just how amazing this game could have been.  You can't enter alot of the buildings, leaving you to run around between finding various collectibles, taking on a scant few side quests and finally going to one of the city's main locations for the main action.  The graphical detail isn't overly impressive, but it's solid with decent characer models, appropriately dingy gothic design and some cool locales to explore.  Animation is stiff, the framerate is sometimes choppy and sometimes the items you need to collect will glitch in and out of existence making it a royal s.o.b. to pick them up.  The voice-acting as stated earlier was well-done although the ambient effects (besides the sinister demons you take on in stealth combat) aren't anything particularly special.  The gameplay slides between sleuthing, stealth action, fetching and exploration.  You'll come across numerous crime scenes and points of interests where your main goal is to search, examine and interrogate for clues.  Everything plays out like a stripped-down, beginner's version of L.A. Noire.  Sometimes your ghostly abilities will come into play such as possession to get inside people's heads, teleportation to get where you need to go, passing through walls, etc.  Initially, the gameplay is fun but as the game progresses you can see how basic it is.  You shouldn't need a walkthrough at all for this sucker because everything is laid out just how you need.  Once you've collected enough clues you can solve the crime scene by selecting the appropriate hints and picking the order of their importance.  It's a shame that your'e a ghost with such cool abilities but they feel second nature.  You will not be punished, nor will anything change even if you screw things up.  The game is linear to a fault.  Yet, these sequences are enjoyable enough in an old school point n' click style that it's fun.  If you can think past how the game always seems to cramp and rope you into doing what it wants you to, you'll be interested in how solving each puzzle advances the story.  To break things up you'll get the chance to possess a cat and use it to explore hard to reach areas.  The other main shake of the gameplay is stealth combat where you take on floating demons that look like monstrosities culled from Clive Barker's Undying.  They are actually pretty creepy in the way that they scream and hunt you down if they spot Ronan.  The only way to kill them is to engage them from behind, entering a quicktime button combo that will take 'em out.  Once alerted they can be tough to escape as your only means of protection is to hide in spiritual residue left behind from poltergeists.  You can jump from one residue host to another, leading to a cat n' mouse game where you try to get the upper hand on the beasties.  It's a fun addition to the gameplay variety but like most things in Soul Suspect it's awkward and feels undercooked.  By far one of the most enjoyable parts of the game were the sidequests, where you help dwelling spirits find out the manner in which they died.  These murders have somewhat of an emotional, human element to them (as stated by a few reviewers) that makes you want to help the poor schleps get some eternal rest.  Each quest is set up as a mini-mystery where you canvas a crime scene and put the clues together.  The only problem is that there's about 5 of them total.  If more were added it would have been a great thing.  Once again this represents just how much of a missed-opportunity Soul Suspect is across the board.  For those after Steam Achievements there's a ton of stuff to collect, but some of it's level specific, so if you miss it...too bad.  You have to start the game over again from square one and give it another shot.  Maybe some of you will but I sure won't.  I got 73% on a first try and I nodded afterwards saying to myself, ""Good enough, good enough.""  It would have been cool if you could start the game over as a new game plus.  I started it over briefly and it seemed to reset everything.  From a technical standpoint things aren't perfect either.  The game ran fairly smooth most of the time but several drops in framerate got me killed by demons about 2 or 3 times, I had about 4 game freeze crashes and I also got the end of cemetery level glitch.  None of these are game breaking, so you can get through them without losing too much progress.  To break it down:Pros:-Salem is a killer game setting.  -Involving storyline with great atmosphere-Fun mix of sleuthing, adventure, stealth combat and pick a path gameplay-Side quests and collectibles are a plus-Strong voice acting-Decent graphics and soundCons:-Pseudo sandbox gameplay is too linear-Easy puzzles and difficulty-Cool ghost powers but all of 'em are quite restricted-No branching paths for messing up the detective gameplay-Can't carry over collectibles that I saw-Some minor annoying glitches-Undercooked combat-Once you beat it, there's really no reason to go backThough I have alot of qualms about what Soul Suspect coulda been, what's there is worth playing through once.  Somehow for all of its flaws, there's a charming veneer lurking behind the game's black tooth smile.  The story in and of itself makes it worth a playthrough.  Whether you'll want to pick it up a second time is going to be an iffy, p2p decision.  I'd say this game is worth no more than $15 if you're going to pick it up.  I got it on a holiday sale for a few bucks and it more than exceeded my expectations in terms of value.  I'm pretty sure I paid $5 and could have seen paying as much as $15 for it.  But for $30?  No way Jose!    Final score:  7/10			"

												Quick Summary: Murdered Soul Suspect is a mystery game more than an action game, so if you’re looking for a shooter or platformer, you won’t find much of that here. I haven’t really played many mystery games so the closest that I can compare this game to is the “investigation” portions of the Batman Arkham series, where you’re in a room with crime scenes trying to piece together what happened. The game has a ton of collectibles, both quest related, and for background on the story, making the experience immersive and decently long if you actually stop to read everything.You play a police detective named Ronan, killed during an investigation into the “Bell Killer,” a serial killer terrorizing the town of Salem. Yes, it’s the Salem with the Witch trials from hundreds of years ago, and the history of the town will play into your investigation. You’re not alone on your quest though, since a local “medium” who can see ghosts such as yourself, has her own investigation to follow and it happens to coincide with yours. Good thing too, since being a murder victim means you can’t interact with most of the living world.As a ghost, Ronan has access to certain powers such as the ability to move through solid objects, “possess” random people (you don’t really control them), “reveal” memory remnants, and later on you can teleport short distances.  The game is played in third person perspective with a lot of narration by Ronan, giving it a sort of noir feel (reminds me of Alan Wake, but with no shooting). The town of Salem is pretty small in this game, and despite being a ghost, a lot of areas are off limits to you because of walls and buildings being “consecrated.” There are 2 worlds that you can see at the same time, the real world (that you can walk through objects in) and a ghost world (mostly walls and objects that block your movement). The town is also littered with ghosts other than yourself that you can talk to. Some of them have mini quests (investigations) that you can take part in, but most of them are just there for short conversations, adding to the game’s atmosphere. I actually stopped talking to random ghosts about 1/3 into the game since most of them don’t have anything story related to tell you.As I mentioned before, this is not an action game so you don’t really fight anyone, however there are a number of “demons” roaming the town in story related areas. You can either avoid the demons by stealthily sneaking around, or you can try to banish them by sneaking up behind them and executing a quick time event. You can see the demons through walls, so it’s possible to get around them if you have ninja hiding skills. Frankly, I suggest banishing them all so you can roam freely and pick up all the collectibles in each area. Pros:+A decent, slow paced mystery story with some twists and turns. You’re playing this game for the story more than anything else.+The investigations are kind of fun, searching for clues and piecing together events after you’ve gotten the hang of it.Cons:-If you’re mostly into shooting games, you may find yourself bored. There’re some stealth sections, but the majority of the game is puzzle solving and searching for clues.-The game uses an autosave system that isn’t very well explained.  There are times where it shows the “saving” icon, but if you quit and reload you’ll be missing a bunch of progress/clues.  I recommend completing side quests separate from main story sections (don’t go back and forth between side quest and main quest) and then move on to the story section. The only time I could be sure the game had saved was when I entered a new area in the story.Overall, I’d recommend this game if you’re looking for a moderately easy “thinker” game, and are taking a break from action/shooting. If you’re just going through the main investigations of the story and not bothering with side missions or collectibles, you can probably finish in about 7 hours.  "

												Paulliee TV ReviewMURDERED : SOUL SUSPECT, Is a Under rated game IMO, it has unique features and has a interesting fun story that involes you being a detective yet a ghost so of course it has investigations mechanics which is quite enjoyable, The downside to this game that stops it being a Awesome game instead of a Good game is the fact it is short maybe about 5-8 hours in length and at times the gameplay and story can be a bit meh, But most games have meh moments but due to the fact this game is short and the combat is quite repetitive and lacking i would have to ultimately say this game is a 7/10 game and a good game and worth a buyBut don't expect a GOTY + Good story+ Fun Investigation mechanics+ Filler content I.E Collecting stuff+ Voice acting --------------- Short- Poor combat- Linear

												This game has one of the strongest openings I've seen in quite some time.  The ghost mechanics work well and feel good.  Being able to walk through walls gives the game a nice twist and the investigations while linear are at least interesting.  The stealth and combat segments are never really fun but they're over quick enough to not detract from the overall package.  The story of this one and strong theme is definitely worth checking out.

Rating: 7.5/10Short thoughts:Overall, I very much enjoyed playing Murdered: Soul Suspect and would definitely recommend it for those who are looking for a cool story about a ghost detective in the town of Salem looking to crack the case of his own murder. Longer thoughts:The story is based around a murdered detective named Ronan who is a pretty cool and has the outfit to match (and never ending cigarette). Ronan travels around the town of Salem investigating his own murder case as well as those of other townsfolk. Main story was enjoyable, as well as the side mini-stories fueled by the collection of 'evidence' around the town. The ghost aspect was neat, as you could walk through walls, possess people and animals, influence their thoughts and more of that nature. Could have used some variety in the options of interacting with NPCs, but I didn't mind it much. The game has a simple combat system which I found to work out great in the end as it allowed you to continue focusing on the story rather than get distracted and spending hours sneaking by monsters as some other games have you do. In the end, I am very satisfied with how this game played out and do not regret purchasing it one bit. However, I would not recommend purchasing this at full price (~$30), but if it can be found on sale below that, I would definitely suggest picking it up.			"

												I was put off this game initially due to negative reports about its length, and so the base price of £20 was enough to give me pause. However, when it appeared on sale for £5 I decided to give it a chance and I am very glad I did. The star of this game is its story, where you play as the ghost of Ronan O'Connor, a detective in modern day Salem. For a large part it feels like a point and click adventure game where the emphasis is on finding the pieces and putting them together rather than on any sort of direct action. Gameplay revolves around investigations that are heavily reminiscent of L.A. Noire (another game I really enjoyed) except you can walk through walls and interrogating people is mostly replaced with possessing them to influence their mind. Perhaps owing to the length of the story (it only took me around 8hrs to complete the main quest, all side quests and most collectibles) both the story and gameplay never outstayed their welcome and remained entertaining to the very end. The main negative in this game is the repetitive forced stealth segments where you are forced to sneak up on demonic spirits before a simple quick time event is entered in place of combat. I felt even after the first of these that it was an unnecessary mechanic designed as a buffer between me and the enjoyable parts of the game. I would commonly find myself sweeping an area of these ""enemies"" before returning to start the section proper. Thankfully, they don't take too long and aren't difficult, but this just emphasises how needless they are.I would definitely recommend this as a sale pickup if you are even remotely curious.			"

												Nothing too special, a nice filler game if you're looking for something to play for a few days to pass the time. The whole detective work isn't that challenging and the story is pretty typical.

Besides its short 6 hours story (with exploring, probably shorter if you just do only the linear story), it is a captivating, emotional, and immersive game that truly develops both Ronan and Joy very well (just like any other Square Enix game :P )The gameplay is unique, the combat is simple, the sound and music is outstandingly well done and the story, is very well written! I’m not going to say much as I don’t want to spoil the game except, I’m not satisfied with the ending. There should have been ‘more’, story wise. I recommend this game in an instant!			"

												Well, a lot of what you've heard about this game is true. There is a lot of clunk to its port (the menu has no mouse support and doesn't even use arrow keys). The ""combat"" amounts to a random key press alongside a random mouse button click. And the mystery isn't that complex. So why am I recommending it, you ask? Because it never lost my attention. Between the atmosphere, the unlockable ghost stories, and the main case (albeit not Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stuff) it was just a lot of fun to play. I even got into the random key sequences of excuting demons (and was a bit suprised that in the beginning my nerves would betray me and I'd fail at times). It was Airtight's swan song, and you can almost feel it in there what with the brevity and all, but it is a nice tune for those seeking an atmospheric haunted noire vibe. Definitely not for everyone, but much better than the critics have given it credit for, that's for sure.			"

												This is a great game for those who like stories. It is very cinematic and its storytelling involves the player in Ronan's story. It's more a mystery story than a horror one (even though it has some elements). I'm going to start reviewing from the negative stuff to the positive:- Not being able to change the controls in PC is a joke. This will prevent left-handed people from playing and makes the only difficult spot more difficult by choosing ridiculous key controls - That said, the game is not difficult at all (it's almost an interactive movie), though in certain spots the difficulty spikes due to the controls- There's plenty of reading if you want to know the whole stories that make the side quests, but there's a bug in the game: if you want to read the stories of the items on the menu, press Enter, not the mouse- There's plenty of stuff to do and to collect in the city and you have almost complete freedom to move around. Still I'd have liked the option of finishing the side quests before ending the game.- The game design works great to make you feel like a ghost. I soon realised that even though I was dead I still tended to try to walk through doors instead of walls""- The experience is great.Oh, and as someone said, you can posses cats. And meow.			"

												It took me 8 Hours to Complete the Main Story. Playing through the game felt satisfying as you learn more about the Killer. It was a very good game for those who are interested into Detective and Mystery. The game has a little bit of Pointless running through the city at the start, but then I realised it was nice to have a bit of an explore and not completely confined to a small area. It's a shame there is no form of replayability unless you are looking for the 100% collect everything. Although good Story and as I said before, I enjoyed it regardless of what the more professional reviewers are saying. 8 out of 10.			"

												Good adventure game with a good story. Not a fast-paced game and with very few action elements, but it was never supposed to be an action game to begin with. Soul Suspect plays more like an adventure game with puzzles with an occassional fighting scene (which itself is presented like an action puzzle with a small amount of strategy involved). The atmosphere is great. Sound (voice and music) and visuals are superb and convincing and set the mood for the game right away. The story is classical detective story, obviously with supernatural elements, is well written and even though not mind blowing in its ""message"", it kept me completely immersed en interested through the whole game. The game world is not very big,but detailed and varying, and there are very many things to observe and find. Lots of collectibles, but these are done right: when found, they provide smaller details to the story, or tell separate smaller stories of their own.Gameplay puzzles aren't very difficult, and failing them doesn't give any penalty. The detective puzzles will remind a lot of LA Noire, but are somewhat easier. To sum up: not a game for people looking for action. It is rather a game for people who don't mind standing still occasionally in a game for a while to observe the surroundings and solve a puzzle or mystery. If you are one of those, you are in for a treat: the game is very convincing as a supernatural spooky detective.PS: almost no bugs found, except cinematics graphics sometimes appeared in much worse quality than actual gameplay (which are pretty good). Also keep in mind that collectibles you might have missed can't be collected once you finish the game (the game notifies about this in the last scene).			"

												Hugely underrated game with brilliant story and unique atmosphere. I wish Batman Arkham games have the same element of a detective genre this game has. Absolutely worth buying. 9/10 for impossibility to collect all the items for acheivements after the ending.			"

												Good adventure game with a good story. Not a fast-paced game and with very few action elements, but it was never supposed to be an action game to begin with. Soul Suspect plays more like an adventure game with puzzles with an occassional fighting scene (which itself is presented like an action puzzle with a small amount of strategy involved). The atmosphere is great. Sound (voice and music) and visuals are superb and convincing and set the mood for the game right away. The story is classical detective story, obviously with supernatural elements, is well written and even though not mind blowing in its ""message"", it kept me completely immersed en interested through the whole game. The game world is not very big,but detailed and varying, and there are very many things to observe and find. Lots of collectibles, but these are done right: when found, they provide smaller details to the story, or tell separate smaller stories of their own.Gameplay puzzles aren't very difficult, and failing them doesn't give any penalty. The detective puzzles will remind a lot of LA Noire, but are somewhat easier. To sum up: not a game for people looking for action. It is rather a game for people who don't mind standing still occasionally in a game for a while to observe the surroundings and solve a puzzle or mystery. If you are one of those, you are in for a treat: the game is very convincing as a supernatural spooky detective.PS: almost no bugs found, except cinematics graphics sometimes appeared in much worse quality than actual gameplay (which are pretty good). Also keep in mind that collectibles you might have missed can't be collected once you finish the game (the game notifies about this in the last scene).			"

												This game was one of the best if not the best game I've played this year! The story draws you in and makes you want to discover more and more. The voice acting is excellent and really makes the characters come alive. The game also incorporates some of the history and salem which is a nice bonus. I can't recommend this game enough! It is more than worth the money!			"

												I really enjoyed this game. It had a very nice balance between the ghost and the detective parts. The story was interesting although a little predictable. Great characters and voice acting. One issue was that the color pallet made it kind of hard to see and then navigate the city. While it was very pretty, there wasn't much variety and one place tended to look like every other place.  But my main criticism is that I wanted more of...almost everything. More things and people to interact with, more choices when you possess people but mostly more gameplay. I would have played this game for fifty hours if I had been able to.			"

												STORY: 7/10Story was good so far. The ending could've been better. Just a little bit unsatisfactory.GAMEPLAY: 8/10The gameplay so far was unique. Also may I point this out, not sure if the creator intended or or if it is a bug, some events that requires ""Reveal"" or ""Remove"" are automatically respawned again after moving from a place like for example the church then the streets. It's already recorded that you got them but it confuses me sometimes. Pretty easy to beat to be honest. It would've been better also if there was a Free-Roam Mode after you beat the game as to complete the collectables I've missed/complete my steam achievements.So yeah, overall it's not a bad game and pretty much I would recommend you to buy this especially if it's on sale.

												Murdered Soul SuspectAfter finishing it , i would recommend it , if you like adventure games and if you can get it cheap (this part is getting frequent lately on my judgement of a game) . The game is sort but not as sortas i was led to believe. Especially if you actually try to find some of the collectibles (the main ones that are worth it are those that give a flashback imo).Also if you do the side missions. Those i found interesting but i wish there were more in game. The game feels like there should be more side investigations , for example there are various ghosts around that looked like you could help the ghosts, but there aren't. I am not sure if it was an issue with money, time or they felt it was not worth it (probably on of the former).Game looks ok, neither bad nor great, sound is serviceable but nothing worth remembering. The controls are easy to use in a streamlined heavy rain kinda way (or walking dead if you prefer). The story and the characters was decent(well.. some of them at least). Voice over was also fine.All in all this is the perfect type of middle of the road game (no AAA or indie). For 20 i did feel i got my money's worth although it could have been better.I would say maybe in a sequel but i don’t think there will be one :)			"

												I had my worries of the game especially considering how multiple gaming review sites just loved to tear it a new one. I found however a particular repeating element and pattern that struck me the wrong way in most of them. The major complaints often revolve around repetition and easy difficulty structure. The learning curve is rather flat while taking the time to solve mysteries and crimes is often called child's play at that. I hate to use this term but it just feels so rather Meta in the face of the pace the game seems to give off. Salem just looks so ghostly inviting and everywhere has the potential for you to take the time and admire the lives of the still living. At the same time it just doesn't feel like a burden to get to the next part of the story and become all the more curious of the world around you. Even the collectables have merit in the stories they tell. It just seems that a great number of people expected a rather explosive and mind bending experience. Murdered: Soul Suspect is like a brisk walk through the undead and spiritual park. It's a pleasant walk. It has a great way of not stifling the flow it has set up and the characters you come to find along the way give a curious nuance to the atmosphere. Would I say the game is flawless or addictive? No, I do not believe it is an extreme grabber that you can't let go of. It's more like that book you've been wanting to read for awhile and you just finally got down to reading it. Take your time, appreciate the attention to details, and you'll feel all the more rewarded for the investment. If you're more set on something more fast paced and hectic then perhaps another title may be up your alley.  "

												It took me 8 Hours to Complete the Main Story. Playing through the game felt satisfying as you learn more about the Killer. It was a very good game for those who are interested into Detective and Mystery. The game has a little bit of Pointless running through the city at the start, but then I realised it was nice to have a bit of an explore and not completely confined to a small area. It's a shame there is no form of replayability unless you are looking for the 100% collect everything. Although good Story and as I said before, I enjoyed it regardless of what the more professional reviewers are saying. 8 out of 10.			"

												This game is very comparable to the recent Telltale efforts, a decent story without much game play backing it up. I think the main reason this game went overlooked this year was the price, people are used to paying less for a short story based game now.I enjoyed my time with this game, the story was interesting enough to justify a playthrough.This is a little odd, but no music or sound at all during the end credits, I would have never guessed how weird that would be.

												Well, a lot of what you've heard about this game is true. There is a lot of clunk to its port (the menu has no mouse support and doesn't even use arrow keys). The ""combat"" amounts to a random key press alongside a random mouse button click. And the mystery isn't that complex. So why am I recommending it, you ask? Because it never lost my attention. Between the atmosphere, the unlockable ghost stories, and the main case (albeit not Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stuff) it was just a lot of fun to play. I even got into the random key sequences of excuting demons (and was a bit suprised that in the beginning my nerves would betray me and I'd fail at times). It was Airtight's swan song, and you can almost feel it in there what with the brevity and all, but it is a nice tune for those seeking an atmospheric haunted noire vibe. Definitely not for everyone, but much better than the critics have given it credit for, that's for sure.			"

												This is a great game for those who like stories. It is very cinematic and its storytelling involves the player in Ronan's story. It's more a mystery story than a horror one (even though it has some elements). I'm going to start reviewing from the negative stuff to the positive:- Not being able to change the controls in PC is a joke. This will prevent left-handed people from playing and makes the only difficult spot more difficult by choosing ridiculous key controls - That said, the game is not difficult at all (it's almost an interactive movie), though in certain spots the difficulty spikes due to the controls- There's plenty of reading if you want to know the whole stories that make the side quests, but there's a bug in the game: if you want to read the stories of the items on the menu, press Enter, not the mouse- There's plenty of stuff to do and to collect in the city and you have almost complete freedom to move around. Still I'd have liked the option of finishing the side quests before ending the game.- The game design works great to make you feel like a ghost. I soon realised that even though I was dead I still tended to try to walk through doors instead of walls""- The experience is great.Oh, and as someone said, you can posses cats. And meow.			"

												Soul suspect is a beautiful game, I love the style of it, with a good storyline and a nice twist at the end.It manages to be both slightly dark and gruesome without being grim, and if you have the patience to hunt down all the collectibles, you'll get a couple of small ghost stories thrown in for free.My only issue is that is is a bit short, you can play through it on a weekend if you try. I would have loved for it to be a bit longer with some more side quests.But all in all, give it a go and you'll love it.			"

												Basically a watered down LA Noire with ghosts. Storyline was somewhat enjoyable, although you can compare it to some amateur detective novel. Gameplay mechanics and the world are shallow and very linear. It has one of the worst clunky controls I've ever seen, even playing with a controller didn't help much.If you get it for a few euros, it's alright for a couple of hours of enjoyment, otherwise stay away.

												Wouldn't recomend.The camera is terrible. It's too sensitive by default and it glitches and 'spazzes' out when you walk through walls or multiple walls.The game's clues are WAY too hard to find. The puzzle solving seems stupid seeming as though there is virtually no punishment for getting wrong guesses.The game's story felt alright at first but as soon I started in the second investigation I just found my self running circles getting absolutely no where. The game doesn't let you progress until you find EVERYTHING in that investigation even though it's not relevent at all.Plus the guy wears his fedora like an idiot and the graphics look DREADFUL on medium and even with a fast computer the game runs like rubbish to say it is on the unreal engine.

												By all accounts, this game should have never been made in 2014.  The market for AAA games demand experiences much different than this one.  This is a niche game, and throwing so many resources at it is a terrible, terrible business decision.The game has almost no combat, and is driven by dialogue, information gathering, and narrative.That said, I am writing this after just completing it, with a huge grin on my face.  The story in this game is STELLAR.  It evokes the slower pacing and murder mystery elements of games like the Blackwell franchise and LA Noire.  It's also compounded with supernatural elements and a heavy influence from the Salem Witch Trials.At it's heart, it's a murder mystery (your own, in fact.)  But once it starts unfolding, there is an incredible narrative to be experienced, one I highly recommend, if you don't mind slow pacing in video games.I can't recommend this to everyone, but if you love a good mystery, and prefer dialogue to gunplay, then I cannot recommend this game enough.  Like I said, it's a niche game, and if you fall into that niche, then please, please, play this game.			"

												I played through Murdered: Soul Suspect back in 2015 and I remember this being a very unique game with the story. Its basically a first person adventure/action type game where you solve you're own murder case. I thought it was well-made and had a lot of fun playing this. I would recommend this game and would give this a 9/10.			"

												Good atmosphere, music, and story. I think the ending was worth the time. Also, it's fully dubbed into Spanish, which is great.Now, I would only recommend buying this game on sale (it's 3€ now at some sites, which is quite fair). The puzzles are basically ""Mysterium"" in a nutshell, which means they sometimes make sense, and some other times you just random-click through all of the clues until you get them right cause they make absolutely no sense except for the guy who made the game lol.Some people find demons stupid. I think they're a nice touch. Repetitive, indeed, but they create some sort of fear that you wouldn't feel without them, cause you never know when ""exactly"" they are gonna pop up (but you can mostly guess). Most ghost hiding places are unnecessary, though, since you won't ever use them at all.Collectibles, collectibles everywhere. I found most of them naturally because I inspect all the stages before moving on with the story, so that I don't have to interrupt it later on to find them. I missed all the graffities, tho. Had to find them with a guide. No idea how to find all of them otherwise, except by luck. IMPORTANT: make sure you find everything before Judgement House. Otherwise you will be unable to do it later on, since the game locks you out of the city at the end (no free-roam after the credits).NPCs are repetitive as hell. Mind reading is useless, since they all think pretty much the same things. Ghost teleportation and possession come in handy in few occasions for the plot, and that's about it. Also, there are only like 5 side missions, and the most interesting one was the first one at the apartment.On the bright side, you can possess cats, xD. Press Y to meow.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect developers have implemented completely new type of investigation games. 'What is it about?', you may ask, so the answer is below:You are local of Salem, Massachusetts, the place which is mostly associated with XVII-century's history about witches, that people were hunting at and then, after catching them, they were burned at the stake. In game, there is mystical climat exposing supernatural skills of Ronan O'Connor, the main character, who had been killed at the beginning of the game and then he transformed to a ghost, who had to face demons, solve a mystery of his death and find out, who had killed him. Ronan, while getting the 'new himself', gets new skills, which allow him to move through the walls, be invisible to people, read in people's minds and even control them! During investigation he meets some demons hunting for souls, so he needs to eliminate them, or move around the place to get safer way. The game reminds me of L.A. Noire, because you need to solve problems by getting some details and then connecting them into one, making sense trace. If you complete it successfully, you'll see what happened before.Graphic effects are nice, the gameplay is happening during the twilight, so colours are darky, but they keep you even closer, because of usage them in thrilling details around. The Unreal Engine 3 is helping the game to get high details of buildings, models and characters, as well as good animations. The last thing I want to mention about is sound - thrilling music showing overwhelming atmosphere of Salem and live comments of O'Connor's adventures, which lead us to equating with Ronan even more.Murdered: Soul Suspect and its story completely touched my heartstrings and that's one of the reasons, why my note is very high! Great compilation of story, graphics and sound is forcing me to put 10/10. Hope you enjoy!			"

												If ever a game was underrated, it's this one. Fantastic story from start to finish, unique gameplay, sure it is a little rough around the edges in places but honestly it is worth playing.I play many single player games and whilst they are enjoyable a lot of them are forgettable copy and paste jobs, this is one of those games that 5 years from now, I will still remember playing, such is how unique the concept is and how good the story was.Also, the voice acting is top notch.

												It has been awhile since I’ve played an adventure game. An honest to god adventure game, where you play the character to pass a few simple puzzles to unlock the next part of the story. And Murdered: Soul Suspect developed by Airtight Games scratches that itch. Albeit it does have its flaws.Lets get the basics out of the way, you play a cop by the name of Ronan and in the first seconds of the game you get to see your character die. But unlike a lot of games this isn’t the end, because you become a ghost. Who in order to move on has to find out who murdered him. That’s the basic plot of the game, and the main story line. And so you will spend roughly 8-12 hours going through all of Salem’s locations hunting down the clues to discover your murder. Along the way you’ll befriend some people and learn some very unsettling secrets about the town.While the story isn’t the most complicated or even the best it still is written and presented well enough to be enjoyable. Along with the side quest and collectibles that fill in the background details about the town and the various characters it kept me enthralled for the nine hours that I played it, but then some peoples mileage may vary. The one complaint I will have is that the developers didn’t put more background in, or even more interesting stuff. As in very early in the game you help a young girl discover what happened to her and why she was dead, you barely ever come close to that type of detail again. And that is sad because of this the background environment in terms of engagement is inconsistent, because at one end you find a piece of the map full of history and maybe a doctor who was performing experiments on his patients then at the other end you have a boring area that you have to navigate constantly to get to other locations in the game.  Seriously it gets tedious having to run the same gauntlet over and over again, with nothing changed just the same old Salem with the same old random NPC’s.As for the gameplay mechanics, you will have learned almost everything within the first hour of how to play this game, except for a couple of “powers” you learn later on. You’re a ghost, you can pass through physical real world barriers, except for ghost barriers and all the houses in Salem are blessed or something so you can’t get into them without there being an opening of some kind. You can manipulate real world things like tv’s, phones, and printers, but except for missions these abilities don’t rouse a response out of the people in Salem. You can possess people to hear there thoughts, which there are not many of them. You can influence them to advance the case and you can view the world through there eyes to once again advance the case. Pretty nifty thing, but only actually used in the missions and have very littler bearing on the game.And that is pretty much the sum total of the game in mechanics other than the bad guys. Which are demons and floor demons as I will call them.Just like most adventure games of the past the bad guys pose little to no challenge and are merely there to present a hurdle to bypass. For being called demons if its 1V1 I’m going to win all the time. You hide in shades wait for them to turn there backs and then rip them apart. Also you can use ravens to distract them, but ravens ain’t used a lot. As for floor demons just side step them. Graphics wise, the game is pretty good, not the prettiest in terms of background environment and the character models look a bit dated, they remind me of XCOM the Bureau, or even LA Norie, but that’s not a bad thing as those games had good graphics as well. And as with anything graphics are not everything as the recent trend in PC gaming can attest to.  So you may be asking why I seemed to be praising this game in the beginning but point out a lot of flaws in it. Well because in truth there are very few actual adventure games made by triple A developers anymore so anything coming out in this genre that isn’t a bug ridden mess, it will be enjoyed by those of us who like adventure games. Where you play a guy or women trying to unfold a story, either by solving puzzles or piecing the story together . Where you don’t have to gun down an armies worth of bad guys to move from one area to the next. Where the bad guys have to be planned around as you really have no actual defense against them. Where you know you can’t lose but hate the fact that you screw up sometimes. So for an adventure game, Murdered Soul Suspect is a fine addition, its has a fairly strong main storyline and some pretty interesting side storylines and background storylines, but as I said before could use a few more to liven the area up even more. (Maybe some DLC?)For a game it is pretty average to mediocre though, with most gameplay mechanics discovered and mastered in the first hour it leaves little advancement in that area. The NPC’s are uninteresting, the graphics compared to top of the line are dated, gameplay is pretty linear, and replayability, well to be honest there is none. I’ve played ten hours and the game will probably sit there unless I have an itch to find those 5 pieces of background info/collectibles. So final verdict? If you are a fan of adventure games and smooth easy gameplay, then Soul Suspect is the perfect game for you. But if you are new to adventure games, or expecting something different then I wouldn’t suggest this game. And even if you are a fan of the genre this will slot into, wait till it drops to under $20 for it to be worth the money.			"

												This is a ghost story, About a abused misunderstood criminal, who meets his soul mate and turns a new leaf on life by becoming a detective with the help of his brother-in-law, He places the story of his life in tattoos that cover his body. His wife dies and he becomes reckless, and winds up geting killed. Now hes a ghost, searching for his killer. Theres alot to do in this game, through fairly easy. you have your main story, about 7 additional ghost stories to uncover, history on salem, and many other artifacts, something like 200 Items to search for. As a ghost you get abilities as the game progresses. The game really does not punish for wrong choices except you lose your gold badge status if you mess up. Steam has achievements to earn. There are demons and demon traps so you need to be carefull where you step, or if your running from demons not to step into traps. You can kill demons by getting behind them. or you can try to avoid them. I perfer just to kill them and get them out of the way. The game is not set up so you fail, it relies on the story telling and requires you to scour areas with a fine tooth comb to unlock all the stuff thats needs to be found. Just running through the main story makes for a short game, But trying to collect everything makes a very long game. So the choice is yours. The graphics are very good, I have not found any glitches or bugs in my two play throughs, the controls are responsive. I'd recommend this game for anyone who just wants a casual interesting story to sit back and relax and play. With that in mind the critics scores on this game is unjust. It's not a 10, but more like a 7.			"

												(I know it says it only have 5 hours on the clock but it's closer to six, around 5 hours and 45 minutes in all..that's how long it took me to finish it.)First thing i'll say is you should half ignore the paid critic reviews the only thing they got right is when they say ""It lacks a challenge"" Because that's true, this game is straight up easy from start to finish. the investigations are fun but pretty much handed to you on a plate. There is little to no combat in this game save for taking out roaming demons wit the equivilant of a stealth kill...or..stealth...banishment i guess? you have hiding spots to evade and avoid detection from these demons, there are also crows scattered around that you can use to distract them, making it easier for you to sneak up behind and take them out.That really is the only form of challenge you will find in this game and even then..it's only a challenge when there are no hiding spots around and no crows.....and even then it's still easy as hell to take them out. The story and characters are what will keep you playing here.The story is interesting, gripping and just down right fun to experience though you could easily just watch the story play out on youtube. If you want to experience this game for yourself then i suggest picking it up on sale. i'll give it a 7/10 for being short and just way too easy			"

												This game is really fun. The story hooked me in right from the start and never let go until the 'yell at your tv' ending. I find the gameplay mechanics refreshing and fun. You are a ghost so you can't directly interact with most things, but you can look and piece together clues leading you through the games story amazingly well. I don't think i ever got frustratingly stuck or bored of the gameplay. The story and gameplay flow together nicely. And the characters! I found them all to be believable, with no cliche cardboard cutouts among the main characters. The collection of all the items in the game adds more reason to search through the levels and adds a nice layer onto the story with collectables about the main character, the enemy, and even the town itself. The world feels very historic. Some might argue that it is too linear, but I personally liked that places were blocked off or I would have spent hours rifling through large buildings, getting lost XDMaybe my only complaint about the game is that there is no map, and since you can go through walls, it can get disorienting. I get that a ghost cant really carry around a map haha, its just a little nitpick, overall I loved the game and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great story and a fun time :)			"

												Finished the game in one sitting. I found it quite short but I also didn't complete all side strories, only 4 of them.The remaining stories would require a lot more, find the hidden item on the map, which I don't find that exciting to do.The playstyle was a nice change of pace from other games. Playing as a ghost and learning your abilities was cool.The storyline was ok and very LA Noire voice style. Finding clues didn't flow very well at some times since it was very obvious what happened but the detective character sounded like he didn't have a clue which was strange coming from an experienced detective. Maybe I have just watched too many detective movies.I recommend playing it but at a discounted price like I was able to get, thankfully.			"

												Two important features this doesn't have: Multiple saves and letting you complete side-missions after you finish. The issues are linked, since there's an auto-saving checkpoint maybe three minutes before the end that doesn't let you go back for no good reason (and you can't turn toggle autosave). At least there's a warning but it's still far less than ideal.If I'm not mistaken the collectibles in the museum area also become unavailable once you enter the judgement house, this time without warning.Otherwise it's decent, but not for 40€. 30€ maybe, since the game is just not that long. (I completed the side missions but not all collectible hunts, and I'm not going back since my save is effectively wrecked, which is definitely in part my fault but not something I expect to be an issue in a good game.)

Murdered: Soul Suspect Review - NihoesI know what you're thinking. Is the game a detective game? Is it like L.A Noir? These two questions are the most common asked ones, and it's a little bit like L.A Noir, but that is only because you can take choices on what to ask other dead persons. Since you're gonna meet others like you, each one of them, have their own story. You can travel into living persons mind and read them, or you can ""posses"" them. Not making them do things for you, but you can make them think thoughts that you kinda implant in their head, You can't make them do things for you, as like you ""posses"" a police officer, and then control him, nope not gonna happend.The game not only got the whole detective genre going on, but also a good old thriller.If you like mystery, thriller, action, then this is game for you. You're Ronan, a former gang member who gets tattoos for each and every 'great' memory in his life that he wants to remeber for his very own personal reason.Visit my profile to see screenshots of the game.-Nihoes			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic! I've been playing it throughout the weekend and i've just finished it. I thought it was great. I found the story to be very interesting and everytime I was left with a cliffhanger I wanted to know what happened next. The fact you play as a ghost makes the game all the more interesting to play. You cannot pick up objects and normal people cannot see or hear you. It's a very interesting way to play a game but I really like it and I think it adds a hint of uniqueness to the game.  If you've ever played L.A noire you'll probably be fairly familiar with the concept of this game (finding clues and solving cases) but gameplay wise they are completely differnet, you cannot pick up and examine clues you find for example.Don't let the negative reviews for this game turn you off from buying it. It's a fantastic game with a great story and for £24.99 (even lower on other sites) it's a bargain! I highly recommend this game to any fans of the genre.			"

												I stumbled upon this game as I was checking out the Square Enix webpage because I am a huge fan of Life is Strange and wanted to see what other titles they had that may be just as interesting. I read the information on Murdered Soul Suspect and figured I'd give it a go. I am so glad that I did. This game kept me wanting to come back to it more and more. I grew fond of Ronan and wanted to see this to the end. His ghost to medium relationship with Joy kept me amused throughout the game and their conversations back and forth lifted the darkness from the game itself. The history also was interesting as it is obvious the creators researched the Salem Witch Trials as well as other newsworthy incidents in Salem, Mass. It was well thought out on how to incorporate these details into the game without it coming across as a boring history lesson. I would have loved to have seen more helping of other ghosts around town (I think there were 4 or so?). The side quest portion I really enjoyed while continuing through the main story itself. It was fun running around Salem tracking down all the collectables. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in the Salem Witch Trials, the paranormal, and who enjoys detective work. An enjoyable game!			"

The main story starts off kind of rocky, but as it pans out, and you learn to ignore the hand-holding that occurs during the investigations and some of the sillier plot points (where the game screams THIS IS IMPORTANT), it actually becomes quite intriguing. I found myself actually ruling people out as the Bell Killer, with my mind firmly set on one person from very early on in the game. To my pleasant surprise, I only partially anticipated the ending, and it wasn't something from way out in left field as you would find in an M Night Shyamalan movie. It worked (eventually).What didn't work in this game, are many of the aforementioned investigations that hold your hand throughout, often making it obscenely clear exactly what happened without ever even looking at any of the evidence at the scene. In most cases, you needed to guide Ronan to each piece of evidence (generally around 10 items), at which point he would make a remark that is often idiotic (and very often the complete opposite of what the item clearly gave me the impression of) about how it may pertain to the case, and after you have collected sufficient evidence, you would choose the items Ronan deemed important in closing the case. Since chances are you already know what happened, you would then need to find the two or three items that Ronan needed before you could move on to the more enjoyable parts of the game. This burden is frequently increased by Ronan's tendency to ignore VERY important evidence, that could immediately close the case, to focus on items that don't really help his investigation..at all. In general, what could have perhaps been the main draw for many people in this game, ended up feeling trivial and even, at times, tacked on as an after-thought. This became especially apparent when comparing the investigative stories to what was probably my favorite part of the game.Perhaps the most redeeming quality of the game in terms of story, is sadly the part of the game that most people are likely to overlook. Each area of the game has a set of collectibles that you can gather to get a better understanding the lore surrounding that part of Salem, as portrayed through a spooky ghost story. Between these and the investigations, it definitely appears that the ghost stories took a backseat in terms of time spent working on them in the production process, as they consist of a single voice actor describing a very short ghost story, while you look at a spooky picture related to the story. It sounds lame, sure, a cinematic would have made more sense, but at the same time I think it allows you to focus more on the story itself. The ability to successfully portray a spooky story with what seems to be as little effort as possible makes me wonder why this wasn't more of a horror-based adventure game, than a detective-y investigation-y game. Perhaps the most depressing part of the story is the fact that it is so short, clocking in at only 7hrs from start to finish, getting 100% of the achievements at the same time. I would have liked to see more side missions (I'd say investigations, but there wasn't really any of  that going on), and a generally longer story than the game had to offer.CHARACTERS 7.5/10 - Ronan is basically a walking cliché for a bad guy gone good guy cop who does more than just toe the line between cop and criminal when he works cases. You can pretty much ignore his character entirely for a good portion of the game as his comments tend to only point out the other flaws in the game. Joy, the teenage medium, even comes off as a rather cliché young pain in the ♥♥♥, but her character does evolve rather well. When it comes to characters, the game really shines with the secondary characters, such as Baxter, and some of the Bell Killer's victims that you meet along your journey, who have all interacted with the killer in one way or another, and you get to see how that experience has changed them - for better or worse. The same split between really good and really boring characters can be seen in the all-to-few number of side investigations that you can find scattered across Salem, where someone may have a problem that you offer to investigate, and inevitably fix. In the cases where the characters are lame, it is often because of the same thing the investigation part of the game suffers from, the answer being too blatantly obvious to not think that character is an idiot for not seeing it. In other cases, it is clear that the character is in a literal limbo, and they need your help getting out of it. GAMEPLAY 8/10 - First off, the game as a whole  works beautifully, both as a game being played on launch week, and a game in general, as I found no bugs of any kind while playing through the game. Chances are, part of the reason the game runs so great is because it is just so simplistic. The combat in the game is about as basic as you can get, and would most likely have become very redundant had there been more combat sequences in the game. I had only just started to get sick of dealing with demons by the time I reach the last half hour or so of gameplay. It is very clear that the focus is on story and investigating the crimes of the Bell Killer (see the story section for why that is a letdown).The world around Ronan becomes increasingly impressive, and creepy, as the frequency of ghosts increases, but in general I got a very Twilight-zone-empty-town feel from Salem, and the ghosts flat out reminded me of the Haunted Mansion ride at Disney World. Ultimately, the living people that populated Salem ended up feeling even more empty than their ghostly counterparts, which I think actually gave me an even creepier vibe from the game, although I don't think that was totally intentional.While making the world feel a bit more lively is kind of optional, since a gloomier look does make sense to me as you are playing a ghost, I think Salem definitely should have been larger than it was. By the time you reach the credits, you will have only explored just over a half dozen different parts of Salem, and the streets of (a rather small) Salem itself. Sure, the areas are diverse, consisting of everything from a Church, to a Police Station, and a Mental Hospital, but none of the areas are very large, further adding to the small-world feel of the game. On the other hand, with how tedious the combat had become by the end of the game, and how pointless the investigations were (they weren't quite tedious, but certainly would have been soon enough), I think focusing more on other aspects of the game first would have been more important than expanding the world around Ronan.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect developers have implemented completely new type of investigation games. 'What is it about?', you may ask, so the answer is below:You are local of Salem, Massachusetts, the place which is mostly associated with XVII-century's history about witches, that people were hunting at and then, after catching them, they were burned at the stake. In game, there is mystical climat exposing supernatural skills of Ronan O'Connor, the main character, who had been killed at the beginning of the game and then he transformed to a ghost, who had to face demons, solve a mystery of his death and find out, who had killed him. Ronan, while getting the 'new himself', gets new skills, which allow him to move through the walls, be invisible to people, read in people's minds and even control them! During investigation he meets some demons hunting for souls, so he needs to eliminate them, or move around the place to get safer way. The game reminds me of L.A. Noire, because you need to solve problems by getting some details and then connecting them into one, making sense trace. If you complete it successfully, you'll see what happened before.Graphic effects are nice, the gameplay is happening during the twilight, so colours are darky, but they keep you even closer, because of usage them in thrilling details around. The Unreal Engine 3 is helping the game to get high details of buildings, models and characters, as well as good animations. The last thing I want to mention about is sound - thrilling music showing overwhelming atmosphere of Salem and live comments of O'Connor's adventures, which lead us to equating with Ronan even more.Murdered: Soul Suspect and its story completely touched my heartstrings and that's one of the reasons, why my note is very high! Great compilation of story, graphics and sound is forcing me to put 10/10. Hope you enjoy!			"

												The effect of the game by the end is TV Drama soaked! You'll feel LIKE YOU WATCHED an exciting, not too modern [GET THIS] TV Drama! The game feels so RETRO (think max payne)! It is 3rd person (FPS is possible for viewing objects up close) , & you do battle ""DEMONS"" and CAN beat them! But, OH; the setting-Salem - T.H.E. world's witch capital (even for modern-day witchcraft or mysticism of the highest curiosity) as it is present day! If you need a little idea of what Salem is like; there are little stores selling witching wares (potion ingredients/recipe books) all over, Helloween is a frequented celebration and marked on the calendar! The quality of the game is good for what the story has to say! It had me guessing about this CHARACTER being in the ""OTHER WORLD"". The if's were coming to mind, if this is so then that, and so on! The main protagonist is likable (definitley in a max payne and mona sax way)! The plot does have a few twists and turns, some may find it not excitable enough, but if you can appreciate SALEM, you may then dig a little deeper in!  Hell or the reverberating idea of an after-life comes around and the realm OR influence this character has in a sort of purgatorial state until certain issues get resolved to either GO TO HEAVEN or GO TO THE -OUCH WHERE PLACE! He does avoid fiery pits to be taken pre-maturely!There is also a lot of detail that CAN be tragically left out! Game on!			"

												Good premise and atmosphere, but some of the gameplay is mediocre.It's basically an interactive story point-and-click game but with a mainstream 3rd person view, some basic stealth and QTE mechanics, and a larger budget to make it more appealing to the masses. This combination of niche and mainstream works well enough, if you have modest expectations. The story is quite enjoyable, but a bit short. Voice acting is decent, and the music fits the mood well. Graphics are fairly modest on a technical level, but some environments still manage to look beautiful, and the effects look slick. While I was expecting some rough edges with gameplay, the core mystery solving mechanics also have some flaws - the answer was sometimes too obvious or seemed inconsistent or illogical. As a console port there are some issues - flawed mouse sensitivity, clunky PC controls you cannot re-bind and a prohibitive autosave system. All these issues are annoying, but they don't ruin the game completely. Possessing cats and solving crimes as a ghost was pretty cool at times.This game reminds me a bit of Alan Wake and LA Noire. While not as good as either of those games, it was better than I thought it would be after seeing the professional reviews. Its sad the developer went bust one month after making this game.If you have modest expectations and some patience, its an enjoyable interactive-story game.Recommended, at sale price.tip: add “-nostartupmovies” to the game's steam launch settings.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect was easily the biggest surprise of 2015 for me, and I think the last game that really blew away my expectations to the same extent was the psychologically assaulting trek through the sands of Spec Ops: The Line. Now of course that comparison gives Soul Suspect a lot more credit than it deserves, it’s a far from perfect game and certainly won’t be looked back on as a game design milestone. But while I expected a more or less point and click hidden object game with fancy 3D graphics and bizarrely contrived QTE’s, what I got was a decent story entwined in a fascinating and well fleshed out word with fantastic mechanics to handle action sequences.Honestly, yes. If I had to boil this game down into a single genre I would have to go with a point and click adventure. The main backbone of the game is walking from crime scene to crime scene and pressing X when you spot a clue. There is certainly nothing revolutionary about the mechanic but the content of the clues- and to a much larger extent the collectibles- brings to light a remarkably well imagined world. Now I’m not well versed in the history of Salem and the details of the witch trials, but I think the writers put in a good amount of creative effort bringing an engaging fictional story into a very real place and time. Typically the little factoids littered around the game world only appeal to completionist minded individuals like myself, however I found myself on a multitude of occasions scouring the town for that last entry to figure out the end of a story.The visuals of the game are adequate, nothing that I didn’t expect after looking at 2 or 3 screenshots. I was able to run the game mostly maxed out on my 680 and the framerate was stable and consistent.Here is the thing that made the game for me: the “final boss”. Don’t worry I will not spoil a thing, and it was actually the absence of something which made it utterly refreshing and a huge relief. Aside from a handful of action-y stealth segments with demons, the game is slow and narrative driven. As I felt the story come closer and closer to a close I got this feeling of dread. You see I know how AAA games go nowadays, every fiber of my being was expecting this dreadful quick time event unfair boss fight that has no continuity with the entire rest of the game. I was even tempted to not finish the game myself and watch the ending online because I didn’t want to walk away from such a great experience with a terrible taste in my mouth. Yet the developers NAILED it. No it’s not a spectacle and no it’s not brutally difficult, but it was satisfying and conclusive to the narrative. The amount of relief I felt at the ending was overwhelming.I’ve harped a lot on a very little point of the game, but it was a big reason this game left me with such a positive view of it. Murdered: Soul Suspect is not perfect but it’s a breath of fresh air for narrative centric games and it kept me engaged and entertained the whole way through.			"

												This game, just this game.I have so much praise for it that I don't even know where to begin, but I'll try to sound it off.-The gameplay is a breath of fresh-air because it's this unique blend of third-person action game with occasional stealth elements and exploration based adventure game with some crime scene investigation and mild puzzle-solving thrown for good measure. I have trouble really classifying it because I've never played anything quite like it, and it really managed to form it's own gameplay identity instead of being a clone of something else or fitting neatly into a pre-defined gameplay genre.-The graphics are also really pretty relative to how easy on the hardware it it. I was able to max it out (with AA turned off) at 1080p on a 750ti and it was rare that it dropped under FPS.-The story is brilliant and actually managed to have a couple twists that I really didn't see coming because of the way it played with my expectations near constantly and intentionally set itself up for common tropes only to subvert or play with them.-The art design is great and does this thing where it creates interesting eviroments by blending the real-world with ghostly left-overs of the past.-It was interesting how it turned no-clip into a game mechanic.-The bonus stuff like the side-missions and ghost stories were cool.I guess there is some cons, though:-The stealth sections can get tedious because the Demons tend to be a little to smart and aggressive, I often found myself trapped because they got stuck in the alert state and wouldn't go back to the posts no matter how well I stayed hidden.-Some poor optimization, I know I said it runs well but it does tend to suffer from really inconsistant framerates, it can be at 55FPS one minute and 100FPS the next and the Vsync is useless because it looks it to 30FPS instead of to your screens refresh rate.-Some of the items are to well hidden, I missed out on two of the Ghost Stories because I just could not find the last items for either, and one location even locked me out of room that the levels last item was presumably in.-No kind of map, even though the ""hub"" area is pretty huge and maze-like.-Short, I spent just over 10 hours on it and that was a playthrough with a lot of messing about and finding A LOT of the bonus items. I imagine it would be under 5 hours if you ignored the side-missions. -Price, I think $30 is pushing it.

I think I spent as much time as I spent playing in order to avoid the stupidly placed save points.... and redoing the same stuff again.... the game already is repetitive enough..-NPC dialogues are limited to very few lines which you'll get annoyed to hear over and over if you use the ""possess"" feature-Very few sidequests- F()cking overwhelmign amounts of product placement (Essentially every God damn computer in the police station is running Deus Ex Human Evolution... Once would have been a nice Easter Egg, so many are just annoying. Well, maybe the devs wanted to show that their company at least made one good game...)Summary:The idea behind the game is GREAT. It's a good damn shame that essentially everything else went wrong. This game was a pain to play through... To bad I also hate leaving games unfinished... Let me tell you: It's simpyl not worth it...Sidenote:Why does this game have a horror tag? Because it features ghosts? Finding out you already ate the last cookie is a bigger horror...			"

												As many of you know this game has issues, issues square enix aren't in a hurry to fix.. mainly related to the game not launching on many PC's. Luckily there are people out there who have fixed this.. and the link at the bottom is a youtube video that also links in its description to the files needed to sort it all out. :)Onto the review... This game was very enjoyable from start to finish. The story is great and the whole idea of playing a dead character solving his own murder is one I haven't seen done before and it was excuted perfectly in this game so welldone to the developers for that as in the wrong hands an idea like this just wouldn't have worked as well I feel.The games graphics and look were great. I ran it maxed out at 1080p on my Radeon 6870 with a quad core Athlon II cpu and 8gb of memory. I didn't experience any framerate issues that others have mentioned in the forums.. tho there was one part of the story that seemed to repeat itself at one point and I'm pretty sure that wasn't meant to happen as it made no sense, but the story continued fine after that little hiccup, not a major issue.Controls on the 360 controller were great, very easy to get into and layed out well. I never tried the keyboard/mouse for this game as I felt no need to, so can't comment on some comments form others about it not suiting keyboard/mouse.. considering the price of even a 3rd party wired 360 controller these days its not a problem worth moaning about and as i said, the 360 controller is fully supported and ideal for this game.The game is quite short compared to most large companies titles these days and can be completed in between probably 7 and 10 hours depending on whether to stick to the main story or want to collect everything and complete the side stories. I clocked a bit more than that as I was playing the game on a day I was ill to pass the time lol, so game was paused for periods of time while i was .. well... attending to being ill lol.I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes games with a good story to unfold.. also its a bit different to the norm thats released these days. I hope Square-Enix and Airtight Games work together again on a similar title as I'd definitely buy it.. and hopefully they will learn from their game launching mistakes with this one.As stated the game launch problems are easily fixed using the files the guy links to on youtube for anyone that needs them.. (link below, view on youtube to see description and files link)I'll give the game 8/10 despite the shorter than usual gameplay and the fact I had to fix its launching problem. The score reflects the game itself and it was great.

												Is this a perfect game? No, not by a long shot, but then again, are there any perfect games which aspire to the complexity of narrative and gameplay as Murdered: Soul Suspect? As a narrative exercise, Murdered is very enjoyable. The stories of the various ghosts you encounter are always interesting and sometimes quite haunting. Ronan, the dead detective whom you play, may seem one dimensional at the beginning, but he is 'fleshed out', so to speak as you play, to at least TWO dimensions. But to mitigate this issue are some really interesting characters and stories, i.e. the aforementioned ghosts you meet. Some are quite affecting.The game is, for the most part, solidly built and I experienced no bugs or glitches while playing the game. Glimpses of Airtight Game's puzzle pedigry show through in several sections, though there is never an explicit focus on that kind of gameplay. Yet nor is there a focus on action. This a much more quiet and reflective gameplay experience, which I wonder is not an explanation of the game's poor reviews thus far. Certainly, it is not a blockbuster, but it feels more like an independent, more closely focused affair which I think many will enjoy if they are open to it.In many ways, I kept thinking about similar games I played in the 90s. Perhaps it was the interface itself or the mood or the package as a whole. The game is a throwback, so yes it does have obvious shortcomings. The living world which it hints at is very quickly revealed to be smoke and mirrors, but as already explained, I was fine with that. I liked the characters and the ideas and the game played smoothly. I do not regret slapping down the cash for this one.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is more of a point-and-click adventure game but with actual WASD movements. There isn't really any combat besides exorcising demons rarely from time to time (there aren't many throughout the game). You mostly look around spam clicking for clues and progressing through the story. A mentally challenged 2 year old monkey can beat this game. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though. If you want to just turn your brain off and enjoy an interesting story then this will be great! Think of it as an interactive movie.This game is rather short and linear even the ""hidden"" collectibles aren't very well hidden and tend to be right next to each other. But if you enjoy a good story and interesting characters it's a good game to play through once.			"

The childish easy storyline ? Stupid npc missions? The glitches since the port is  bad (at a few points of the game v sync should be on , on others off to complete it) ?The fact that even the subs are not the same as audio?The fact that the ♥♥♥♥in Salem is smaller than my neighbourhood?The 'riddles'?  Only positive here the original  idea of a ghost cop. And thats all. Have a second copy of the game which i will give it for free to a guy i hate .Playing it will be his punishment .

												I will agree with some of the reviews, that this is more like a movie, than a game. And this game gets negative reviews because people are expecting a game, not a movie. But if it was soemthing like ""Wolf Among Us"" (""The Walking Dead"" is a bit off, sicne it's not a detective story), noone would have complained, I think. And if there were more choices, that influence the game, if collectibles did not only tell you some background, but also influenced the ending somehow, if saving ghosts influenced the story... There are a lot of ifs, that could have been covered if this was an episodic game and if it did not feel like pieces were cut off of it. And if it actually had a map IN the game, not on a web-page.But if you forget about all these, it's not a bad story. Yes, if the background told by the collectibles were more integrated in the main story, characters could become more... Real. Less flat. But overall, I actually enjoyed it. It has good dynamic: not too fast (since it's not an action game), but not too slow (as some detective quests can be), it has motivation, it has mistery.I think I'll give it 7/10. Maybe 7.5/10, since it kinda reminded me of Dreamfall (although Dreamfall had more gameplay). I wonder if Airtight Games can make something in similar fasion, while covering some negative points. Or they can simply try an approach closer to Telltale Games, I guess.			"

												I tend to give a game a lot of points if the idea of it is good and it looks good. This totally does, it's a cool film noir thing that's written like a paranormal TV show, in a good way. The 'detective' puzzles can be a little...wonky sometimes, abd a lot of them come down to trial and error. But even then it only takes a few minutes to really sort out which clue you need. The ""combat"" is kind of a sore spot, it's basically a stealth/reaction puzzle thing where you have to sneak up behind a demon, hold R, then press the WASD+mouse1/2 combination it shows you. Luckily the demons are pretty sparse. The focus is really on the atmosphere and the writing, which is actually super good.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a pretty good game, as long as you recognize it for what it is and what it isn't. It's essentially a mystery adventure game but entirely lacking in inventory. The game play is fairly simple and most of the game is fairly easy and can be finished rather quickly. A lot of it is going from point to point, looking for clues, answering a few questions based on the clues, and moving onward. In that sense its got a lot of ""novel as game"" elements. It has a small semi-stealth-like action element that crops up a few times, but it is in no way an action game. While in some sense there's not much to the game play, it has a pretty good story and a lot of atmosphere. In addition to the main plot, there are a few side quest mysteries to solve, and a large number of collectables to find if you enjoy that aspect of games.Because the game play is fairly simple, moderately short, and its almost more of a game novel at times, the game is likely not worth full retail price, but if you can get it on sale and enjoy supernatural murder mysteries, it's a worthy pick up.

												Now the game isn't inherently bad for what it is.  I just don't think it's my genre game.  Some people like the seek and find Where's Waldo games.  But at least those allow you to plot your own course to a degree.  I'm good with games keeping you on a track provided it doesn't feel like you're chilling out in a train car being taken for a ride.  They call those movies.And that is what this game is, a interactive movie.  Good dialogue, decent graphics, but the cat thing took me a few minutes to figure out.However you're not likely to get that frustrated.  That's how linear it is.			"

												So no idea why it's online reviews were so bad. I've been looking forward to this game for a long time and I wasn't disappointed at all. Think of it as LA Noireish with ghosts. It's got the whole detective thing going for it which I like a lot and wish was found more often. Pros: -Compelling story, made me sit down and play though it in one sitting, amazing.-Gameplay, if you like to walk around and discover everything then this is the game for you. It never gets dull, slow or too fast. Demons are there to change up gameplay and overall I enjoyed being a exorcist.-Graphics, beautiful game, love the art, everything looks great.-I found a few Just Cause 2 posters in the game.-Even though it's supernatural it doesn't feel fake/childish.-Writing, for the most part, was done very well.-Made me want to help the lost souls and feel rewarded for doing so.-Examples about people who throw their life away.-Good ending.Cons:-Short, only about 5 hours if you stick to the story and probably close to 6-7 if you want to 100% the game.-Character development, sometimes it felt like characters weren't developed enough for me but I like to know full blown backgrounds, I wouldn't say it was bad though.-Occasional frame drops.Overall: Solid game, would definitely recommend. Good luck in the afterlife!! Morals:Don't do drugs.Don't kill yourself.Don't hold grudges.Do something with your life.			"

												The gameplay is repetitive -- just walk around and find some stuff and sometimes kill some demons. The game itself is buggy. I was able to play the same cinematics twice. Also, the war room mission title keeps popping up on the right hand side when I start the game and then says that it's completed no matter at which point of the game I'm at. The story is not so original. The twists aren't that shocking and you can see it a mile away. The way they try to close all the loose ends just seemed so convenient. I didn't thoroughly enjoy the game and I wouldn't recommend it to friends, but if you're looking for something to pass the time with, this may be worth the while.			"

												This game has a very interresting concept and nice graphics. First, if you are planning to get this game, do not expect explosions, gunfights or whatever about action scene. There are none. You may avoid or kill some demons sometimes, but that is all. It is all about discovering and investigating, so if you are the kind skipping everything related to the story, this game is not suited for you, you will get bored very quickly. You will need a lot of reading and story comprehension to  get throught this game. The good thing is that, I personnally find the story awesome and intriguing, I have not finished it yet, but I will. I defenately want to see how it ends. I am not sure it is worth 50$, so wait for a discount or a cheaper price. I paid it 15$, I think it is a fair price. Again, it is all about the story, I recommend it.			"

												Oh man, this game. Right from it's release, I somehow knew this game would really capture my interest. I picked it up at the Humble Store when they were doing a Square Enix Sale for $15. I do not regret paying that much, as this game really caught my attention.As far as gameplay goes, L.A. Noire players will find that it's a lot alike in terms of clues you must find and mysters that have to be solved. Of course, if you fail to connect the clues to the pending question of ""who dun it"", the game is more forgiving in that regard, as you get as many tries as it takes. Get it on your first try, however, and you get a better rank for that mission.There is ""combat"" in this game, but this is the one and only thing about this game that really was shallow. The ""demons"" that all of the ghosts within the plot are afraid of are nothing more than easy prey for the protagonist. What was supposed to be a game of cat and mouse where the demons were the cats, actually felt very flopsided, as every demon encounter I had within Murdered: Soul Suspect felt like mice, and I more than likely felt like the cat in multiple situations. I really felt like the purpose of having demons within the game was really undermined, thus, it fell very flat on it's face.The overall plot to this game is where it really shines. Within each level, it's a consistent game of ""who dun it"" as I mentioned earlier. Each solved case supposedly brings you one step closer to unmasking a pertty good villain: The Bell Killer, keyword ""supposedly"". I found that whom I thought it was all this time turned out to be completely and utterly wrong, and the game laughed in my face for having me think it'd be whom the clues all pointed to.As an added bonus, within each level you can find these artifacts that, when you collect them all, tell a ghost story about the specific surrounding that you find yourself in. Because of this, I will happily be replaying Murdered: Soul Suspect so I can listen and bask in the ghostly horror of these stories.Overall, this game was great, although a bit short. At it's current price tag of $50, one might be a tad disappointed. Wait for a sale, however, and you'll truly enjoy the ghostly world that is Murdered: Soul Suspect.			"

												There's a lot of good to be found in this game, but it is ultimately let down by its length, scope, and incredibly frustrating 'combat' mechanics.You play as Ronan, a newly-deceased detective on the trail of the same serial killer that had just taken his life. In his new ghostly form, he possesses powers of teleportation, x-ray vision, and some other supernatural capabilities in addition to his police skills.The game is fully linear in nature with some detours (small side stories), but ultimately railroads players down a single, short path. Taking my time to look around, I ended up clocking just under 10 hours on my playthrough, but your mileage may vary here. In addition to basically being a one-track experience, the game heavily relies on collectibles to flesh out its characters, setting, and lore; a bad design decision as not everyone may be inclined to seek out every little hidden detail. All Steam Achievements are tied into this as well; if you collect all 242 collectibles, you have 100% completion outside of surviving the final 'boss battle'.Nonetheless, if you are a fan of murder mysteries, point 'n click games, and supernatural stuff in general, Murdered might be worth a look during a sale (you want to go for 90% off, like I did). That being said, don't expect a groundbreaking ride; interest in the aforementioned things will justify a cheap price tag on this game, but little more than that.If you have no strong interest in the above genres, steer clear of this game; short on content, zero replayability, horribly implemented and hamfisted combat, some bewildering design decisions, and suffocating linearity (with plenty of walls to stifle your progress) will kill most enjoyment you can get out of this game. Additionally, the developers closed down less than a month after release, which is pretty ironic considering the sense of wanting to get things over with the ending has about it. A shame considering the likable protagonist, but the closest the game comes to outright telling you you shouldn't have bothered.			"

The side stories are as good as the main story, I actually stopped doing the main story to find collectibles and solve some of the side cases. If you want a nice story, great atmoshpere, this is a game I highly reccomend.

												While I have said I wouldn't recomend it I do have some positive points as well as negative ones.I will admit the concept is quite a fun one, a dead cop investigating his own death however I feel this game suffers from Remember Me syndrome. A good, interesting concept with bags of potential that has a half arsed delivery. It also feels like a dumbed down L.A Noire, that maybe a bit harsh actualy but anyway it still holds your hand through the investigations that are implemented a lot like L.A Noire. The twist is ok and frankly I was quite a head of the investigation before that point anyway and the rest of the game was basicaly confirming my theories. The controls are also very odd. Exorcising demons, which I swear is never explained how the main character and only him can do it however I may have just missed that or didn't pay attention, involves holding the R then pressing either W,A,S,D and the left mouse button. Now I'm sorry but this is just too much, a 3 button QTE is just too much, it's a QTE not a think for a bit to make sure I have the right button because if you don't your going to have to run fast. These demons are quick and kill quick too, they also freak me out a lot but that might be just me. The mouse is also super sensitive and it took me a while to get used to it even on the lowest setting. The cat controls are ridiculous too and seems to be slightly less broken than Radscorpions, which is saying a lot as they are the most glitchy animals in a game, ever. Oh and the game is too short, and the escort parts are silly as the people your escorting won't move till a distraction happens to lead the person away....who is standing still at the time, not actively searching...so those being escorted are never in any real danger, so it's a tad pointless. On the whole, good concept, average delivery and worth £10 on sale, definatly not full price though.Check out my youtbe channel for lets plays and commentary every Monday and Fridayhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2l1zwMcpJm_hJq4owO3nHg "

												The game is actually pretty good. Short, but good. The story is absolutely fantastic - well written, well presented. There are a couple of problems I encountered - keyboard controls felt awkward, so I had to switch to xbox controller, the whole ""investigation"" thing is pretty linear. But what saved this game for me was the sheer amount of LORE and background for everything happening and what happened. Hell, even the town and some of it's past events are real. But also not only you can ""read"" newspaper articles or you dead wife's diaries - you can also poke around the city to find some ghostly remains of city's past, reveal some well-narrated backstories and so on.It is pretty linear in it's investigations, but outside them you have your town which is kind of open-worldish, but not really. Nice little touch is the ability to read people's minds - and even though they sometimes repeat - the amount of ""thoughts"" is pretty big and also reveals some lore.The ""ghost"" mechanic is great and executed well - the only bad thing I can name is that in tight spaces (there are not a lot of them, but still) you can easily lose your sense of space because of your ""ghost noclip"" ability. Oh, and demons are kind of annoying, but not too much, and they are pretty rare.The real bad thing is that this game is pretty short. If you ignore all nice details you can possibly complete it in 6 or 5 hours. With all the poking around it will take around 9-10, but not more. Though the story is good, really good. The whole story made me not regret buying it.8/10			"

												I REALLY wanted to like this.  The premise was unique (you're a detective and you need to find out who murdered you).  But this was just not enjoyable.The game is short.  By itself, this isn't a big deal, you don't need to put 40+ hours into a game to get your money's worth.  My playtime was 9 hours.  But I'm guessing 4 of those were spent fighting with the game's poor systems:1) No Map.  Seriously?  What is this 2004?  In a 3rd person exploration game this is unheard of & seems like it was omitted to add unnecessary time & difficulty.  Wandering about town, there is a series of intermediate waypoints that lead you to the next target, but those get broken & send you through areas that aren't available, so unless you're a navigational expert, you're stuck randomly wandering until you luck into the next target.2) Combat.  It's basically added as an afterthought to add time in between the ""investigations"" (which are generally well done, once you figure out the game's systems).  There's one monster type & it's pattern is easily identifiable.  But the controls are difficult & even if you do everything right you still might get caught & have to redo the area.  The game is using poor controls & frustration to again add extra difficulty & time, instead of giving the enemies useful AI.The graphics are fine, but suffer from overusing a ""dark & hazy"" theme.  Considering the story takes place entirely at night, this is probably expected.I was engaged enough with the setting & story enough to want to finish it, but definitely won't be replaying to get a 100% finish.

												To start off there is only 4 hours of gameplay here and no replay value. It is basically an interactive movie. It is a murder mystery. For me this game/movie was kind of boring... Not very fun for a video game. I feel sorry for those who paid full price. I guess I got my $12 worth out of this game since it's cheaper than going to the movies to kill 4 hours. This is a Crime, Drama, Murder, Mystery. I'd say I've been bored for 4 hours since I just wanted to finish the story. It wasn't worth it for myself. There was no challenge at all... Just go here investigate this and that help this person do this get here blah blah blah.... Just boring.Killing demons isn't even satisfying and it's also a very small part of the game to add a challenge... It's not challenging at all. Just get behind the demon hold R then you will have to hit W, A, S, or D with left or right click, it's completely random which is cool but i'd rather actually battle the demon with something more interactive. But yeah do that and the demon is dead YAYYYY!!! Or you can just skip killing demons and go to your next location... doesn't matter.This game is only worth $12 or less. For a single-player only game for $50 when it released and only 4 hours of gameplay if you don't care about finding every stupid hidden piece in the world. I just went where I needed to go and picked up what I could along the way. Most single-player 3rd person / 1st person games have around 8 hours average if not a little longer and also have replay value majority of the time.Bought it, played it, completed it, never playing it again, the end.

												Criminal turned detective stumbles upon a killer and end up dead. Insted of going into the light, he becomes a ghost, resolved to reveal who murdered him. It's an adventure game, most similar to LA Noire. You go around, detect and inspect clues, listen onto the conversations, talk to other ghosts, walk through the walls, think, make hypothesis, solve mysteries, and reveal the story step by step. There's no much action, but there are stealth sequences, where you have to detect demons, and destroy them before they find you. A lot of optional content (side quests, world information, character info and all that) to be found. Nice graphics and sound, a bit weird controls but one can easily get used to them. I like it.

												""Use W,A,S,D to move your hand closer to the door knob"", ""Use W,A,S,D to align your feet"", ""Use E to talk to the woman, Use E to talk to the man"" Why? They tried to make this linear game as intereactive as possible with useless button presses to do the most common things, in a 1 on 1 conversation in a cutscene they want you to press E to continue the conversation. Also did I mention it's extremely boring? The graphics are nothing special. The intro to the game is a unskippable 5 minute cutscene.			"

												Просто уверен что люди которые будут читать мой обзор,сразу же закидают меня своими тапками,но кто не рискует,тот не пьет шампанское,так что пожалуй пора начать.

												So... this game...Well, I got it as part of a Humble Bundle, so I cannot complain about it as such - it was an interesting experience.HOWEVER, had I bought it as a stand-alone game on Steam, I'd be very dissapointed.Visually impressive (to a degree at least) the game is filled with a bit too many collectable quests (get X of Y to unlock something). The investigations are sensible 50% of the time - the other half just felt I was wrong becuase the scriptwriter went for a really surreal story. Finally, the ending... well, I don't wish to spoil things, but what a cop out. On the gameplay side of things... someone decided that to build tension they need to throw in demons into the mix (either in the form of demonic ""pools"" on the ground or ""sentries"" that patrol the area). Suffice it to say it doesn't build tension, but it does slow the pace even more, and is purely annoying. Oh, and speaking of the pace - I really wish the character could make a like a ghost and move faster. Getting anywhere is a pain.PS. The game is also buggy. Because the developer is long gone, don't hold your breath for a fix for any bugs you may encounter.			"

												To be honest I expected better with this game. Better story, better mechanics, better gameplay, better graphics.  The story is probably the best part. It wasn't too obvious and had a lot twists and turns to it. That being said it does have some glaring flaws.  Some of the gameplay is fun for a while but the problem I found is that you begin with almost all the powers you will have at the end. This leaves no room for a feeling of character progression and development. It has some buggy mechanics such as having to stand at the exact right spot to interact with certain things. The graphics seem very last gen. I also HATE the stupid demon killing thing. It's very repetitive and an all round pain in the ♥♥♥ to have to take them out. Negatives aside, I wouldn't say the game was terrible. If you enjoy story based games, in particular, ghost/horror/noir based games. You may enjoy those aspects enough to warrant you buying it. I would say, buy it if it's on sale.			"

												While there are some things that I liked about this game and are really interesting, almost none of those take place in the gameplay.  Gathering clues and evidence is neat.  The game's mechanic for putting those clues and evidence together for a solution is terrible.  When it's not the most obvious puzzle ever, it's a complete guess and luck.  The action sequences are not terrible.  They simply aren't fun.  Wait till the enemy turns his back and then walk up and do the QTE.Gameplay aside though, the environment and story are interesting and the conclusion, though a bit hokey, is pretty good too.			"

Its like LA Noire but you are a ghost, thats a completely new twist to the gameplay. The story is intriguing enough to keep you playing till the end without getting bored. Being a ghost you are on -noclipmode all the time, you can walk through most of the walls except some. You can possess people  and mind read them and here is what the devs screwed up. Most of the people looks same and think the same stuff, that was really crazy lazy. Oh this game is a cat simulator too.			"

												This game is a nice break from the extreme combat oriented Triple A titles. A game where your sole purpose is to find your killer and move on to the next life, the game doesn't requre the necessity to fight every single person you see. Instead, you get a story-driven, investigative (and sometimes stealthy) gameplay. The narrative behind this game is spectacular. You'll just have to see for yourself. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone, no matter how old you are or what kind of games you like. PLAY THIS GAME.			"

												I was at first skeptical of this game, but I played it and found the storyline and characters interesting. I really found it interesting/intriguing that it focased on Salem's history and how it blended with the game's modern day storyline. Alot of references and educational material thrown in, as well as some in-game easter eggs thrown in here and there. I highly recommend this game for those interested in Salem, the withcraft trials, ghost stories and murder mysteries. The only problem I had was the uncustomizable awkward key bindings, the inability to use utilize a multibutton mouse, and the linear gameplay. NOTE: This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.			"

												Overall, I liked the game, but I do see why there was some disappointment to it.The investigation aspect was neat, but there wasn't a whole whole lot of it if that makes sense. There were little aspects here and there, but the parts where you influence people or peek at their notes was used very sparringly.For the most part you felt like a detective, but it was definitely done in a way where you could never fail. Once again, not horrible if a lot of your play is based on the story and not difficulty.The only piece outside of being the detective was the part about the demons, the cobat part. This was horrid in my opinion. When there were demons I just sighed. It was annoying. I wish there was an option to turn off the demons, like ""turn off useless boring combat mechanic that doesn't matter."" Maybe others like it, but in my opinion it was just annoying.Overall it is a decent game, as long as you can stick through lame-o combat (which there is not a lot of thankfully, and you can walk by most of it) and fairly easy riddles and puzzles for you to solve. Worth the seven dollars on sale.OH, and, minor spoiler I guess....why did they try to make it a surprise when some of the murders were based on witch killings? The game takes place in Salem, why would this EVER be surprising? It would be wierd if the witch trials didn't make an appearance...			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a game where you play as a detective named Ronan, who dies during a chase for the Bell Killer, who has been killing young women of Salem, Massachusetts.  Ronan is your typical cliche chain-smoking detective, wearing the fedora and vest, and talking with a low, raspy voice.In M:SS, you have constant flashbacks of how you died, and you need to figure out why, because you find out you are stuck in a limbo spirit world, and will be stuck there forever until you find out what you need to find out.  As you solve these cases of the Bell Killer killings to ""release your soul"", you travel through Salem as a ghost, able to walk through many walls and obstacles, viewing the real world as it progresses (without you) and spirits trapped as you are, along with ghostly residue of things that have happened in the past.As a ghost detective, you will solve cases and ask questions of other ghosts and spirits, find clues at crime scenes and put cases together, and use an abundance of ghost abilities, such as possession, transportation, and reading minds, to name a few.M:SS is a very unique game of the supernatural, and pretty interesting, but it has many flaws that ruin the flow of the game.  While playing detective can be very fun to a lot of crime solvers, the method in which you solve these crimes is a bit silly.  You simply inspect all the clues in the surrounding area, then ""solve"" the portion of the case by piecing it together with the clues you found.  The problem is, it's like putting together a puzzle where all the pieces are numbered and fool-proof...so it doesn't feel like you are solving much of anything.The worst and most obnoxious part of the game, however, is the combat system.  Yes--the combat system--as a ghost.  Occaisonally, you will come across demons, and you must use stealth to take them out with a clunky, button-sequenced execution mechanic.  If you fail, you have to retreat and hide in ""ghost residue"" until they leave.  The combat could have been completely been left out and it would have made the game better.However, even with the terrible combat system, and the goofy crime scene mechanics, the story is interesting and the collectibles you find are fun to read.  I recommend this game, but not very high, and only for about $15-20 or less.  All in all, I rate the game a 7.0 out of 10. "

												I picked up Murdered: Soul Suspect because a good friend kept stressing how good it is (in spite of all the negative reviews), and I wasn't at all disappointed with the game. In fact, I enjoyed it a lot more than I ever thought I would! The game relies largely on its characters and the murder mystery that's central to said characters' lives. If you're looking for a fast-paced, highly action-driven game, it doesn't deliver on that front - but that's what made it such a great ride for me as a player.I wasn't sure what to expect of the game from the premise alone, but it does atmospheric horror really well, along with the splashes of detective fiction and noir, too. Investigating, gathering clues, questioning witnesses, and making deducions are all important to the game. It even has an historical angle that I first thought would be somewhat canned, but actually surprised me a bit by the end.Collecting is an important part of the game and, although it's ""optional,"" a lot of the story content depends on how well you can scour a map for all of the items - some hidden and some not. Even with ~10 hours play time into my first ""completed"" game, I still didn't track everything down! So if you're a completionist who enjoys searching and interacting with maps, M:SS definitely appeals on that front.The other main challenge of the game is demon encounters, and they can be tricky to master at first, since some of the combinations are a little awkward. Still, by the last few maps it seems easier (as the difficulty doesn't really go up much during the course of the game) ... but it's definitely anxiety-inducing sometimes! All in all, the demon encounters kept the game from feeling extremely linear (i.e., like a visual novel).So if you're into mysteries and crime fiction, love spooky stuff, and enjoy a game that burns a little slowly, definitely give it a try.

												One word: Short, The game had a lot of potential, the story was geat, it had me feeling like a dective through the whole game and the side quest help a bit too. The crime solving mechanincs were good but a little glichy, wallking a round as ghots was fun and felt new to me.My problesm with the game is that they played it safe, short and simple. They could have doulble the game if they had added time travel to it. You all ready see stuff from the past but only small stuff but with time travel you could have ,witneses, much better under standing of the wicht trails from exploring the past town and the people from that time. the murderers, (spoilers) You could all so see the past bell murders and victims. The side quest would alse be better with it adding the murder , plan or thougths and reasons for it as well as seen the even unfold.  Possessioning people was very boring and not that  usefull, you had alot of copy and past npcs. Would be better if you could contol them which would make it possible to enter more building increassing the game.The town was very small and cluster together with random hinding spots all over town.Its a good game and stands out from many other games.

												This is a great game with a very interesting storyline but it is also extremely short. It only took me about 6 hours to beat the main story along with most of the side stories. The only major issue with this game is that it is one of those games like Fallout 3 where you don't play anymore after beating it - you have to revert to a previous save before you beat the game and it is pretty tacky.

												Excellent detective-adventure game, which could have easily been an awesome point-and-click adventure as well. I'd have to say, that this format fit the game even better. Excellent story, interesting gameplay mechanics, and well-optimized PC port makes it easy to recommend this one.			"

												A hidden gem or a rusty stone To some players, this game popped up from nowhere in the Square Enix's catelogue. However, some players has been following this game from E3 2013 and has been building up alot of anticipations and pre-release hype. Based on the original concepts, authentic setttings and unique mechanics, this game definitely delivers.In this epic detective meets criminal adventure heavily inspired by the likes of L.A. Noire and Alan Wake players takes the role of detective Ronan O'Connor who happens to find himself being killed by the mysterious 'bell killer'. He then not only find himself dead in the real world but simultaneous alive in another dimension like the movie 'ghost'. Determined to find out who the killer was, Ronan embarked on a endless investigation to solve the mysteries behind his death and discover the dark secret behind Salem's ancient history of witchcraft.By playing as a ghost, you gain awesome abilities such as no clipping through walls, possessing people, poltergeist electronic devices to attract attentions, and if these aren't enough you can possess a cat and go 'meow'.By poeessing common folks around the town, you are given the options mind read their thoughts. However, most of the things they say provide little to no useful information at all which makes it pointless at any point of the game. Some NPCs such as police officers will allow player to obtain useful clues regarding the cases often by means of eavesdropping, peeking through their eyes and influence their decision making.By possessing the cat, you gain access to platforming sections of the game which often will help you to get to a upper level.The detective elements of the game was not as good as L.A Noire, investigation can help you gather clues and the amount of clues needed for each case was given to players. Interrogation can only be done on other ghosts and it involves picking from limited options and are way too easy most of the time it is just common sense. With enough clues gathered, players can conclude the current investigation by chossing pieces of important information. Players are given 3 chances and even if you selcted the incorrect choices, the game will give you infinite tries leading to eventually picking out the correct information by trials and error.This idiotically defeats the purpose of giving 3 tries and has way too much hand holding throughout the story. Whereas, in L.A noire inability to solve crimes often can have consequences and investigation cannot be done again once it is concluded.The combat is however interesting as player gain ability to see demons through walls to allow advanced planning of strategies and make decisions to whether encounter or avoid. Most of the battle requires player to teleport between human remain souls to get behind the demons to perform execution called 'exorcism'. However, the game has only one enemy type and every encounter feels the same and after a while it gets repetitive.The environment is also quite boring with little open world elements, no interactive NPCs, and bland design choices that players often just walking around for collectibles, side cases or towards the next objective. Speaking of side quests and collectibles. It can be a real chore as the game has little replay value so you gasically back tracking for the sake of it. There are no incentives or rewards for doing it apart from some achievements for completing a side case or a set of collections.Characters have little personality development throughout the game, most of the time I find it hard to relate to most of them. If the story wasn't decent enough to make me continue playing I just cannot think of much selling point in this game.Techniquelly, there has been occassional frame rate drop issues and stuttering problems which is annoying but still playable. When booting up the game for the first time, the screen also flickers a few times but I won't rate a game based on these minor issues as it can be simply fixed with a update or two.Is this a good game?I think overall, yes it is a good game if you like story driven adventure that doesn't involve all out shooting and straightout combat. Its appeal really comes from a real life location and interesting depiction of Salem's ancient history and traditions with a unique play style, it can be really appreciative. If you can ignore the problems present and look at the good side of things plus the price they are asking for, I would say it is worth a try.Final verdictMurdered: soul suspect is far from perfect or a masterpiece if you compare it to similar games such as L.A noire and Alan Wake. But it borrows what is good from both titles and add its own twists which some think it is good and some simply may not like it.Finally, I think it is one of those game that should be played but just don't expect 100% perfection and a fully immersive world and rather expect a rough around the edges unque title to try in 2014.7/10			"

												Very enjoyable game with alot of twists keeping you guessing and wondering what's next. Playing as Ronan O'Connor  you piece together clues and evidence to find his killer . With just the right amount of skill for anyone to keep the story moving along.Great voice overs and dialogue that had me smiling and laughing at times.If you like to find hidden objects there are 247 total artifacts to find if that's something you'd be interested in .Having missed 3 artifacts I proceeded to the final chapter and couldn't go back. So unfortunately I will have to do a second play through to get the game to 100% . Game does allow you to skip dialogue.So as I play the game over I can fast track many scenes and also leave the artifacts I don't need alone saving time.			"

												I am enjoying this game more than i had anticipated the atmosphere the voice acting and the genrel felling of dredd and spokiness it more than makes up for the lack of gameplay elements ,"" ITS A STRONG NARRATIVE""For those who can get past the genral idea of always looking for a NPC to eliminate, this is a etmospheric ride which has very few games to compete with it in the current Genere. There is a hokey charm which can easily let you overlook the few flaws , think watching movies like FRIGHTNERS but with a general idea of case solving and playing the protagonist.			"

												Having seen footage of the very first part of the game, I was curious about the story. The characters and detective esque gameplay seemed interesting. So, I purchased the game and have only just finished it. The game is about a detective who has to find the mystery behind his own murder. This game was played with a 360 controller.Lots of text following, so:tldr; amazing cat simulator, 10/10serious tldr; Only buy if you are interested in the story only and not in it as a game. And only then when it is on sale.numbers tldr;Gameplay      [3/10] - not much of itWorld            [2/10] - felt emptyStory             [6.7/10] - not as exciting or interesting as I hoped, but still good. Narrated short side stories were very entertaining, and eerie. Graphics        [6/10] - adequateSound            [5/10] - nothing noteworthy or memorable, but adequateVoice Acting   [6.7/10] - mixed feelings, bland NPCs are bland, main characters are quite okay.You can move freely as a ghost, passing through real world objects such as walls. The design here is quite well done, clipping through objects felt quite natural in this game and definitely was an interesting experience. You grow quite quickly accustomed by it, and by the time you do the novelty of it does wear off as fast (atleast it did for me). Even though you can pass through some objects, ghostly objects and certain walls still limit you. More and more as you progress through the game, making it feel like any other regular game. Gameplay wise, throughout the story you encounter different ""crime"" scenes and are left to examine it. This involves some looking around, and depending on how many of the clues you want to find and how adept you are at it, it could take 5 to 10 minutes. It does not involve more than walking around the crime scene and pressing X to interact with an object. Sometimes,  the game wants you to be slightly more involved by asking you to, for example, select which of 3 objects matches the sound being played. More often than not, the sound and belonging object combination were quite far fetched in my opinion.  Another type of clue is when you ""reveal"" a memory of the scene. You get to see a person and need to select out of a bunch of choices what the person was doing or experiencing, again a selection of 3 to be made. When you have collected enough clues, you can ""solve"" the scene by combining the most relevant clues to mystery at that time (such as: ""What was person X doing here?""). For each of these elements, the player has 3 tries to get it right. When the player fails within those 3 tries, I believe it doesn't quite matter and the counter stays at 1. I'm not sure of this, since I've at most only had it happen to me once in the beginning of the game.The player moves from scene to scene through the town of Salem, which is filled with bland NPCs. You have the option to possess them and read their thoughts, which more often than not are only 2 of. Once you listen to a thought, you can't quit it either, and have to wait for the voice to finish talking. Other options the player rarely has when possessing an NPC is to ""Influence"" their thoughts (pick the most likely clue out of a bunch to try help the person remember something useful) or to ""Peek"" meaning watch through their perspective to see what they see. These are only ever useful with NPCs at a scene, not random NPCs spread throughout town (whom, by the way, all look similair and mostly have the exact same thoughts). You can sometimes hear them converse with eachother, which is a nice element to the game to give it a bit more depth and make it seem more alive, but it is not far enough to stop the NPCs and the town of Salem feel bland and empty.Other actions the player can use as a ghost is ""Reveal"" (hold R to reveal a ghostly object), ""Remove"" (hold R to remove a ghostly object) and ""Teleport"" (hold LB and release to teleport at an aimed location). In a nutshell, the actions the player has available to him are very limited and do not add much to a gameplay perspective value. To try and make the game more exciting (dare I say challenging?) they have added two enemies to the game: demons and a pool of demon grasping hands. When you walk over the second one it grabs you and you need to press a random direction combined with a button to get out. Once you figure this out it succesfully into like any other wall you can't pass through. Demons patrol certain areas, once they see you they try to suck your soul which means game over. You need to avoid being seen by them, meaning hiding in certain ""Ghost residue"" or simply behind walls. You can sneak up on them from behind and execute them by, again, pressing a given direction and button. Bland. Annoying. Nothing more than a nuisance.I believe we've arrived at the final gameplay element, which is the cat. Yes, you can take over the cat and move around for some basic platforming action thing. If one could even call it that, as you're basically still just walk around, except sometimes with a jumping or climbing animation. The most interesting thing for me were the short narrated ghost stories, which could be unlocked by collecting a bunch of objects. The problem with this though, was that you had to actively search around to try and find the objects, sometimes 14 of them. And you needed all of them. Got 13 and can't find the last one? Too bad, you get nothing. I would have really liked it if the developers had changed it so that you only needed to find half of them, because a game such as this that only has the story going on for it would do well to cater the only players still playing by giving them these greatly narrated short stories. The characters in the game were alright, there's a bit of character progression going on and you learn the relationships between them. The main character is enjoyable to get to know, and thinks and behaves like a real person. It was good enough to keep me interested. The game can be finished within a day's playtime if you want. I've got about 12 hours on it including afk time and searching for most of the side clues.If you enjoy the story, I recommend just watching a playthrough on YouTube or something and skipping through boring parts. I can only recommend the purchase of this game if you are truly interested in the concept of it and would like to see more (better!) of it by supporting the developers, and even then only on a heavy sale. €40,- for a game as this is severely overpriced, unfortunately.

												When PC gamers complain about console ports, this is what they're talking about. The mouse and keyboard controls are terrible. It's full of quicktime events and unskippable noninteractive sequences. The dialogue between characters is full of weird inflections and unnatural pauses, like the dialogue was stitched together from people who weren't in the same room (which it almost certainly was).The first puzzle is ""find 8 objects you can click on in this scene"", and the gameplay is completely linear. With so many cutscenes, it's more like watching a terribly edited movie than playing a game.I wish I'd listened to the 59 on metacritic and avoided this stinker. I'm only an hour in, but I really can't take any more of this.			"

Gamplay is straightforward, demons are annoyoying thankfully you can run past and avoid them. The atmosphere and partial ghostly enviroments are very well done where you can see the history of past injustices and horrofic events. Collectibles are tedious and lots of examining items for clues, buy this game for the main story not gameplay.Score: 7/10			"

												★★★★☆I had great fun with this game, the plot always had me playing to the next point to see what is going to happen. That said this is obviously a plot oriented game, everything you do is to further the plot or to give you more information that informs you in a direct or indirect way to what is happening, going to happen or has happened before. Don't expect any 3rd person shooter action in this game, that is not what it is about, it is about finding your murderer and running away (and sapping) demons. So no shooting, only talking and running XD.Okay now that that is all said and done, just a quick summary, it is a good game, definitely worth the money if you like mysteries. I would give this game a full rating but there were a few annoyances I had while playing. The textures are quite crappy in most cases, especially if the cutscenes would zoom up to the people talking, then you can see just how non ""high quality"" the textures are, but that’s still fine, I can get use to that. But what bugged me the most was that to play the game I had to launch it 5 times every time -_- because the game would automatically flag itself if is set to be fullscreen, for some bloody reason, so I had to open the game, close it, open it, close it, flag it open and close, open and close, and just hope it will not auto flag itself afterward.Now that said this game still gets a 4/5 from me :) enjoy, and hopefully you won't have the annoyance I did.

												I decided to try this game seeing the good user reviews on steam and after finishing this game i realized not to trust professional reviews and ratings. This game is actually good. Its like LA Noire but you are a ghost, thats a completely new twist to the gameplay. The story is intriguing enough to keep you playing till the end without getting bored. Being a ghost you are on -noclipmode all the time, you can walk through most of the walls except some. You can possess people  and mind read them and here is what the devs screwed up. Most of the people looks same and think the same stuff, that was really crazy lazy. Oh this game is a cat simulator too.			"

 So, Hear Me Out, I'm Going to Do Something A Bit Different Here I bought this game for next to nothing on Humble Bundle a while ago and played it awhile ago. Now I'm giving this a positive rating because I enjoyed it for what it was for how cheap I got it at. That said, I am going to give you a dual opinion here. You will hear the side of me who got it cheap and you will hear a side of me who bought as if it were 60 dollars. So, to be fair, I will ♥♥♥♥♥ for both sides. Let's begin.Legend1 - 60 dollar opinion2 - 2 dollar opinion (around the price I bought it for)(1)ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING KIDDING ME!!!! 60 dollars for less than a 5 hour experience? I forgot this was an interactive movie. This David Cage ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off where game developers think a good short story is enough to justify a 60 dollar purchase for a ""Video Game"" as in you play the ♥♥♥♥ing game. Sure, the story is decent but the game play is ♥♥♥♥. No wonder so many people were ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about this interactive story, it lacks meat, it has almost no game in it. Now you have to follow some teen girl around because shes the only one that will put up with your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or rather is the only one who can since no one else can hear you since shes psychic that has to listen to whiny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s like your character who can't handle being dead so he has to find out which ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ killed him. Of course, I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ since the main character is easily forgetable, hell there's interesting side characters I remember more than him that are in this game.(2)The game will start off with your character, Ronan, literally dying in the first 2 minutes after starting. The game had a good story and even though lack of game play was present here, at least for the price I got a worthwhile experience and an interesting concept of a story. While the game play does lack, it does have pretty entertaining parts to it at times. These times being the investigation parts where you, as the ghost, investigate crime scenes finding things that humans can't quite find. The game makes you pick 3 evidence that you found to match up a story but there's really no penalty here, the game will just move along and that's that.(1)Speaking of the ""game play"" there is ""stealth"" sections but they aren't stealth, its just waiting for someone to turn the ♥♥♥♥ around or setting off a printer so that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ can check it for eternity while you guide a teenage psychic around. You can also possess this teen or other humans so you can pass certain sections you can't get through by yourself. Yeah, this is the first Triple A game where it encourages you to go inside a teenage girl, ♥♥♥♥ing perverts. You also can possess animals as well, so now for 60 dollars I can go inside a teenage girl and a cat, was this concept straight out of Jared Fogle's computer history? You also can read their mind and hear what they're thinking if you're a nosy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. This game also presents you with a linear open world where you can't travel through certain walls, cause ♥♥♥♥ it, right? They came up with some sort of an excuse but I forget what it was.(2)The game play, or what is there rather, consists of stealth sections, while linear, are more like puzzles you have to solve. You guide the teenage psychic through a dangerous area, like, a Police Station or a Mental Hospital. You just distract somebody one certain way and you move her on. Sometimes they might switch it up but essentially its the same kind of pattern. There's also collectables...(1) Who gives a ♥♥♥♥ about the stupid collectables.(2) ....That I can agree with. So, they're not hard to find but with a game with little content in it, I doubt it'll reward you in anyway besides giving you behind the scenes videos to watch. The open world is hard to traverse at times since its got a lot of invisible and visible walls up to block you way. It can be a boring and confusing process but for being a slow game in the first place, it won't affect the flow too much unless you are on your way to a dangerous event taking place. You also have to use these ghostly hiding places where you can hide from demons when they are hunting you down. You can go about two ways of taking care of demons in most situations, one: You ambush all of them and send them back to hell or you take out who you have to and move on leaving the others alone.(1) The voice acting is meh, but I'm not here to listen to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I want to play a ♥♥♥♥ing game. Why is that for 60 dollars that out of my 3-5 hours I have to sit here and listen to an hour total of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t? This game is like the Order 1886 before the the Order 1886. Sure, the atmosphere is creepy and the demons you have to hide from are scary, however, the story is decent, like I said. But there's still no game here. I don't get why this game got a 9/10 for 4 hours of story and almost no gameplay. The game play itself isn't even innovative, why is no one else ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about this?(2)I thought the voice acting was pretty good and the scenes were shot well, although not perfectly. I did enjoy the story and the characters moving around were realistic looking, like they're actually just human beings, they have casual movement and the lip syncing isn't even that bad. Overall, it makes it more believable of a story.(1)Overall, for 60 dollars, its an over glorified movie and its game play is almost non-existent. Its a sad attempt at a game but a good attempt at an interactive movie. Of course, it should be this expensive, you greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s over at Square Enix need to stop ruining the game industry damn it. You ♥♥♥♥ing ruined Deus Ex Mankind Divided cause of your ♥♥♥♥ing greed you mother..(2)Unless you can get it for the price I got it at, which is dirt cheap, yeah, just look it up on YouTube or something if you don't wanna buy into it since its just a movie and not much more than that.

												I'd only recommend this game for its story only - in no way is this game worth the full price and it doesn't live up to what a game should be (some good gameplay elements but not used very well).This game is more fitting for a movie than a game since the whole ""clue"" thing is very much compulsory to proceed in the story line. The investigation aspect is forced on to you on each level and spoon feeds you on what you need to do, meaning that the harder-to-find clues aren't even necessary and have no impact in the game, making it a linear story. Side quests are almost non-existent despite it showing some potential with some of the ghosts you talk to - most of which, there is nothing to persuade them to move on from the living world. It has much potential but it dies down and you realize that everything you thought was cool, becomes repetitive and or unnecessary. Gameplay/Story aside, there are annoying technical issues with this game - only one save file is allowed and the autosave is terribly planned. If you're unlucky, like me, you'd have spent some time and lose all your progress with side quests (did two side quests and quit the game, only to find out that the game didn't save). The game's vsync is garbage, your video driver's vsync produces better results.To sum things up, the game aspects of this game are great but not used well to keep you entertained for long. The only things that could keep you entertained would be the story and that depends per user's preference. The autosave feature sucks, it only saves during main quest and when you enter/exit places. It doesn't save on the town map at all.[Possible spoiler regarding gameplay]The teleport and remove abilities are barely used in this game, making you wonder ""whats the point of having this?"". In the end, you only use the teleport ability for travel conveniences rather than to get past obstacles like how it was originally introduced to you. Remove ability is pretty much dead in the game, there's no point of having it. I'm quite ok with the monsters but other people may have issues with them. The demons need more variety. There are only 2 types of monsters that get in your way and it's those same 2 from beginning to end. Their availability in the game are very rare and illogical - you don't see them in the open map and only during story related quests. The investigation/clues - some answers are stupid and doesn't fit well in what you are observing, others are so obvious. As mentioned before, the important clues are in your face and you're forced to use them as your evidence. You won't be able to proceed unless you use those set pieces.The AI ... at first, you think it's cool but as you play on and interact with the non-quest related AI, it all becomes repetitive. They all say the same things and they don't react when you use poltergeist... they're there for decoration and nothing more.  "

												This title looked fantastic when I first read about it and watched the teasers. Then I watched the first few minutes of gameplay, coupled with reviews, and (wrongly) came to the conclusion that is was a hidden object game/single-room puzzler wrapped in a 3rd person Unreal Engine. Not the case at all. While the puzzling is not brain taxing in the slightest, the story is interesting and the setting can be almost beautiful in places. There is no horror to be found, unless you found Peter Jackson's Frighteners scary. Were it designed for grown-ups instead of E for Everyone it could have been so much more.Despite it's flaws, I found it enjoyable and sometimes hard to put down.			"

												Really awesome game, painfully short.  Game is pretty easy, really no penalty for wrong answers to investigations.  It's also really linear.  But regardless I found myself really enveloped in the world and lore, I found myself finishing it quickly within 3 settings, totalling 10 hours.  If I could say one are I did not like were the demons (enemies) in the game, the only way to beat them is to use a QTE that lasts no more than 1 second on screen that randomizes each time; if you fail you need to hide for a good 30 seconds to a minute if not more each time.  If more than one demon is chasing you, good luck - just kill yourself and restart at checkpoint because I *never* was able to elude more than one demon at a time.The story is fanstastic, the voice acting is above average bordering on great.  There is an awesome twist right at the end and the culprit, in the realm of the gameworld, is believeable and throughly explained.  However it has very little to no replay value.

(The demon fighting I found to be rather tedious and wore thin quickly.   I would've been happier if this had been executed as more of a straight on adventure game.)In spite of the some of the flaws, I feel the metacritic score of 60 is a little harsh.			"

												This game is a nice break from the extreme combat oriented Triple A titles. A game where your sole purpose is to find your killer and move on to the next life, the game doesn't requre the necessity to fight every single person you see. Instead, you get a story-driven, investigative (and sometimes stealthy) gameplay. The narrative behind this game is spectacular. You'll just have to see for yourself. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone, no matter how old you are or what kind of games you like. PLAY THIS GAME.			"

												WELL! just finished it (12 hours gameplay... really tryed to enjoy it).... WELL...where to start?first: was waiting for this game 2 months... big expectations.... preordered and waitedsecond: limited edition - there was a small journal (i have a phys. game DVD limited ed.) - nice small book, interesting reading.... no spoilers... just some ""background"" info... nicethird: the game.... well... the story is great i think, the end surprised me. Nice twist. I guessed another ending :) The story, i mean the IDEA of this game is great/unique. The afterlife and etc. Many ghost NPC - some interesting, some useless. The living NPCs on the streets.. .well... the city was a bit dead .... empty. (many repeatitive toughts and lines, etc...) not enought side quests.The gameplay.... not bad, but not superb...  I think the action passages were..... the fighting part was for 3rd time boring. But the demons were great (mean the design, not their skills or AI)I think 2-3 months more for betatesting to correct flaws and changes in gameplay, this game could have been PERFECT  (9 from 10) but maybe next time!But now... one playthrout and I think I never play it again. There are flaws for me I cant never forget....Dont buy it for full price or you become angry. Trust me.  (10-15 euros, or sale)In past, Ive played fahrenheit (indigo prophecy) and both Alan Wakes (game and expansion)... I think this game is first for me, then Alan Wake, and then fahrenheit. Didnt liked the Alan Wake supernatural part, and fahrenheits either. But this was more believable. I really want to try Beyond 2 souls and heavy rain, but i dont have a ps3 and they never make it for PCs.I can tell Im satisfied... And I think theyve made a room for a sequel maybe...I give it a 7 (i dont care for the reviews) this game is: you love it or hate it... no other way. And I loved it more like hated it.Fans of deep story adventures are welcome... the others... well.... you can try (but dont forget, not the full price) :)7And one more thing - the MC was great. He played it very well(he had a great style and personality). And all others too. Like a theatre.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a typical Square Enix title story-wise, however it falls short on game length, suspense based on its genre and some pretty slow controls. What do I mean by slow controls? I mean that walking is more like shuffling and the run option is nothing more than a fast paced walk. Granted you get a power later on that helps with that problem, but only to a point.The story is well presented but it still feels rushed and boring at times. The only thing that would make the gameplay any longer is by aquiring all the collectibles which I feel has had more time spent on than some more important parts of the game, both finding them and reading/watching them. This game is portrayed as a thriller and it hasn't failed on that part. However it also implies some horror elements that aren't really present, even with the ""spooky"" spectres.As my activity time shows, I've not spent long on this game. I'd say that the campaign is only around 3-4 hours long and all other time is spent simply getting the collectibles or completing the tiny amount of sidecrimes/cases that you can solve.All in all, this is getting a thumbs down. While the story is good, I can't help but feel that this game was rushed out to help with the new gen consoles rather than be a good game. I also don't think that with the small amount of time spent on thisgame it is worth the £24.99 price tag.			"

												While I do recommend the game overall, I have one major gripe with it: the demons. Having to fight them was, for me, a total distraction from the story. In short, they were supremely annoying. IMHO, the game would be much better without them.I have one other, less serious, gripe: the navigation system. At various times there is a pointer displayed that, supposedly, tells how far, and what direction,  it is to the intended destination. It's practically useless; truly annoying.On the positive side, the story is really good. The way the graphics are handled is also pretty clever. Some say it's similar to L.A. Noir. I've never played it so I can't compare. The movement mechanics for keyboard were good. It is a little slow at the beginning while trying to figure out what to do, and how to do it, but it picks up as you get into the story.			"

												Graphics are nice, but the control system is limited and a little forced (obviously intended for a controler). the only 'Action' is when you interact with demons and try to kill them from behind, in which case you have to quickly push a randomly chosen WASD key+mouse button combo while holding down another key to initiate. If they see you first, or you miss the key combo (EG because you're moving when you initate and the key your holding isn't the right one) then the only thing you can do is run away untill their not searching for you anymore and try again. Other than that it's a really simple detective game where you atempt to move your character into just the right spots to be able to interact with clues to get really obvious hints. (you get flashes of information when you find the clue, then you have to watch it all over again anyway once you 'solve' the crime)If you enjoy 'Tell me a story' mode games and can get past the controls it's alright. but get it on sale.

												The game has a good story, nice environments and believable characters with solid voice overs. Actually, it could have been one of those interactive movies if not these two things.First of all, it's completely linear. The main story and a few side quests. The only variable is whether you find all the collectibles (they are all related to the lore) or not. More likely, not - looking for every collectible is just too boring and doesn't provide much new information.Secondly, for some reason the creators tried to add more depth to gameplay and introduced demons that you need to hide from or kill stealthily. And it just doesn't work. Too easy for any Thief (Splinter Cell, Hitman, etc) player and too boring on top of that. Thankfully, those moments with demons are really short and sometimes you can simply run through them and then hide.Despide the flaws, I still recommend playing it. Basically, it's like watching a good movie. Perhaps you can even be surprised in the end!			"

												To be honest I expected better with this game. Better story, better mechanics, better gameplay, better graphics.  The story is probably the best part. It wasn't too obvious and had a lot twists and turns to it. That being said it does have some glaring flaws.  Some of the gameplay is fun for a while but the problem I found is that you begin with almost all the powers you will have at the end. This leaves no room for a feeling of character progression and development. It has some buggy mechanics such as having to stand at the exact right spot to interact with certain things. The graphics seem very last gen. I also HATE the stupid demon killing thing. It's very repetitive and an all round pain in the ♥♥♥ to have to take them out. Negatives aside, I wouldn't say the game was terrible. If you enjoy story based games, in particular, ghost/horror/noir based games. You may enjoy those aspects enough to warrant you buying it. I would say, buy it if it's on sale.			"

												Nice, entertaining and original detective/adventure game, almost totally focused on exploration.The story is good but quite predictable; the mechanics simple but addictive.There are also very brief stealth moments, combined with a little of Quick Time Events... More like Normal Time Events, since there isn't the hateful timer, so it's not annoying.			"

												This game is very similar to LA Noire but instead you are a ghost detective in the present day instead of an LAPD detective in the 40s. The gameplay mainly consists of walking around and examining objects in the environment to help solve cases. If that bores you, don't get this game because there is not even much of a combat system aside from sneak attacking demons once in a while. It is kind of open world in the sense that you are free to walk around town and collect objects to solve side cases, but the lack of any sort of map or minimap makes exploration a hassle. With all that being said, I enjoyed the story and atmosphere of the game, which is surprisingly a bit lighthearted for a game about ghosts. It took me about 7 hours to complete the game and I also took my time to grab most of the collectibles as well.Verdict: Definitely get this on a sale, it is short but sweet. 6/10			"

												A great thriller rollercoster ride with top notch narrative and voice acting. Its like watching a 8 hour suspense horror movie. Gamplay is straightforward, demons are annoyoying thankfully you can run past and avoid them. The atmosphere and partial ghostly enviroments are very well done where you can see the history of past injustices and horrofic events. Collectibles are tedious and lots of examining items for clues, buy this game for the main story not gameplay.Score: 7/10			"

												They probably made the game and before going gold, some genius noticed and said ""Wait, we made a game, but we forgot to put any challenges in it."" so they added some useless demons to the game for the sake of jump scares. I've read that you were a ghost, investigating your own death and the idea seemed cool so I got the game. If they didn't add demons and made the investigations logical and challenging it could be a great game.			"

												A hidden gem or a rusty stone To some players, this game popped up from nowhere in the Square Enix's catelogue. However, some players has been following this game from E3 2013 and has been building up alot of anticipations and pre-release hype. Based on the original concepts, authentic setttings and unique mechanics, this game definitely delivers.In this epic detective meets criminal adventure heavily inspired by the likes of L.A. Noire and Alan Wake players takes the role of detective Ronan O'Connor who happens to find himself being killed by the mysterious 'bell killer'. He then not only find himself dead in the real world but simultaneous alive in another dimension like the movie 'ghost'. Determined to find out who the killer was, Ronan embarked on a endless investigation to solve the mysteries behind his death and discover the dark secret behind Salem's ancient history of witchcraft.By playing as a ghost, you gain awesome abilities such as no clipping through walls, possessing people, poltergeist electronic devices to attract attentions, and if these aren't enough you can possess a cat and go 'meow'.By poeessing common folks around the town, you are given the options mind read their thoughts. However, most of the things they say provide little to no useful information at all which makes it pointless at any point of the game. Some NPCs such as police officers will allow player to obtain useful clues regarding the cases often by means of eavesdropping, peeking through their eyes and influence their decision making.By possessing the cat, you gain access to platforming sections of the game which often will help you to get to a upper level.The detective elements of the game was not as good as L.A Noire, investigation can help you gather clues and the amount of clues needed for each case was given to players. Interrogation can only be done on other ghosts and it involves picking from limited options and are way too easy most of the time it is just common sense. With enough clues gathered, players can conclude the current investigation by chossing pieces of important information. Players are given 3 chances and even if you selcted the incorrect choices, the game will give you infinite tries leading to eventually picking out the correct information by trials and error.This idiotically defeats the purpose of giving 3 tries and has way too much hand holding throughout the story. Whereas, in L.A noire inability to solve crimes often can have consequences and investigation cannot be done again once it is concluded.The combat is however interesting as player gain ability to see demons through walls to allow advanced planning of strategies and make decisions to whether encounter or avoid. Most of the battle requires player to teleport between human remain souls to get behind the demons to perform execution called 'exorcism'. However, the game has only one enemy type and every encounter feels the same and after a while it gets repetitive.The environment is also quite boring with little open world elements, no interactive NPCs, and bland design choices that players often just walking around for collectibles, side cases or towards the next objective. Speaking of side quests and collectibles. It can be a real chore as the game has little replay value so you gasically back tracking for the sake of it. There are no incentives or rewards for doing it apart from some achievements for completing a side case or a set of collections.Characters have little personality development throughout the game, most of the time I find it hard to relate to most of them. If the story wasn't decent enough to make me continue playing I just cannot think of much selling point in this game.Techniquelly, there has been occassional frame rate drop issues and stuttering problems which is annoying but still playable. When booting up the game for the first time, the screen also flickers a few times but I won't rate a game based on these minor issues as it can be simply fixed with a update or two.Is this a good game?I think overall, yes it is a good game if you like story driven adventure that doesn't involve all out shooting and straightout combat. Its appeal really comes from a real life location and interesting depiction of Salem's ancient history and traditions with a unique play style, it can be really appreciative. If you can ignore the problems present and look at the good side of things plus the price they are asking for, I would say it is worth a try.Final verdictMurdered: soul suspect is far from perfect or a masterpiece if you compare it to similar games such as L.A noire and Alan Wake. But it borrows what is good from both titles and add its own twists which some think it is good and some simply may not like it.Finally, I think it is one of those game that should be played but just don't expect 100% perfection and a fully immersive world and rather expect a rough around the edges unque title to try in 2014.7/10			"

												There’s been a mukduk!You play as Ronan and have to accuse someone of a murder. Your own! High quality graphics give noir-detective feel to modern day Salem. Voice acting is superb and really takes the game to the next level. It is a very well written whodunit. Do not expect action packed shootouts. The game is all about the story.   It keeps you interested until the finale and I really enjoyed discovering Salem, the clues and getting to know the characters involved.  "

												Murdered is a game with an interesting idea and showed a lot of promise before it was released; a game where you play a deceased detective hunting down his murderer whilst solving crimes and using ghost powers, what's not to love? Well the problem is that the game is ultimately short and, frankly, boring - there is nothing to do outside of the main quest aside from FOUR side-quests and a bunch of collectables no one really cares about; the use of ghost walls, while a good concept, are only present to hide how small the environment is; and the biggest problem? This game is far too easy. It has a points system depending on how well you solve the crimes, but this doesn't actually have any impact whatsoever, and there is no penalty for making a wrong judgement, sure you lose a point but even after you lose them all you can keep on guessing. Oh and this game can be painfully short, if you're good at it you can complete in under 4 hours (or if you want to speedrun and miss the cutscenes - the story is the best part of the game, mind you - you can complete it in about 2). So yes, Murdered is an OK game, but it's one that will be played once and probably be forgotten about soon after playing it. However I do recommend playing it, but get when its on sale.			"

												6 hours game playAfter having finish this game, I would rate this 6/10. The score are deducted as follow.-2 for game lengths. having to wait for a year, I would have expected the game to last for more then 6 hours of game play. And for the amount that I am paying it is not worth getting. heck there isn't even a start new + where we can do more side quest or something. Major disappointment. -1 not challenging enough. I have play many other detective rpg games but this one seems to be really dumb down. the clues were very easy to get and conclusion was very obvious. I was expecting more of a challenge and a little bit more action. -1 no charctor build. there were no real charactor background relating to the game.  for example there were no solid explanation as to why the antigonize went out of its way to hunt the so call ""witch"" in the game. overall it feels  like the charactor are introduce as if they were made up on the spot. overall conclusion, i believe this game has more potential and hope that there are some sort of free dlc for customer who paid at $49.99. I would not recommend to get this game at a full-price. If you are really interested, then try waiting for the price to go down like say 19.99 or something (well, if you waited for a year, might as well wait a little longer).			"

												Terrible game. Predicted the final solution within the first five minutes of the game and spent the next four hours screaming in frustration at the stupidity of the main character. Feel like this game smacks you round the face with every answer, leaving no detective work to do and no mystery to think of. You can typically think up answers with one clue, but have to find a dozen arbitrary things - mostly irrelevant - before you can progress.Slow, no replay value, and definitely not worth the money.

												I picked up Murdered: Soul Suspect because a good friend kept stressing how good it is (in spite of all the negative reviews), and I wasn't at all disappointed with the game. In fact, I enjoyed it a lot more than I ever thought I would! The game relies largely on its characters and the murder mystery that's central to said characters' lives. If you're looking for a fast-paced, highly action-driven game, it doesn't deliver on that front - but that's what made it such a great ride for me as a player.I wasn't sure what to expect of the game from the premise alone, but it does atmospheric horror really well, along with the splashes of detective fiction and noir, too. Investigating, gathering clues, questioning witnesses, and making deducions are all important to the game. It even has an historical angle that I first thought would be somewhat canned, but actually surprised me a bit by the end.Collecting is an important part of the game and, although it's ""optional,"" a lot of the story content depends on how well you can scour a map for all of the items - some hidden and some not. Even with ~10 hours play time into my first ""completed"" game, I still didn't track everything down! So if you're a completionist who enjoys searching and interacting with maps, M:SS definitely appeals on that front.The other main challenge of the game is demon encounters, and they can be tricky to master at first, since some of the combinations are a little awkward. Still, by the last few maps it seems easier (as the difficulty doesn't really go up much during the course of the game) ... but it's definitely anxiety-inducing sometimes! All in all, the demon encounters kept the game from feeling extremely linear (i.e., like a visual novel).So if you're into mysteries and crime fiction, love spooky stuff, and enjoy a game that burns a little slowly, definitely give it a try.

												After hearing bad reviews about this game, I was a bit hesitant to even buy it. But the more I read into the reviews, the more I realized that this game was just never given a fair chance from the start. A lot of people came off as jaded as to what they wanted and expected with ""Murdered: Soul Suspect"". In truth, I feel as though they were wrong.""Murdered: Soul Suspect"" is what you expect out of a good ghost story, or even a Noir movie. You have many different characters that fit the roles they were supposed to play. The story keeps you guessing until the very end, and manages to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. While it is not like a sandbox game like many had hoped and desired, you still have plenty of places to explore and little nooks and crannies to find within the game's structure.This game is not for a player who wants a sandbox world, who wants to shoot up bad guys, or that has to really put some effort to unlock, discover, and solve the many puzzles within the game. This is the kind of game that is for those who enjoy the journey it takes you on. For those who loved games like ""Gabriel Knight"" or ""7th Guest"". Good horror stories that make you want to discover everything that happened and why.While the replay value may not be as good as some other games, it is the sort of game you will play, try to find all the artifacts in the first run through, and then put away when you are finished. You will then pick it back up after awhile, and play it once more for the amazing story it tells.			"

												The entire premise of this game is solid. The story is well done. The characters aren't half bad. The locations themselves are very well designed and it doesn't overstay its welcome (about 8 and a half hours to 100%). That being said take note that some problems exist (at least at the time of writing this ""review"")1. No key rebinding. At all. Unacceptable. Good thing I used a pad.2. If you miss any collectibles you can't go back and find them after completing the final sequence of the game. This game has over 200 collectibles. It honestly expects you to find them all in one go.3. V-Sync locks the game to 30FPS. Unlocked I didn't notice any tearing myself but YMMV. (Runs at over 100FPS maxed on a 2500k/12GB DDR3/670 @ 1920x1080 if you're curious about performance). 4. There are terrible tacked on demon fights in most chapters of the story. They add noting and just slow the game down. It's just a game of waiting for a demon to turn its back to you so you can come out of hiding and do a quicktime event. Absolutely. Pointless. Outside of that, it's pretty awesome and worth about $20-$30. It's no L.A. Noire but as far as detective games go it's not bad.			"

												When PC gamers complain about console ports, this is what they're talking about. The mouse and keyboard controls are terrible. It's full of quicktime events and unskippable noninteractive sequences. The dialogue between characters is full of weird inflections and unnatural pauses, like the dialogue was stitched together from people who weren't in the same room (which it almost certainly was).The first puzzle is ""find 8 objects you can click on in this scene"", and the gameplay is completely linear. With so many cutscenes, it's more like watching a terribly edited movie than playing a game.I wish I'd listened to the 59 on metacritic and avoided this stinker. I'm only an hour in, but I really can't take any more of this.			"

												""Murdered: Soul Suspect"" had my hopes. Yet, as soon as I downloaded it, it disapointed me. The gameplay is rough on the PC and even the font isn't well polished. I had high hopes for a ""Resident Evil"" kind of game. Yet, the game was glitchy and laggy.			"

												Bought this one as part of a Humble Bundle.Pros- the story is quite satisfying, the intro is such that I actually said ""WOW!"" out loud, flashbacks are well done and interesting, backstory is well told- the main characters are quite fleshed out, especially Ronan (see what I did there?)- love the voice acting, it's quite good, even for minor characters- lots of collectables (if that's your thing)- performance is excellent, I did not encounter any bugs or technical problems what so ever, very polished- you get to be a catCons- combat is THE WORST, you basically have to walk up to the enemy (demon) and pass a QTE, if you fail, you can scramble to get out or (more often) stand there feeling helpless, VERY FRUSTRATING and the reason I'm uninstalling before finishing- gameplay (besides combat) is underwhelming, I've expected much tougher and more diverse puzzles- the city feels quite empty and samey, people's thoughts repeat and are otherwise boringTLDR enjoyed the story, left because of the combat which (I feel) shouldn't be in a adventure / puzzle game to begin with.

												I heard good things about this game, and it's an interesting premise, but after three or four sessions I'm losing interest.  The gameplay typically involves wandering a room/area and picking up 16/16 random glowing points, for each you'll get a mostly uninteresting sentence to read ""A police report.  Witness says the killer was wearing a hat."".  Then he'll come to a conclusion to move you to the next scene.  The dialogue is also typically very uninteresting.  You can read NPCs thoughts which should be cool, but each NPC has 2 useless dialogues, and they share the same dialogue with the other NPCs.  ""It's so cold outside"" ""I don't feel safe with a killer on the loose"" etc.  And everyone else who has unique dialogue is some kind of secret psychotic serial killer.  The demons are getting annoying.  My favorite part was a bit where you can ""posess"" and become a cat to access an area you otherwise couldn't.  The main character's backstory was interesting, but just poor implementation so far.  I'll probably push through and finish it, but I'm disappointed.			"

												5/10Best Part: Playing as a cat!Game with a lot of good ideas that got made by people who didnt know how to craft them into a good game-------I have bought this when it was on sale and since i really like these adventure games especially playing as a detective I just could not get into it. I was so bored... soooo bored. I did not expect another LA NOIRE but c'mon.. the best part was the intro video. It does have a very good story with interesting characters but it is so dull when you play it.It is sort of like this. You get into a location where you run around and picking up some totally useless things for revealing some sidestories which are interesting (some of them) but after picking up 5(/10/25) whatever they want (saw/papers/photographs) you go ""OMG just give me the achievment and let me go"". And the game starts telling you the whole sidestory while looking at some picture or something similiarily cheap.Some weird ♥♥♥♥ in the location where you run around belongs to the main story. But the point is same. You runnin around like an idiot and then go ""HA! it wants me to push E"" then you push E and then continue to run around. Then it asks you some totally dumb question and you got to connect some clues which would be interesting if the game would punish you for a wrong choice... You picked the wrong clue? Nevermind.. Pick another! So you can just click around cause it doesnt matter and answering questions like ""Why did she go to church?"" with an answer ""I think she did go to the church"" summs up the dullness of the ""detective mechanics"".Overall Murdered Soul Suspect looks like a game by someone who knows what makes a good game but doesnt know how to put it into his game. I can imagine somebody can get into this game and actually like it but I was so bored after 2 hours playing it.			"

												Got this game for free when I purchased my video card. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a detective game set around the site of the former Salem Witch trials where you are a ghost stuck in limbo until the you can resolve everything in regards to your death (namely, identifying the killer). The story is moderately enjoyable, and the ending twist regarding your death genuinely surprised me. Didn't care for the time spent in between crime scenes, as things tended to drag, and the collectables are more of a hassle than anything. Since the story only lasts for 7-8 hours and the game doesn't have much replayability, I can not recommend buying at the $50 price. Look into playing once it hits a major sale on Steam.			"

												Right then, I just finished the game.Let me start by saying that I like playing detective and love trying to solve puzzles on my own. I don't even mind if the graphics are bad, as long as the gameplay works and the plotline keeps me interested.When the game started I thought it seemed alright. The whole ghost detective trying to solve his own murder wasn't a bad idea and had quite some potential. Woe is me now, having paid 40 euros for something that lasted for 17 hours, and only so long because I kept on exploring the extremely limited environments that seem to be a trademark of Squaresoft's games these days. The player is guided by both arms like a blind and handicapped elderly through the mediocre and predictable story. God forbid anyone who pays good money for the game should have to think for themselves.And it's not just that. The whole game was more like getting from one lengthy cutscene to another. The only times you can screw up or die is when ""battling"" demons, and by battling I, of course, mean pressing two keys that show up on the screen in the correct order when close to a demon. How exciting.There was really only one thing I enjoyed in this game, and that was the first time I got to possess a cat. The cat's animations were done nicely and it was a fun idea. But really - not worth 40 euros. Another thing that was ""ok"" was the lead male's voice acting. It was not great, but it didn't get on my nerves either.At some point you gain an ability that made me think I might be able to roam the map more freely, but again I was to be disappointed. Most times I didn't even need this new ability to reach any places that were meant to be reached.I won't be recommending this game for anyone with half a brain.			"

Question: is Murdered a good game? Not really. Is it bad? Not at all. It's the defitintion of ""average"".You play as Ronan, a badass detective who wears a black fedora and a stupid vest and still managed to get married, who's following a lead to stop ""the Bell"" serial killer, who enjoys murdering women in pretty babaric ways. But the protagonist ends up dying in the first minute of the game and becomes a ghost. But not even this undead form can stop him to unravel this mistery and stop this murder once and for all with the help of Joy, a psychic teenagers who's looking for her mom. Also, she's a total ♥♥♥♥♥, almost as boring as the main character.The gameplay takes a lot of inspiration from L.A. Noire: you have to inspect the area to find clues to answer questions about murders or misteries. Except it doesen't do that stupid sound every time you're close to a clue; I can actually say that it's a bit improved in comparison of the Rockstar game. You can pass through certain walls to access secret areas, and trust me, there's a lot of secrets (about 240 in total).So, the detective mechanic are pretty fun, but sadly, the devs though it was a good idea to add some kind of fighting system. Sometimes, random flying demons will appear, announcing themselvs with a ♥♥♥♥ing loud scream that will ♥♥♥♥ your ears every single time; how to fight them? Go on their back and click 2 buttons. It's just a time-waster mechanic, and could have easly been removed.The mistery itself in the game is pretty ok, but honestly, I figured out most of it during the middle of the game, while Mr. Spoopi Detective realized only at the end. THOSE MURDEREDS ARE CONNECTED? AND IT'S ABOUT WITCHES? IN THE CITY OF SALEM?! WHAT A COINCIDENCE! ..Yea, is pretty lacking story whise, and most of the characters are pretty obnoxious.Music is almost non existent in this game, so I can't really recommend anything from the soundtrack.Even tho this game is not that great, I can't help but recommend it. But why? Because at least is trying to do something different. Sure, it's borrowing a lot of mechanic and ideas from other games, but at least it's really trying to bring something that is not a classic story ""kill the bad guys and win the lady"". Sure, you might argue that it's kinda following that path, but it's the way they're getting there that at least is trying to be different.Final Score: 6/10I highly suggest to pick this game up during a sale, or if you have the chance, get it for cheap at humblebundle.com "

												Part 1.A 3D'fied, hidden object game that has you enduring puzzle assembly and clue finding of intelligence insulting proportions, spanned across a story to solve your own murder as you play a good samaritan ghost, packaged in a hand holding and linear gameplay fashion.Part 2.Endless backtracking, undeveloped and dreary characters, numerous side stories which detract from the main investigation, game bugs requiring a reload from last checkpoint and an ending which this game is not saved by.  However, demon chases which occur sparingly and are condensed towards the end are exhilarating.			"

												I don't know why this game got so many bad reviews on some websites. The story is exciting until the end and it makes you think about your own murder the whole time.The controls are easy, sound were really good, graphics are ok. The atmosphere in the game fits good in the story.The ""fight"" scenes could be better, for me it was just to easy to escape or fight the enemies. Maybe it would better if it would be harder or just don't happen.Ending this game took me 8+ hours with sidequests, maybe not so long but the story is really well done.I would recommend it if you like story based games, were you need to think and be surprised.I think Airtight Games & Square Enix did a really good job!Rate: 8/10			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect - Spoiler Free ReviewFirst off, I'd like to point out that I like both pulp noir and ghost stories both of which are heavy influences on the general feel of this game.  If you do not like either the cinematography stylings of pulp noir (in which case, you won't like the cut-scenes and may dislike the characters on occassion) or think ghost stories are dull, then this is not the game for you.  For those of you still with me and looking at potentially buying this game a bit of background is in order.  The studio that released M:SS closed down despite really ploughing everything into this game.  Part of it is odd in places, which I'll get to, but mostly they'd been struggling for a while due to releasing a couple of games which were bombs a while back.  Any future updates to the game will have to be community driven but that at least is one piece of good news - after multiple playthroughs I only came across one minor glitch, once, and it was a graphical one that I couldn't replicate.  The game runs really well so future patching should not be necessary.So, where to start?  How about the story.  It's pretty standard fair, almost straight out of a ""Randall & Hopkirk: Deceased"" episode.  You're a detective in Salem when a call is put in about a strange hooded man breaking into an apartment building.  As you are an emotional loose cannon after your wifes' death (it's actually nice to play a character who's irrational behaviour gets some explanation for once) you chase after him alone only to find that he's too strong for you, the eventual fight resulting in your death.  Your purpose is to stop the killer from beyond the grave so that your spirit can move on and be reunited with your wife.  This opening is actually really impressive as it's almost entirely done using the in-game engine and graphically looks superb, the sweeping camera shots and the slow-motion work really well giving a strong movie quality feel but rather than just have you as a passenger watching the opening the developer makes you take part in it, trying to first catch the killer and even trying to survive the attack.  The sound is excellent too and is nicely understated, something that carries throughout the whole game.After this you're left, dead, in Salem trying to figure out how you can stop this killer.  There's a tutorial which covers the controls and then you're given objectives to complete but you are left to wander through reasonably large parts of Salem without being stopped.  As you're dead you come across other spirits and left over memories of Salem in it's past, which just helps to make the world more interesting and full and the contrast in design is really well realised, especially when it ties in with the sidequests and main stories.  The more you progress the more of Salem opens up to you, allowing you to find out more about Salems past and revisit areas you have already explored.  The team have been as historically accurate as possible, considering that the game is a work of fiction, and you'll get to pick up on a real flavour of Salems darker past as you wander town.Character design suits the mood of the town too and there are characters in period dress in certain areas, although they are very few and far between, I'd have liked to have seen more of them.  They are reasonably realistic to look at - not ultra-real - which would feel out of place in a ghost story, but real anyway with very good motion capture and facial expressions especially on the main ones.  One that stood out to me is a point where a character manages to pretty much lie with just their face for a split second near the end, you'll know it when you see it, but the technology is well utilised without being overdone, it does not take you out of the story or gameplay very much if ever.As a ghost you get to travel through walls but presumably due to hardware limitations this pretty much is only really used within enclosed spaces, though this is explained within the game-worlds mythos itself well enough and it can be quite good fun.  These sections really can make you feel like a running, screaming spirit.  I felt less like a spirit and more like I was going to have a seizure due to swoosh noise everytime you select a conversation topic.  It's fine in short conversations but they can be long and a little grating if you want to find out everything.There's some disturbing bits in this game too.  Some pretty nasty deaths of young women, some ghosts have some surprisingly harrowing and well-acted lines, almost mini-stories, of their own if you come across them and there are collectables that unlock urban legends, a couple of which are genuinely quite creepy.  There are places with a lot of extra details added in which build up a wonderful sense of dread and oppression too, a lot of which can easily be missed and overlooked as it is just there for scene-setting.  Controls are pretty tight, the camera is good but can be a bit awkward when you are possessing something or trying to get through a wall slowly.  But there are two elephants in the room and these are what most reviewers scored the game so harshly on.1) Pointless Sort-of Forced Combat/Stealth Sections.You do combat, you either have to go for it whole-heartedly or just don't do it.  In for a penny, in for a pound!  M:SS feels like it's dipping it's fingers into the collection bowl and wondering if it can get away with giving a two Christmas old chocolate coin.  You get an enforced stealth section, taking you out of the more interesting portion of the game which feels jarring, so you can try to sneak past these demon-monsters which look like the Nozghul if they'd been drinking sheep-dip.  It hardly ever works so you have to try to stealth kill them, which is only a temporary fix.  2) Escort MissionThe escort is at least useful but these are really badly designed - it barely matters if you get spotted because the spotter sub-routine is so badly programmed.Both of these things feel tacked on and out of place.  I have a sneaking suspicion that they received orders from their publisher that if they wanted a Triple A advertising budget then it had to have those things in it because they feel completely at odds with the rest of the game.  And yes, I will be doing a video rant I am that annoyed about it.Mercifully, there's only a handful of those sections and apart from that and one point with a truly stupid portrayal of mental illness (completely different to an earlier scene with a ghost in a bath), the rest of the game is pretty much excellent.  If you can stick out those few parts you will find a good to look at, engaging murder mystery, with an excellent twist and interesting backdrop and characters.I recommend it, but have to dock it marks for 1) & 2)        Total Score:  7.5/10  Well above average and definitely worth a play if you want a murder mystery that's a little different or a slowly paced adventure game.

												Part 1.A 3D'fied, hidden object game that has you enduring puzzle assembly and clue finding of intelligence insulting proportions, spanned across a story to solve your own murder as you play a good samaritan ghost, packaged in a hand holding and linear gameplay fashion.Part 2.Endless backtracking, undeveloped and dreary characters, numerous side stories which detract from the main investigation, game bugs requiring a reload from last checkpoint and an ending which this game is not saved by.  However, demon chases which occur sparingly and are condensed towards the end are exhilarating.			"

												The game is really really good so why im disliking it ? The answer is simple. After the last stage of the game you cant get back to all places you just cant leave last place ( no spojlerino) and in this case i cant get all achievement's in one play. So i have to play this  game again and waste time to find all items ( got like 200 of 220 or something so you can feel my pain --' ) ANYWAY the GAME IS VERY VERY GOOD graphic's    8/10 Music         7/10 gameplay   9/10 Effects        8/10Buy this game but not for full price its not worth it its too short.

												I was genuinely surprised by this game. I had my doubts when the hype around this game began to wane when it got closer to launch. Glad I was mistaken.The story starts with a bang and keeps you interested with a plethora of sidequests and lore. There's a lot to find in Salem, as there are over 200 pieces of different collectibles you can, uhm, collect. Bits of info about the town, witch trials and the characters themselves. All of them well written.Graphically the game looks good, but then again I'm really not that into graphics when I play. Voice acting is quite nice, though the budget seems to limit the amount of voice actors on NPC:s, as you tend to hear the same dialog often. But at least you don't hear Nolan North arguing with Nolan North (looking at you, Mafia 2).Story is great, in my opinion, and the ending was good. No cliffhangers or anything, everything is resolved.The gameplay is okay, although the ""stealth combat"" seems a bit out of place. It's only padding, really, they should have let that on the cutting room floor. The UI is very console-like, with rather odd button bindings. Nothing major, though. I played this with keyboard & mouse with no problems.All in all, it's a good game, definitely better than its metacritic score. Sure it's not a masterpiece by any means, but it sure has a spot on my underrated gems -list.			"

												I liked the game, good graphic, nice soundtrack and immersive storyline (so far). I guess the only problem I found with the game was the lack of depth in gameplay (e.g. lack of difficulty settings, engaging combat systems and side quests). However that said, I really dig the story and aesthetic of the game as well as the classic who done it vibe. I reccomend this game for people who are looking for a interactive movie experience with a solid plot and expectionally good voice acting (IMO). I'd give this game 7.8 out of 10, because whilst the fundamentals of the game perform well, the lack of gameplay depth and overall quantity can take the shine off what is a generally wonderful experience.

												This game I feel appeals to people who enjoy story rich games. The gameplay is satisfying but nowhere near as enjoyable as that of LA Noire. Though it draws many comparisons to it I would say a gameplay format such as The Walking Dead would have done this game justice. The low score doesnt reflect the well written and intriguing story which this game relies on, but rather the repetitive and simple gameplay. Going into this game with the right expectations I feel you will definitely enjoy it. The concept is good just needs some difficulty improvements and the next installment in this series, in the hope there will be one, could easily become a popular franchise. Supplying 8 hours of gameplay, with some side missions which are just as enjoyable as the main storyline, I feel this is a game which all should experience assuming you are someone who just enjoys a good story.

However ticking off cats isn't my cup of tea.)-There's combat that doesn't add anything to the story or game, it's just annoying.-The constant ""find every tiny clue"" is hard to do; if you mess up, you basically can't go back. (Some clues are only found by being a terrible person, so don't worry if you mess with people to finish the game.) Although I didn't find even close to everything and maybe that fixes all of my problems with the game (I doubt it though.)Honestly if you want a mystery with corpses and plot, I'd recommend The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.

												I need to point out a bias, and that's that I love games that dare to be different. I have no heavenly idea whether it's the optimism or the bias itself speaking, but I really like this game! I'm sure you know what the game is about, you're an ex-""bad boy"" who wanted to change your life, so you became a cop. Now, during an investigation, you got shot by a mysterious man who seems anything BUT normal. You now need to solve this wicked mystery of who that man is, to get your redemption. Don't worry, you won't get to hold a gun, exactly, so it's not your ""average COD-clone"".My personal opinion of the beginning- and middle parts of the story is that they were good.  The ending was the most disappointing part of the game, however. Extremely cheap and weak way to end the game.. and even if it was ""cheap and weak"", it left you with a whole lot of questions afterwards. I won't spoil anything But story was overall quite good.The world in itself, that you walk around in, is fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic! It is soooo cozy to walk around in a very Italian-like village during the night! But there's a huge flaw.. hugeeee flaw. The voice of the main character is painfully bad. He tries to do something Batman-like and deepen his voice way too low that it ruins everything. I don't know how to demonstrate this exactly, but when I was playing and heard him talk, my stomach hurt.. that's how bad this situation is!Other characters are somewhat lovable, and their animations & voice acting are all well done. HOWEVER, despite this game being ""open-world"" the elements that show this are abscent. There are missions you can do when roaming around such as helping a ghost solving their deaths, but I've only found three or four. Pathetic! And the collectibles aren't even worth thinking about. It does get quite scary at times as well, however, for you horror-lovers. I definitely recommend this game, in the end, though!7,5/10			"

												You play as the ghost of Ronan O'Connor as he investigates his murder and attempts to find the identity of the serial ""Bell Killer.""  There are several investigations you must perform through the game, plus a number of optional side cases where you can help other ghosts resolve whatever issues are keeping them in the world.  The story is really interesting, especially when you discover the identity of the serial killer, but the game is just okay.Finding clues to solve the investigations is kind of difficult.  There is only a narrow margin in the view angle that will allow you to actually examine each clue, and there is nothing to indicate what can or can't be examined other than the ""Examine"" option that appears when you look directly at a clue.  Piecing together the clues to solve each case is not at all intuitive, and often doesn't even make sense.  The soundbite clues were my least favorite; the game plays a sound as the menu appears (and the menu has its own sound clip), then you have to choose which object in your sight makes the most sense for the sound you may have not even heard.  There is no way to make the sound replay.Thankfully, there is no punishment for selecting the wrong clues when solving a case.  Unfortunately, there's also no reward for perfectly solving a case.  After solving a case, the game tells you exactly where to go next, which makes for a very linear experience.  You do revisit a few locations, and you can sidetrack to perform optional cases or discover collectibles, but the game really holds your hand the whole way through.  This makes the game pretty easy to complete, but I didn't feel like it caused me to enjoy the game any less.The ghost powers are nothing more than arbitrary game mechanics that change for each situation depending on what the game needs to let you do in order to progress.  You have the ability to possess people and listen to their thoughts, which results in you hearing the same small selection of dialogues over and over.  Sometimes cases will make you possess a person and ""influence"" them to provide more clues.  You are prompted, ""What will make this person remember _______ event?"" and then you choose something from among the clues you've found thus far.  You also have the ability to teleport a short distance, interact with electronics as a poltergeist (which only draws peoples' attention when the game needs it to), and reveal ghost objects of events from the distant past (which doesn't ever seem to do anything useful except allow you to find optional collectibles).Each case only requires you to find a handful of available clues, so you need not collect all 362 pieces of evidence (189 of which are for the main story) if you aren't the completionist type.  Failure to collect all the clues will not affect the outcome of the game, so don't expect a Heavy Rain type of game where information you do or do not find affects future revelations.  However, collecting all of the clues does reveal a lot of information about the locations and characters, so you are actually rewarded for picking up the ridiculous amount of collectibles.Despite these flaws, I did enjoy the game.  It holds up as a solid detective game even if the clues and cases are somewhat arbitrary.  This is certainly not the best detective game I've played but it is far from being the worst.			"

												A first impression here. It's not bad as some of the review sites out there might want you to believe. It's and adventure game, think LA Noire without the action and driving. It's a slower paced game where you'll have to look around for clues to solve puzzles to move to the next area, so if you're looking for an action FPS or something like that, it probably won't be for you. It's a good looking game with better graphics than watchdogs that I picked up last week, and has alot of graphics settings to play with, runs smooth on ultra/high on my HD 7870, although the frames per second seem to be locked to 30. I'd give it a 7 out of ten, it is kind of pricey though for what it is, but would definitely reccomend it at say $25.			"

The clues you collect are useless if you have any sense and pick up the obvious one first then you progress without any of the menial.. pick that up.. investigate this (by looking at it) move forward, now you can move to the next area, where you will do it again, and again, and again.There was one, amazing, feature that made some of the montany worth it...YOU COULD POSESS A CAT.for all of 5 minutes then you were straight back into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Don't spend money on this.

												MURDERED isn't really a game. It's more of an interactive story/movie with movement, It has a very interesting premise, but in my opinion it failed to deliver on that punch which it desperately needed and strived for.For the ""gameplay"" mechanics, you basically find crime scenes, try to find and examine every object, then have infinite tries to choosing the correct ones that apply to move the story along. Sometimes this involves influencing people by possessing them, but that's only during scripted moments and does nothing useful when you possess the NPCs walking around the world. It's the same when you ""poltergeist"" an object (turn it on/mess it up for a few seconds). Lifeless NPCs will not react unless it's a scripted moment for the story.There are enemies in the game, demons, and you can walk behind them and try your hand at a randomized QTE where you'll have to press one button from WASD and use the left or right click to destroy the demon. If you fail, which you will due to the poor controls of this, then you'll have to jump into ghost fragments around the level to avoid getting your soul sucked until the demon gives up. This is all of the ""action"" in the story and it's more of a waste of time than anything. There is no boss fight or no real reason for destroying demons. Their AI is on a predetermined route and they're just an inconvenience for scouring a level for the collectible items.Each area has a different amount of collectibles. These unlock urban legend/ghost stories that are just a picture and a person monologuing. That's really it for the entire game's mechanics outside of possessing a cat and following a predetermined route with no real obstacles/puzzles. There's literally nothing interesting to do in this game beyond solving the main storyline with its pre-determined deductivity.  All in all, I can't recommend this as a game. If you're looking for the great supernatural mystery thriller of our time this is far from that. But if you're looking to chance it for a story that you may (or may not) enjoy and you're willing to overlook about 8 hours of lacking gameplay, this one on the cheap might fit that bill. Treat it more like an average-grade movie than a game.			"

												This game has garnered criticism for being short and a simplistic combat style.Yes it is short but I don't feel it needs to be any longer, they may have been able to extend the gametime if they had added more and longer side-quests rather than condensing them to a small investigation area but I do think that this would require a larger map and a means of fast transport and you're not exactly gonna have the main character (a ghost called Ronan) drive around in a ghost car, are you?No, I think the formula this game has landed on is right for this game.As for the combat, (some basic stealth against actually rather scary demons), it doesn't NEED to be complex as this is not that sort of game.Are Telltale games critisized for the combat, no, they win game of the years awards, bottom line is they are story driven and so is this, if you can get it on sale definitely get it and if not probably still get it, it has a very good story and ending.

Seriously, trying to turn a knob and then trying to lay back down are not engaging gameplay. Story seems like it has potential if you can stomach everything else about this ""game.""			"

												Murdered Soul Suspect is the last game made by Airtight games, Did the go out with a bang ? In Murdered Soul Suspect you play as Ronan o connor. Salem is haunted by a serial killer named the Bell killer. One day Ronan Finds the trail of the bell killer but gets killed in the process. Ronan returns as a ghost but hes unable to move on until he finds out who killed him. In the proccess he meets Jane who the killer is trying to hunt down. So its youre job to protect her from the killer while trying to find out who killed you. So how is Murdered ? Its actually a great game. The best way i could put it would be a supernatural LA Noire. The game is essiantly you interogating ghosts and people who can see you know as mediums. The game lets you posses people and cats. Mess with electronics and stuff like that. Theres also fighting segments where you have to fight ghost while trying to aproach them from the back. But if they see you you will have to hide because you cant fight them head on. So now for the pros and cons. The game has a great story and a great twist ending. The game is fun and simple. Great puzzles to solve and tons of collectibles to collect. The cons: the game is kinda glitchy and its also really short. Overall Murdered Soul Suspect is a great game and i suggest you buy it because simply put it its a great game and Airtight Games will be missed. I give Murdered Soul Suspect a 8/10			"

												Would have been okay if it came out 10 years ago. Key word being ""okay"".Average to bad story, bad acting, not as cheesy as it should have been (big missed opportunity there), and lots of 'collect all the ♥♥♥♥' which is usually my jam, but even that feels messy and arbitrary.Speaking of 10 years ago, I would recommend something like Fahrenheit instead, which still blows this out of the water.On the other hand, if you want to play a $50 game that really takes ZERO brain cells to process, both in story and gameplay, this is the game for you my friend!update: Finished the game (which thankfully speeds up in pace at the end, but still doesn't get an upgrade to recommended from me), and saw that the credits feature a Japanese dev team! This actually explains a lot. It really feels like a eastern interpretation of a western crime story - they pick up every cliche and trope, the cheesiest characters, but approach it completely straight faced. No irony, no self awareness. I wish they'd felt more free to inject more of their own personality.Now it sits in no-mans land, the equivalent of a western attempt at an anime or a JRPG.			"

												MURDERED has a cool concept and plot: You have been murdered and trying to solve your own murder as a ghost. What is not cool, however, is how repetitive and confusing this game can get.The game is a glorified movie with a few cuts of brain-dead gameplay here or there. Your objective will tell you to go to a location. Then you will use to stealth to kill some demons, then you will pickup all the clues to solve a few ""questions"" which lead you to another location. Rinse and repeat a few times.The crux of the game should be solving hard puzzles, but most puzzles are just wandering around a small room and mashing 'E' on everything to 'reveal' it. Then you have unlimited tries to put the 'clues' together (there is NO penalty for guessing wrong, not even a special perfect ending). Additionally, the demon fighting game play is ridiculously easy. I realized half-way through that you could actually run past every demon without fighting them. In other words, there is no challenge.One final thing I didn't like: No mini-map in-game. It turns out you only could get a mini-map if you PREORDERED the game (for something so core you would think it would just come with the game). If you are a completionist this makes collecting everything a living hell. Every wall in the town looks the same. And some collectibles don't appear unless you go along all the walls and mash a button (in other words, this is near-impossible without a guide).			"

												So clearly not recommending this game, this Review is being written in 2016 and should be noted as such, if your thinking of buying this game just go for something else.This game is basically a detective story in 3rd person where you hunt for clues to piece together the bell killer murders and find out who the murderer is.The main part of the ""game"" part of this game, is annoying little demon sections where you have to go up behind a demon and exorcise them, these have really crappy AI and mostly just detract from the story (the main reason to play this kind of game), looking a little too low? these demons won't register, will turn around and notice you, and you will have to hide from them till they get bored and go back to doing their rounds, and this element just feels added for the sake of actual gameplay (even though the story does technically cover it, it's a really loose connection.As for the Actual main story, while part of it is obvious, the true answer is basically a massive cop out, and as this is spoiler free i won't actually be able to say why, but once you have played this game, you will be dissapointed by the ending.Other then this, it's basically a fetch quest where you look for clues and work out which few are actually even relevant (each section requires no more then 4 clues to do any one part, and you can then move on) and it mostly just becomes find the relevant spot and look at it.I finished this game in about 6 Hours (although steam doesn't seemed to have registered my play time properly) and was rather disappointed, i'm glad i bought this through a humble bundle, as i didn't end up paying the $20 price tag, which realistically is asking a bit much for something like this.Without all the filler stuff this could easily be a 2 hour game but you spend most of your time walking around and playing hide and seek with demons.

												This review will be in separate parts when ever I want to complain about the game. But every bit of this review is constructive criticism.First three areas explored in:I am already offended by this game for its lack of social construction. This game's dialogue seems to have bits and pieces of an idea together but are poorly sewn together. If you are a private investigator or an FBI profiler you will be saddened by this game. For the dialogue choices seem to route you to the same answer, but are shallow in complete thought. I get the idea behind this game being the main story line but my problem with this game so far is not your maneuverability, or lack of direction. But more or so to the approach this game takes when it comes to solving the cases. It seems like the person who created this plot forgot that detectives constantly talk to themselves while piecing together a story. Though to be fair it says in the text right there what it wants you to do. But it should be stated by the detective to help people figure out what is going on. The text floating around as you try to piece things together will throw you off guard as soon as a change of course happens within the solving of each small puzzle.While trying to figure out one thing it suddenly switches... but our friend the detective doesn't say much and it quickly moves on to the next thing. So you miss what the text changed to, telling you what you are supposed to look for now, at that very split second given moment and you guess wrong. Worst of all is the clunky UI. You mess something up it freezes you... pauses.... backs out.... brings up several different separate tab screens for each object which suddenly takes away the purpose for searching it, (which is why I say again it would help if the detective was constantly talking to himself in thought to keep the main point in focus.) And quite frankly leaves me bewildered at what happens when you ""try again.""Maybe the approach to this method should have used better sorting options.... Throwing things around all the time makes me think this detective never carried around so much as a book. Possibly carried around a recording device seeing how disorderly everything being displayed becomes.Just imagine that every time you came up with the idea behind a string of events you got angered, and suddenly threw up all the information you just looked at in frustration... only to come right back to it, to string everything together again, as all the papers fall to the ground and you have this game. I think the creator... if he is or was a detective... must have had little to no patience himself in each case. Possibly due to extra ordinary means like time or money allotted to his investigations. Maybe a sergeant or person's interest was a timely manner. I am still willing to give this a second try but it is so demanding on your eyes, more or so than your brain, that it causes you to lose concentration quite easily.And the demons? My goodness. Talk about an annoying trap puzzle that springs up like a jack in the box that malfunctions a lot. I get the idea behind exorcising ghosts... but uh.... how does our detective friend just suddenly know how to exorcise a ghost exactly? Was our friend the detective a priest? There is no mention of him being one in his own background... But just barely minutes into the game, you have the ability to exorcise a ghost without having to read any books about it. I think this game would have been a lot more interesting with the setup it seemed to hold. In which I think the Detective originally did not know how to exorcise ghosts until later in the game. But I guess the devs thought it would be too annoying to make players fear them so early. Yet it would have been a lot more fun and made more sense if the ability wasn't there until you figured it out.This game seems to be targeted at kids more or so than adults seeing how there are some ""way too soft"" spots that spring up like a bad smell. You will literally yell at our detective to ""JUST GRAB HER F***ING ARM!"" When it comes to solving one of the cases. I want to slap the detective for being so.... retentively sympathetic, yet wise cracking at certain times.Also the girl? Best idea ever when it comes to surprising your audience when you finally meet her for the first time. But there was one inconsistency that happened at the cemetery... She complained about not being able to see him... even though she was holding a flashlight... Then a few minutes later she has no trouble seeing them. Could have been the lamp post nearby but uh.... She did shine a flashlight on him.Last three bits:Am I ever more disappointed in a game? This game answered that question. Incredibly short game. I am sad. I am so sad after completing this game.The best puzzle is the ending.I think the issue is that the development team behind this had an astonishingly awesome idea.... but I think budget cuts really let this game down. This game had some real potential but it is so short lived. The ending seems to be pasted together. But at least it did create one hell of a mind ♥♥♥♥. It is just too bad the whole time you believe one thing because of your own abilities... and then there is another. What the hell.Too short. Way too short. My final complaint? Some of the ""side missions"" are broken.This game should be twitch viewed only.			"

												If somebody asked me to describe Murdered: Soul Suspect in one word, I would say: Unfinished.It's evident from the start that this game was rushed out the door too early in order to meet a deadline. Many things that you'd expect from a modern, full-priced AAA game are not present here. I knew something was up even before I jumped into the actual game. The menu was just a static image. There were no flashy effects when you highlighted any of the options. No bells and whistles whatsoever. Of course, none of that is actually necessary, but it is odd to see a big-budget game cut corners like that.Unfortunately, this was just the tip of the iceberg.After the game's opening cutscene, you're immediately tasked with investigating a crime scene. Games like Ace Attorney and L.A. Noire have already demonstrated excellent examples of how to simulate actual detective work, so it's pretty baffling to me that Murdered: Soul Suspect would take the most basic, and un-intuitive route possible. You point. You click. You win.There's almost zero deductive reasoning involved in investigating these crime scenes. Gathering evidence presents no challenge, since the ""clues"" are ridiculously easy to spot in the environment. It's depressing that the biggest problem I ran into when solving the mystery behind these crime scenes was my tendency to overthink them. Turns out, the most obvious solution is ALWAYS the right one. Once you figure that out, the rest of the game is a cakewalk. So what else is there? Well, your ghostly character can possess people. This is a great idea on paper, but your enthusiasm will quickly wane once you realize that you can't actually control your posessee's. However, you can read their minds. Better than nothing, I suppose, but you'll be in for a rude awakening once you find that NPCs in the town only have a handful of phrases to recite, none of which are actually relevant to the investigation at hand. What could've been an excellent and inventive way to acquire information about the details of your case is squandered by the complete ineptitude of the developers. Soul Suspect isn't entirely without merit though. The story held my attention for the duration of the game, and even though the characters are archetypes that we've already seen before from the detective/mystery genre, it still managed to be a moderately intriguing tale. The pay-off is also decent, with a twist ending that even M. Night Shyamalan would be proud of.What saddens me the most is that Murdered: Soul Suspect is a very solid idea, and it could've easily been a great game with a little more TLC. It's painful to see a game with this much wasted potential. I liked the ideas here, but the execution left a lot to be desired. I'd love to see a sequel to this game where these ideas are more expanded upon, but as it stands, Murdered: Soul Suspect is half-baked, and it shows. "

												A lot of the games that I rate ""thumbs down"" are just mediocre and still have redeeming qualities. This game, on the other hand, is literally the worst game I've ever played. Took me just over 5 hours to finish it and it overstayed its welcome.The story is actually OK - not great, but a decent B-horror-movie tale. It does have a pretty good red herring followed by a nice twist at the end. However, one aspect of the villain's identity is very clearly telegraphed. The plot is pretty simple - you're a homicide detected who is killed by the serial killer you're hunting. Now relegated to ghost form, you try to track down the killer.The gameplay, however, is abysmally weak. Gameplay has two phases - investigations and stealth. Investigations involve peeking into people's minds and observing supernatural objects. Stealth involves avoiding demons and helping your (live) AI companion sneak into locations by creating distractions. The basic problem with both is that they are essentially hidden object games - all you need to do to progress is to find the correct button to press. The game never gets any more complicated than this. There are a few sections where you have to do things with correct timing, but they're very easy. In reality, you spend the entire game walking around and clicking on things. Occasionally, you will be asked to identify the ""relevant"" clues out of a crime scene with numerous clues scattered about. If you pick incorrectly, you're just told you were wrong and given the chance to try again. So that means that your ""investigations"" can be beaten by simply picking clues at random until you get them right. That means this so-called ""mystery"" game has no actual mystery to it. What's the fun in a detective game where you aren't allowed to be misled? Calling this a mystery game at all is misleading - it's a glorified walking simulator. You couldn't possibly make a mistake. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter has far more actual mystery than this.The game is so brainless and holds your hand so much that at times I felt like I was playing one of the simple educational games you find on Steam, like ""The Deer."" It's dumbed-down to the point of utter boredom, start to finish.Technically, I guess it's fine, runs fine and looks decent for a last-gen console title. Controls are OK with both M+KB and with controller, which is to be expected when the game has such a limited amount of interaction.The only reason I played this to completion was because I didn't want to feel like I wasted my money. That makes me a sucker. Don't be a sucker like me. Avoid this game. "

Really, there was the making of a great game here, they just needed to write it better. I suppose the main reason I am giving it a 'no' is because of how bad this game is in comparison to the game it could've been, rather than judging the game on its own merits.

												Solid story line with cinematic scenes, along with multiple side stories with their own stories.However, the game has little to no replay value as it is extremely linear.  You are not allowed to investigate as you see fit, but rather as it fits their predetermined path.Game completion with nearly all sub clues collected in 10.4 hours of playtime.I give the game a 4 out of 10			"

												I've had this game in my library for like 3 years now and I haven't bothered to even install it once. Recently I figured that I would play it because I had nothing else better to do and I had seen a few short gameplay videos. It's a game by Square Enix, one of my favourite publishers and it's got moderately good graphics so I'm able to play it Ultra and in 4K resolution.Firstly the premise seems cool enough, but also pretty simple. You play a detective who's been killed and you have to find out who killed you. No problem there, as I always like a good 'whodunnit' story.The problem is everything else except the story.CONTROLS - The controls are so annoying to use. I had to turn the sensitivity down so low to avoid the camera spinning around like a tornado. You also walk so slowly, and are forced to constantly hold run 100% of the time if you even want to get anywhere within a reasonable timeframe; having to always hold shift also made my pinky get sore fast. All of these things make the game quickly feel very cumbersome to play and my patience really started to wear thin...GAMEPLAY - There's no 'crosshair' but you have to perfectly directly face an object so it is in the middle of your screen in order to interact with it. Due to being a ghost, you can walk through many solid looking objects which is cool until you realise that there is also no kind of map in the game at all. Paths are constantly 'hidden' bethind objects that you have to walk through, and it's very hard to remember where something is. If you missed something way back at the start of the area, you can go back provided you can find your way through the confusing and very narrow/linear path from one area to another. The game is also filled with pointless empty alleyways and dead-ends that I really could not understand at all why the developers didn't bother to make any sort of map. It would have made navigation so much easier. Finding clues and collectables in Murdered: Soul Suspect is a huge part of the game, but sadly it's very hard to spot some mission related clues do to the objects being absolutely tiny, and/or partially hidden.ENEMIES - There aren't really any except for these 'demons' that lurk around some areas of the game, and 'traps' that just force you to find a way around them. Demons are more of an annoyance than a challenge. Simply hide behind a wall or in a 'safe zone' until they come close enough, then when their back is turned press the right combination to kill them. The combinations are a total pain as you have to keep holding the 'R' button AND then press 2 other buttons at the same time which are often very close to the 'R' button. Getting it wrong means wasting a few minutes whilst the Demon chases you or looks for you. They're incredibly easy to kill as you can spot them through walls and there's often plenty of places to hide. Honestly I found them a pointless addition to the game and just something obviously added to try and increase the overall length of a playthrough.STORY - The story is good enough I guess. Some of the side missions seem stupid and some of the murder/death mysteries are quite boring really. I found it kind of hard to care about a few of the NPCs but at the same time I guess a couple of them were interesting enough. The main story seems interesting enough so far and so long as it's about the same length as 'The Wolf Among Us' I will be pretty happy. I still prefer TWAU's gameplay and smoothness to this game's by far.GRAPHICS - Not much bad to say here as graphics are pretty top notch. The game looks really nice in 4K, although I found that some of the floating papers got a bit distracting as I often mistook them for clues that I could interact with. Also the game is capped at 30FPS if you enable Vertical Sync which made it feel really, really choppy for me. A huge part of the game are also pre-rendered cutscenes which are also all capped to 30fps. So if you end up playing in 60+ FPS normally and then move to a cutscene you can end up getting eye fatigure and a general nagging feeling as the game changes framerates constantly. Finally I thought that it was kind of annoying that a lot of the NPCs don't have proper lip movements when they are speaking. This is something that Square Enix usually does really well, but in this game a lot of NPCs just stand there going through their limited behaviour animations with their mouths closed but they are still speaking.ABILITIES - These are actually pretty boring and feel really lackluster. The first ability you get is to be able to possess people in order to read their minds or try and jog a memory that helps uncover part of the story. Murdered: Soul Suspect has a lot of NPCs in some areas, and using the mind-reading ability shows really how little thought was put into the game. ALL NPCs only have TWO possible dialogues that can be uncovered through reading their minds. Specific NPCs have specific and more 'unique' dialogues however NPCs that do nothing except to just 'populate' the game world almost always all have the same ""I don't feel safe here"" etc. responses. It's really boring. As for the other features like Reveal, this is just used to uncover small side stories and Teleport is only used to get into 'consecrated' areas that would normally be off-limits.There's not much else to talk about but all in all I wouldn't recommend the game. The graphics are good and the story is interesting enough but the game quickly becomes a total pain to play. My fingers get sore, my patience runs thin and even the uniqueness of the game and the lingering mystery to uncover doesn't hold my attention for more than a few short hours at a time. More than anything I can't help but feel that a few changes or extra small additions to the game would have yielded a much smoother experience. Things such as a small map, faster walking and running, and increased amount of dialogue in the game would have added a lot of value.			"

												I was actually enjoying this game until I encountered a game-breaking glitch near the end of Chapter 2. What I assume I was supposed to do was use my poltergeist ability on the vacuum to get the priest to walk over the vortex thingy on the floor so I could possess him and safely cross to the other side of the hallway.As it turns out, the priest decided to be a bishop, in the sense that he only moved diagonally. He crossed over and clipped into the wall opposite the vacuum cleaner, and when I possessed him he moved diagonally across the vortex, clipped into another wall, and walked in a courtyard where I could not unpossess him.I tried restarting the checkpoint. I tried letting the priest make a single trip and then using poltergeist on the vacuum a second time before possessing him. I tried starting the game over from the beginning. I tried reinstalling the game. I even tried starting the game from the beginning AFTER reinstalling, but nothing worked.So I checked Google for answers, but couldn't find any solutions. That's when I gave up. Even if there is a solution, I refuse to sit through the same unskippable cutscenes for a fourth time in the hopes that maybe I'll be able to get past the second chapter.If you're thinking of buying this game, don't. There's an old flash game on Newgrounds called ""The Dead Case"", which is similar yet vastly superior despite being from 2004. Not only is it free, but it actually functions like it's supposed to.

												A fantastic idea yes. Does this make a fantastic game? nope. Not even close. How the managed to make something as awesom as this boring is beyond me. Giving us awesome ghost powers then limiting them. All the enemies are slowly moving around and easily destroyed with some boring steath sections. There is alot of emty areas so i guess the game was hurried to the shelf. Now the game only feels like slow transportation between rather dull story scenes. And after sitting through this borefeast, they even put up an unskippable text wall at the end. Jolly good times.			"

												Pros:- Nice environment and atmosphereCons:- Very short. Feels like a DLC of a bigger game that wasn't released yet.- Closed map, not much to do besides the actual main missions.- Only one kind of enemy, the demons, and that's it.- Repetitive gameplay, you do the same stuff over and over again.- This cannot be compared to other investigative games, like L.A. Noir. It's not that good. We have a game with lots of potential, but it feels like the writers got lazy and ended it very quickly.I do not recommend this game at full price. Buy it, with caution, on steam sale.  "

												I am a casual female gamer, not great with button mashing. I really love rich story lines, rpg styled play, and puzzles! This game included all of that. If you're casual like me, it's a great point and click that isn't boring. Too often I find the point and clicks are slow paced, but this isn't. Most of the game is really innate. You know what your goals are and what you have to do. I rarely needed to look something up, so that's a plus for the casual gamer. The storyline is reallllly cool, the characters, the voice acting, all of it. My only negative is I didn't clue in to just how open the world was. You can explore a lot and do side quests and I missed a lot of them because I was only following the storyline. Newb mistake for sure, so be sure you do all the fun stuff on the side to get all the achievements. Graphics and controls were great.			"

												Awesome game. Reminded me of both ""Fahrenheit"" and the movie ""Ghost"". I see a lot of idiots misread the genre and poured out their virginity in a form of a negative bs, learn to read, ffs. It's action adventure!There are no puzzles in traditional point-and-click sense. It's mostly about gathering stuff and making some obvious choices.Nice graphics, not top of the line but very nice.Had no issues with controls whatsoever. It is THE MOST standard keyboard layout for modern games (for a right handed people that is).The plot has a few holes in it but otherwise is pretty solid and engaging with a twist at the end.And not a single bug through the whole game. That's a rarity these days.So I just have no idea what those kids with their negative reviews are whining about.The game is good and it's well worth the price.			"

												This is my first review, so I'll try to keep it simple.This game is aggressively mediocre. For a puzzle game, the puzzles are never very engaging, but then again, not a lot of puzzles can be done if the main character can't touch things. Every brain teaser is either 'pick the obvious clue' or 'pick the obvious series of clues'. Sometimes you have to do them in the right order, wow.The combat/stealth is practically non-existant. Occasionally demons will jump out accompanied with the sound a piano might make if it were thrown through a window. It shocked me the first time it happened, then never again. You disable them by running up behind them and doing a simple qte. This is made incredibly easy since they cannot see through walls. You, on the other hand, can both see and walk through walls. Dissapointing.Oh, and the many hiding spots in the overworld kept me constantly wondering if I might get jumped at one point. Never happened. Why even have them there?The story itself is okay, but it suffers from the protagonist having never even heard of withces before, and he's lived all his damn life in Salem, of all places. Sometimes there are no excuses. And the ending, oh god, the ending was a major dissapointment. It lasted all of 5 minutes and most of that was cutscenes. That said, I really enjoyed all the interactions between characters. All the ghosts are kind of one note characters, but the humans were kind of special to me. The way they reacted to your death and subsecuent actions made them seem more real and alive then most other characters I can recall offhand. They all mourn and act in their own way and even though this is not a big game, I can't say that there are any living characters that I disliked.Ending... uh. Rent it, I guess? At least wait untill it goes down in price. A 10 hour game does not deserve a 40$ price tag. Definitely get it if you really, really like collecting stuff.			"

												I enjoyed the game, but I having completed the game in one sitting I can't recommend it straight up.If you enjoy point n clicks, this will be a wonderful title. It functions much like one and the only reason it wouldn't work in the point n click format is the Demons sequences, which functioned for me a a quick jumpscare (that noise they make on spawn..) and then to slow my progress moving around. Moving the plot along feels very linear and I didnt feel any real motivation to deviate from the main plot. The detective sequences were also very simple, I wasn't challanged by any of the puzzles throughout.Again, great for point n click fans! Not so much for anyone else though.			"

												Best Part: You possess a cat.Worst Part: Combat and QTE.I was really expecting this game to be good, and I tried to enjoy it. I recently finished it (6 hours with 77% of achievements unlocked) and I only recommend if you really want to play for the theme.Note: UI is terrible, play with a controller if you have one. Pressing 1/3 and Q/E to change tabs is a no-no and shows that it's a port.First off, you don't really do any detective work, I often got the answers to detective questions wrong because I was over thinking and in the end, I sometimes tried multiple times until I got it right.The town is simply dull, some NPCs keep walking in the same path, really killing the atmosphere, they also have only two lines of dialogue, which are boring. Since there's no map/minimap, there was one time that I got lost and had to keep running all over the place trying to find my way. The barriers they added to limit the scope of the game are horrible, making the game feel more linear than it should have.Also, the combat is simply terrible, you can see they added this part only to make the game lengthier because it's not fun at all. The QTE buttons keep changing, making you sometimes fail and get annoyed.			"

												Boring Ghost Simulator.Sure, your a ghost trying to solve his own murder, but most of the game, is solving other ghost's murders/deaths. Which is odd, as most of these other ghosts apparently have spent years unable to be put to rest knowing who killed them or why, despite the evidence litterally being a room over.The gameplay consists of clicking all the buttons you can on everything. There is no wrong choice, there is no alternative options. Whole game is purely linear. ""Combat"" consists of walking behind another ghost-thing and pressing a button, it feels like your playing the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle over and over again.			"

												This game was disappointing, to say the least.  It had a wicked premise and I loved the concept of blending old Salem with new.  But what should have been a challenging puzzle game was ruined by annoyingly repetitive quick time events that will one-shot you if you lose and easy puzzles.  The first couple of areas in the game were intriguing, but it seemed like the team put less and less effort into the game during the later levels.  One of the coolest gimmicks, possessing people, quickly became boring because NO ONE HAD ANYTHING INTERESTING TO SAY.  I really wanted to love this game.  I did.			"

												The graphics are beautiful, and the story seems interesting. Too bad the game has clearly been developed for a console, and so the game play is severely limited: you can't save the game freely, there's no map, and it's very easy to crap out side quests, because due to inadvertent advancements in the main plot you're incapable of getting back to the earlier game zone. This is really annoying, because due to the save/load limitation you can't go back.Another thing is the demons and traps in the game. Again, this seems to me more like an action console game, not a mystery adventure detective game.. Which might be OK with you, if you're into that sort of thing.			"

												MSS is pretty much a PNC adventure game masquerading as a modern cinematic AAA game (which I don't find any better, by the way).  While the game has merit for any adventure game fan, know that the story falls apart and I doubt anyone will be satisfied with it.  So with such a major hook of pnc games not really delivering, what are you left with?At its heart, MSS is your typical textbook modern game design, except the main character doesn't carry a gun and you don't run around shooting at pop-up targets.  Instead, you are tasked with investigating your own death, complete with spritely sidekick and canned TWEEST.  This in itself isn't bad as mysteries often need to have at least some sort of turning point and well, being dead kind of demands you have a real-world sidekick to help you out.However, being of modern game design, MSS falls into the trap of checklist design; that is to say, it takes no risks and does pretty much everything by the book.  Exploration?  Check.  Voice actors?  Check.  Cinematics?  Check.  Hidden objects?  Check.  Progessive ability unlocking?  Check, check, check.  None of this bad, really; just saying it brings nothing new to the table.  The worst offender is the checkbox for action - because why would anyone play a game without action in it, right?  Pfft.  From time to time you will be forced to deal with a completely useless and forced section where you sneak around bad guys and try to get rid of 'em (or circumvent them entirely once you're tired of this ♥♥♥♥) because someone in development land has decided that under no circumstance should a game of this type be without an action sequence; problem is, it's stupid and provides nothing to the game other than padding and, of course, a checkbox.  Similarly, you'll be tasked several times to arbitrarily click on multiple clues to proceed through the game and it gets old fast - at least it's thematically sound what with the main character being a detective.  Whatever.Anyways, as far as fans of PNC games goes, this one isn't that bad.  The game has a runtime of approximately 8 hours, maybe 6.5 if you don't bother looking for all the hidden stuff (which is also pointless, but allows you to do some checklisting yourself).  I wouldn't recommend getting this at full price in any shape or form, but if you get a decent deal on it, say... $10 just to cover some of the production value, then why not give it a run-through?  It's kind of like watching the latest sci-fi space opera film just because you don't often see them being made and not because it's actually really good.  MSS is just a decent effort.tl;dr: Adventure game fans may enjoy this game on theme alone, but anyone looking for a meaty game experience will find that this offering is leaner than that girl you used to know whose bones could be counted individually when she had her shirt off.  So this remains a (meh) thumbs-up for adventure game fans, but a thumbs-down for anyone else.			"

I just love on how her freckle sparked on her cheeks, her lips were bloom with her piercing, her eye shines as she speaks, lol, I just fell in love with in-game character.10/10			"

												Awesome game. Reminded me of both ""Fahrenheit"" and the movie ""Ghost"". I see a lot of idiots misread the genre and poured out their virginity in a form of a negative bs, learn to read, ffs. It's action adventure!There are no puzzles in traditional point-and-click sense. It's mostly about gathering stuff and making some obvious choices.Nice graphics, not top of the line but very nice.Had no issues with controls whatsoever. It is THE MOST standard keyboard layout for modern games (for a right handed people that is).The plot has a few holes in it but otherwise is pretty solid and engaging with a twist at the end.And not a single bug through the whole game. That's a rarity these days.So I just have no idea what those kids with their negative reviews are whining about.The game is good and it's well worth the price.			"

												I am a casual female gamer, not great with button mashing. I really love rich story lines, rpg styled play, and puzzles! This game included all of that. If you're casual like me, it's a great point and click that isn't boring. Too often I find the point and clicks are slow paced, but this isn't. Most of the game is really innate. You know what your goals are and what you have to do. I rarely needed to look something up, so that's a plus for the casual gamer. The storyline is reallllly cool, the characters, the voice acting, all of it. My only negative is I didn't clue in to just how open the world was. You can explore a lot and do side quests and I missed a lot of them because I was only following the storyline. Newb mistake for sure, so be sure you do all the fun stuff on the side to get all the achievements. Graphics and controls were great.			"

												Not a bad game... Thought I feel like this could have been a much superior experience with a little more effort... The core concepts definitely work, and the interaction between a living character and a ghost make for interesting gameplay situations... The game's key failing is in its actual interaction during investigations - you essentially look at things, and click on them, with very occasional sections where you select the most likely explanation of a given situation. This is woefully inadequate for a game that is supposedly about solving the mystery of your own death. I'd confidently state that this is pretty much a zero-difficulty game with no significant challenge except that of avoiding the irritating demons.The game has decent voice acting, yet some pretty ropey cutscenes, interesting ideas and systems, but inadequate use of them, a dreadful cut & paste soundtrack, but reasonable sound design. It could have been better, but that said, this game is still worth your time, so long as you don't buy it full price.			"

												MSS is pretty much a PNC adventure game masquerading as a modern cinematic AAA game (which I don't find any better, by the way).  While the game has merit for any adventure game fan, know that the story falls apart and I doubt anyone will be satisfied with it.  So with such a major hook of pnc games not really delivering, what are you left with?At its heart, MSS is your typical textbook modern game design, except the main character doesn't carry a gun and you don't run around shooting at pop-up targets.  Instead, you are tasked with investigating your own death, complete with spritely sidekick and canned TWEEST.  This in itself isn't bad as mysteries often need to have at least some sort of turning point and well, being dead kind of demands you have a real-world sidekick to help you out.However, being of modern game design, MSS falls into the trap of checklist design; that is to say, it takes no risks and does pretty much everything by the book.  Exploration?  Check.  Voice actors?  Check.  Cinematics?  Check.  Hidden objects?  Check.  Progessive ability unlocking?  Check, check, check.  None of this bad, really; just saying it brings nothing new to the table.  The worst offender is the checkbox for action - because why would anyone play a game without action in it, right?  Pfft.  From time to time you will be forced to deal with a completely useless and forced section where you sneak around bad guys and try to get rid of 'em (or circumvent them entirely once you're tired of this ♥♥♥♥) because someone in development land has decided that under no circumstance should a game of this type be without an action sequence; problem is, it's stupid and provides nothing to the game other than padding and, of course, a checkbox.  Similarly, you'll be tasked several times to arbitrarily click on multiple clues to proceed through the game and it gets old fast - at least it's thematically sound what with the main character being a detective.  Whatever.Anyways, as far as fans of PNC games goes, this one isn't that bad.  The game has a runtime of approximately 8 hours, maybe 6.5 if you don't bother looking for all the hidden stuff (which is also pointless, but allows you to do some checklisting yourself).  I wouldn't recommend getting this at full price in any shape or form, but if you get a decent deal on it, say... $10 just to cover some of the production value, then why not give it a run-through?  It's kind of like watching the latest sci-fi space opera film just because you don't often see them being made and not because it's actually really good.  MSS is just a decent effort.tl;dr: Adventure game fans may enjoy this game on theme alone, but anyone looking for a meaty game experience will find that this offering is leaner than that girl you used to know whose bones could be counted individually when she had her shirt off.  So this remains a (meh) thumbs-up for adventure game fans, but a thumbs-down for anyone else.			"

												Interesting story but the game is unplayable on mouse and keyboard. First I had to MANUALLY change my mouse sensitivity in the config file because the lowest ingame setting was still too high. And then not only does my game keep getting completely stuck in the clues menu, it got stuck when I encountered the first demon. I don't want to tolerate such massive bugs throughout the entire game and repeat a lot of the gameplay when they happen because the save system is crap as well. Apparently the developers don't care about fixing any of these controls bugs so I can't recommend this game to anyone. For what it's worth my brother also got the game and finished it on a controller without any issues whatsoever. Yet another piece of ♥♥♥♥ console port.			"

												So... I love the idea of the story. Investigate your own murder, help other ghosts along the way. Superb premise. I play games for the story. I personally am not a fan of fight driven games, or games that constantly interrupt the story due to fights and battles inbetween. If the difficulty could be changed to ""walk through the fight, so I can go on with my puzzles and story"", then that would be ideal for me.As is, however, the controls are so infuriating that I stopped playing it in first chapter. Randomised-button-smashing-after-on-screen-prompt as a ""battle"" is not my description of fun, particularly when half the time the game doesn't react at all to the button usage even though you KNOW you have hit the right ones. In the right order. (edit: there is a function that lets you make the demons be completely unaware and they won't bother you. That at least let me play the game through to the end...)So, if you are after action, and battle and that tiresome interruption of the story, then yes, that games if for you and I can recommend it, because the graphics are amazing, and the idea behind it is great.Either way, if you are like me, a casual gamer that doesn't have a world of time and plays for exploration, story, puzzles, then no, this one is way too infuriating and I cannot recommend it. (Though, playable with Demon's off, it's bearable and I enjoyed it a tad bit more).Meh... Guess I'll stick to my ""simple games"" like Myst, Riven, Obduction, etc.			"

												This is easily the best game i've ever played! Granted, i am a strickly point and click gamer where there is a distinct beginning and end, and crime stories are definitely my favorite, but with that said, i have never played a game so incredibly clean and well-written. There was only one glitch that i ran into, and it didn't keep me from completing the game. It had to do with a side story, and although i usually like to be thorough in the games i play, i let it go and moved on (i had no choice unless i wanted to start over, which i definitely didn't want to do because i was well into the game). The graphics were amazing, the voiceover fantastic, and the story was intriguing and kept me interested to the very end. And to top it off, the ending surprised me.

												There's a reason this game gets so many bad reviews.  It's not that it's necessarily a bad product, but it's a bad GAME.  Virtually all of the gameplay elements serve to do nothing but force interactivity; they don't really add anything substantial to the product.  There are little forced ""stealth"" segments, some elements of old school pixel-hunting games, a very Vampire Bloodlines-feeling ""open world"" hub section, etc.But, ultimately, I don't think they add anything to the product, and in most cases actually detract from it.  The plot isn't going to win any awards, but it's competent.  The voice actors are all at worst competent, the art direction is fine, and the setting is kind of fun if you like the supernatural stuff.The problem is that this could've been a movie for all the significance of the actual interactive parts have.  That's why I keep referring to it as a product, and not a game.  Because I don't feel like Murdered: Soul Suspect is a game for the same reasons I don't think Gone Home is a game.  Or, rather, because I feel like Murdered is cramming in a bunch of random gameplay elements to make us BELIEVE it's a game... when it's really not.I would never, ever recommend paying anywhere near full price for this product, but if you can get it for a few bucks on a Steam sale or in a Humble Bundle like I did, it's a decent enough way of using five or six hours of your time.

												Murdered: Soul Suspect was surpsingly enjoyable game, despite it being very game-y (which is somehow odd to see in era of AAA MOVIE-LIKE BLOCKBUSTERGAEMS).Sure, it didnt have the most amazing new mechanics, but I kinda liked it. It has its problems and I can see why some could give it 80 or 70.´""Problems"" include things like: linear levels and narrow corridors, the animation is bit clunky and there is random stuff blocking your way without trying to ""hide it"" at all. Its really obvious that ghostwall (get it, hur?) is up there to block you. NOTE: when you finish the game there is no ""go back to get last achievements!"" thing. Once you get into ""last room"", you gotta start all over again if you missed achievements/sidequests.It aint AAA game by todays standards. If this was released early at PS3 or late PS2-era, it would fit right in. Now its slightly feeling like indie studio who is trying to get into deep story with still bit of clunkiness on the gameplay and design part.The story is a bit predictable at points, does have nice plot twist. But overall it was fairly enjoyable.But..you actually feel like playing A GAME.For me this is actually refreshing. It doesnt try to hide it I guess. Its game with story, not ""movie story with game mechanics"".			"

												To be honest, I picked up this game during one of its deep sales, and still wasn't sure what to expect. Though after seeing ""Square-Enix"", I had some clue. (Those guys are the kings of cutscenes, after all.)That aside, it's hard to classify this game as much of an action game. It's defeinitely more of a casual one than anything else, and not that long of a game, either. I guess one could also think of it as a kind of roaming adventure game with a few side missions, plenty of collectibles, and plenty of 'Press X to Not Die' moments.The investigations in the game involve searching for clues, some of them obtained from thinking a little bit out of the box. Though personally, I'm surprised that weren't any 'match-3' or 'hidden object' puzzles in here. Maybe I'm a bit jaded in that respect. Really not all that hard to deal with.As far as action scenes, there aren't that many, and they're generally limited to Quick Time Events with maybe a little bit of strategy involved. Outside of that, there really isn't much that can kill you. Again.All in all, it was worth the discount price, though. Square-Enix can weave a decent tale, and the storytelling here was pretty decent, and not quite that predictable. Biggest faults, though, were that the game was too short, and the action rather limited in scope. "

												-If you really like crime and ghosts get it on a sale-Best feature up front: you can control cats. With that out of the way: this is a detective adventure where you play as a ghost, nothing as fleshed out as Gabriel Knight, think Fahrenheit meets CSI, simplified.Graphics are not that much to look at, music the same. Voice acting and characters are good.I'm half-in so there might still be a nice surprise story-wise but it is: get clues to next location, go there, repeat.There are several logical flaws like every log shelter counting as a consecrated building you can't pass but I tolerate that.Worse are the useless collectable item hunts to add artificial length and distract from the story where you should hunt a terrible serial killer. Strange design choices like the game world's small hub being filled with collectibles every metre and questing ghosts. They'd better made several small locations accesible by quick travel like most adventures handle it.Game features no real jump scares and only moderate horror. Has quick-time-events for ""fighting"".The detective part of the game isn't actually that much brainy also and involves some guessing.Only get this if you like crime and ghost adventures very much and it's on sale. The simple clue clicking and the drive to find out about the killer sees you through.Barely recommended.Edit: finished, ending was ok, some entertainment but can be skipped with nothing missed.			"

												Murdered: Soul Suspect is a game with a really cool idea, but with terrible execution. Even on sale, I couldn't recommend this game. (overall worth? about $5.00). The idea of being a detective ghost, and getting the chance to investigate your own death is very cool. The writing is surprisingly good, and it didn't really feel cheesy. Likewise, the voice acting was pretty good and I didn't find myself hating any of the characters. Usually teen girls in games can be a little, overacted?However, that's all that is good about the game. Any writing that isn't related to the main story was terrible. The little story snippets that you get are not scary, nor interesting. Yay, a guy bathed in nasty dead body water.This is compounded by awful, and I mean awful, level planning and game design. Your ghost powers, which could be AWESOME, are hindered by invisible walls. In this case, invisible ghost walls that have no reason to be there, prevent you from taking better shortcuts, or are there just to make you weave through the miniscule levels in a particular way. And then there are the demons, an utterly pointless addition to the game. All the way done with the investigations in a level? Well, lets just add some extra demons on your way out, to annoy you. Oh, how about some demon hand pits that you have to avoid. The only reason I can see for these being added to the game? To make the game feel longer. To make the final scene completable. Whoever planned this game, and designed the levels and town should be fired. This game is a perfect lesson in how NOT to make levels.Then there are the pixel hunting items. Where you'll spend a few extra minutes per level scrounging around to find half invisible items that don't do much but give you a codex and a short voiced story after finding them all. Without these items, some of your ghost powers would be utterly useless. And many of these items don't contribute to the main story. Those items are real world items that don't use your powers. They could have done so MUCH with the reveal and teleport powers, but after getting them you use them maybe once or twice. But mostly only to get those silly little trophy items. Also, any action in the game is dumbed down to quick time events. Yes, quick time events that don't even register your keypresses properly. It's a game of chance if the game decides to excorcise a demon. On top of this, you often have to kill multiple demons in a row. Failure to kill, sometimes resulting in death, makes you have to start all over again. Meaning if there are four demons, and you kill three, but your kid happens to distract you... Then you have to start the whole process of killing all four OVER again. What a terrible game mechanic. There were also still a number of bugs. The most noticeable were the freezing bugs, where when you go to ""peek"" through someones eyes, the game will not let you click anything. So, you have to restart and hope the same bug doesn't happen again. Would I recommend this game? No. It's one of the most atrocious amalgamations of horrendous game design and mechanics on the market.  "

												Take the basic premise of the Patrick Swayze movie ""Ghost"", ditch the pottery wheel scene, add some gameplay elements from Heavy Rain and L.A. Noire, and wrap the whole thing around the historic Salem witch trials. The result is Murdered: Soul Suspect.As a game, it's really easy, but the gameplay is varied and competent enough to avoid being a chore. Intriguing mystery plot, likable characters and haunting atmosphere are the main reason to play this title, even though there's no replay value whatsoever - consider getting it at bargain price. I should also mention that this is a rare case where collectible hunts are actually worth your time. Those ghost tales are cool as sh!t.			"

												Another glitchy xbox port. From what i understand, this was Square's attempt to appeal to a western audience. The plot is that you are a detective who must solve his own murder, which, as a game, had so much promise... but the coding was top heavy. My system struggled to run it even in safe mode, the story was surprisingly predictable, and the controls were unruly to say the least. I would have been more into it maybe if fighting demons weren't WAY harder to combat than they initially let on earlier in the game. The demons can ♥♥♥♥ right off. The investigations don't really involve any real problem solving on your part: just treat it like a 6 hour movie. :/ Save yourself the trouble and watch an LP. You might miss the side missions (of which there are a gazillion of them), but it's really not worth the trouble of playing it yourself. It was such a good idea that fell flat on its face.			"

												Long story short, Interesting somewhat short story with a twist in the end, where you can get to possess a cat. Other than that, for a person whom loved L.A. Noire, it still left me very unsatified. The biggest enemy is the demons whom seem to love floating like they're struting their stuff in a fashion show. Truth be told, they're mostly an annoying factor of the game than a challenging one. If it's on sale, and you enjoy the meowing and crime thrillers, it is worth spending a rainy day on.

												I really like the story in this game! It draws you in pretty nicely and I really want to find out more, but trying to beat the demons prevents me from spending too much time on this in one setting. You have to sneak from behind, hit R and then a random direction button  (W,A,S,D) and a random left or right click at the same time (you have to match the direction button and click that appear on screen).. ugh!. If it wasn't for that I would be spending many more hours on this. As it is now, I play for a little, get frustrated, and then come back to it later. Eventually I get past the demons by beating them, but I don't consider this part of the game fun.Although I'm not sure of the real reason for Airtight Games going out of business, I would like to think it's because they threw this stupid difficult platforming into their puzzle games that adds nothing but frustration to players like me who are in it mostly for the puzzles. (these folks are also the culprits behind Quantum Cunundrum). The recommendation is a yes for the story and progression of the game but a no for the gameplay. If you like platforming games and are pretty coordinated, this part of the game won't be an issue for you; however, you might then be bored with the rest of the gameplay which is just simple puzzle/exploration.

Overall i give this game an 8/10 untill i complete it 3 hours ive played so far and i have not got bored.Edit:I still like it but since ive got a new pc i cant play it as is only 64 bit what is horrible as it costs aproximately £70 for windows 7 64 bit as i have a 32 bit system what plays allmost all my games so if they make it so people can can play it on 32 bit systems i will b e a happy bambi			"

												I liked the game in general but the ending was unimaginative and short. The game also seemed a bit short but I enjoyed being a ghost detective. Some parts were frustrating but I recommend the game if you can find it with a good doscount.			"

												It's a good game and worth playing but I'd reccommend waiting for it to get cheaper through one of the special offers that steam does nearly every week as it's in my opinion a bit too short considering it's price(and I'm including side cases and collectibles). After less than 9 hours I've already achived 71% of the available achievements for thsi game.			"

												I Pre-Ordered this game and was worried when I started to read reviews. I installed it Friday and decided to fire it up last night and see if it was as bad as I've read. Let me tell you that ""professional"" reviews don't know what they are talking about, some franchasies with annual releases continue to get 80-90% every year for the same game. New games with new ideas often get trashed.My initial trail was intended to be to check the opening scenes, I found myself getting pulled in and played for more than 3 hours straight. I can't wait to continue this game. They premise and story is very cool so far, the main character is well acted and the other actors are ok too. I can really see this game being a cult classic if it continues to be as good as the first few hours. It isn't perfect, there are some cheesy or wierd things. The possession stuff, especially the cats is very chessy and seems to be a step down in quality from the rest of the game. The side quests seem cool but usually are unrewarding, I find myself collecting all the items and I enjoy the spoken story at the end but the static picture feels cheap and it would have been awesome to have some animated stories, even animated comic frames would have been a huge increase. The jump to pre-renedered cutscenes isn't terrible but can be a bit jarring, it would have been nice to see it renedered in game since it does appear to use the game engine but the subtitles are a bit blurry becuase it appears it may have been recorded in a lower resolution like 720P.This reminds me of older point and click adventure games where you have to find clues but uses a modern 3D engine and it works pretty well. The game also looks pretty good, and runs well. I can easily max the game out at 1600P with no problem on my computer.I don't think I have ever written a Steam review but I had to for this under rated gem. The game so far is a solid 7.5/10 for me, it seems interesting and overall pretty fun. I've been getting bored with the same old games recently and it is nice to see a different take. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this game, I think a lot of people would like it and I think the review scores are misleading.			"

												This a a really prity game. The story is well written and the characters are believable although more background about them would have been good. The game play is really good with either Keyboard or controller. With surround sound it definitely creates a spooky atmosphere. The one down side of this game is that it is a bit short at around 10 to 13 hrs game play. 9/10			"

												Loving the game so far, taking up most of my spare time the past few days so thats always a good sign!There's a lot to discover when you include the side quests and hidden clues.... not sure whether that's quite so good as my OCD kicks in and makes me want to explore everywhere.The ability to walk through walls etc can be a little disorientating, to me at least.... I naturally was looking for doorways or openings which I didn't actually need! It can make you lose track of where you are on the map, if you aren't careful.This isn't a shooter, most of the time you are tracking down clues or witnesses to help solve the case(s) but, to me at least, that makes a change as I've often stuck to the ""shoot your way outta here"" type games.I have an old system but this still runs smoothly and not had any dropout or issues.... not even any noticable loadtime issues during play.

												Metascore 60... well F*** metascore =)All the time I've spent on the game, was done discovering Salem's stories and Ronans own story as well, this game is amazing, from some scenes, by looking at them with attention I've even felt sort of sick to my stomach (or it could've been that burrito and cookies I ate too, but I'd say it was the game)L.A Noir should've had something like a ghost wandering a city discovering it's dirty secrets and it's hidden past, GOTY for all years.The detective take to the game is great and well done, also Ronan himself is pretty well done as a character from the ground up, all in all this game really draws you in. The best is that it can be a short game (if you just follow the story itself) or a long game (if you decide to uncover every little thing)Enjoy it!			"

												MSS is a very entertaining detective story, but very very short (4 to 8 hours). So you should buy it if the price is falling to 19,99 $. The concept of possessing people, eavesdrop their conversation and their thoughts is well made. It is more or less railroading, but you can walk freely through Salem, solve sidequests and find collectibles. There are many little ideas like possessing cats to avoid demons and find hard to get collectibles or teleport Dishonored-style. The demons are very annoying, but easy to defeat or to avoid. No variety, no intelligent. wandering from point a to point b.If you want an entertaining short detective b-movie you should play it.			"

												Rich story, great graphic(realistic but little plastic), good audio. Its typical interactive movie game. You enjoy it more by experiencing story than challangeing with enemies.I bought this game for myself but after intro my girfriend grab gamepad and spend with game 4h. I was only called to kill demons while she is not gammer so those elements are too hard for her. Defenetly great game for not only gammers.On my msi gt70-0nd game runs smooth on medium settings ( i5, gtx675m, 12gb ram, ssd) just dont forget to turn off vsync.I really recomand to play on big tv with gamepad - game is like movie.

												Just finished the game. Over all, it was pretty neat. The graphics were nice and the story was pretty interesting. While I thought the dialogue might be a little cheesy, it was bearable and I have no real complaints about it. I enjoyed playing a ghost detective and getting to posess and influence people to get what I needed. Also, the demons you come across in this game are pretty terrifying. It seemed like the more you crossed paths with them the more they recognized you and then became harder to take out. It was a nice challenge to a game that doesn't really have many  hard obstacles apart from the demons.There are just a couple cons about the game:1. No map. While you can play and beat the game no problem without a map, it was still annoying at times trying to navigate without it. Since the game took place at night and a lot of the buildings look similar, I found myself lost a lot and running around in circles. The game DID come with a code for an interactive map, but I could never get that to load for me and thus never used it. 2. Retracing your steps. Partly due to the lack of a good map, you also have to retrace your steps a lot in this game. That can get tiring. You can also get a bit dizzy from walking/running through walls etc. while retracing said steps.So yeah. The game was pretty awesome and worth the money. I give it a 8/10.			"

												My review of Murdered: Soul Suspect:ATTENTION: This review is long, so you can just skip to the conclusion if you'd like.I always liked supernatural fiction.That's why I took an interest in Murdered: Soul Suspect when it was first shown, back in 2013.First of all, I have to say that this game is unique.Where else can you find a detective game where the main protagonist is a ghost? Answer: You can't.Murdered: Soul Suspect is more than just a detective game.It's a story about Ronan O'Connor, a detective that was killed at the beginning of the game during an investigation, and became a ghost.Now, as a ghost, he has to find his killer in order to finish his unfinished business in this world, and be at peace with himself so he can go on to the next world and be with his dead wife, Julia, once again.The killer is called ""The Bell Killer"", a serial killer that roams the streets of the town Salem.The killer was searching for something in an apartment building when Ronan interrupted him and wanted to make an arrest, until the killer overpowered him and threw him out the window, badly injuring Ronan. Ronan becomes a half ghost as he's about to die, and when he wants to get back to his body, the killer shoots him several times, thereby killing him.Ronan became a full ghost immediately after. Later, Ronan meets Joy, a medium who's looking for her missing mother.She helps Ronan find the killer because her mother is possibly connected to the killer in a way, and by finding him, they will possibly find her too, so they help each other.The story is an excellent detective story, with great characters that are well voice acted, but it's really short. It only took me about 6-7 hours to complete, which is not enough.So, after you die, you immediately jump into the ghost-detective action.Since you're a ghost, you can't physically touch anything, which could be a problem when you want to investigate further, but as a ghost, you can do certain things you wouldn't be able to do as a human, such as possessing people and eavesdropping on their conversation, or influencing witnesses into remembering what happened at the crime scene. You can analyze evidence which will give you more clues about the case as well. Ronan also has the ability to see the memories of victims through their ghost residue, which helps him see exactly what happened at the crime scene. All of these will help you solve cases, and it's executed pretty well in the game.On the other hand, the choices you make as a detective are meaningless, since you will eventually make the right choice no matter what, and there is no grading and EXP system to motivate you to do your best. It's really disappointing.As for the town of Salem, Massachusetts, it's a really, really small town. It's so small that it kind of makes it hard to believe that there's actually a serial killer in this town. Also, the game gives you the feeling of a semi-open world game, which in reality, there's so little to do in Salem when you're not playing through the main missions.The only side quests in the game involve helping other ghosts finish their unfinished business, which means finding the truth about their deaths. It’s pretty neat. Aside from that, there are a ton of collectibles scattered around for you to find, and if you collect enough of them, you will know more about the people that lived in Salem in the past.There's also a side case for Ronan's life with Julia, which tells a lot about Ronan's past.Lastly, there is a side case which includes special collectibles that are hidden in the main areas of the game, which, if you collect all of them, will uncover stories about ghosts that are haunting those places, and also each place has its own collectibles that tell you about the history of the place, but, that's about it for the side content.By the way, you can also possess a cat which will get you get to certain places you can't normally reach, which is pretty cool.One thing I didn't like in the game was the demon encounters.Demons, as the game explained, are lost souls that stayed in this world, and they're the only enemy you'll ever encounter in the game. They can only be killed stealthily by executing them from behind, and if they see you, they will chase you. The only thing you can do in this situation is hide from them in ghost residues. They will come looking for you in them, so you have to switch between one residue to another in order to avoid them, until they will eventually stop looking for you.Sounds exciting? I didn't think so. It's utterly boring, and I would prefer if it wasn't in the game at all.Luckily, there are only a few demon encounters in the whole game.When you play through the game, you are accompanied by a creepy, intense soundtrack, like one from a horror movie when there's a scary scene. It's fantastic, and it immerses you into the dark and gritty atmosphere, and the great number of ghosts haunting the town makes it even more immersive.Speaking of atmosphere, the visuals in the game are fantastic. Textures are great, although I did encounter a few texture pop-ins when playing the game, and I had a few frame rate issues at certain points, but that's it.The dark atmosphere makes the game look amazing, and the graphics looked great on my PC.Overall, the game is a good adventure game, but it had so much more potential, and it could have been an amazing game if it had been done right.While Murdered: Soul Suspect definitely has its unforgivable flaws, it tries to compensate for them with its great narrative and the amazing atmosphere, though with not great success.It's not a horrible game by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not an amazing one either, and it certainly didn't live up to my expectation.Pros:+ Great story+ Incredible atmosphere and soundtrack+ Side cases are interesting+ Great graphicsCons:- The game is short- Boring enemy encounters- Choices as a detective are meaningless- The town is really smallMy final score for Murdered: Soul Suspect is 6.5/10.I would wait for a big discount before buying the game.

												A very well made mystery game. Incredibly fun and unfamiliar to solve your own murder. You feel like it's you who are finding the clues and piecing them together. And on top of that is a very well written story, that drives you forward.			"

Awesome graphics except sometimes to dark in few corner. Control clusmy on computer could have been better. The only real reason I recommend is that the story is nice and beautilful graphics.			"

												In my opinion, the metascore is way off on this one. Usually I feel the scores are about right but not this time. My only complaint is that this game was way too short. I completed the game in under 9 hours and got every achievement in that first playthrough. The story was good and the mystery stayed a mystery to me until the very end when all is revealed. The gameplay was solid (reminded me a little of L.A. Noire which I expected) and the story was great as well as unique (I don't know any other games where you solve your own murder). I would recommend the game and I think the metascore should be around and 80. Had the game been longer I would've given it a better personal score.			"

												This game is very unique and quite good. If you like some adventure mixed with puzzles and some action then this game might be something for you.Even though i do recommend this game, I sadly do not think it is worth the price. I've played through it in about 6 hours, wich is quite short in my opinion.			"
