Early Access Review
								I've waited over 3 years for this game since I backed the kickstarted and I got to say that I'm not impressed at all. The sheer amount of content is very disturbing and the poor animations when running and hitting made the game feel very stale. I got no enjoyment out of slaying all those zombies. It just felt plain and boring. I want satisfaction out of dominating zombies and with smoother animations I think the game would be much more enjoyable.Hopefully this game will be worth coming back to at a later date, but at the moment I can't recommend it.

Early Access Review
								As a backer of the Kickstarter, maybe I'm just rationalizing my donation, but I'm really just happy they're still working on the game after so long and am pleasantly surprised with what they have so far because for months at a time I would forget the game even exists only to check up on it every now and then forget about it again. They could've easily just have dropped the project long ago with the difficulties they were having and I wouldn't have even noticed, so I really admire their dedication to it and the backers.With that said, the game still needs a ton of work done on it, but I feel like they have a pretty solid foundation with pretty much all the basic gameplay elements laid out. They really just need to add more of everything, smooth out the controls and combat, and of course do a lot of bug testing and gameplay balancing. The game is pretty playable the way it is at the moment, but lacking so many of the promised gameplay elements you might do everything there is to do pretty quickly and grow tired of it. Still, if the concept appeals to you and you like these kinds of games, it may be worth looking into and see if you'd enjoy watching it develop into a fully fleshed out game.			"

												There is not much to this game just yet, and as such I cant reccomend it. There are 2 ""classes""; one that is a bit tougher, and one that is a bit faster.  There are a bunch of different weapons, but as far as I can tell they all do the same damage and combos/specials, and a bunch of cosmetics (shirts shoes, pants, backpacks, etc.)   The core gameplay is running around whacking zombies with your melee weapon or shooting them with your range, your melee gets combos with finishers, combos being x--> y    x--> x--> y   x--> x--> x--> y and your pistol gets like a grenade charge thing.  As it stands now I cant reccomend this game, because as it turns out, this game is complete.			"

								Cute game but boring. Scarecely any reviews and no games in multiplayer lobby. I don't think many people bought this, and to be honest it isn't worth the price in it's current state. If you do pick it up look in the forums for detailed explanation of the controls because they are not in the game, even though it tries to fool you by offering a controls option which is entirely misleading. Kind of a waste of time and money if you ask me.			"

								I waited a long time for this game. I followed the Kickstarter campaign, the forum updates and finally the Steam early access. I feel like I need an option for in between Yes and No. I like the art style, the options for customization, the music and the a lot of the gameplay. I have a huge problem with the camera work (more on that later) and the seeming lack of story/objective. I understand that this is a work in progress so here is what I'd like to see; the option for story mode and simple run and gun gameplay. More character options. More levels. Achievements. You see where I'm going. I think this is a good foundation and after the bugs are worked out and more content is added Zombie Playground will be a great addition to your game library. Fingers crossed.			"

								This game is good but you've got to like this sort of game to get enjoyment out of it.It needs more work done to it but so far it's quite fun, there's not a lot to do at the moment but there's still a few different missions to do and the developers are working towards adding new stuff into it, not too sure if online is any good as only played the solo mode.Pros:Cheap and cheerful.It's a zombie game.It has an objective marker to show you where to go.Cons:Combat isn't the best. It locks you on to a zombie and forces you to strike in that certain direction which takes some of the freedom out of it.This review probably isn't the best in terms of explaining the game but hopefully helpful enough for you to decide if you want to try it out :D I haven't played a lot of this game so there's possibly a lot of stuff I'm missing but this is what I picked up from the beginning of the game.Here is some gameplay if you would like to take a look at the game before you buy it, the video may contain spoilers:

								Right now I can't recommend this game. Yes it is in early access and it has potential, but there are a lot of issues. It hasn't been updated since Halloween and there really isn't that much content. You pretty much get to play the school area over and over for all missions. Online mode bugs out for the person who isn't the host, causing them to force close the game. The leveling system jumps all around. I was level 7, then went to level 9 then level 4, make up your mind lol. But yeah, 14.99 for what you get now is not worth it.			"

Early Access Review
								I highly recommend this game. Is it perfect? Nope.Does it have fun issues like Zombies coming through doors? Yeah, occasionally, But so does DayZ and that's been out since December 2013.They're not the same game of course. DayZ is survival and this is, well fun. You get to run around as a kid, customize your character to wear gas masks, have backpacks and a dog. Plastic baseball bat? You've got it. Nail guns (not child friendly) they're there too. Paintball gun? Yep. Remember those paper cutters you had in school that you used to be terrified of because you thought your hand was gonna get chopped right off? Well those are weapons too. It needs some work, sometimes in Multiplayer you'll get locked in place. Sometimes one of your friends is just floating and sliding about, but on his screen he's being a bad A 3rd grader. No one is judging. It's challenging enough that it holds my interest. I posted a screenshot and the dev commented. How cool is that? They're paying attention. it's really easy to get into a game and play when you've only got a few minutes to kill, and if you want to invest more time I'm sure it's the same level of easy. I don't normally write reviews, but I saw this one had mixed reviews on the first day, and I don't think that's fair. It's fun, Worth the 15 dollars in my book and I've only played for a little over an hour and a half, however, I see myself putting a lot more into it. If you're on the fence, watch some gameplay or streams of it, if you're a fan of supporting devs get this, but remember it's in Early Access so as mentioned, there will be some issues.If you have no desire to play this then you probably didn't have a childhood where you got to play on a playground and pretend you were saving all your friends from monsters.

[TL;DR] The game feels incomplete and gets boring very fast. 3/10After the gameplay video I was quite interrested in the game, however the game didn't come near to feel my expectations.Core gameplayAfter quite some crashes (which happened alaways when the loading was taking to long and I clicked the screen twice, it would ""[something something] stopped working/responding"", you know the usual...) I got to try the game, but for a game heavily based in single-player/co-op game the A.I. was not that great. The dificulty felt along the way was mostly on the bosses or if a lot of zombies spawned near you.To beat the buggy zombies you have a bat/club, a gun and 2 abilities. The bat is your best choice in most cases as it does a lot more dmg than the gun(from what I've felt).For the abilities you gotta feel up somekind of power bar but you don't get much of an explanation on what the abilities do. The guns are pretty 'sucky' and I only used it to hit the high dmg dealing bosses from afar while dashing around(yes there's a dash too).The one good thing in the combos is that they have timed attacks where the bat flashes and if you press it at the right time you make a special move (similar to Witcher 1).Visuals, sound...The character customization was somewhat decent but nothing far beyond. The item shop is based mostly on expirience, meaning, the more you play, better are the things you can unlock, pretty standard. The same goes for music and visuals.Single-player carrier and Multi-playerWithout the tutorial level you get 9 levels of game. You unlock new areas of the map as you go. I got through half of it until I was done with it.For the online expirience the was noone around but from what I've seen, you pretty much get the same 9 levels from before but this time you get to play with up to 4 people (yourself included i believe) which gameplay wise doesn't bring anything new.Final opinionAt this point anyone already can conclude that I don't recommend this game. It seems a early unfinished concept, that should be in early acess but the devs got done with it and shipped it to full release incomplete.			"

								This is still early access, and it's great for early access. I love how I customized my character, but that's slightly off-topic. I haven't heard about this until today, and it once and a while skips a few frames and the sensitivity is out of whack for me, but that's most likely how my computer feels like acting right now. Anyway, it's definitely a good way to spend your money, even if you can barely afford it. It's a zombie game, so it doesn't sound original at first, of course, but I doubt there are many, (if any) games with similar themes. I haven't played much either, but it's awesome so far, heh.			"

								If there was an option to vote ""Wait till it gets better"", I would chose that. It's a promising game, but right now it has a few issues that make playing it unenjoyable.Well, the core of the game at least is in a promising state. Combat is fun enough to justify fighting zombies for hours and there is a fair amount of customization options already in the game. Probably more unlocks than one would be willing to grind for.The problem is that in less than 2 hours I've already experienced everything available (apart from multiplayer). Another ""bugger"" (pun intended) is the framerate as the game runs terribly bad. There are complaints about the camera controls, though I quite like it as it is, provided that performance is fixed at some point.Still, the dev remains relatively active in the forums so it's not an abandoned project, and once they fix the performance and add a bit more variety in terms of enemies, it would be quite fun to grind for those unlockables.

Early Access Review
								Why do children never get to be protagonists in zombie games? Are they not equipped to handle such peril? Perhaps their death would be taken too harshly by the audience? Zombie Playground pulls off the seemingly impossible, delivering superb class-based arena combat featuring children against hordes of the undead. The enemies and environments are endearingly creepy. The cartoon style with its stylistic black blood, serves greatly to ensure that even while eviscerating tens of opponents with a nailgun, the game never feels like it is taking things too far. Just look at the sparkles! OOH!Class-based means this game is infinitely more fun with a friend or two, but even alone the fluid controls and easy-to-master combo system makes Zombie Playground just feel nice to play. Currently only two classes are available, the Bully which takes on a Berserker role and the Rascal who serves as more of a Scout. The dynamic works well enough, with the Scout finding the path of least resistance and the Bully keeping it clear. However, with only one level to explore maybe double-Bully is the way to go. As more classes are added the game will develop some much needed complexity.Customization is extremely vast in this game. Hair, clothing, and accessories abound to ensure that no two survivors will look the same. You can even choose between a few different school-related weapons. I experimented briefly with the level-up system, which gives a fair incentive to continue playing. Eventually you will unlock all of the few available game modes, and find yourself waiting for the next update. There is a lot to love about this game and it is an extremely promising Early Access title, but the variety will need to be stepped up if it hopes to make itself known in the horde of zombie games available today.I greatly enjoyed my time with Zombie Playground, but lack of variety hurts this game a lot. The difficulty score is flogged by the beat-em-up nature of the game and the sheer amount of items dropped. This games unique aesthetic and fluid controls are what eventually won me over. This game could surely be amongst the greats if it offered a more complex combat system and maybe some RPG elements. If it seems like something you would enjoy, please leave a comment on the youtube video mentioned previously and your name will be entered to win one of two Steam keys. Thanks to Stealth Studios, and I can’t wait to see whats in store for the future of Zombie Playground.Gameplay:    Controls- 10/10    Fun Factor- 8/10    Difficulty- 6/10    Replayability- 2/10    Innovation- 7/10Aesthetic:    Graphics- 10/10    Music- 8/10    Sound FX- 6/10    Story/Lore- 0/10    Level Design- 7/10Final Score: 64/100 for graphics, controls, and fun factor.Summary: Arena-shooter about kids cleansing their school of zombies.

								Couple of things to keep in mind when deciding on purchasing this game.1.) It is early access. Understand that means it is not complete. If you can't deal with that, don't buy it. Otherwise, it is a sound purchase for its current status and will only get better. (Many people buy games in this state and expect a fully finished, polished game and then bash it and give bad reviews because it is not complete to their satisfaction. Dont be one of these d0uchebags.)2.) The developers are fully committed to this game and its success. I know for a fact that they listen to the suggestions of the community which is a great reason for this purchase. How many times does a game feel great and have potential only to find that the devs don't care anymore and/or have given up. This is NOT the case here. This will only get better and better.3.) Conceptually, this is new. Who doesn't want to run around the halls of their school as a bada$$ kid killing zombies! Get this game NOW!!! You won't be disappointed.			"

								Take the style of Zombie Ate my Neighbors and throw in a big helping of hack 'n slash and you've got Zombie Playground! While this title has plenty more of development to go, what is there is promising. From the awesome character customization, crazy weaponry, and over the top action, Zombie Playground has plenty of good ideas and shows potential. In the audio/visual department, Zombie Playground is also looking nice. While the game focuses more on slime and less on gore, this doesn't stop it from looking really fun and crazy. The characters animations flow well and combat is highly explosive. What Zombie Playground does lack is simply content and polish. The game has all it's ducks in a row, it just needs to turn itself into a game with a cohesive direction. Goals such as kill 500 zombies isn't necessarily dynamic gameplay, however, this is Early access though. Combat and level design need a little bit more polish but are just about where they need to be. I personally am very excited to see what becomes of this title, with features such as online co-op and possible more fun weapons to slaughter the masses with. This high school drama might be just the kind you want to stay tuned into and see how it all ends. I made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

Early Access Review
								Zombie Playground is a RPG childhood nostalgia with zombies in a visceral combat with a school atmosphere.The game offers singleplayer and multiplayer, to either have fun alone or with others. The game has six different missions to play and challenge your self in the current school area. The equipment option gives a large scale of costumization of your child character, which gives a enjoyment to be the cool kid back in the days. There is currently two classes, which is either a bully as tank or Rascal as a agility class. Every player has a mele weapon aswell for pistols. - And for those who like dogs, then you can get a dog.While playing the game we notice the EA stage has the same design of zombies everywhere besides the bosses. The school environment is damaged and should be any childs nightmare, but with the skill set and feeling of character control, should not stop them to wipe their asses.Overall, the game has potential where i can imagine that the game has alot to come in the future. If you want to be young again and beat up everyone including your teacher for giving you homework, then you have the chance to to that repeatedly until you are satisfied.Here is a demo:

												this game is very fun I got it from a giveaway on alienware arena not really expecting not to like it but so far I am really enjoying myself. but i dont really think it is a complete game and should still be in early access because there is just not enough features and things to do I really think this game has potential but needs more work done on it and more to do in the game so unless more things get added to the game i cannot reccomend the game for the price there selling it for. but definetly worth free from that giveaway. The moment they fix the bugs, properly optimize it and add the content needed to be a full game I will easily give it a thumbs up but till then I would hold off on buying it because there is no guantee they will add what is needed into the game.Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

MASSIVE stuttering during most mouse movement despite pushing >100FPS, movement acceleration per key press that resets on direction changes so the movement is unresponsive and incredibly clunky, mouse aim feels completely off, weapon changes and abilities often don't work while making other inputs, etc. The melee combat has no weight to it, and the shooting at least with the revolvers I chose offer some of the least satisfying gunplay I've seen in years irrespective of the stuttering.I made it through a bad tutorial with timers for each section so you have to wait even after you've completed the objective, and a few of the levels, but when I go back to the customization and find EVERYTHING I had access to on first launch is now locked behind large exp and currency requirements, and simply entering that menu reset my character to defaults even though it stuck fine prior during the first few levels.Judging by how the movement operates, and the hitching (almost outright freezing at times) during mouse camera movement, I have a feeling this was designed for controller despite having seemingly functional key rebinding. I'd whip out a controller and try it, but honestly f*k that, there's no way I'd want to play a 3rd-person shooter without mouse aim, so there's no point.I remember seeing this 4 years ago during their Kickstarter campaign, and then again last year when Jim Sterling covered the first builds. The only thing I can see that has changed since is the effect when the ""mayhem level"" increases, that and there's no insane stuttering likely because he used a controller. The original pitch and concept art was absolutely superb... interesting classes and abilities, fantastic style, color choice, and atmosphere... this ""released"" game (minus the amount of customization options and the visuals) is as if it's still in the programming stage before even pre-Alpha, before core gameplay has been established.It's so disappointing it's painful... so imagine how the Kickstarter backers feel about the state of this, and the fact that I just got the game and it's DLC for free from their Alienware promotion, and not the $8.29 they just sold it for in the sale two weeks ago, or the $15 they charged 4 years ago on Kickstarter.

Early Access Review
								Zombie playground is a hack and slash game of fighting off horde after horde of zombies.as far as that it isnt anything new, or ground breaking.the fighting in it is pretty much a one button mouse click hack and slash with no real combo's in terms of melee combat, you also get a fire arm that is dual weild and can be charged up like megaman leaving a massive explosion leaving a few zombies tossed into the air and across the map.the school and graphics are decent looking and creative, but the map is very small and can be run through in less then 30 seconds.and thats the only level you will get for the moment.the ai in this game is simplistic at best, pretty much if you where new to the ""unity"" game engine, you could make a similar ai you're first few hours in one of their tutorials located on their website.Missions are very simple in their mind set, you have explore the schoolKill 10 zombieskill 50 zombieskill 100 zombieskill 500 zombiesdefeat the janitorNow at this point i have already just stopped playing, because now you're just becoming bored slashing at the same enemy's with complete and utter ease.wanting to level up but it grows so tiredsome you dont even want to make it past ""level 6""atleast not me anyways, maybe later on when this game grows, but really their are other ""horde mode"" titles that are far less in price then this with more content to enjoy while fighting off wave after wave.once and a while you feel like your in a tight spot.but that was only when i was in the ""500 zombie"" mode where they cut off the entire school and you have to just fight in the court yard....the rest of the modes allow you to fight anywhere...So all and all, is it worth 15 bucks.No, far from it right now.I understand its early access and they will improve certain things, update it with goodies and such, witch i will say you can customize you're character with both ""picking gender's"" articals of clothing, hair styles and a few backpack choices and a puppy that serves no real purpose but follows you around the school until you reach the school bus where it now becomes stuck due to bad pathing for it.you have certain classes with different abilitiesbut all and all...it isnt worth 15 bucks at this moment, if i had to price this game, its around maybe 3 dollars, even app games on my iphone supply me with more to do and more interesting methods of game variety.and honestly i have been waiting for this game for a while now, the key concept of this game is cute, and something that really brought my attention to it...a game featuring kids with rather creative concepts of how their roles can be used.but then it kinda left a sour first impression the moment i jumped in.all and all, if you wish to try it, just be warned, you wont have to much to do in the game to keep you there much.Also the graphics in this game are very simplistic as well, some cute and interesting concepts like a giant plant growing in the biodome, and a few school buses that have crashed into the building...but as far as it goes...thats really it, the concept art had more interest then the literally game did.

When I got in the game after customizing my character, it wasn't fun. The combat doesn't feel like fun and the ranged combat confused me. The kid's voice annoyed me to the point where I cringed.

								Featuring terrible controls, a graphics setting that makes the developer look like they don't know how to make a good game, as well as plenty of unoptimization to fly around for all, this is an interesting one.After about 14 minutes of playing, this game is the fine definition of ""mindlessly murder zombies"". it offers an objective such as ""explore the school!"". I clicked on that one assuming it would be a tutorial. No. There is no tutorial.The next objective: ""Kill 10 zombies"". These objectives get larger as you go, with little to no variety. If you enjoy mindlessly clicking mouse1 while facing zombies, this game is for you.This is the real kicker though. One of the video settings presets is ""ALIENWARE"". In all caps. Why not just ""Maximum""?This game is unoptimized. It makes a GTX 660 superclocked and intel core i5 3570k jitter between 60fps and 45fps. This is understandable, as it is early access.			"

												A decent time-killer that shows a lot of promise. The dev(s) are responsive on the Steam forums (the website is not maintained, apparently), and with some tweaks this could be a really fun arcade-style ""beat em up"" with a quirky aesthetic and feel.It's still definitely got an early-access feel to it at this point, it's difficult to play solo at points, and it lacks some polish and depth. Looks nice with a lot of bright colors and surprisingly detailed environments. Recommended, but with the above caveats. I've seen worse for a higher price, but I can't shake the feeling the game isn't at 100% of its potential. Not yet anyway.			"

Pros- Art style is fun and cohesive- Various customization options for your character are niceCons- Solo mode is just a series of hidden object quests for the same books over and over again- Enemies are dull and slow- Combat is simplistic- Poor tutorial is both boring and doesn't end up explaining everything (like medpacks)- Customization requires XP which requires playing a lot of the game- It's not clear if the weapons you unlock even do anything or if it's all cosmetic- It's not clear what all the pick ups that are dropped do (apple juice?)There really isn't much of a reason to play this game.

								(Early Access Version Review) Even though the game is rather bare-bones at this point, it shows tons of promise. Running around a school yard and smacking around creepy zombie kids & faculty with a paper cutter blade is a nice twist to the generic ""shoot a zombie"" approach. Though in it's early stages, there's a fair ammount of customization to your character's appearance, and I suspect more would be added upon a completed release. So far there are just two classes ""Bully"" & ""Rascal"", and personally, I'm hoping for a ""Geek/Nerd"" class. Perhaps a quirky looking kid who can use a modified Bunson Burner to set his enemies a flame. There's lots of possibilities here and I hope all aspects are fully fleshed out for it's release. Controls could be a bit more solid, and there are the expected hiccups with an early access version, but I believe Zombie Playground can inject a bit of juvinile glee to a bloated genre of gaming that's made me somewhat weary of the walking dead. More classes, More fun weapons, More customization, better control handling and I think it will be a solid release.			"

												Kickstarter backer. Watched the game get passed to a different team. Since then we've seen very few updates (even less meaningful).It's somewhat sickening that this game no longer has an Early Access tag... it clearly fits the criteria. There is one map. It's somewhat large, but one map is one map. Mobs are bare-bones. Barely have textures. They all look the same once you start playing.The two classes only control differently under the hood. Skills and such. Movement and combat are completely the same regardless of what you choose. There's a lot of cosmetics, but the vast majority are simply retextures of say ten or so different models.There are different modes, but they all just seem like placeholder junk. Kill X amount of mobs. Kill the boss. Explore the school. They're all pretty boring, and mindless. The game feels unfinished because it IS unfinished. The original developers talked about this fantastic experience that ""all kids dreamed of"". What we've got here is a dry, hallowed out version of that. There seems to be a resident developer roaming the forums, but updates are very few and far between. I have doubts that he/she is actually part of the dev team, and may just be assigned as such because of his ties to the game.It's a shame that I can't really think of any other game for you to get if this kind of thing appeals to you, but I really can't recommend this unfinished beta product to anybody. Especially not at the pricetag listed.			"

								Game has a lot of potential. I've been a kickstarter backer waiting patiently for a long time. I'd like to enjoy it more, but not until our extra keys are given out, and multiplayer upped. I'll change this to a positive one day, if this is still around and they've updated.			"

								I backed this game a long time ago, and perhaps I should have given it more play time but I got stuck at the ""Find the classrooms"" part. The game is imaginative, or at least the idea of the game is. My largest complaint is the camera, it's super-sensitive, and perhaps you can turn that down in options but the options menu isn't in game, you must leave the game to look at it, and well... I wasn't that excited to give it another go and wait on loading to see if it did. I hope this game becomes something great, at this moment though, perhaps I should be thankful we at least got something from our money.			"

I donated to the kickstarter two years ago, and after a long time it's finally in early access!In just a few short months they took this game from a mostly unplayable, buggy, crappy alpha into something that, while still rough, holds a lot of promise.When purchasing the game please understand that this is early access, and it will be buggy, with movement glitches, exploits and graphical issues.and jesus christ I've waited 2 YEARS FOR THIS GAME TO GET THIS FAR GIVE IT A CHANCE.

								I am just hoping the game is completed in my lifetime. As a backer on the Kickstarter, i cannot currently recommend this title to anyone. there was only one map, and a character customization when i tried the title for an hour and a half. When playing the school map, the gameplay felt uninteresting to me. here's hoping the game turns out well for other players.player controls seemed fine though. i used my keyboard and mouse.Successfully funded on [Kickstarter] Jun 26 2012, i would like to see more (playable?) developments this year.

								Terrible, no tutorial, no one on multiplayer, crashes and closes, terrible gameplay, poorly executed. Early access, yes but that's not an excuse to charge people 8-10+ on it. I played it and as soon as I released how horrible it was, I refunded it. Want a real game thats functional and is a co op experiance against zombies? Try l4d2, never played a game this bad since Orion Dinohorde and atleast while that was a pile of turd, it never crashed on me and was atleast fun. What game have you ever heard of allows you to my stuff with xp? You xp level should reflect how good you are as a player and how much ""experiance"" you have with this game, buying stuff with it is stupid. You need a proper currency system, more customization options, allow us to customize our characters faces, style and physique. A tutorial from the get go wouldn't go amiss and actual modes, kill 10 zombie to 500 zombies mode is basically the same thing, same♥♥♥♥♥♥diffrent option which could be done as survival mode,done.This game barely has a frame rate and looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥for it's style, the camera movement is jerky and aiming with the guns is inaccurate. I'm running this on a GTX 980 and it runs just as bad as Ark Survival Evolved. TL;DR: This game is not worth you money, and is the definition of early access.			"

Now, I can't say if the game is abandoned, the devs simply are lazy or what else, I can just give the doubt benefit, but anyway even if the studio is small... 2 years and just some update that can't be count in ONE hand, no I won't reccommend. When (and If) things will improve I will be glad to change the review.			"

Basically, don't waste your time; the game is NOT done and NEVER will be. You will probably have better fun burning paper and stapling yourself in the face, and you won't have to pay for that. I refuse to mention any of the gameplay because, there simply is none.			"
