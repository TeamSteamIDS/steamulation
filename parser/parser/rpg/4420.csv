												It is hard to decide if this game should be recommended or not. It is basically a Dungeon Siege clone, albeit less polished. The interesting aspect is the decision between nature and technology the player has to take. Unfortunately, in the long run the whole setup gets somewhat boring and repetitive, with the game seemingly lacking some fine tuning, and the somewhat crappy inventory management being more annoying than necessary. On the plus side there is the character development/skill system. If your main focus is on combat and leveling and gathering of the best loot, you may still want to give this a try if you've already done with Torchlight, Dungeon Siege etc. and do not mind the weaknesses of ""Silverfall"".

												An amazing RPG. A few glitches that i've encountered : the teleport system being unstable and while teleporting to a specific location you can wake up in a totally different place, also there are some map glithes when enemies, your companions or even you can get stuck in certain spots being unable to move, though this can be fixed just with restarting the game. Despite of this insignifiant ""problems"" i found this game to be extremely entertaining. A lot of quest to be done, a wide variety of items, a lot of companions to choose from, who help you in your journey and in the meantime by the answers you give them to their question you can influence the attitude they will have towards you, if your companion is a woman you can even get her in love with you. It is pretty important in Silverfall that you chose right from the start if you want to go the technology or the nature path. If you do quests of the opposing faction you lose points with yours and that means you can't use your best armor and maybe even some skills anymore. So, before starting playing the game i would recommend finding some external info about the quest for each side. to keep track of what you should and shouldn't do. I had a great time playing it, and now  i'm looking foward to Earth Awakening expansion.			"

												Silverfall is flawed for sure but has some satisfying elements for action rpg fans. Might be tricky getting it to run but is definatly worth it on sale.Pros: - Characters are highly customizable with six races to choose from and a simple yet robust set of skill trees- Neat morality system, align with nature or technology to access unique skills and equipment- Lootfest with a pretty deep crafting system- Attractve cell-shaded artCons: - Lots of terrain issues, getting stuck on bushes, slight inclines, etc.- Skill hotbars are counter-intuitive but can be remapped- No UI scaling makes text difficult to read from a distance- The map and quest log are clunky to usePlays Like: Torchlight / Neverwinter Nights			"

												I wouldn't recommend this game at full price. I picked it up for less than $4, and it is totally worth it. You can easily get in 20 hours of enjoyable gameplay solo. The skill master rapidly drains your money if you don't plan out your characters, but I just started new if I didn't like a character by level 15. If you have a lan connection for multiplayer, then I'd say you will triple your game time. The controls can be difficult to work with, but targeting is simple, and hotkeys will allow you to organize what is important to your character. It also has some minor glitches with movement and occassionally leveling. Typos are abundant, but all in all it is an endearing little game.			"

												DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!I really like the premise, for me Silverfall falls under the hack/slash rpg genre; it has character creation (female/male), ability to upgrade your character as you choose, armour/weapons choices.I tried hard to like this game, but where it fails horribly :-  is the insane and extremely difficult controls.  I found it hard to wrap my head around the mini map and the orientation of the whole game.  Plus the character is prone to getting stuck in the most awkward moments.- extremely difficult, coupled by the fact that when you die you lose all your equipped items.  So if you are fighting a challenging boss or swarms of enemy and die, you can pretty much kiss all your equipped items good bye.I bought both Silverfall and Silverfall : Earth Awakening for less than $5, I want my $5 back.

												Silverfalll, developed by Monte Cristo delivers an average action RPG experience.  To it's credit it includes a wide variety of items, interesting stylized graphics, as well as complex crafting and skill trees.  Unfortunately, at high widescreen resolutions, the onscreen text and menus are incredibly small making it difficult and tedious to read quests and navigate the various character screens.  In addition, the camera control, while allowing 360 degree movement, is not automatically tethered to the orientation of the mini-map, making simple navigation a chore.  Lastly, the actual action can grow a little dull, as melee characters in particular need only select a target and sit back while the ai and pc automatically duke it out.  Despite these deficiencies, Silverfall is certainly a solid addition to any RPG library.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!The reviews from people who actually have this game running are mixed but after thinking ""I'll give it a go."" I found that the game would not run correctly and that there is no support. The website just tries to sell you stuff and looks like it was put together by a 6 year old.Plenty of tech issues on the forums with no solutions. I personally am unable to even get the game past the menu. May as well have thrown my money in the toilet...			"

												This game is right on the edge of what I can recommend. It is a Diablo-Siege clone, albeit less polished. Like its predecessors, it does offer a wealth of character upgrade options, and different looking weapons and armor. Combat is more or less typical of the genre, so if these are qualities you enjoy in a game, I would recommend it. I certainly enjoyed playing it for quite a few hours.However, there is definitely plenty wrong with the game. My personal caveats:1. The UI is very clunky. Menus don't scroll all the way to the bottom, quest logs don't automatically take you to your active quest, and the font can make numbers difficult to make out (can't count how many times I wasn't sure if I was looking at a lvl 23 vs a lvl 28 item).2. Gameplay is not very smooth. Movement is erratic, especially if you are holding LMB to move. Sometimes a piece of scenery way above the ground level will get under your mouse, and your character will move very unpredictably (often straight into monsters I was trying to avoid). And the view panning never felt elegant. I always felt like I was lugging around this terrible camera man, and waiting for him to get into position so I could see where I was going.3. RP opportunities are few and not great. There are some decent companion interactions that were well scripted, but they don't seem to have any purpose other than flavor. The only mechanical RP elements I could find were ""science vs nature"" themed, which were just awful. The choices were always so absurdly binary (""do you want to destroy entire eco-systems or completely trash all technological conveniences?""), it was hard to take them seriously, and I just picked whichever had the talent choies I wanted.

												I would like to say this was a shocker at first for many resons 1. this was not easy to start to play game there was two probems with getting it to run on a new system and once running then mouse pointer was hidden then the config screen was messed so could not fix it. so yes there are issues and if you don't know how to fix and find them steam commuity forums then don't buy it. 2. once the game was running another shocker the tutorial was not annoying.( now days with way people program then its ment for a 8 year old kids for most video games not this game read tutorial or skip it and your given a high end mage with all the spells sink or swim. 3. once you die you lose evey thing till you find the chest for the life insurance gobin. after many deaths ....... even more deaths starting out with undes only I built a mage it was fun.4. There are not many games I go I have to play it though I have them diablo 3 same gene type of game. this one though is way better then that in that I feel like I'm playing a version morrwind with freedom to mess up it royaly where can run in to something a low level can not deal with and good luck trying to run a way or load up next area and be ambushed with none of your spells on fun fun know your hot keys !5. like morrwind you can make the charater in to any thing any hybrid mage tank , dps mage what ever you dream up with spells in the game you can make it truly your own. mine is summoner tank I have these undead and nature beast jump in to the battle with me i then stun enemys with frost wave and slowly beat there heads in with sword and sheald.to rap it up if you can get it to work dont mind a little dated grafics and you dont have a life becouse this will suck it up you just forget the time and keep playing this.

												I want to like this... I love action RPGs.  But this game is just beyond punishing.  You qute literally die every 2 minutes.  The click detection is appalling as well.  It's built like an MMO, but plays like a single player game and unfortunately makes the worst of both worlds (enemies that are all back when you reload is a prime example.  Makes for a LOT of grinding).  I also have the PSP version and to be honest, it's the better of the 2.			"

												Polished visually, completely lacking in refinement. This game is ultimately a ruse. A mirage. At first glance it's beautiful. Visually, the combination of good graphics and Cel Shading is stunning. Quickly, however the true gamer realizes the actual gameplay is flawed beyond reproach. Lackluster clunky combat, an archaic quest system and VERY liminted voice acting make this game mediocre at best. A poor ecuse for an action RPG, and a poor excuse for either genre, period. The combat barely passes as a Diablo clone. The camera options, while involved, are seemingly limited, scarring the experience at every turn. Choose one angle, you'll be doomed to limited view, choose another, you'll be thrust into a pseudo-3d world. Any camera you choose limits the experience. Couple this with repetetive combat and repetetive gameplay. I.E. NO puzzle solving, no clickable objects. Basically, you kill, kill kill, LEVEL up, add stats,. collect loot, KILL some more repeat. There are some notable points of interest. They have graciously added in their desperate quest to copy Diablo, more options for loot...you can get yellow, green, blue white AND artifact (brown and rarest) loot types. Beyond this, Silverfall is a hack and slash nightmare...it will remind you of all the cliches of a game of this genre, while satisfying next to none of those expectations. Expect the expected with Silverfall. Expect the predictable. Barely worth the price of admission.			"

												Official Multiplayer Servers seems to be permanently down, seems also that you'll not find support form producers, so this game isn't what it is promised to be. So if you search something like a multiplaying based on servers I suggest you to get something different (I would point to Titan Quest).That's a shame because multiplaying would have been great in this game.There are also other bothering problems that you can ignore, like getting stuck in simple little rocks or can't jump down from little heights or graphic that ""is not the best"". You still can use Lan multiplay, but you have to find someone every time, which isn't so simple.			"

												I knew from the ratings this game was badly received and still decided to try, because I hope it was similar to the first dungeon siege game which I loved. I'm not sure why dungeon siege was so awesome (there virtually was no plot after all, it was supremely linear hack and slash and yet.... fond memories). The graphics aren't that fantastic, controls are iffy, AI is stupid, plot is, erhm, and the dialogues are horrible. If you REALLY have nothing better to do with your time, then by all means..			"

So I go to redownload and the app is no longer needed and no i hav e a game that I can't play anymore nor redownload.  Yes, i have tried removing it from my library and my whole computer (even tried it on a diferent computer still nothing).

												UInfinished game plain and simple. I instantly regretted buying this game and the expansion which also felt 1/4th baked. Everything about the game feels like a beta. The graphics are wonky and often buggy, the art feels unfinished. The Sound is acceptable, but nothing near great. Game play is a mindless slog of one kill after another of pretty generic feeling monsters. The story is hardly even there and when it is, it's mind numbing. All the magic feels rather similar or like it just doesn't work. The AI is extremely basic. The Multiplayer has been broken since the game's inception. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. If you like Diablo style games, I would highly recommend Path Of Exile. It is free and 10x more enjoyable that this game :]			"

												Silverfall, a once glorious city, lies in the fantastical Kingdom of Nelwë, where the forces of Technology and Nature are strongly opposed. Symptoms of this terrible conflict have begun to manifest physically as melded cyberbiologic organics and living steam-driven automatons. Drag your hero from the pits of this world and craft him into a mighty champion that can oppose the planet-choking Order of Nothingness. Freedom to evolve in either the technological or spiritual paths is in your hands and you must choose your comrades wisely to provide a balance and benefit to your efforts - but be cautious, any bias in your choices will either corrupt or upgrade the growing world around you.

												So i am going threw our Supported games and checking them and playing them to see if there working well enough to use in a event for our Group, first i play them Solo awhile to get the feel then i will work on the Multiplay Feature, i will need help on some of these games which i will add a list of soon.First upYou need to install Silverfall as well and at lease load it once, if it keeps going to bar, you need to go into the Game folder and delete the Config for this game. Then you need Load SteamFrom the Library section, right-click on the game and select Properties from the menu.Select the Local files tab and click the Verify integrity of game cache... button.Steam will verify the game's files - this process may take several minutes.Once the process is completed, the Check Window will automatically exit.https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335 Then install Do all the same as above.Then launch the game from FS:EA only and pick ether level 1 to enjoy the first game or level 45 to start this game. it reminds me of Titan Quest you have to have both installed but you play off off Immortal Thrones.Pick your Race from Human, Elf, Dwarf, Troll, Goblin, LizardmanClasses are Tree skills so it is really open to what you want Melee, Caster, Archer, Gunner etc. i went with one-handed Weapons and shield. and Dwarf. You can Gain followers threw quests events etc. i have atm a caster and a archer with me so it works i rush in do the damage they lay down covering fire and the caster is a Icemage and Healer so really good.There is a Stash and your backpack has 4 Tabs but there named tabs, like Weapons - Armor - Items - Crafting stuff and the first two fill Quick, but you can Quick travel vie map to town. its the basic color code most games use white-yellow-blue-orange. But this game offers a really cool gear slot Backpacks-Flags-Stuff, so you can change that look a long with your gear kinda cool really, no Shoulder or Cloak slot, but maybe the backslot will have one and shoulder items are included in cheat armor.i Put about 10 hours into this game and it is still fun to me its kinda like PoE and Torchlight had a crppy Baby but he was a ok kid. but its more Camera control than those games.5/10 Really, it's fun but do not pay over 5$ for Both games do not buy the first one.i have tons of Screen Shots on this game and i plan on keep on playing it.I Do not Recommend this game because it is broken, but with this and Earth Awakening i would Recommend it, like i will on the other game.

I hav not had any problems with the physics part; the Steam inatallation did it and the game runs quite well for me. I have a ATI  Radeon graphic card. As for the game, it is a huge world and there seems to be many missions which you are free to do in the order you wish. You are also free to explore the world.

It basically drops a folder inside your current physx files and it plays flawlessly afterward!!			"
