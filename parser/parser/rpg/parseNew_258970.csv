												You've already read the other reviews.  You already know this is supposed to be an updated and modernized verion of the arcade classic.  You already know how they tried to make each character unique, with new elements: twin-stick shooting, MMO tactics, RPG progression, element-mixing magic.  You already know there's both couch and online co-op.And you know the other reviews aren't answering the one, fundamental question.  One that's hard to vocalize without sounding trivial.  It's about something that can't be measured, can't be analyzed or quantified.  It's about a feeling, a memory.Is this Gauntlet?  Is this *really* Gauntlet?And the answer involves a flashback.  Sorry in advance.1985 --  A group of 15 and 16 year-olds hits the arcade to get their videogame fix.  They were a standard 80s group of teens -- the preppie, the punk, the jock, the girl.  It was a group that didn't outwardly have much in common.  But not long ago, they discovered by accident two shared passions among them: video games, and Dungeons and Dragons.That day in the arcade, they saw something.  Something new, something different, a game that spoke to both gamers in each of them.  Pixellated swords and sorcery.  Four, count 'em, four players at once.  Four characters, four classes, four roles.  All working towards a common goal: the next level.These four unlikely friends each took a spot before the grand machine, somehow choosing characters in coordinated silence.  No discussion, just unspoken agreement.  The girl became Warrior, strongest of all.  The punk became Valkyrie, protector of the group.  The preppie became Elf, rogue and rebel.  The jock became Wizard, cerebral and calm.The next hours were epic.Fast-forward to 2014.  An old gamer sees an updated Gauntlet.  He sighs, remembering Dark Legacy and other kind-of fun but failed attempts to update and recreate the arcade classic.  But the reviews look positive, and YouTube videos show fun-looking gameplay.  What the heck, there's even a sale on 4-packs.The next hours were epic ...The answer is yes.Yes, this is Gauntlet.(first Steam review ever, thanks for reading)			"

												Have to say as a whole, the game was not a bad game - However, I would not recommend buying it.The ""feeling"" of the game was very old school gauntlet (prior to Gauntlet Legends & Dark Legacy), the visuals were beautiful, Relics are an awesome new spin on the classic ""Bomb Potion"" we all know and love, and a lot of the other new additions were cool (Death is actually a challenge now!), but that's about it.Where this game falls short is... pretty much everything else - Like Seven Sorrows, really.It is a very short, very empty, and very unfinished game with a pitiful amount of content.If you were hoping for old school Gauntlet with loads of levels, prepare to be let down.For one: There are only 12 levels, split into 3 realms (A crypt, a cave, and a volcano) - Each of these realms comes with 3 sets of 3 (Always a normal stage, a random generated stage, and an arena), and then a fairly easy to defeat boss to deal with as the fourth and final chapter level.You paid $19.99 for a 3.5 Hour game (The original Gauntlet? The game this is based on? Pretty sure that game was endless honestly, it had HUNDREDS of levels - Even Dark Legacy took 12 hours to beat on 2 player and had 60 Levels, more than 5 times the amount of levels this game has!) I've played the game solo, and I've played it through twice nearly with a group of 3 and a group of 2 .Secondly, none of the levels pose unique challenges or puzzles - It's all the same paths just recycled and arranged. Even the randomly generated levels are similar, I have played the same randomly generated level twice in one playthrough! These levels are also COMPLETELY LINEAR!Third, there's only four classes - Of course one can argue this is ""based on the original"" which only had four classes, but that leaves no reason for not expanding on and improving a working formula. More than one gauntlet game had more than 4 classes, why not bring those back?Gauntlet 3 had 8 Classes, Gauntlet: The Third Encounter had 8 classes too.Hell, Legends / Dark Legacy boasted 8 Classes, 8 Beasts, and 1 Secret character + Skins. Fourth, there's also very little customization of said classes, as all growth is in a mandatory tree that grows as you play. Even the wardrobe and custom armours? there's only 3 full sets and a few extras, and all of them require playing on hard or higher to acquire (aside from the usually very ugly first set of unlockable armour). mastering your character takes longer than beating the game - I finished the game at about 50% Mastery, and this is while consciously trying to actually master the character - I can't imagine how slow playing for fun would be. While this would be fine normally, what's the point in learning these new abilities and bonuses if you've already beaten the hardest obstacle in the game without them? Most of them are passive skills (like damage up +5%) so they don't change gameplay all that much.Fifth, the game (much like Diablo) Expects you to just replay it constantly on higher difficulties to add replay value. And by higher difficulty, I literally mean that all that changes is A) how much gold B) How many generators there are. C) How fast foes come out of them. D) How strong these enemies are.It doesn't unlock additional side paths or secret stages. No major differences on difficulties.Sixth, Lack of co-op - The game is structured so you need to work together to persevere - Yet,you get constantly rewarded for killing your teammates. It is almost impossible to find good teammates, the game works best if you KNOW you have 3 friends who will consistently play with you - Trustworthy players. While this can't be blamed on the game itself, it really ruins the multiplayer experience if you have bad luck and can't find a good team. Luckily, I bought this for a few buddies as well in the four pack - So I've experienced the good as well.Seventh, Filled with bugs, glitches, errors, the odd crash, and other ""half-finished"" giveaways.And finally, keys and potions reset - You literally lose all your keys and potions after every ""level"" (3 stages per), So stashing Potions and Keys to benefit you later? no point! You can't! But there's enough keys in every level so that you can get every single locked door if you have have a brain, so don't worry - You won't miss a single thing unless you try! It is so linear that you have to consciously TRY to not get everything (Though the only thing you can really collect is Gold anyway!)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------I can't say this game wasn't fun at all, but it's literally free-to-play quality. It's not a bad game, but it is THE WORST Gauntlet. It is not worth $19.99, and it is definitely not worth $59.99 for a 4-pack. If you wanted a good ol' Gauntlet style experience, I personally recommend you do yourself a huge favor and buy either Gauntlet, Gauntlet II or Gauntlet: Dark Legacy instead, because in my opinion they are all far superior to this rendition of Gauntlet. Considering Dark Legacy is 14 years old, and Gauntlet II and Gauntlet are from the 80's - that's really saying something.For what it's worth, it was pretty fun for the short four hours of gameplay we got - But save your money. This is not Gauntlet, Gauntlet II, Gauntlet IV, Gauntlet: Legends, or Gauntlet: Dark Legacy - This game might as well be called ""Rusty Brass Knuckles.""Now, I know this is based on Gauntlet (the original), not Gauntlet: Legends, or Dark Legacy.I've played the original gauntlet, and multiple other renditions in the series - Great series, really.But I felt this installment didn't match up to the glory of other previous games, hence: negativity.As someone who has played most of the series (aside from Gauntlet: Third encounter)I strongly consider Gauntlet, Gauntlet II, Gauntlet IV, Gauntlet: Legends, and Dark Legacy (if I didn't make that obvious enough) much better games than this rendition of Gauntlet.(Which - much like Seven Sorrows - is less than four hours, has pretty generic gameplay,) and made a promise of old school gauntlet action, then didn't deliver a quality product.)As stated above, some people will enjoy this game - But I cannot recommend a 4 hour game,for the price of 20 or 60 dollars. 5 or 10? I would agree. Most Indie games are that cheap,and this honestly feels like an indie made game rather than a professional production.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DRIf you like short, simple, unoriginal games with literally no replay value that have less than 4 hours of content? Gauntlet is your game! On the other hand, if you like games with at least some replay value, unique items, customization, Challenging puzzles, cool classes, and generally more than just a difficulty change for replayability? Do not get this game! Go play Gauntlet or Gauntlet II - Both of which are also better games than this, and give you the ""Real"" gauntlet experience. Or if you're not feeling the old games, try Gauntlet: Dark Legacy instead.			"

												G:'14 = Gauntlet 2014G:SE = Slayer EditionAH = ArrowheadAH was undoubtedly thrilled to apply their mantra to their childhood franchise by quickening the series with a more tactical reboot. They indeed elaborated on the action, but did they make a winning formula and is this truly Gauntlet? I'll add that this Gauntlet is as much an arcade game as the first and the hack n' slash gameplay is the best you'll find in the genre.THE HEROESIf your perspective on nostalgia consists of 4 buddies coming together as Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard, and Elf and challenging the Gauntlet, you're in for a real treat. AH's expansion to them is very worthy and each possesses nostalgic nods to their original concept. Merlin's spells are an absolute joy to wield, and though the others have less to work with, there is elegance in their designs. All are solid and all depend on player skill and improvisation. Suffice it to say, there are no predetermined roles in Gauntlet.Thor - the WarriorThor became a confident, unyielding brute, and aside from one weapon set, has nothing but all-rounded, close-range attacks. This deceptively makes him appear straight-forward, however, he cannot be played casually. This is due, in part, to the clumsy demeanor of his attacks. Fortunately, he has the greatest vitality, possessing the highest health pool and the most invincibility states.Thyra - the ValkyrieThyra became a stoic, battle-hardened shieldmaiden of death. Like Thor, Thyra cannot be played casually, however, she possesses keener attacks--owed to her valkyrian discipline--that allow her to hastily fell the machinations of the Gauntlet. Her shield can ward any attack and it allows her to take defensive postures or guard allies. She, most of all, requires precision. Anything less will leave her open to counter-attack.Merlin - the WizardMerlin became a wise yet patronizing, mythical grandmaster of magic and is unabashedly the reason I bought Gauntlet, being fit with a miniaturized version of the wizardry from Magicka. He has nine spells in total. Together, they give him immense power through versatility. This factor easily and expressly makes Merlin the greatest of the four. Although he is undoubtedly the greatest, presence of mind is required to unleash his phenominal, pseudo-cosmic power.Questor - the ElfQuestor became an absurd yet graceful arcane bowman. He is straightforward, stylish, and by far the easiest class to play due to his ranged capabilities, subtle magic, and manueverability. Fans of fantasy archer archetypes will definitely appreciate what he brings to the table, and he plays how an elven, veritable, twin-stick archer should.SLAYER ADDITIONSForget everything you knew about G:'14 because the gameplay and monsters have been heavily revised. Most importantly, the heroes were expanded upon, particularly the melee classes. Talismans & RelicsRelics--magic items which cast an offensive, defensive, or supportive spell--are now tagged with a relevant cooldown and only one may be equipped. My favorite is the Tempest Locket. It unleashes a slow-paced tornado that breaks up even the most densely packed hordes. Talismans are the new equippables, taking the role of effectual potion magic. Tailored to each class, they allow for a totally awesome, welcome expansion to the heroes' personalities. What's more is each class has a modest selection. For instance, Elf's Ultimate Arrow fires a powerful, pervading missile, the Enchanted Willow Branch summons three spirits which orbit him, and Dryad's Song plays a magic melody that heals allies and placates enemies.Unfortunately, these items are hit or miss. Inquire about them in the community and choose wisely.WeaponsWeapon sets now grant each class unique abilities, such as Merlin's Eldritch Sphere which replaces a school with extended lightning magic, or Elf's Shadowstrike which replaces Magic Bomb with Smoke Bomb--a wicked cloak power. Some aren't as obvious in their use, while some are in dire need of AH lovin' to make them more viable. Overall, this change is mind-blowing and I guarantee you'll find some combination of Talisman, Relic, and weapon that thrills you.The BestiaryIf you're familiar with the original games, you'll recognize at least a few of the throwbacks. G:SE's iteration of the monster roster has bestowed very welcome refinements, particularly to the tougher variety. You may find yourself being under constant threat from Orc Berserkers once they lose their temper, being charged by a Skeleton Defender once you demolish their shield, or dodgeing projectile barrages from Grunt Shamans. There are also some new enemies, such as the enchanted skeleton archer, tougher spiders, and a Temple miniboss.AH has lain a much tastier variety of monsters to slay but quite a few of the enemies were gutted and a few of the revisions are simply unpalatable (see: Cultists). Almost the entire roster lacks appropriate aggressiveness and movement speed on Hard difficulty. This is counter-acted by their excessive reach and a very frustrating oversight that allows for stupid fast melee attacks. Temple enemies are the prime abusers of this. Basically, when you're in Temple levels, all the game's 'fair play' is demized in the fire of a thousand exploding suns.The ViewG:SE sports a tethered camera and UGH, is it hideous. One grievance is how adjustments throw off your aim, but that's just the beginning! Previously, it was full overhead. Now, it's half isometric, and you'll find yourself fighting it as fiercely as your enemies. The camera subjects players to all kinds of nonsense, including death, 'stucktitude', wobbling, and many more! This call to nostalgia enforces cooperative play, but the cost is incredibly steep.The ContentThe delightful hub from G:'14 was removed in favor of an artsy but practical map screen. I'm going to miss the ol' hub, but having control over the exact level you play is very convenient, and the unwanted interruption to the flow, known as 'run' levels, can be skipped (thank Gaia). Campaign offers a good experience for newbies and as a side venture, however--by virtue of its difficulty alone--you'll find it unsatisfying if you're an expert. While many encounters (arenas included) were greatly improved, the rest lost some of the magic from G:'14, also, only one boss recieved an upgrade, with the others being castrated. Speaking of arenas, the Colosseum made a return and is on a rotating schedule. One Colosseum map is chosen at random, per day, with a random Summoning Stone affix. Defeating the challenge earns you that day's bonus.EndlessThe heart of G:SE. AH has smartly answered the thunderous cries for a worthy procedural mode! Not worthy of the classic games, mind you, because there is a distinct lack of elegant labyrinths in which to wander. Nonetheless, Endless is a welcome addition. Floors consist of the highly linear run levels from G:'14, reconstructed. Sadly, Endless is plagued by some major issues, the greatest of which is the curves that are thrown at you. Sometimes you'll mosey through a pointless, barren level, while other times you'll be treated to the Mini-Battle of Endor. Still, Endless provides a good experience despite its wild difficulty, limited variety, and hacked-together presentation.CONCLUSIONThe lack of retro, procedural labyrinths is highly disappointing, but this is definitely Gauntlet, and it boasts superb co-op and gameplay. While it has a semi-solid foundation, there is a mind-numbing amount of frustrating bugs and balance issues, and the game is still considerably content starved. It's a bummer G:SE couldn't be supported further.Ultimately, the action is the juice. Don't bother with G:SE if you can't appreciate that. Otherwise, take up the Gauntlet and INVADE THE DARKNESS!

												Gauntlet is a classic envision of the dungeon crawler game from the atari/nes classic. Introducing a unique take for the classes with the controls, a more modern look and a multiplayer mode which is ridiculously chaotic while keeping true to the original concept of the game. Fans of the original will pick this up and immediately be immersed into a good time with their friends or random individuals online.Right from the beginning the game will introduce players with some random retro sounds, and music thrown around remixed. Fans of the original gauntlet will immediately be hit by nostalgia. The game lets players choose from two control scheme, The keyboard and mouse scheme or the xbox controller scheme. The controls, however, are not bindable at the moment but does match up to today's control scheme in gaming and works out really well. Those that are new will have to be able to adapt to these controls which aren't hard to learn. The options of the game will have screen size; blood gore; and graphic options and even a retro mode filter which makes the game look like a 8 bit colorized classic look for the game.The game lets the player choose four different hero each with their own control scheme style and abilities (referencing to the joy pad). The Warrior Thor  with the ability to spin attack enemies and rush/charge them  able to tatically enter the fray of battleThe Valkarie Thyra is the defender of the team, with the ability to shield wall block and toss the shield at multiple enemies.The Elf Questor is the agility of the team that can roll quickly and dodge from attacks while dropping mines and using focused ranged attacks to back the team in a distance. The Wizard Merlin is the complex of the classes. By using three distinct elements and a combination of two spell press each. He can cast a variety of different spells. Varying From shielding spells to projectile damage and crowd controlling spellsEach of these four classes adds a unique play to the table as players traverse the dungeons. There will be four difficulties of game play. Options are Easy, Normal, Hard and Insane. There are a variety of kill challenges that players will have to complete while playing the game to earn a buff perk called masteries on their class in order to survive the difficulties. There are also some relic items' players can buy from the shop after earning enough gold in the game to carry to add more variety of skill to aid them in the harder difficulty along with some aesthetic load outs.The game play with coop is quite simple. As the team moves along the map moves along with the team though  players can, however, can get stuck into a corner if other players hug the opposite side and stay too far. There will be many things going on at once on the screen so some players might have to adjust to seeing the intense amount of action on the screen and keep an eye on their character otherwise losing sight of the character and dying will cost the team a coin which is the shared life the team uses. If all coins are diminished it is the game over, and the entire team will have to start from the beginning, however, coins can be replenished by attacking enemy summon portals. To win the stage players will destroy enemies, take down portals, discover secret with keys and open doors and reach the doorway to escape. Spamming buttons and shooting randomly at everything are also not advised because the only way to heal in the game is to eat food items and by doing so will accidentally destroy the holy chicken and potions.At the end of each stage player will be rated on the gold collected along with the amount of kills and the one who performs above all will be crowned king. There are also only three bosses in the game and three different stages with 4-5 levels each, which can take anywhere from 15-30 minutes to complete depending on difficulty and skill levels.Players can play this game by themselves. However, it is highly recommended as a coop game, therefore, multiplayer is must especially since there will be all types of variety of undead and monsters to fight. From enemies that explode and damage all others or those that spawn from portals to shoot projectiles. Only with the help of friends and others will players conquer the gauntlet and reign supreme. As for my opinion about the game to be honest? This game is ridiculously fun with friends and random players alike. It's a fresh look on a classic game while staying true to it is what more can I say. Online has been flawless so far with a few problems on connections. The game has some technical issue such as unbindable keys at the moment and reading the game from window language or detecting resolution. Those are issues that should be taken to the forums and not about the game in terms of review. And hard + insane mode is ridiculous. As in you'll die when the action gets intense, and you'll die many times. The game has some technical issue such as unbindable keys at the time and reading the game from window language or detecting resolution. Those are issues that should be taken to the forums and not about the game in terms of review. Prepare to Gauntlet.+4 Variety of modes for your skill level+ Sleek and refined envision of gauntlet series+ Retro sound effects and music and epic music scores.+ Control scheme for controller and mouse+kb  is fantastic for each character each with thier own style of play+ Some randomly generated content but not much.+ Fast and sleek gameplay even on multiplayer, though there isn't lobbies but joining is easy with a click of a button.+ Masteries to accomplish to benefit character with Relic items  to purchase along with aesthetic+ fast paced gameplay with hordes of variety of enemies+ MULTIPLAYER + Second player on your pc can also join in.- Getting stuck in corners of the map when a teamate decides to wonder off- People going afk, luckily theres a kick function- no online communication of any type. Can't type or talk to them in a mic- unbindable keys atmyou can't change the setup i've tried.- Good varieties of relic and items but not enough- Who the ♥♥♥♥ destroyed my chicken? You idiot!- Not completely randomly generated content- can't join a game underway or started- Questor is always crowned king that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ * he also steals my chicken- Good amount of replay value until you max out every single mastery.- Some players having problems with display, reading game language and unbindable keys, they're ixing it.Feel free to check my steamgroup and follow curator if you enjoy the review.Reviewed live twitch.tv/kenutyYT video -

												So Posted a review for Gauntlet a while back but it wasn't received to well, and they are now putting this game on sale for daily deals so I made a few changes and reposted. hope this one is more helpful. It has no issues or bugs that I have experienced. I have only played a little bit on my own most of my time spent in game was co-op with my wife. For me the entire reason to even play Gauntlet is to do it co-op. In co-op even though you are working together to complete the level there is also a bit of competiton. You strive to get highest kills, most gold, and also to obtain and keep the golden crown which flies off every time you take damage(and I mean flies off, sometimes across the screen). Each character has a unique and individual feel to their combat and attacks. My only regret is that it's not longer(beat the game in about 7 hours). However replay value comes into play with completing different difficulties and experiencing the combat and skills of the other characters. I definetly see myself playing through the game two to three more times. I don't regret spending $20 on this but %50 off would make it about right I think.Oh and I could probably live longer and complete the levels with more ease if my wife didn't love being the archer, shooting every piece of food that shows up, stealing all the gold, and using all the revive tokens! She is lucky I love her!!!!Gauntlet- 7/10wife- for better or worse, richer or poorer, food or no food!			"

												The Quick ReviewA very short and a not too awfully fun game. If it's on sale for about 80% percent off, then I might recommend it if you have some friends that would want to crank up the difficulty and have a few beers a couple of nights. Some quick negatives:- it is extremely short- not much character selection- you can't unlock the ""hidden"" character, you have to buy him with real money....- extremely repetitive. Levels were made with much copy and paste The ReportMy wife is a huge Gauntlet fan. The old school Gauntlet on Nintendo 64 was once of her favorite games, so naturally we grabbed this as soon as it went on sale. As soon as I loaded the game and was looking at the few choices presented for character selection,  I noticed at the bottom of the list the Necromancer character with a lock over his name. My first thought was ""cool, you probably get him after beating the game or something."" That's what I had hoped anyway. Then the more seasoned side of my brain said ""wait a minute, this is 2014. I bet you have to buy it."" Quick Google search later and yes, you have to pay to unlock the ""hidden"" character. For me, this was an instant down vote with very little hope of being saved.Then we started playing... The only character that is really worth anything is the Valkyrie. She has everything:- A ranged move, which is throwing her shield. Small cool down- A shield to defend with- Sword for up close quick attacks that deal good damage- A spear she can use to charge through hordes with. Insta-killing mostSo what does the warrior get? An axe and a low IQ, which is humorous at times but gets old rather quickly. He can swing … and swing. No defense whatsoever. You do get some perks to help later, but still, it's very annoying to just be able to run in with no defense options.The archer? A bow that does little to no damage, and a bomb. The bomb is useful, but your friends will probably kill everything before it goes off anyway.The wizard? Believe it or not he's not bad. He can mix and match up to nine spells, which does make playing him pretty entertaining. But there is something about him that just doesn't make you want to keep using him. The spells get a little boring after a while, and a couple of them could really use some tweaking.Keep in mind the above mention of the wizard is just my opinion. He can be a good character to use if you adjust yourself to his playstyle. The warrior and archer, however, are seriously lacking some needed adjustments.All that  being said, you'd expect to find everybody running around with either a Valkyrie or Wizard, right? Well, two people can't play the same character, so two of your friends are going to soon not be your friends. As for the rest of the game? Short and repetitive. It's really sad how short this game is considering how many times they just copy and pasted when making the levels. Even some of the bosses are duplicates, just with different models. The first set of levels is alright, but once you've done those four, you've seen all this game has to offer. There were honestly moments when we were playing that I thought I had picked the same level again, or we had messed up and it was making us redo a floor for some reason. They were that similar.My final opinion of this game:Just another cheap rip off that was crapped out by another gaming company that is no longer interested in making a good game. They too have fallen into the get rich quick schemes and make more for less. Finished product? Better chop it up and sell some off as DLC.Remember:It’s wise not to pay full price for a game in today’s market. Also, NEVER pre-order a game, pay to be a beta tester, or support DLC. Maybe once upon a time those things were alright, but the video game market is exploiting it now, taking away your hard earned money and giving you nothing in return. "

												tl;dr -+ Faithful to the series+ Some randomized generation+ Dynamic design and enviroments+ Updated and fun to play charaters+ Incredible fun with friends+ You get to chop through hordes of enemies+ Watch your friends suffer because you shot the last Food (HP refill)- Lack of potions, replaced with purchasable temporary boosts- Game is fairly difficult, even on the easier settings (but is this really a negative?)- No changing character/players mid-game (have to quit back to lobby)- Main fun comes from playing with friends / No chat to others can be fairly hardIf you've played the original gauntlet, the dark legacy version, or perhaps one of the arcade ports, you will find yourself in love with this game. That said, people new to the gauntlet series can also find a lot of love for this game. This game takes gauntlet back to it's arcade roots with a few modern twists. If you're new to the series, A breif overview:Gauntlet is  a cooperative top down beat/shoot/magic/death them up game where you and up to three friends traverse increasingly deadly areas searching for gold through death bringing traps and hordes of enemies in an effort to complete the Gauntlet and earn power and riches beyond imagination.If you're one of the people who only cares for gameplay, prepare for a treat. Gauntlet brings back the main 4 characters from the previous games, who have each been amped up beyond what abilities they had previously been seen with:First comes the warrior - Rough, Tough, Break Through & Beat em up. Two handing an axe allows the warrior a wide melee swing and devestating damage. He can also preform a spin attack, cleaving enemies all around him. Great for taking on those hordes of skeletons who just can't seem to leave you alone.Next is the Valkyrie - Strong, Agile, and willing to take any measure to get her revenge. The Valkyrie uses a spear and a shield, able to dash through enemies while blocking her opponent's attaks. She can throw her shield Captain America style with her special and oh is it a devestating move.Thrid comes the Elf - Long Range and Quick as the wind. The Elf is an archer who can utilize rapid fire arrows, precice piercing shots, and even small bombs he can place at his feet. And if enemies start to encroach he comes prepped with a dodge role to quickly reposition and wreak havoc on his foes.Lastle comes the Wizard - Spells, Spells, and more Spells. The character to see the greatest update from their old age counterpart, the wizard now has access to 9 different methods of attack. From chain lightning to freezing orbs to massive fireballs to electricity bubbles, the wizard finds himself the most versatile of the 4 heroes, although he is the weakest in HP.The game plays just like the classics, with a multitude of enemies and chain attacks that leave you feeling like a total badass. This game is enjoyed far more with friends, though single player can be a great challenge if you're feeling brave. The game is not without some slight negatives. It lacks the possibility of changing your character color (to my knowlege) as seen in the Dark Legacy iteration of Gauntlet, leaving me without the possiblility to play as my classic red elf. (warrior is set to red, valkyrie to blue, elf to green, and wizard to yellow) The potions that used to be screen nukes or destroy death have been removed, replaced with artifacts that you can purcahse with your gold in game (no microtransactions as of yet - and never i hope) that grant temporary boosts to stats. While a nice twist I just can't get past them removing one of the most iconic abilites in Gauntlet. Overall, this game is a gem, and definatly worth the asking price. Whether a fan of the series or not, you can find good fun in this game. If you're unsure if you want to purchase it, know that it is a game aht is a lot more fun to play than watch.Good luck in the Gauntlet. and please.... Don't shoot the food.			"

												If you can remember this game the first time around you're probably like me; couple of kids (in thier bed right now), a penchant for all things mystically nostalcic and incredibly thinning hair. Not 40 yet though ...In short the original was awesome. I remember it taking an age to load (on the speccy) and then spending HOURS with my best mate killing ghosts, skeletons etc. etc.The reboot definitely lives up to the playability of the original, though times have changed. I'm running it on a machine that makes my 128k speccy look like the first wheel and my partner in rendering 'bum kicking destruction' is my good lady wife.To be honest, we're not that far in to the game, having only completed the first two scenarios but we've experienced, in no particular order; edge of the seat tension (thanks Death!), tactical analysis, acute tactical deficiencies, where the hell is the next chicken dinner?, smoke breaks, dying (a lot), spamming the B button to do Thor's whirly thing, shouting, heatedly debating, the children, halfway through play, spilling juice all over their bedroom and an EPIC amount of GOLD. This is what a game should be all about :)Being a Diablo III player I thought that this would be the usual kinda romp through a dungeon with no particular level of difficulty, however, I was totally wrong. This game is hard - playing it solo on normal with Thor will get you killed fairly quickly. Like other games of yesteryear you had to learn them especially when soloing, so I was pretty chuffed when the missus stopped on WoW and decided to have a bash. Better. Much Better.You really get the benefit of the differing abilities of the characers when you play as a team. We were playing as Thor & Questor (Tank & Damage respectively) and were pretty effective at knocking out the generators/portals or whatever you want to call them.Hard on two player, No. Challenging, Yes. but that doesn't mean it's not FUN. I've thorougly enoyed the last 3 hours of play and if it wasn't for my eyes about to dry out, I'd probably be on it for a few more tonight.By comparison Diablo is a bit of a cake walk, if you really want something to get your teeth into, then give this a go, I double dares ya!!!P.S. I bought the 4 pack which I think is really good value for money. If you're gifting, you'll have a lot of fun with whomsoever you send it to.P.P.S The kids bedroom carpet is ok ;)Merry looting!Fudge			"

												Pros:- It's a Gauntlet game, in which you'll find overhead dungeon crawling.- 4 Player Co-op (If you can actually find 3 other people to play with).Cons:- Barely last generation graphics.- Extremely repetitive.- Only 3 worlds.   - Of those 3 worlds you get 4 dungeons.      - Of those 4 dungeons you have 4 stages, the last one is always a boss.- Linear levels.- Survival/Defense stages.- Little to none procedural generation.- Characters have repetitive, annoying dialogue.- Death is no longer a threat in every level.- No robber to steal your Magic/Potions.- Potion mechanics have been changed. - DLC Content.This Gauntlet remake was supposed to bring the classic series into the present generation but, this game bears little resemblance to the games I had known and loved. Above all else, this game is a massive disappointment. The game itself is not even long enough for ten hours of game play!Before you vote my review down out of spite, I would reccomend looking at previous itterations, Gauntlet, Gauntlet 4, and Gauntlet Dark Legacy specifically and see for yourself. Also, comment on my review page if you have any objections to my review, don't be that guy.The ""Was this helpful"" button is not for if you disagree, don't just vote me down if you didn't like what I said about this game.

												I grew up with Gauntlet, but alas.... this version has sadly mucked with the formula a bit and made it a bit more like Diablo and other grinders, as to be nearly unrecognisable. In fact, it's probably closer to the classic ""Smash TV"" in gameplay - which is not bad, per se, but it doesn't resemble Gauntlet much.Most of the classic gameplay elements are there, but some have been meddled with while others are  notorious by their absence. The characters play far differently now - to be completely different from the arcade original. The warror and valkyrie can't shoot, and the wizard has a bunch of spells which can be selected by confusing street-fighter-like button combinations. Also the way magic works in game is not like the original, owing to a  relic system that lets you buy types of magic for in-game gold. The enemy generators are fewer but now take excessive hits to damage. Death is more of a nuisance than he ever was, and now ALL the food is vulnerable to being shot. As for level design, the rooms are rather too large and you can avoid most of the nasties by running in circles. It's not very claustrophobic and Gauntlet-like at all. Also granted that the game likes to lock you in arena battles is where this game borrows more closely from Smash TV than Gauntlet.The inclusion of the crown is a welcome addition (like classic Gauntlet II's ""it"" creature), as are the exploding barrels. Some of the other room elements (moving blocks, lava cranks) don't add much to the game at all and just get in the way of the fun.I understand the desire to update an old game, but sometimes going crazy and introducing a bunch of cool new things that don't really work together can really imbalance the fundamental gameplay, and that's what's happened here. As it stands as a game in it's own right, it's certainly fun during multiplayer -- if you can bear being the slow old wizard while everyone grabs the gold before you do. Also the boss fights are a bit of a let down... I had to figure out how to kill the first one, and having to solve room puzzles isn't really what Gauntlet is supposed to be about. Just let me hack'n'slash them, thanks.My fear is that the game will not have much lasting appeal - save for those who love grinders. There are not so many levels and there are no infinitely generated ones like the arcade game. It's just going to become a grindfest for masteries, new character clothes and relics pretty quickly. To top it off, the character speech in-game gets really REALLY repetitive, and the score leaderboards have been plauged by cheats.It's not a bad game,... in fact it's fun for a while, and will grow on you if you give it a chance .... but it's just not a great game.

												The Gauntlet coin-op from '85 holds some fond memories for me and any modern conversion was going to have to stand up to a rigourous critique.  I'm so happy to say that the team behind this version has done a sterling job.  This is the best hack-and-slash dungeon crawler that I know of. The five characters (one character is in purchaseable DLC) have just enough different moves, which are fun in their executions to keep the game from feeling mundane.  Each character that you play with does make you feel like the hero!  You get the chance to demolish large hordes of monsters, which either clear the way or save your team mates from taking hits (or dying!).The co-op is fantastic.  As is mostly the case, the more the merrier.  Currently finding online players is no problem, there seems to be a healthy playerbase at the moment.  Let's hope it holds for the future.The graphics artists have done a good job on the in game graphics.  The characters on the select screen look a bit blocky, but doesn't effect anything important!You can alter the abilities of your character by collecting gold in the game, speed ups, different special moves, magic, etc.The devs implemented quite a big update recently which frustrated some of the community, this is the reason for such a large number of unwarranted negative reviews.  Sadly with patches that change many things in a game, some will see it as progress and some will feel alienated.  My advice if you like dungeon crawlers, don't be deterred by these opinions, you will be missing out! "

												I hesitate to select ""no"" on this, but I guess I wasn't sure what to expect before I began playing it. Needless to say, I approached with optimism.I played the hell out of Gauntlet Legends way back on my N64 with my brother and sister, as well as some of Dark Legacy. Although this game has upgrades you can buy (""relics"", kind of like constant passives) and a small amount of persistence, there's a lot that doesn't work in this iteration of a classic.-This game is short.-The bosses are easy.-Teamwork is non-existent in most PUG scenarios (and anti-team actions are even actively encouraged).-The latter fire/hell-themed dungeons are depressingly boring and empty; devoid of even minor details.-There's literally nothing to unlock as you progress except for ugly skull-obsessed cosmetics and minor passives: no new hero classes (jester?) or full reskins (like the minotaur from Legends, for instance)... not even the ability to change your colour. Maybe a skull helm though; well done, hero.-DID I MENTION THE SKULLS-ON-CLOTHES THING??My biggest gripe though: there is literally no reason this game had to strip out the numerous advancements of the formula established in Dark Legacy and Legends. Those were damned good games (but nostalgia may be strong with this one), and in their place we get a shallow experience wearing the skin and spinning the axe of Gauntlets of yesteryear. It had some potential but feels like the ball was dropped.TL;DR: It's still a decent arcadey chop-em-up, but I'm left feeling like I got (another) half-finished Kickstarter project which promised big and delivered nothing. Legends and Dark Legacy moved the formula forward, to great success. This one has moved the ball back to the 50-yard line for no conceivable reason. I can't figure out what the idea was, here. If it was intended to be most like the old Gauntlets, why don't you constantly lose health? Make up your mind!EDIT: You can get new characters... in DLC! Frabjous day!EDIT 2: I should note that some dude got mad about my review, saying ""it was supposed to be like the first Gauntlet"", as if that somehow excuses it from being boring or feeling barebones. If it could be better, then it could be rated down, period. I'll use this as an example: a bunch of my friends own it, and I have the most time in the game, by at least a dozen hours. This should probably be something a game tries to avoid.			"

												The original Gauntlet from 1985 was one of those genre defining games, that was not only one of the first really fun co-op games I ever played, but also was the predecessor to many classic dungeon crawlers we know today like Diablo, Sacred, Path of Exile, Magicka, Baldur's Gate, Dungeon Defenders or even instance dungeons of World of Warcraft. Spawning a classic sequel & several modern remakes on the consoles, Gauntlet has endured the decades, although the modern 3D versions failed to capture the feel from the originals for me. So here we are in 2014 with another remake, one making the bold claim to the title, simply 'Gauntlet', has a lot to live up to!For those familiar with the original games, first time you start you will be hit with a good dose of nostalgia. Retro sounds from the original are remixed into the modern music & effects, the logo & look all feels familiar but fresh. Great sound really sets the scene & gets you pumped! I liked the graphics look & the lighting, not super HD but clean and easy to see what is going on. Monster designs were also well done.All the trademark Gauntlet features you expect are included, ranging from the 4 well defined character classes, the puzzle like mazing map designs, lotsa gold!, keys, turkeys (& friends to steal them :p), potions, jump platforms, spawners, grim reaper & the awesome narrator telling the classics like “Warrior needs food .. badly!” & “Wizard is about to die!”. All this feels authentic & refined, honouring the originals faithfully, but there is also many new features & enhancements.Besides the obvious move into 3D, all the characters have got new moves & upgrades. Each has 3 attack types, plus ability for 2 Relics (basically power-moves), each using unique controller configurations. You can combine your attacks in different ways, & also with other classes based on the situation. Most moves have both strengths & weaknesses so the right selection (plus aiming & timing) is key to survival.


Gauntlet Fellowship (Wizard, Valkyrie, Elf & Warrior) 
A Screenshot of Gauntlet™ 
By: Aussiedroid




Basic character class are as follows:* Warrior (Thor) is great in mowing down large groups, although weaker against ranged, hard to excel at but tough overall. * Valkyrie (Thyra) is good defender with shield, also versatile & powerful offensive moves, but weak destroying spawners.* Elf (Questor) is fast & nimble able to attack from almost any range, good AoE bomb damage for groups but needs space to operate effectively.* Wizard (Merlin) is the most complex, yet highly adaptable class, with 9 spell combinations both offensive & defensive, it can be seen as over-powered but requires a lot more skill to play.(There is more to each class but it gives you a rough outline.)Adapting to the battle is fluid & fun to control though & when mastered, combat can become epic! The combat control system is simple by many modern game standards, but it’s really exceptionally balanced, intuitive & accessible – one of the strongest features of the game!Each character class independently can gain 72 Mastery Levels (XP levels) which will unlock perks & upgrades to progress further on the Hard or Unfair difficulty. Each difficulty level needs to be unlocked for each character & higher levels do offer a really intense challenge. This adds a lot of replayability as does the many in-game ‘grindy’ achievements you can earn at the end of each level that give you buffs or boosts. There are some cosmetic items you can purchase for the coins you earn in the dungeons, to change the look of your character. There aren’t very many though. Likewise, there are some (few more) Relics, but overall there isn’t a lot of selections for those wanting high level of customisation. Despite all the positive design choices, the authentic feel & just plain enjoyable co-op gameplay, Gauntlet has one fatal flaw … the lack of content, specifically the number of dungeon levels. There is 3 zones each with 4 dungeons, some multiple levels, but overall only 30ish levels in total. This includes 3 boss arenas that have no exploration. This will only take 4-5hrs to play through Solo @ Normal. The original Gauntlet I/II had 100s of levels (if memory serves), practically endless random dungeons to conquer. See how far you could survive with your buddies, but you just don't get that feeling here.Replaying levels for each character & difficulty level is fine, but with so few levels I have already started to memorise the layouts. I fear this lack of variety will make this a short lived experience with many gamers, when I could have seen it be my go-to favourite game for a while.  I really hope to see lots of new dungeons or at the least support for community workshop maps or a random generated endless mode (100s of increasingly difficulty & larger dungeons) to provide a real hardcore on-going challenge to work with your friends towards. More items, perks, customised looks would all be welcome too!Although I agree with having no chat in the game, having text chat in the lobby &/or hub would be most helpful. Currently, there is no way to communicate at all with other team mates if not in your friends’ list. Also, it is very limiting in public games when players cannot join in mid-level, you can only join when in a lobby – but who wants to wait in a lobby for that elusive 4th player to drop in, or to go back to lobby every time to find another player when someone drops mid-level? It’s not a smooth experience & comes off as rather basic, along with making it very hard to get a full team together. Matchmaking does seem to work well at least.Playing with friends is an absolute blast & with so much else done right the limited content can be ignored (for a while) along with the online multiplayer limitations I mentioned above. It's a supremely enjoyable experience. Whether you have played the originals or not, this is a solid action dungeon crawler that succeeds in recreating that uniquely 'Gauntlet’ experience.Find some friends & have some fun! Dibbs on Valkyrie .. and … No destroying the food! :)If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

												When it first came out I really enjoyed it with my friends.  A new brighter and shinier Gauntlet that wouldn't eat my paycheck in quarters? Sign me up.  Then came the Slayer Edition in August.  Instead of getting in game perks for the masteries in the game, you now get gold instead. Well isn't that useful. A now uninstalled terrible game in my inventory.			"

												It's alright, maybe worth getting on the cheap, but I think my friends and I were a little underwhelmed and lost interest quickly.We'd all played Gauntlet back in the 80's, and while this does generally stay true to the basics (characters, keys, potions etc), the level design just seems lazy and linear. Linear's not a bad thing in games, but in this instance it takes an already simple game and points you forward. With limited character attacks that soon become repetitive, and only the illusion of character skill trees/progression, it all adds up to you thinking you could spend your time better elsewhere.The levels are split into 3 sets of 4, with each of those 3 sets having it's own theme. One of those themes is mostly dark caves where the only light source is a slight glow around your character, which doesn't really add to the atmosphere, it just makes it annoying to navigate. Each themed set is also very samey.. I think they've been a bit lazy and could have not only put ALOT more levels in, but also more variety. Kinda feels like a tablet game in that respect.On the plus side, it's a bit of fun with friends, especially with the difficulty up when in rooms where you get swarmed, but unfortunately it mostly lacks any real frantic play.If you like working on Achievements, you'll find a third of the achievements are for playing very badly, another third for progress, and the last third for playing way more than you really want to.I'd give the game a neutral rating if I could, but in honesty I don't think it has enough to recommend it.. seems like development was a bit lazy, although it's not buggy or anything.. just design choices really.

YouTube™ Video: Gauntlet Review 

			Views: 169		

			Full Review of the Warner Bros. Games Newest indie title that being Gauntlet (2014) remake of a old game that was released back in 80's.		

Warner´s Attempt of reaching to your WalletOverall the game seems really fun, it offers difficulty for those who seek it and you can swap characters around when you want to get different experience or level the masteries of other characters. Few points that i do not like though; first of the camera is locked where you team is so you can't really solo around out from the screen, so all have to move in a group.The game offers somewhat depth through the Trinket system (Which you are able to buy with gold) and choose two you want to use and of course upgrade them to better tiers which grant more bonuses. The game is best played with two or three friends (With skype or similar program) the game lacks lot of aspects though, there isn't a chat inside the game, lobby systems are stone age. Also musical score is very loopy and gets annoying to hear same track over and over again.Also there is a Gamepad support for the game which is neat. If you are able to look past some of the gritty details you will have great time with this game and its not too costy anyway			"

												I wont recommend this game to someone looking for a Gauntlet game, but if it's on sale for like $10, id say go for it.On one hand, the game isn't a ""bad game,"" except for the fact that there are only three areas, which was an enormous disappointment to me when i walked forqard and back thinking i had just missed them. On the other hand, this game is not the Gauntlet you probably know and love. The whole new character design thing is lame, Gauntlet didn't need that type of gameplay.Then theres the part where there really aren't any items because you get these sort of bonus skills (which are the only thing you use gold for) which are activated by potions (which is the only thing you use potions for). Keys don't roll over after you've completed a level, and neither do potions, and theres really no reason to ever worry about having the exact number of them, you might just miss one or two doors with some gold behind them, which is relatively pointless and not even remotely exciting anyways.It feels like someone who hasn't played Gauntlet much just took the project and went ""Hey, guys, hear me out, I think people want this kind of game!"" All things considered, I didn't go through it hating my life, but I would give it a better ratying if it didn't pretend to be a Gauntlet game. And, again, why so few areas, that really bugs me. I feel like if I paid $10, or $15 i would be okay with it, but I didn't, so I'm not.			"

												I bought the 4 pack for my friends and myself so we could play this game together.  There was a lot of excitement and anticipation in all of us since we all remember playing earlier versions of Gauntlet.We played the first world and we were all enjoying it very much.  ""The warrior needs food."" ""The wizard shot the food."" It was great. But we then began playing the second world and then the third.  It was all very much the same.  There was little creativity in the theme.  I understand that level design can be challenging but each world followed the same pattern.  First stage introduces you to the world and some theme on this world.  Second stage you run from Death.  Third stage has some kind of boss fight at the end.  Fourth stage is pure boss battle.I don't regret the purchase since we have played a lot and will continue on higher difficulty but I would say wait for a sale.			"

												The""Slayer Edition"" update helped alot in making the game less monotonous... well... to a certain degree. Each character has a few weapon sets they can choose from that changes up the way you play a fair amount... the fact the game throws more enemies .. and removes the need to use potions for relics and just puts them on a cooldown is a blessing. The endless dungeon is a nice addition as well.. delving deeper and deeper each time to see how far you can get... honestly not a mode for everyone but at least its there. In this update they also added in a few ""super"" moves that uses potions instead that spices up the combat just a bit more.This update did bring some needed changes the game was missing.. but at times still feels a little bare, fifteen dollars isnt too much for a few hours of fun and i enjoyed my time with it at least.

												I still play this game even when writing a negative review. Mostly because I like the mindless monster killing. But at the same time this game has so many positive reviews that are based on content that is no longer in the game since the release of the 2.0 patch. Great things like the Hub were removed, necromancer was nerfed into the ground (more like 10 feet into the ground), and all the work that everyone did in 1.0 to unlock character masteries was rendered completely pointless now. Now everything is purchased with just base gold. All skills, abilities, trinkets blah blah all gold. AMAZING passives from masteries were just wiped from the game. 1.0 gauntlet had plenty of fun things to work for by grinding the levels. Now in 2.0 gauntlet you can do endless for an hour or two and deck out a character with whatever weapon and ability you want. I do not recommend the game in its current state. If it's on sale and you have friends who want to play I would give it a 2 hour test run and refund if you find it distasteful like I do in its current form. What annoys me the most is that even though they patched out all this stuff this game still has a large majority of positive reviews... All of which are obsolete since 2.0's release.EDIT: Forgot to add that they completely removed the ""unfair"" difficulty which to some was the only real challenge in the game.			"

												When just about every other version of this game is more ambitious and better thought out, you've got a problem on your hands.More Diablo 3-lite than a proper Gauntlet game. Even with friends this isn't worth it. I had hopes to capture the magic of the Dreamcast version but alas... It's basically a glorified demo for the engine that should be powering the full game.Critical to know this review is about the last update, the Slayer Edition.			"

												Where can I really start? With the promise of the classic Gauntlet experience, as a remastered reboot, I came in with glinting eyes and an eager smile. The first levels I greatly enjoyed, especially playing in a group of 4. Unfortunately, I started to notice something sinister as the time went by. The level design, the enemy design, the bosses....it's all so lazy! the entire game follows the same formula. There is almost no deviation from this, and the exploration factor is zero. Using keys in smart manner is absent, the enemy variety is disappointly scarce, featuring what basically amounts to recolors of the same enemies: melee gore fodder, slightly tougher ranged casters, and brutes, along with minibosses. The lich I found to be pretty interesting, featuring a couple of neat attacks. Beyond that, the game had a gross blandness you normally need unsalted crackers to experience. Class design is horribly tilted, with Valkyrie having the ability to block, Warrior being a warrior, Elf being useless (seriously, his attacks cannot damage spawners--who made this decision?), and the ripoff Magicka Wizard (why is the wizard given 9 spells, in a hack and slash game, and then make only 2 of them do meaningful damage?). The game falls flat at a meager 3-4 hours, with no real incentive to keep replaying. The new relic system replaced the potions that we remember. These relics cost gold, and use a potion to cast. They range from making enemies not attack you to making enemies not attack you. And then, as a slap to the face, you can't gain any potions to use during boss encounters. Wtf? Why give us this illusion of progression? And the actual gear and DLC incentives are cosmetic only. Dropping 36,000 gold nets you a different colored cape! nice! There is a mastery system, but to get noticeable effects, you have to grind so hard (dying gives you bonuses to reduce your ability to die.... you're rewarded for bad play). All in all, this isn't the reboot we wanted, you're better off looking for a PS2 copy of Gauntlet Dark Legacy or even the original Gauntlet (stay away from that horrible mistake God of Wa-- I mean, Seven Sorrows). To its credit, it is not the worst thing I've ever played. It works well, isn't buggy, the netcode felt sound, and you might even get some giggles out of a 4 player co-op session. This game is just bland and felt lazy and uninspired the whole way through. But at least you can still shoot the food.			"

												If you played and loved Gaunlet on GameCube, do not expect the same type of game here. This game is much more challenging and expect failure at first on higher difficulties.  This game is designed with team coordination in mind.  At Normal or Easy difficulties, the game is easy once you get the hang of it.  But at Hard and Unfair, it becomes very challenging to play solo or with an uncoordinated team members since you have limited lives.  This game is best played with friends or other people.  Though it is doable even on Unfair difficulty, I would not recommend playing this game solo.There seems to be some imbalance amongst the classes.  Archer and Wizard are arguable the most reliable classes on Hard or Unfair difficulty due to their ability to kite.  Valkyrie would be a close third with his overpowered spammable lance thrust and shield block.  And Warrior is definitely the runt of the liter due to damage and survivability issues.Warrior offers the least overall damage and the most difficulty avoiding damage while in combat.  His weak attack is appalling and his strong attack is comparable to the Valkyrie's while being slower and having a smaller area of effect.  The only redeemable quality about the Warrior is he unlocks a low-hp regeneration perk and he has the simplest control design. Wizard has the most complex kit design requiring 2 button combinations between 3 buttons to determine your spell cast.  (XX, XY, XA, YY, YX, YA, AA, AX, AY).  They offer a lot of utility, have comparable sustained damage and a decent kit to kite once you get used to switching spells on the fly, and unlock a shield that blocks damage after 16-20 seconds of being untouched.  Wizard has essentially no burst but plenty of ways to dish out damage over time.Archer is in my opinion the easiest to use with high burst damage from his bombs, low sustained damage, and a nice roll dodge; just imagine playing a MMO and mobbing monsters.  Valkyrie like I mentioned earlier has a ridiculously power strong attack which offers high amounts of sustained damage; the tradeoff is he's vulnerable to getting hit if he just spams the attack.  The Valkyrie unlocks a powerful perk which makes him very durable at low health.The leveling and gold system definitely seems a bit bland.  You can buy relics which are temporary perks you can use with potions and new gear but the gear is purely aesthetic.  I do find it interesting that you ""level up"" by unlocking achievements (eg. killing 10,000 monsters, breaking 500 props, etc) which will give you various benefits.  It seems kind of silly that you unlock some perks for dying.  Some perks have 3 tiers, Bronze Silver and Gold.  Each is just a slight upgrade over the previous perk.  The time it takes max out all the perks is at least 30 hours on a single class. I would estimate the average playtime will be around 20-40 hours for a person who enjoys this game.  After 40 hours of personal gametime, I would say the game is definitely better played with friends.  Though public rooms are available, the experience is nowhere as fun.  My biggest concern is that the game will lose replayability once you become better at it and master every level on Unfair difficulty since there is a limited amount of actual content (you can speed run through everything on Easy in probably 2 to 4 hours).Overall, I would give this game a 7 out of 10.  I would say the game's good, but not great, and very fun while chatting with friends over voip.			"

												Game is basically ruined.  They removed the unfair difficulty setting which was where 99% of the fun was.  They also removed the leveling system that improves your character after defeating x amount of different types of monsters.   I spent 97 hours according to Steam improving my characters and just had that returned to me as a paltry amount of in-game (read: completely worthless) gold.Do NOT recommend.			"

												Gauntlet, not a game for the faint of heart...But in reality you just need to have two things to play and enjoy this game - patience (I can't stress this enough) and a love for the classic 'Dungeon Crawler' genre, which has paved the way to many great games in this modern age.However - you will need to understand what this game is NOT. It is not item / equipment intensive (no matter how much some players will complain), nor is it a game that currently contains plenty of end-game material - and NO, this does not give you the right to complain endlessly when you realise this. If you are looking for these sorts of games - then you can play a game like Diablo or Path of Exile, because chances are; you will not be able to enjoy this game or understand the uniqueness that it presents.So what sort of people would enjoy this game? 'Completionists', classic gamers, players who have a group of friends and want to enjoy a co-operative game together (re-experience the 'old days' where gamers would sit together and play on a console), players that have played the Gauntlet gameline since the very beginning, fans of 'Dungeon Crawlers' - the list goes on and on. It is a game that immerses itself within local competitiveness (just like those times when you would battle your friends in Super Smash Brothers) as well as giving you a darker theme (for the glory of adult themes).Truely a game that can unleash a multitude of emotions.Do I recommend this game? YesShould you buy this game? YesWould you enjoy this game more with friends? Hell Yes!So leave your ego at the door, sit yourself down and play some Gauntlet.(If you were looking for gameplay and mechanics information - go here http://gauntlet.gamepedia.com/Gauntlet_Wiki)--- EDIT --- 5/11/14I have had a few messages saying that 'if I find this version of Gauntlet enjoyable - I must not have played any of the original games'. I laugh at these messages - and to refrain from any further pointless accusations, please refer to the below.I have wasted many a 'gold coin' playing this game back in the arcades in the 80s (the original and Gauntlet 2) and I am currently arranging shipping to have the one of the original Gauntlet Arcade Machines - delivered to my house.I have then spent many many hours playing the Nintendo version as well.I have played the game on the Atari Lynx (Third Encounter).I rampaged my way through number 3 - on the Commodore 64.Legends, Seven Sorrows, Dark Legacy on Playstation 1 and 2 respectively.

 Positive + A good graphical upgrade/re-creation of the original Gauntlet, with unique designs and animations for each character, as well as voice-acting for each of them+ The integration of 4 player co-op makes the journey through the game much more entertaining; distinctive playable roles allow players to tailor to their own playstyles and give the game some variety in the gameplay department. Negative - The hack-and-slash gameplay becomes extremely repetitive, very quickly; even more so with the re-used level design. With a poor upgrade/shop system (both relics and passive bonuses require excessive grinding and offer negligible improvements to your character for the most part), the gameplay can be difficult to stomach the further you progress- The fixed camera and limited perspective make losing your character on-screen (mainly in co-op) and getting hit at the edge of the screen when you can’t see an enemy a more frequent occurrence than they should be. Having to effectively remove the HUD in order to see your character at the bottom of the screen should not be a prerequisite- With a 5 ½ hour campaign (Hard difficulty in co-op) encompassing 12 short chapters, combined with little to no story at all, and topped off with unimaginative boss fights... there is zero replayability here outside of a forgettable arena mode. Verdict “An immensely mediocre dungeon-crawling experience, Gauntlet can be enjoyable in limited dosages with friends. However the monotony of the gameplay completely drags it down, making it unbearably boring for the majority of it. The game does have an arcade feeling to it, but sadly this can’t overthrow the limited gameplay on offer.” 6/10 TJBs  "

												Gauntlet is a top down dungeon crawler game that was developed by Arrowhead Game Studios and published by Warner Brothers. Gauntlet was released in September 2014, and was later ported to the PS4 in August 2015. You take the role of one of four classes of heroes. Each hero has their own unique play style and special abilities. Personally I played the game primarily as the archer, because I just find the range classes more fun to play, but there are warriors and mages included here too. Your character has a regular attack, a special attack and a more situational ability too. The special attack and special ability all change when you upgrade your weapon. You may find that certain weapons/abilities are more suited for certain levels as well. The gameplay reminded me very much of a Diablo style, in that I was actually able to just hold down my left mouse button which is the regular attack and not let go as enemies just surround you most of the time - your other abilities come with a cooldown so you need to time these for when they are going to be most beneficial.  The aim on each of the levels is to reach the end of the stage - there aren't any side quests on any of the stages, it’s purely a dungeon crawler. Throughout each of the levels, you will come across piles and piles of gold. The gold is used in the lobby screen before each level to purchase upgrades, whether it be new weapons, new skins for your character, new relics or new special abilities, and they cost a lot of gold too, so it's a good thing you will come across abundance amount of gold in this game. The graphics in Gauntlet are OK - they aren't anything special, but they certainly aren't bad by any stretch. The lighting on the darker levels is something I found to be really well done though - you get a sense of being really deep underground and with the helpless lost feeling as you are crawling through empty dark hallways and caves. The lava levels are really pretty too and some of my favourite stages in the game are because of their aesthetic. Gauntlet is fully voice acted, each of the four heroes has their own individual voice actor; all be it the elf archer can wear very thin on you at times. The narration is done very well too, as it guides you through the plentiful stages on what is happening and keeping the plot going. We see three levels of difficulty in Gauntlet, Easy, Medium and Hard - easy mode is VERY easy. You should only be playing that if you want to blast through the game for special achievements or just for completion sake. You could also be playing easy if you want to learn a new class. The downside to playing on easy is that you get less gold from drops though - so it is kind of swings and round-a-bouts. The medium difficulty is where you should be spending a lot of your time - this is where you will get a regular amount of gold, and the enemies will be sufficiently challenging. Hard mode should only really be played if you are planning on playing with friends who have a lot of experience in the game, or you have built up a ton of upgrades allowing you to min/max your way through the stages as efficiently as possible. I touched on playing friends briefly above, Gauntlet is able to be played in a four player co-op environment, each player takes control of one of the four classes and you play the game as a team. The enemies are all scaled up depending on how many people are playing - most people will say that co-op is the only mode you should be playing Gauntlet - whilst I may say that will be true, it is certainly not wise to be playing with PUGs (pick up groups from quick queues). If you do want the multiplayer experience in Gauntlet, then play it with friends and get on Skype together, it will make the entire experience so much more fun and will definitely make it a better play through as opposed to playing with randommers or on your own. Each of the numerous levels in Gauntlet all have a main dungeon design to them, but a lot of the stages are also procedurally generated, allowing for some stages leaving you lost in the deep depths of caves and forcing you to explore around in order to find the exits. Others which are more objective based, whether it be lowering a gate, or finding keys to open a door, will be more or less the same for each play through. Some of the better levels I found are when you have to outrun ""Death"", you are not able to kill ""Death"", you just have to run as far away from him as possible before he catches you up.  As I said above, there is so much gold to be looted in this game, you can go off the beaten path on the hunt for more of it if you desire, with secret rooms and areas just overflowing with gold all to be found. On top of the gold, there are a few other items you can pick up, Health potions, but these come in the form of dinner on the plate - a nice little feature is that you can actually destroy this meat by hitting it, so that makes the close range combat a little bit more on edge, if you know you are going to need to heal up soon after a fight; it also gives the range characters a need to be a little more precise when it comes to where they aim their attacks.  The final item is a potion, this potion is used as a sort of mana crystal for using your special abilities, they can be few and far between so you should try and pick your moments wisely for when you want to use it. A full run through Gauntlet on medium mode took me just over three hours - even when you finish the whole run, you can still go back and replay previous levels to farm more gold allowing you to purchase more upgrades. I still plan on playing through the game again on hard mode and also playing it with friends. This will easily mean Gauntlet will have a pretty hefty amount of hours/content on offer. I would say you can easily push about twenty hours from it, and that's just with playing with one character! If you want to get fully immersed in this game, you can be at it for weeks and still not experience it all. Even though the graphics are nothing spectacular, I wasn't able to play Gauntlet on 4k resolutions with max graphics as the frame rate drops down to the region of 30FPS, which for me is unplayable - but I didn't find the graphical differences between 1080 and 4K to be anything massive so I wasn't too bothered about that.  Gauntlet can be played with a controller, and to be honest, I think it is designed with a controller in mind, given the amount of abilities and keys you need to be pressing; it makes perfect sense to plug in your controller and sit back to play this game. I also played Gauntlet with the Steam controller, and was able to map all of the buttons perfectly to how I wanted to play. I am going to strongly recommend Gauntlet, the price tag of £14,99 is reasonable but the amount of content and gameplay quality really out way the price. The game has been known to go as low as £3 on Steam and other sites, so if you see it on sale anywhere, do not hesitate to pick it up. You will get so much game time out of this game and it is something that all RPG fans should be playing.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

There aren't many skills/spells to get and honestly once you've beat the game, there really isn't much to do after that.If you are looking for the old school gauntlet feel go for it. If you want something like Legacy save your money.			"

												I love this game, though I was a bit disappointed in a few things, sadly. Lets start on the negative first.The world variety is lacking in this one, I don't mean to say that this game should be something like Dark Legacy, but that is what compensated for the previous  game lacked. The only theme here is caves, mines, and Hell... it kinda starts to all blend in together, caves, caves, caves, lots of caves. Something that kinda baffles me is how Colosseum has ice spawners, poison spawners, yet no ice worlds or jungle levels?The boss battles didn't feel as grand and epic though, the bosses having invuln frames felt like they're there to drag out the battle, not increase difficulty, don't get me wrong, I like a challenging monster to fight, but know the difference between challenging and tedious.Oh also, its Gauntlet, find someone to play with cos this can be played single player, but this is a multiplayer game, always has been, always will!	The positive!The heroes are different! Anyone who knows the previous Gauntlet games would take note of this first! Though I adore Dark Legacy with a passion <3 something that was troublesome was that all the classes were the same, they all just start with different stats though, that isn't the case in this game! The warrior is all about throwing his weight around, charging right into the hordes you fight! The elf has the enemies running in circles to catch him! The Valkyrie is able to dash into a horde and defend teammates! The wizard, oh my god the wizard! I never had any idea how to differentiate a wizard class in a game like this! They used a simplified version of Magicka's spells, but still something neat! The enemies are something too! I love how they even got the enemies to differ from each other as well <3 I am actually very glad that ArrowHead did that! The mummies having their own mages, bloated mummies! Skeleton archers! Juggernauts, spider queens, the list goes on! 	Final thoughtsI would buy this game 3 times over if it had the level variety of Dark Legacy, yet managed to have all classes different from each other! To this day, to whoever reads this maybe many years down the line, I am awaiting a game that meets that description, a game that is as grand adventure as Dark Legacy, yet provide enough variety throughout! I don't see such a game like that coming out soon, maybe not even within my lifetime. I await the day I can go on a quest to slay a fearsome yeti, enter the nightmare realm, deal with a wizard summoner who is obsessed with the desecrated temple!The game is great, it gives plenty new but doesn't change too much, keeps the old but does something new! I want more of this! I'll close this at this point now, a great game to play with friends if you like fighting massive hoards of enemies, I eagerly await the next installment!			"

												I have yet to purchase a game with such excitement and high standards to meet my expectations, until I heard they were ""updating"" the old Gauntlet series. To put it short and simply this game did not deliver what a veteran Gauntlet player would've liked. Albiet, I was looking forward to something similar to Gauntlet: Dark Legacy and maybe that was my mistake.Positives: -Game runs well-Voice lines are nice touch-Artifacts (or whatever they're called) were new and interesting-Reminded me of playing the original Gauntlet full through-Sound effects of the elites sound exactly like the soundbit from Dark Legacy elites which made me nostalgia a bit-I felt in full control with both the controller and mouse bindings except for one classAnd now for the painfully long negatives:-Firstly when I saw the opening I saw three areas to go to and figured it would expand maybe once completed, in a fashion to the Gauntlet spawn point would move you lower into the Gauntlet or take you elsewhere, but it didn't. Three very short areas.-The areas themselves weren't something to be impressed over. A castle (which did look nice to be fair), a cave which is a boring excuse for no effort, literally two levels are just dark and you can only see your character with a bubble effect, and a cultist lair (in hell?). My 5.7 hours on record was all it took to beat it by myself. -The sound would ALWAYS glitch out and become ear-wrenchingly bad anytime a spawner or a mass of enemies would enter your line of sight. Seriously? Half the game was comprised about that, this shouldn't be an issue.-Monster spawners were a serious pain to get rid of at times. The only thing that ""progressively"" made the game harder was that some enemies would ""enchant"" the spawners so enemies came about twice as fast and playing by yourself make this much more tedious than need be.-Wizard customization for keyboard was designed by an idiot. Left-click, shift, right-click to switch to ice. There's about ten numbered keys on top or a nice scroll weel on the damn mouse that were unused for pete's sake.-The enemies were so uninspiring. What happened to the countless crazy monsers that were in Dark Legacy like treants, lizardpeople, mummified egyptians, spider-people, minotaurs, AND SO MUCH MORE?-Money was worthless in this game. Money is meant to upgrade yourself to do more damage or survive longer, but no instead you complete ""achievements"" to unlock upgrades to yourself (such as more healing on food and more damage to enemies) while gold is meant to buy these somewhat pointless trinkets that cost WAY TOO MUCH TO UPGRADE. The items to ""upgrade"" your character such as armor and weapons are just different looking. Nothing new added other than asthetic. That is some cheap crap right there, I'm sorry.-THE STORY IS UNBELIEVEABLY POOR! I'm sorry but I had no idea who any of the ""bosses"" I fought were and what the lore was. Who was this guy who wanted the three shards? Why did these guys have them? Who is Anul'Rekkan (or whatever their names were) and why is his sword so underwhelming in the final fight?-Bosses weren't fun and were not even challenging. First try on them all and the final fight was a laugh. Be an archer and just ricght-click aim every enemy until he's done spawning them. Yawn.-Also Classic verison makes you want to vomit with how bad it made the game look. Way too confusing to tell anything especially with the cultists' lair.I really wanted to like this game, I did. I loved it in the beginning and was 100% stoked for the rest of the game. Yet, as soon as I got near the end I realized that I really didn't want the game to end like this. I expected mroe from Warner Bros. being on the titlecards. The only thing that would make this redeeming would be if free expansions came out to give you more areas to explore and items that actually were useful. tl;dr 3/10 You quickly wish you were playing the original Guantlet more than anything.EDIT: Since I intially put this review out (admittedly a bit hurried before I went to work) I have played more into the game, such as increased difficulty, more class expansions and more single-player and multi-player experience. As before I'll just start with what I noticed this time around.I've got to say playing on a higher difficulty with friends you actually know is phenominal. True most of the fun came from how stupid we play, but nonetheless the credit is to how the game handled us. The Valkyrie literally just runs in and does damage to everything in pair with the Warrior to peel off damage from the Elf and Wizard. The combos were SO much more amazing when your team barely makes it out of a room alive and are rewarded with some gold and much needed food.My friends I feel had more fun than me (due to my own reasons listed above) yet with the few bug fixes that came out today I really noticed the change, especially the chrashing on the Wizard class. No more time wasted on having to wait for someone to rejoin in and start the dungeon again. Game moves smoother and feels much more like an arcade with friends, so I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you get a friend or two to purchase this game. For the $20, I feel like it's a decent price. I'd like to say maybe $15 just because of the lack of replayablity after your beat it and (understandably) yet to see changes to asthetic changes. I feel I was a bit more harsh in my initial review so that's mainly why I came here to adjust it. I still have some audio issues with spawners, but maybe just because I'm hosting the game? I'm not sure really. If you're old enough to have played the old arcade or NES version of this game I'm sure you would feel right at home playing through. If you're expecting it to be Dark Legacy, don't remotely get your hopes up, because it's a completely different set of developers and they've chosen to go back to the game's old roots, which I rather enjoy more when playing with friends. Altogether I say this game still has a ways to go to get me to change my mind of purchasing this game, but I do like it for what it is. Here's hoping to adding new levels in soon.6/10- IGN ""It was okay.""			"

												I was pleasantly surprised by this game. My buddy picked me up a copy to play with him during the Steam sale, so I gave it a try for him. We preceded to beat the 3 areas straight through with no breaks. I have never played a Gauntlet game before and even had to learn the controls at first. I still couldn’t put it down and truly enjoyed my time with the game. It has high replayability, excellent co-op, and great level design. However, the glaring negative is the lack of content. There are 15 areas that can be beaten around 4 hours. It doesn’t mean after that you will never touch the game again, for the levels can played over and over again yet still give the same excitement. If you want a great co-op game online and offline, this is the game for you. I now consider myself a fan of the Gauntlet series and this is my first entry played. So you other noobies out there, give it a try if you are on the fence! You might be pleasantly surprised like I was =) "

												Pros: The game looks and runs great. I haven't seen any bugs or had any crashes yet. It is very fun for the first 3-4 hours. CONS: It is extremely repetative.The ""puzzles"" are easy and you don't have to think twice about using a key. The characters AREN'T balanced. The melee characters need a complete rehaul.  You can literately get stun locked when you use warrior. If you get hit once as the warrior, there is no way to escape and you can bounce around and get hit 2 3 sometimes 4 times and die. 90% of the time you are running away, kiting as a melee character. THERE IS NO END GAME. You work towards your relic, which is the only thing you can customize besides cosmetics. BUT GUESS WHAT? You can't actually use your relic during the boss fights!! ALSO you can only use it 2 MAYBE 3 times during a dungeon with the way they have it set up. All in all, it is a fun game for a couple of hours. Maybe a weekend fling. But there is absolutely no more then 7 maybe 8 hours of fun. $20 is too much. 6/10			"

												Very disappointed with this version of the classic. I only played it about 8 hours and I feel that there is nothing more to gain from it. I may be wrong but I cant see what it has to offer me now... except maybe long farming run to get the character slightly more powerful... and then what ? Run the same (few) dungeons again ? for what ?The original was a brutal, random, hectic kill fest that challenged you at every turn. This one is not very challenging, even soloing the dungeons (at least with the wizard).The graphics are good and the engine is fluid enough to have pleasant experience. The game camera can be frustrating sometimes, but its nothing major.Its a shame cause it could had been great, but there is simply no depth to it and very little incentive to keep playing it. At least this is the feeling it left me with, even though I really wanted to like it and was willing to spend more time in it.I won this game in a giveaway and was super ecstatic about it, so I cant complain about money spent, but I would have a hard time recommending it.

I know my name... I don't need to see it 24/7-Do a brightly colored ring around our characters for increased visibility. Names are dumb.-Camera again... gives me motion sickess, way too zoomed, moves too slow... wtf 0/10-Less enemies on screen at once, camera zoom... wtf-Necromancer class went from fun to unplayable-Menu music / navigation are both crap compared to 1.0-Dampening / Removal of monster sounds in combat-Feels like a complete downgraded version of the game, not an update / improvement.They should of allow us to have two options when playing it.one with all the normal stuff we had in it before and slayer edition.I would not pick this game up at all. till they fix all the issue slayer edition has made.

												Gauntlet doesnt have drop in play.  The only way to get 4 people in one session is to sit in the lobby, but most leave after waiting a few secs making it very difficult to get a full party.  In this version like the arcade there can only be one wizard or one fighter, that means often a player will leave if they cant be the class they want making it more difficult to form a full party.  Its hard to make a full party now, let alone when it gets old noone will play it meaning that most people will be left playing it alone since without drop in it would mean sitting in the lobby for ages hoping even one person had the game installed to join.  If someone quits mid level or if you have 4 good people but one quit and need 4, then you have to quit the match and start over, ugh....  Drop in during gameplay was the first question asked in the forum when it was posted on steam, no wonder it never got an answer :PThe camera is real weird in the game, it does not focus on your character, instead it shares the screen with all 4 players like an old game where people share the tv.  This means often people can stuck in corners or cant move at all because of a wall.  The game works, the devs are active in the community.  So there is that...Rating:  7/10  Value:  $4.99			"

												This review is about the update, not the game itself. And boy is this update bad.Having played the original release to excess and already having trouble with it being far less than Dark Legacy or even Sorrows I was looking forward to this update to finally fix things.So what did (not) they do: They took all incentive to grind achievements. They yield money now instead of the very helpful skill and damange increasesThey updated the engine to a somewhat more 3D-experienceThey added skills to weapons and trinkets, which could've been interesting if they didn't suck so hard They took away the ""select your entrance"" with a somewhat linear level tree selectionGot massively bored and turned the game off after three levelsAnd you worked months on that? What did you do after week 2? Laugh at the gamers hoping you would actually work on the game? I liked your ""vision"" of the game better in the oringal release than in this update feeling like an Early Access.It's sad. Still, if you have not played the game before, it's a decent, if somewhat limited, Gauntlet experience. It was better before the update. WAY better.Just my opinion.All the Best(formatting edit)			"

												The gameplay, visuals, and skills were very neat. The game deffinetly had the old gauntlet feel to it. That being said, this game was so short... I think it took about 4 hours to beat the game, it seems the makers of this game literally pulled a Diablo on us and gave a short game with the ability to play it over and over again to unlock ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items. Gauntlet Dark Legends which was presented on the Playstation 2 had more playable hours then this and the memory space available was tiny. TL;DR This game is not worth your 20 dollars, it is another fine example for how companies overcharge for games that are not yet finished yet or are half♥♥♥♥♥representations of what they are meant to be.

This game however feels more like Torchlight or a Diablo knock-off than the Gauntlet of old.  Good action, amusing dialogue, and co-op if you're into that makes for a good dungeon crawler and time killer.  Pro:  Dialogue, action.Con:  Doesn't feel like the Gauntlet games of old.			"

I took a small break from the game,came back to jump in for some quick and fun action only to discover thehuge changes to the game which in my opinion are absolutely terrible.  I played Merlin exclusively had a mastery level of 64/70.I can't even  imagine why the devs would change Merlin's skills from Ice, Fire, Arcane to Ice, Arcane, ???and nothing else?  Why no more Fire?  seem really stupid andupsetting.  I will take an extended break from this game in hopethat something is done when the devs read all the negitive feedbackabout these changes and hopefully revert some of them.  no interest in learning the new skill set.  seems boring.  peace out.

												The original release of this game was tedious but incredibly fun.  Logged 60 hours of game plan with little hesitation.  I took a break from the game and recently tried to play it again.  At some point the developers released a slayer edition which renders the game unplayable for me.  The controls are laggy and inconsistant depsite playing it on the same machine as before, which exceeds the recommended system requirements.  If there was a way to play the original version, I would recommend that game, but not in its current iteration.			"

I don't know what these people were smoking to think this 2.0 massive change was a good idea. It's awful. Just awful. Not at all like the game was before this 'patch.' You can read all about the complaints from other people. I will say if you want to play something similar to the old arcade version of Gauntlet....this is not that game. It's just terrible mainly because they had it right before this 2.0 change.Oh the camera angles are super screwed up now too...wow...no idea what these people were thinking.

												Don't bother. Arrowhead really screwed the pooch with this one. The original version of this game had its flaws, but was still a fairly fun dungeon crawl. Then they released the Slayer Edition, which was supposed to fix all the problems... but in reality, they just dumbed it down to the point where a goldfish could play it. Well, that is if they hadn't screwed up the smooth controls and combat to some herky-jerky tangled mess. All the progression from the original version? Gone. Now you just get gold. Wow, so original guys!Between this and the release + abandonment of Helldivers on PC, Arrowhead is no longer a developer I will be supporting. They got a whiff of that EZ console cash and sold out the PC gamers responsible for their initial success, and that's something I simply won't forgive, nor forget.			"

												Sadly dissapointing.  Gauntlet has evolved with every game with new leveling systems, character customization, and even unique hidden characters, but this is just a crash from all of that.It's a dungeon crawler with little to no player/class customization, No shop, no leveling, no, uniqueness, no hidden classes or special chalolenges that made all the predecessors so amazingly addictive.  Fair graphics, good voice acting, fair game controls, and decent music.  5 Hours to beat, more fun with others, but that's it.  Just has a sprinkle, a flavor of Gauntlet.

												Before you buy this game keep in mind: THIS IS CLASSIC ARCADE STYLE GAUNTLET. THIS IS NOTHING LIKE GAUNTLET DARK LEGACY.I have mixed feelings about this one. I am having a lot of fun with it playing it with friends, but I feel like they went so far trying to stay true to the Gauntlet formula that it feels downright unfair and frustrating at times. The biggest problem I have is Death, who pops up every other level, and kills you instantly if you get caught. There is no way to kill him, all you can do is run. I almost rage quit because he popped up directly over a turkey leg and killed me right as I ate it. So not only did I lose a life, but the food was wasted as well.Having said that, the combat is fun and really thrilling. It feels just like playing gauntlet in the arcade. Because you know you have limited lives and no auto health regen, there is a real feeling of failure and loss if you all die which makes it way more tense than a lot of ""modern"" games where you know ""Meh, if i die I just respawn and keep going"".Overall it is a decent enough time to recommend. If you are on the fence, wait till it goes on sale. It's definitely worth 10$, especially if you can find a couple friends to play with.			"

												While this game is fun for a quick hack n slashing dungeon crawl it is very disappointing considering the Gauntlet series. It gets boring and repetitive about an hour or two through and there is little reason to replay it or even for some to bother to finish.Little to no player customization, no leveling up or experience, very lackluster shop and items are relatively not worth their somewhat obscene prices. In addition it got tedious when even the players die in about two to four hits, even from a scratch from a weak minion. Several times the deaths have mostly occurred been because a singular minion in the masses lands a strike.Although the controls we're simple and easy enough to learn the characters also seemed very lackluster (if not uninspired) and could have been much more. Heck even Gauntlet Seven Sorrows seemed to have more impressive characters.  I love some of the skills but they gold old really fast and several became to tedious to keep playing. Wizard's spells became difficult to manage in tight situations and the Elf could never fire enough charged arrows against certain mobs of enemies. Both situations just force you to run around in circles.The graphics are the games are fair, the music is good, and the game itself is not terribly difficult but this game fails to keep people playing very long and has little to offer to the Gauntlet series.

												Originally this game a a great source of funa dn entertainment with friends. The ability to upgrade and customize your character through progression was a great function.

With the removal of any skill or ability progression, it's now just a dungeon slog with no reward.			"

												Honestly, it's not like it's -completely- terrible, but it completely missed the mark on what made the Gauntlet games fun, regardless of whether you're referring to the classic arcade games or the 3D ones of the Playstation 1/2 era,Rather than build on what the previous Gauntlet games had been like they decided to take more inspiration from the old arcade/nes games and it really just feels like a giant step backward. Gauntlet Legends had the players climbing an active volcanoe, exploring a disease-ridden town, and fighting through a huge, corrupt cathedral, among other locations. This just has you exploring dark cave corridors ending in square rooms, over and over and over. Sometimes instead of cave corridors it's generic, grey, uninspired dungeon corridors that still end in square rooms. Sometimes the caves have spiders, or maybe even a single demon, who are some of the only enemies who break the monotony of killing hundreds of generic dead-in-one-hit mooks.That in mind, the idea of blasting hundreds of minions is pretty standard for gauntlet games, but this game seemed to miss everything that made them fun. The original Gauntlet/Gauntlet 2 had you moving at practically a breakneck speed as you stormed through the dungeon killing minions and spawners, hoping to find your next food before your health bar ticked away. In this game, a single spawner will easily take 15-30 seconds of just sitting there wailing on it until it finally dies, spawning wave after wave of enemies the whole time which makes it just take even longer, and it's downright boring whenever you have to fight through a room with more than one spawner in it.Even the bosses manage to be completely and utterly bland. To again use it as an example, Gauntlet Legends bosses all had somewhere around 4-5 attacks, if not more, and it sported 6 boss fights, with even more added in the Playstation 2 remake. This game only has 3 bosses, two of which only seemed to have a single attack (the other only had two), and one of them is basically just fighting wave after wave of regular enemies and then the boss using his -only- attack in-between waves when he was vulnerable.Even though it has barely 8 hours of content(for all I know even less, a chunk of that time was probably the game idling for trading cards) you feel like you've experienced 90% of the game after the 2-hour mark, everything past that is just tedius, and there's plenty of far better twin-stick shooters out there for the same price or cheaper.

												I was one of the people that loved the game until the Slayer update came out. There are a lot of people that shared my sentiment, and therefore my review will be written with hardcore gamers in mind.They removed the unfair/nightmare difficulty from the main campaign. This is indeed stupid to us Unfair players who would challenge ourselves on levels over and over, raging until we won, or if you were like me, soloing without using any relics whatsoever. They killed the fun there, I agree. But you know what? The main campaign is like.. 5% of the game now.I played NoX way before I played Gauntlet. In NoX, there was a main campaign which, like Gauntlet, was underwhelming. Then there was a ""Quest mode"", that started you off at a very low difficulty that kept gradually increasing until the game was damn near impossible. In this mode, every 5 maps you complete would open a teleport for that character so you can skip to that level in the future so you don't have to grind out the easy♥♥♥♥♥♥again. That is exactly what Gauntlet's Endless Mode is. The first teleport floor you find is on level 19.If you missed Unfair mode, missing things like gilded hams and turkeys, oh well, it's not in the campaign. Make it to floor 37 on Endless and now you're in Unfair mode again, except the maps are random and can be absolutely brutal. They darken the maps, make ghosts black instead of white to hide in the shade, will spawn four obelisks and two necromancers on you (this happened to me in a ♥♥♥♥ing Reaper map), and best of all, relics don't feel game-breaking anymore. You don't have to feel like a scrub for using them!The current version of Gauntlet is the best version by far. It is absolutely worth picking this game up with a few friends.			"

												It's fun for a while, I played with a group of friends which made it all the better. I even tried grinding my character up so I could beat the harder game modes. But just like Diablo 3 I got very bored of the grind and quit. There is so little incentive to continue playing the game! Your gold is spent buying new armor that awards you nothing but a different look and no new stats.Game is easily beat on normal, but to beat it on the hardest mode you have to kill so thousands of the same mobs, forcing you to play the easier level difficulties over and over just get a damage increase versus that monster. Which is where the grind sets in. With 35 hours play time, I played more than I should have as I was having fun and got sucked into the grind for a little while. But reallity hit and I gave it up after I noticed there was no reward for completing the game on a harder mode.Also they should have an option to only view the friends list leaderboards, because the world leaderboards are not even fun to look at due to the cheaters.

												One of the best coop play experiences I've ever had.  This is a fantastically fun and solid game, which will only benefit from even more content in no-doubt future DLC.  The best part is even though you have to work together and coordinate, you're still trying to backstab one another to steal gold, steal crowns, shoot food, or screenkill someone to Death - all to get a high score and more bonus golds or level up points for your greedy self.It seems bizarre to say so, but I think the closest thing I can compare this game to is Super Mario 3D world - which has a similar 'steal the crown' mechanic and passive-aggressive points-battles.  Like Super Mario 3D world, it also has fantastic coop and solidly executed core gameplay that will keep me coming back as they add new levels in expansions.Everyone on my friends list should own a copy of this game so they can invite me to play it at any time, which I generally will.  Just know that the crown is mine.  MINE.  *Shoots a pot roast and roars all kingly like.*			"

												Here I am giving a Gauntlet game a negative review. Honestly, I never saw this coming.Back when the game was first released (pre-ordered it about half a year in advance, it was a friggin Gauntlet reboot after all), a lot of people said it didn't really have the feel of the original games, primarily in part due to not having an infinite randomly generated dungeon. I was one of the people who actually liked it though and found it to be greatly enjoyable.Now they've released version 2.0, the 'Slayer' edition. However, slayer in this sense seems to be referring to the enemies rather than the players. Sure, they've added in Endless mode and given us the procedurally generated levels that made the original games so great, but they've changed virtually everything else in the game too. Including beefing up the enemies to the point that a large group of them is complete overkill on a solo player. On easy difficulty. You may be thinking ""it's a 4-player co-op game, why are you trying to solo it?"", and if you are then my question to you is, at which point in any of the original Gauntlet games did you absolutely need more than 1 player to get anywhere? I'm not really sure what compelled the developers to make such changes, but I'm definitely not the only one who finds the update to not be worth it. Maybe they're trying to appeal to the 'hardcore' crowd, maybe someone cleared the (now non-existant) Unfair difficulty and declared it to be easy. Who knows.I really want to give this game a positive review, and if they revert/alter a lot of these changes I will. In its current state though, I simply can't.			"

												I played the original Gauntlet local co-op with my brother regularly as a child. I find that this remake has stayed true to the concept and I have enjoyed it now twice all the way through. First time was normal mode solo, and then hard mode with my brother (ah, the nostalgia of playing the original!). This game is fairly short - about 5-6 hours. There is a lot of reason to replay this game though: you can level up each of the four classes, upgrade items and gear for up to all four classes, have fun playing with friends and even try to break the speed run records and score records. There are also 5 skill modes ranging from easy to unfair!On the downside, there is absolutely no text or voice chat within the game so it can be annoying if you ever need to talk to a party member, especially if by allowing public to join your lobby. If you plan to co-op with friends steam chat and/or steam voice chat (or 3rd party software) are the only ways to communicate without any chat functions in-game.All in all, I really enjoyed playing this game twice and would play it again if another friend wants to co-op through it.

												Quick to play, quick to discard, Gauntlet is a well made game, blurring the line somewhere between the original arcade Gauntlet and dungeon crawlers like Diablo. It's fun for a few hours, but I doubt many people will come back again after that. More complex skill system than the original Gauntlet, giving the players a few options other than just shoot shoot shoot, but nowhere near as in depth as something like Diablo, Path of Exile, Torchlight which are what the original Gauntlet evolved into. However, it is fun for those few hours, so the game is recommended - only if you can pay less than ten of your local monies, and in the UK, even that's a bit too much.			"

												Alright, I have finally completed this game and have seen mixed reviews. What I have seen in the negative reviews is ""the game is too short, I finished in 3 hours."" or, ""It is really repetitive and boring."" The first statement is false, and the second is an uninformed opinion. The game is not short at all.  I have over 20 hours of time on it and finished around the 24 hour mark. Bear in mind, I spent some time grinding and replaying some levels with friends. Which leads me to the second statement. To say a Dungeon Crawler is repetitive is like saying a Bugatti Veyron is too fast. While it may be true, that is the whole reason behind it. Dungeon Crawlers are supposed to be repetitive. That, in my opinion, is where the fun is. Grinding through waves of enemies to level up and finally beat that unstoppable boss. And trust me, the bosses in this game do not mess around.    So to answer the two main questions. ""Is the game short?"" That depends on you. But you should be able to get at least 10 hours of playtime. ""Is it repetitive?"" Yes, yes it is. Its a Dungeon Crawler, if you were not expecting that, the game is probably not for you. Now, the story of the game is as follows. A Wizard named Morak summoned an immense magical dungeon known by heroes and common people as ""the Gauntlet"". Inside is the usual treasure, traps and evil creatures. And of course, no one has ever made it out. So Morak calls on the four protagonists promising them wealth and all sorts of goodies and of course, a sword slashing, fire blasting good time.The heroes you can pick from are the Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard, and Elf. The Warrior is my personal favorite. He has plenty of health, and can easily cut down waves of enemies. The Valkyrie has a short sword that can swing incredibly fast at the cost of short range. A shield that can block all means of damage, and she can throw her shield to have a sort of chain lighting effect. The wizard is the most complex. In order to cast his spells (with the default controls) You have to push the ""Shift"", ""Space"", or ""RMB"" keys to conjure the spell.  What makes him more complex is that pressing ""Shift"" first and ""Space"" second may make a fire spell. While pressing ""Space"" first and ""Shift"" second may create an ice spell. It requires some getting used to. And then finally we have the the Elf. He has a dodge ability, a bomb that can be attached to his arrows or be placed, and can fire arrows incredibly fast. The gameplay, as mentioned before, can be repetitive. But this is a game you need to grind in. The ""levels"" in the game are called masteries. You level them up by completing certain tasks. For example. The ""Mummy Slayer"" mastery may require 5000 mummy kills to reach the Bronze rank. After doing that, you get increased damage against mummies and the towers that spawn them. Each enemy type has a mastery to go with it. Making the grinding worth while in the long run. The actual levels themselves are divided up as follows. There are 3 sets of 4 doors each. The first door in each set consists of three basic levels. The second door has a procedurally  generated level and tons of places requiring keys. And the third door contains a level that requires performing a specified task to open the exit. And the fourth door in each set contains the boss. To make up for what may seem like a repetitive formula. Each set of doors has a different atmosphere and enemy types. The first set takes place in a sand buried crypt containing Mummies and skeleton warriors. The second set is themed in dark caves that are sometimes, literally pitch black. Here you fight orcs, grunts and the occasional Spider queen. The final set appears to be placed in a volcano or Hell itself. Here you will find fanatic cultists, and many types of demonized creatures.Now, I won't say anything about the bosses. The first two are just challenging enough to make the victory worth it all. While the final boss and ending seem just hastily thrown together. I won't spoil anything of course, but the final boss was, in my opinion, more annoying then fun, and the ending did not have any closure. It left me wondering, and to honest, very dissappointed. But the game in its entirety made up for it. Gauntlet is a fantastic Dungeon Crawler in my opinion and a nice addition to the series. If you have the spare change like I did, pick it up for some friends and play a marathon or two. Good times can be found in every nook and cranny in the depths of this particular dungeon.			"

												i would love to recommand this game because the base of it is so promising.sadly the hole game reaks of console design and it destroyes the game.the camera is terrible and tries to follow every character and keep all on screen at the same time, it doesnt follow your character, meaning you will have tons of situations where you get hit from outside the screen and the camera refuse to let you see what is there before you are hugging it.the skills have fixed ranges, so the fact you have a mouse to aim with isnt used at all.there is auto aiming as well which you can disable but doing so makes it impossible to hit stuff on different heights, again an issue because of the console design.the skill system is abseenly limited and the one character ""wizard"" that have more then 1 skill (all have 3 attacks, which is including their skill) you cannot see cd's on the skills because it is made in a ""console friendly"" manner.these problem have been there since the first release of this game, and the VAST majority of the game population have been complaining over this, especially the camera.yet the devs have completely ignored all the complaints, and instead of making these issue less frustrating or fixing them, they made them worse with this latest version of the game...so i cannot do anything then set this as ""not recommanded""... if the dev steam ever change their ways and actually start listening to the community instead of thinking they are the ""guru's of game design"", then i would properly recommand it. but as it is now, with devs that utterly and completely ignore their playerbase, i cannot recommand it.edit: one thing you most give them credit for is, endless mode have at last been added, it is incredibly boring(it emphesizes all the problem throughout the game and repeats them endlessly; the first 20+ levels are incredibly easy which makes you give up on going on because you are bored out of your mind). but at least it is there; so if they fixed the other issues this would properly be good ^^			"

												When this first came out I was hesitant. This wasn't Dark Legacy, which I still enjoy to this day, this was something different. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and found it enjoyable. I dare say I was pleasantly surprised. The masteries kept the feel of progressing a character, even if just barely.Alas, I didn't have much free time to really delve into it at the time.Then, when I came back... everything was different. All the things that were reminicent of Dark Legacy were removed, including the hubworld, and masteries. This enjoyable little hack and slasher has been hacked apart. I guess I'll go back to Samurai Warriors for my mindless fun.			"

												Less content than a game released in 1985. If you're going to do a reboot, at least try to reach parity with the original. Difficulty levels add absolutely nothing to the equation, merely increasing enemy health (which is lazy and definitely not content.) Enemy spawners have inflated health to begin with. Snatching gold and items before the other players is part of the charm of Gauntlet, but some of the masteries and achievements encourage bad play. Like you really want to team up with someone looking to grind their death count. There are no doodads to speak of - no teleport tiles, invisibility, or if you're familiar with the NES port, reflective shot - nothing of the sort. Some of the relics replicate those features, but you've got to grind gold to get them and fuel them with potions. The problem with potions is that they're rare, you have to share and you can't buy them in the shop. So most boss fights see zero relic use. Then there's the length: 12 areas, consisting of 36 levels and 3 bosses. In other words, an indefensible joke. The artists got their palette from a bowl of gumbo. The game looks like one of those souvenir Wild West photos you get at the boardwalk. Enjoy your stay in Brown Town. It's going to be extremely uneventful.			"

												This is a far cry from the gauntlet I played on N64. Which maybe that's not what they were going for. I think it could be a good lan game now and then but that's about the end of it. The ""secret walls"" show signs of wear and are also given away by the sudden appearance of explosive barrels in the area that you need to destroy the wall. The dungeons are very linear, no dead ends, no exploration aside from bonus treasure rooms, hardly even multiple ways to get around the dungeon.Again maybe the N64 version isn't what they were going for. But. Back then secret walls could show no hint of needing to be destroyed and you did it just by shooting them, no obvious barrels nearby. Sometimes you would break the wall and step on a switch which yes had an arrow pointing in a direction but it could be pointing to anything. You could be at the end of the map and the arrow just points back across the whole map. You now have the whole map to explore trying to figure out wtf that switch did (this is an example which people may be frustrated with). Those were difficult puzzles.I have a hard time putting a definite yes or no on this game but I wouldn't tell people to buy it which I think is the point of ""do you recommend this game?"". I'm probably still going to play it through and enjoy it with friends.			"

QUICKRATINGGAMEPLAY 3/5It is a refreshing approach to an old concept, lacking the courage to add new elements besides basic character improvement over purchasable items/skills. The ""poisonous"" air in the dungeon that constantly harmed you in the arcade predecessor is gone and if you die, it's due to the enemies. The cultists get some cheap kills from time to time, which is plain frustrating. Other than that, the game feels balanced, but you have to grind to unlock it's full potential. A lot.CONTROLS 3.5/5I have played it with a controller and never had any issues with response times. The button layout is convenient, but not rebindable. Jumping over gaps sometimes feels wonky.MUSIC & SOUND 4/5The music fits the scenario and the sound effects are really good. I own a localized version [GER], the voice actors sound like lackluster porn actors.VISUALS 4/5I enjoy the visuals and the different locations are distinctive. I like the gore and overall special effects. Sometimes you can lose sight of your character, especially with a full team in a crowd of enemies.ADDITIONAL INFOYou (and your friends) fight through different dungeons from start to exit. You gain continues, when you fill the bar at the top of the screen by killing off hordes of enemies. If you run out of them, it's game over. You have to share gold and other resources (food, potions) with your team. There are bossfights at the end of each area which require a bit more tactics than the standard enemies. This is the standard game mode. Besides that, you can fight in the Colloseum (a daily challenge) to gain more gold and some hero specific items. You also have the option to start an endless game to see how many dungeons you can clear without dying.With gold you can purchase special skills, items or potion effects, which adds to the gameplay. The most interesting parts are the unique upgrades for each hero.I have enjoyed this game so far and I recommend it, if you want something diabloesque without the hassle to store and manage items, inventory limitations and clicking through complex skill trees. If you want that, you won't be satisfied. It is easy to pick up (except the mage) and play. Be it for 30 minutes or 3 hours.I have had some serious issues with my connection crashing (either hosting or joining), so at the moment I would recommend local coop or single player to avoid these frustrations, taking away a good measure of the game tho. I have contacted WB Games support with this issue, but unfortunately received your standard ""Have you tried turning it off and on again"" reply.			"

												7/10 for good coop fun!  Far too hard on solo for weak little Wizards (and me!) and much more progress to be made in coop.  One-Two-Three-or-Four players run the Gauntlet sharing loot, food, and death.  Similar top-down vein to Chaos Engine (same era) and also dead island epidemic (if you're blessed with youth!)  Gauntlet is 1980's Dungeon's and Dragon's-esque nostalgia of simple mazes and underground dungeons bought up to date for modern times.  Potions, keys, monsters, ghosts, imps and beasties horde the map, reminiscent of L4D2 frenzies, with end-of-level bosses to defeat also.I like how each time you die, it takes a few more seconds compared to last time until you can respawn.  If the rest of your teammates die before your respawn counter allows you back in, you all die and so have to start the entire level from scratch.I currently have audio stutter and white noise, fps is very low (poor AMD gpu) but workable with the game only using 0.7GB vram of my 2GB available for some reason.  I expect things will improve with patches/fixes sooner rather than later given a forum full of issues.  It seems nVidia users have a more optimised experience.A very colourful arcade experience, Gauntlet has decent weapon effects, spells and explosions.  The scenes appear crisp at 1920x1080.  The voiceovers are very British, and humourous.  I make no comment re the stereotyping of the ever-hungry Irish bomb-throwing Elf...It may prove too repetitive a game long-term for most gamers, but it's price point is about right.  The difficulty ups to 'unfair' to challenge the maestros who wish to persevere.  Each character can be upgraded using in-game coins to purchase cosmetics and potion powers, aiding longevity.  The steam cheevos are plentiful and many revolve around multiple deaths, in fact, it is actively encoraged in the game to boost your skill set.A nice change of pace, and no doubt if it proves popular the inevitable dlc packs will arrive in due course with further levels, beasts and cosmetics.Edit due to update: With the latest patch, the audio stutter issues I had are now gone. :)			"

												It's got a drop-in and drop-out system that's perfect for multiplayer on Steam and has five types of players to choose from. It can become repetitive but I take it that the developers were going for an arcade kind of title when they made it. The graphics and controls are pretty solid. If you're looking for a fun game to play instantly and has less dialogues then this is definitely for you. (I have maxed out the masteries for each characters and finished 100% of the Steam achievements associated with the title, plus fully unlocked all unlockables, so I have definitely tested and enjoyed the game thoroughly, for the validation of this review.)

												I had lots of fun. The game is easy to beat, but then you start wanting achievements and begin playing on difficult settings and at that point it's anything but easy. As I was playing with a friend from work and the competition became very intense — it was not about winning anymore, it was about getting more gold by whatever means necessary. Sure, we were playing co-op, but if he had that crown and I want it, I would totally shoot the food just so that he would die and drop it. It wasn't all for one and one for all, it was every man for himself. It was Gauntlet!			"

												This game does homage to the Atari classic of running around dungeons, killing baddies, collecting gold, and finding keys to unlock new doors.  But the reboot also adds a bit more depth with semi-robust game mechanics with powers fueled by potions rather than being just a shooter with a ""clear screen bomb""  The characters are unique and fun and have balanced strengths and weaknesses.  As someone who does not play dungeon-crawler games like Diablo or the sorts I found it fun without being overly technical staying true to its button-mashing ancestors.  And the game's levels are designed for replayability so you can keep going and upgrade all your characters.  The prologue has you learn the basics of each character.  Then you are able to play through the main game with friends or solo.There are multiple stages.  Each stage consists of 4 levels and 3 rooms in each level.  This is with the exception of the last level which is one room containing a boss character you must defeat with skill and smarts (simple puzzles).  The room in each level consists of your basic dungeon running and fighting collecting gold and items.  The second part is a dungeon run to stay alive and avoid death's touch.  He will fade in and out throughout the map and you must try and complete it witout getting sucked into death's vortex.  The third part of each level consists of a final larger battle with hordes of adversaries that you must survive in order to complete the level.  The final level as I said is a single boss match where you have to figure out how to beat each one while not being overrun by additional hordes.You collect coins in the game and those are used to purchase artifacts.  You can equip 2 artifacts at the same time and use them by collecting potions.  For each potion you can use one of your equiped artifacts once.  You can collect up to 5 potions.  Artifacts can be leveled up multiple times for increased effects and abilities.  If you die in mid-combat a timer appears and when it counts down to 0 you can rejoin the fight.  But you can only revive yourself if there are continue coins available.  You get revive/continue coins by killing more and more enemies.  If you run out of coins you cannot revive and as in say Left for Dead, if all players die at the same time, it's GAME OVER for the whole team.One thing I found surprising as a avid player of the coin-op version, was that not all the characters have ranged attacks.  that is left solely to the elf and wizard.  The warrior and valkyrie are hand to hand fighters with some decent dash and range attacks but do not actually shoot any reasonable distance with primary attacks (special moves aside).I've got 8 friends that have this game and we enjoy it very much.  It was well worth the $15 each if bought in a Steam 4-Pack and will likely be on sale by December for even less.  If you want to play it though and support the developers.  It's well WORTH the current price.			"

												It's okay.It's not Gauntlet, but it's fun enough.There are some customer-care issues, like no key-rebindings, using the arrow keys to ""communicate"" with the team (all of four messages) but WASD for movement, some damn instructions (no, don't make me ""guess"" the wizard's other spells in order to the complete the tutorial, especially when he has radically different controls to the others), etc.But, really, it's just a 4-player co-op hack-'n'-slash.  The only things ""Gauntlet"" are the camera-fights where you all run in different directions and jam each other against the edges of the screen, the four characters (note: not their abilities), and the running away from Death...This should have been a ""Gauntlet-like"" game, not carry the name Gauntlet.  If you've ever played Get Medieval - that's what this is.			"

												This game got way more fun after the Slayer Edition update. Bought it in a 4-pack when it was released and had a couple of hours of pretty fun co-op games that first week. Overall, though, that original release was a little bland and ho-hum. Nothing broken with it, but just didn't have enough Gauntlet flavor. A year later, the developers released a big 2.0 release that added a ton of interesting content, significant art improvements, a couple of different game modes, and an improved co-op and matchmaking experience. It's a good time. I breezed through the story mode pretty fast, so decided to dip my toes into the scary online modes. I typically hate jumping into games with internet randos, but they've made this online co-op experience worth it. They've added a bunch of customizations for the characters so serious fans can powerup and build a death machine. You can also just jump in and mash buttons to casually kill waves of monsters if that's your thing. Stay as long as you want.Look for this in a holiday sale. It's some of the best arcade couch fun in a while. Online Endless mode is great. You'll either hookup with some hardcores who will kick you from their game for shooting food -- or you'll find a dungeon crawl buddy who helps you grab loot. Either way is a treat.			"

												Gauntlet was an underwhelming experience. Here are some more points that should reinforce my statement:1. The game is around 5 hours long.2. There are approximately 4 mobs that you fight that look slightly different every level or so. Combat boils down to destroying summoning stones. You'll be doing this for every single level. Have fun!3. Relics are utterly useless. Gold doesn't really matter. It doesn't matter if you die either. In fact, you get rewarded for dying. The game is very forgiving.4. The last boss just sucked. Besides having to wait until you can actually kill him, you get to fight all those fun and varied mobs that you fought all game. The only thing that was missing was even more summoning stones.5. For me, the game has absolutely no replayability. Once you've done it all, what else is there to do? 6. The ending is a slideshow of 3 pictures with some guy talking in the background. No, really.7. The characters talk way too much. You'll be hearing the same lines over and over. Enjoy.			"

												I cannot recommend ""Gauntlet"" as it is in its current form.Having pre-ordered the game I played it during the 1st week of release. At that point I was pleased with what I saw: the game was pretty & there was an upgrade system allowing one to quest for something. More like an RPG then an endless dungeon hack & slash. It was still Gauntlet of old but it was interesting not the mindlessness of old technology.Because of some problems with the multiplayer with my friend it was set aside until tonight when, having an immense headache, I wanted something more light hearted to play then my other games at the moment, namely Dark Souls 3.And I've come to find a mess of a game. Gone is the beautifully rendered hub room replaced with a fairly ugly 2D map representing the dungeon. Also removed is any kind of upgrade or bonus system. So not having the hub room makes sense in a way... there's no reason to replay levels. However instead of selecting your current level on a map they should have just made you go to the next level automatically.The only thing left to purchase in terms of ""upgrades"" are talismans & relics. Or read properly: ""healing"" potions & magic potions.  The healing potions no longer heal you, the activate a skill that can earn health depending on the character you're playing. The relics replace magic potions... instead they recharge on a timer & are infinitely usable.Once you have the talisman & relic that suits your play manner there's no point for grinding as all that's left after you have your favorite is looks. New armour, new head or a cape if you try their new play type. All cosmetic & rather pointless since you can't really see that much detail in game anyways since it still plays from an overhead zoomed out dungeon style.Enemy redesign is not necessarily faithful to the original & in some cases is not intuitive. A prime example is the new ghost. Looking kind of ugly it looks like a sheet on a wire. However my 1st encounter with it it wasn't clear it was a standard enemy; it looked more like a spell effect. Flying through walls the ghost bared no resemblance to the original ghost; part of which was the ability to use the terrain to your advantage.Death however is similar to the original however unlike the original there does not seem to be a way to destroy it (or at least in the level it's introduced I could not find a way with my necromancer). Also it does not come when you're taking too long or pre-placed in certain areas, instead it's on a timer for the level (at least in the level it's introduced in).Overall the action is much slower than the original Gauntlet & I almost feel like Get Medieval has a more interesting playability. Considering all this I'm now regretting having pre-ordered the game & urge people to pass on another failed Warner Bros. project.Instead, if you're lucky enough to find it, I recommend the previously mentioned Get Medieval.

												Genre - Fantasy Dungeon Birds Eye Action with Co-opOkay so I am old enough to played most of the games in the Gauntlet series at their time of release so I pre-ordered this one too.  So what do I think? Well it is a tricky one, I think if you hold it up against the early games in the series this seems the next logical step. Keep to the 4 character format, and make use of co-op (No Diablo players running off like kids on drugs grabbing loot, you are all stuck in the same area!). The 4 characters are varied but only have one primary skill each, I think there should be some options here. There are 3 zones, with 10 levels each. Not a vast amount, but enough until they release some DLC (I guess they plan to, depending on popularity). You can pay for cosmetic costumes with in-game cash  (why these couldn't add minor stat perks is anyone's guess) and you get relics that act as specials for potions (these can be levelled up and are quite varied). There are also perks you unlock by completing achievements and this is where my main criticism comes in. This is a great idea and would keep you coming back, but their should be more and evenly spaced. You get some for dying once, others for killing thousands of monsters! I find this game fun, and will play it more in small doses chasing some achievements and harder modes. I completed normal mode in a few hours but then you have hard and unfair to go at, where good teammates are a required (let's hope there are enough active players later on). Plus I should have earned a few more perks by then. I think the price is a bit steep for what you get (I think it should be about 1/3 cheaper). Also as I said at the start it ignores some of the advances made by some of the newer Gauntlet games such as more character choices and a 3D perspective, but for us old boys it mostly ticks the nostalgic box. I give it a thumbs up, but it is a bit of a *shrug* too.			"

												I have only played Gauntlet for a short time, but will play some more. Gauntlet is exactly what the store page says it is, a dungeon crawler, RPG, Action type game. I found it rather similar to games like Torchlight, but remember Torchlight is its own game, and you dont have a pet in Gauntlet. But you do get to collect lots of loot, and also Turkeys to eat to rekindle your health as you will be up against hoards of zombies and other creatures, that you will encounter as you move along through the dungeons.The characters you play are rather tiny in the game so i hope you have good eye sight, even though they are tiny, i still had fun playing Gauntlet. Also you can play this game with an Xbox controller quite well. It can be played in single player mode or play with up to 4 players or friends including yourself, I tried  both single and  online and found playing with others was rather more fun except they pinch all the loot and food before i could get to it, so remember to share the food and stash please. It would be great to join in the game with some friends, and this can be easily set up to do so, if our times allow for convenient game play.Only negatives I had are :I had a few issues starting the game as it keeped crashing at the start, but after some persistance and checking the game cache files and a reboot of steam, it ran beautifully. Also to note I have windows 8.1 and the game  ran fine, once it decided to launch, so please dont panic about this, as its all just minor issues i encountered, i just felt i  had to mention this, incase anyone else has a launching issue.Also game needs more food pickups to be added aswell, as you tend to die pretty quickly, if your not careful.I will rate this game 8/10.

												Fun! Really fun especially in local co-op. Grindy! Really grindy, less so in co-op! Some flaws but overall one of the best entries in the Gauntlet franchise in a long while. Some solid humorous voice acting, the game doesn't take itself too seriously. If you like the original coin-op games you will enjoy the overall faithful incorporation of the signature elements of a Gauntlet game -- except the Death encounters but whatever, just roll with the changes and you'll have fun.This game is not gonna become like, your world or anything, it's just a fun actiony dungeon crawl with some decent replayability, with features including an endless procedural dungeon mode and unlockable equipment that affords a fair amount of playstyle customization per character. As always, Gauntlet is best enjoyed with friends.			"

												I feel bad for anyone who gets stuck playing warrior with your three other friends. There are clear balance issues between classes. Valkyrie and Wizard are far superior to their other counterparts. Melee on bosses is nearly impossible for both the warrior and valkyrie. The character progression system feels like a grind with very little reward. The equipable gear is the most expensive thing to purchase with in game currency and is purely cosmetic. The gear gets the same reaction as playing on harder difficulties which is ""Why bother?"" The only redeeming quality for the game was the leader boards that are constantly shown at the end of mission clusters. However, those are now useless on day 2 of release because hackers hold the top scores with numbers in the billions and clearing times that are unobtainable by legit means. $20 is a bit much for this game, purchase it for you and your three friends at $5 a copy or less because it is worth about 4-6 hours of entertainment at most.

												I really don't understand why there are so many good reviews. This game is boring. I didn't played the original Gauntlet.- You fight waves of the same ennemies again and again- Levels feel like copy paste.- Useless expensive equipment, give no stats, you just have to chose only 2 relics (10 total) that are the same for every classes. 0 feeling of progress.- 0 synergy between classes.- ""Epic bosses"" what a joke, bosses are so uninspired.- The camera is so annoying- You can pick health when you are full, really ? You get rewarded to kill your friends, so many good idea for a co-op game...- Classes are not balanced.- No control rebind.- Short game, not enough content for a 20€ game.I am sure i forget things.I mean when you see Hammerwatch for 9€, i do not recommend Gauntlet.

												I died because I yaaawned!I wanted to love this, but I can't now...The game is BUGGED LIKE HELL: Wallglitches, doors that don't open, clipping, food disappearing.The relic and equipment system (I felt totally trolled by the developers when I noticed that my preorder items don't give me any stat upgrades at all, but only cosmetics) is totally useless and there is NO MOTIVATION at all to grind gold. Additionally, the 4 classes are totally UNBALANCED (Valkyr/Warrior < Rogue < Wizzard) and the content is played through in 4!!! hours, which is quite ridiculous for that price.The game needs drop in - drop out implementation quick. It's obsolete to let players only enter matches while others have to wait in the Lobby. It's COOP! COOOOOP! ...ah well, I forgot: The game has NO INGAME CHAT! SRSLY?!?Mission design lacks variety and is tedious. After the fifth or sixth mission I just wanted it to be over....and it breaks my heart! 20 bucks out of the window! Never will preorder of this company again... Nostalgia destroyed!3/10, because I had fun in voicechat (ofc external, because this game doesn't offer any options) and the soundtrack wasn't annoying in comparison to every other aspect of the game! This is just a shame!			"

												This is my first negative review as I was always lucky to get a game that really was right up me alley .Unfortunatelly for me this game didn't reach my expectations.I will try to write it down what was really buggin me in Gauntlet:- The graphics is really outdated ,you can not zoom in on your character or enviroment ,level of detail is medium.- You don't have a skill tree ,insted you gain  so called "" Mastery"" which gives you some bonuses but you have no    absolutelly control over you character development .- The amount of gold you're getting is quite limited and also when you die you ressurect yourself but you pay penalty in gold .After all when I cleared first level I could not afford to by anything from the shop. - There is no quest ,you have to just clear all levels and that's it! Over all the game is quite dificult to finish it but in the same time is very boring as I did not find any quests or side quest.The story line for me is barelly ""visible"" and  does not appeal to me at all. I forgot to mention I couldn't log in to WBplay account  to claim my reward for prepurchasing Gauntlet.			"

												I have only been playing this game for a few hours or so but I already see a lot of disappointing flaws in the game. 1) If you are looking for a game that is similar to Gauntlet Legends on N64, you will be sorely disappointed. I never played the original arcade version but I did enjoy Legends on N64. This game is nothing like it so please do not spend money expecting a similar experience.2) Each level is pretty much the same. Each world (or section if you will) has a theme, much like Legends, however each level within that section is pretty much the same. It seems like the developers did not care enough to make each area unique and I was left feeling like I had been playing the same level over and over again. Zero imagination was put into the creation of each level. It is almost like the developers created a program that would spit out some random levels using a small set of textures and models.3) There is no in game communication for multiplayer. Multiplayer is a disaster. Without communication players cannot coordinate whatsoever. ""Hey man, don't shoot that barrel, we need it to unlock a secret area!"" ""Oh secret area eh? I had no idea!"" Yeah those conversations never have a chance to happen. If you're a completionist like me, you might be matched with someone who likes to run to the next area, completely oblivious to the small forture waiting on the left hand side of the screen. Which reminds me: There is a sort of doorway that takes you to the next area. If someone were not paying attention and goes through that doorway, the game sends everyone to the next area, even if the other players know of a plethora of gold toward another part of the screen. Without a communication system there is no way to tell anyone to hold on a second before heading to the next area.4) The gear system is a joke. So the game boasts that you can modify your character with cool gear etc etc however the selection is dismal and only relics affect your character. Your loadout does NOTHING to improve stats or anything like that. Different outfits are cool and all but why would I spend my hard earned gold on purely cosmetic items (that don't even look good btw) when I can spend the gold on the relics that will actually help my character. I understand that the game just came out but I really hope they make improvements to the gear system because it is terrible right now.So in summary I was very disappointed in this game and if there were some way I could get my money back then I would. Perhaps my expectations were too high but Gauntlet Legends was a great game for its time and I automatically assumed that they would create something that would feed my nostalgia and provide a great experience at the same time. I will never make that assumption about a game again. A red flag I should have paid attention to from the start was that Warner Brothers and another no-name studio created this game. I am in no way insulting indie developers but I dont think WB or the other company (don't even remember its name) have the experience developing video games necessary to do this game justice.Please please please do not spend money on this game. Put your money into something, anything else. If you are a Gauntlet Legends fan you may find this game to be absolutley horrible. "

												A well made remake of the 1980s classic arcade game, that is true to it's predecessor. The game looks and feels really good, I really enjoyed the challenges of each level and the chaotic amount of enemies to burn, slash and shoot. I would say the true content of the game is actually the characters, they each offer a unique way of playing, and because they are so different I feel I can replay the game from scratch without feeling like it is a new game.However, since the game has been out for a year, I am afraid the community has dwindled, making some of the co-operative features only possible by gaming with friends, which can also add a handicap for solo players, but besides that, I recommend the game if you like a good quick action fantasy game, and it is also a good peek into the past of how games were like for the new generation of gamers, but without the dated pixelated graphics :).If you want to see how the gameplay is like, click on the link below to see my video review:

												It's not a badly executed game, and the combat is quite nice... It's just i lose my interest everytime after a few levels  because there is just not enough incentive leveling your character or gaining gold, which feels pretty useless after you unlocked the few and only skills your character has, without the possibility of upgrading it. A decent upgrade or leveling path feels like a huge omission for what could have been a great game considering the execution of everything they DID right. Fun maybe for a few hours, but gets old too quickly unfortunately.			"

												If you're looking for a co-op game to play with friend Gauntlet is a good choice.Pros:~4 player co-op (local, online or both - Yes both)~4 unique and well balanced characters to choose from.~Hilarious comments from the Narrator. ~Complete controller support.Cons:~The story for the campaign mode is very basic, but kind of what you would expect from Gauntlet.~Surprisingly computer intensive for what's being displayed on the screen (if FSP are terrible I suggest turning off V-Sync)ConclusionOverall this game is a lot of fun, especially if you have the right people to play with. Playing alone is fun too but becomes quite difficult quite quickly depending on which character you are playing as. I suggest you buy this game on sale and try to get the bundle that includes the DLC (for the same price as the game itself on steam).Notes:I have only played the Slayer edition with DLC.I bought this game bundle to play with my brothers.(I didn't buy it to play alone)			"

												Playing this cooperatively with 3 others is great. It keeps the classic Gauntlet formula whilst not trying to overcomplicate things. I can't say I was one of those that had played the original, but playing with those that grew up with it was a good insight. Personally I don't think it excels in any specific way. Its just a good, solid dungeon crawler. Note that the game takes less then 5 hours to beat, and the game is extremely light on content - even saying that some of the unlocks were really not worth the amount of grinding! Still, Endless and Colosseum modes are nice additions and kept me playing a bit longer.Grabbed this at a bargain price for £3, and kept me and my friends entertained throughout. A worthy addition to my library.			"

												This is the kind of game that I wish that I'd have a Neutral Selection here. Like, not a yes, or no.I had fun with Gauntlet, don't get me wrong, but if you're buying it, I don't think it holds up. There's a lack of customization options for the user, especially if you're someone who doesn't have 3 friends to play with right away with the game. The lack of customization of games to find to play, lack of customization of controls, and lack of options in general, and the game feels like a game that was made for the developers to play, not for the masses to play.The developer is apparently working on those features in question, and I highlight the lack of them here:

												I like this game a lot, its very beautifull and fun to play, but... There is a lot of things which making you feel that something is quite wrong. First of all, cooperation: there is just no way to speak with others (no chat), not even an emotes or basic movement directions for party — you have to gues what others have on their mind. It could be played solo, but this way its pretty booring and super hard. So you have to eather use real life friends or skype to talk with people, which isnt really good. When you enter the lobby... Well, there is no lobby lol. You simply pick desired difficulty among 4 (where the first one is actually hard and the last one is 'bloody hell, damn it, get away from me!!!'). And if you want to beat some special level among 12, at current exact moment — you cant do it, cus there is no way to predict which one party leader will choose to play (but you can create ye own game and wait few hours for people to connect to you). Also this influences other side of game — you can pick two of many special abbilities, which are good on some levels and bad on other and there is no way to understand what to take with you since you have no idea where gonna go.Now a bit about classes balance. Warrior is beyond patheticness. Seriously, this guy is slow, his dodge ability requires charge and have direction restrictions. Autoattacks damage is very low, so he needs 3-4 of those to wipe one single smallest enemy. He isnt able to do anything cus mostly have to fight in melee combat with only one aoe damage skill. And some monsters can two shot you. The other problem — you must click mouse button once to execute each swing of your weapon, which is just lame and requires button mashing your mouse. While mage have 7 active AoE spells, 2 crowd controlls and mostly one shots any monster. Yes mage also can simply push and hold attack button to land spells non stop.Now a bit more about coop. There is almost no way to get fun of your team, cus when you destroy their food, deal damage to them by enviroment or corner (preventing any movement) — this leads to their funny death, but also will make others members to die, cus monsters dont care about your dumb fun jokes, they simply kill you. And when everyone dies, you will have to replay SAME level WITHOUT any random generation. Dont take me wrong — game is nice, there is lots of secret areas, nice graphics, many hard situations to overgo, but playing same area over and over and over... You cant just revive mates like in Left 4 Dead 2, nooo,  you gonna suffer. It is very interesting to play each stage for the first time, since there is special traps and logical 'mini games', but only for once.Between levels you can spend gathered gold to buy stuff. Each class has his own treasury chest so you have to actuall play (farm a lot)with that hero, before gearing him up. Yet, that gear changes visuals only, and getting 2 active skills pretty easy task, so we can say: there is no shop at all and no progression. Now about achievements — all heroes have the same types of them, so if you gonna play some hero for a long time, you will get lots of nice bonuses, but have to repeat it it for every one else. Anyway, they wount change game flow even a bit, they exist just to exist.Right now i would not recomend it for solo players or those who seek fun with random people. It also lags a bit on lava levels even on minimum settings, so you have to get better pc then my'n (iCore5 3000Hz, 4gb ram, 2gb video gts 640, windows 7).Again — this is good game and i LIKE it, but right now its not ready to take a place in our heart. Have to wait and see what ddevs gonna change.			"

												Gauntlet came out today. My review.The good: Great game play 4 classes with fun abilities making it fun to kill things. The boss fights all have their own challenge to them. You can play 4 player on the same computer. Didn't feel repetitive for different levels.The bad: Only 4 classes and multiple people can not play the same class. Difficulty did not increase as game progressed. The game was simple with no puzzles. No dazzling graphics. Normally I do not judge on graphics as a negative factor however I expected more game play. There are only 12 levels, 3 of which are just fighting a boss. There are no mini bosses to challenge you no unique monsters or loot. The overpriced gear you can buy is only for visual appearance. There is no findable items as there was in previous games. The relics you buy are also overpriced you will beat the game before you can fully upgrade one relic. The only reason it didn't feel repetitive was because the game was only 4-5 hours long.Verdict 7/10. Would recommend playing it, would not recommend buying it. It is a arcade game if you have 3 friends you constantly game with, it's only $20, might as well, but don't tell everyone else they should buy it just have them come over. If they opned up the code to the community for custom levels it would be a must have.			"

												During the Summer Sale we picked up the new Gauntlet four pack. My husband and I took two copies and gave two copies to those who we knew would enjoy them and then promptly got sucked into other games for a bit. Sunday the 10th of July, 2016 we decided to play with my brother. We are almost through to the second shard on Normal difficulty and I am excieted to get through so we can try Hard mode. THE NOSTALGIA! This isn't the old Gauntlet but it keeps the little things that made them great. I havn't played a hack n slash dungeon crawl that made me feel challanged in any way in a long time. The frustration of accedentally destroying your meat, the consternation when someone else is getting all the gold, and the death from getting mobbed by too many spiders is something that I didn't know I was missing. I wouldn't call this a hard game but then I don't like my wins handed to me like a small child either.			"

												I don't think I've had as much co-op fun with a game at this price.  Everything in Gauntlet is extremely polished, all the way down to the glimmering piles of gold and the jingle of coins when you grab them.  It's cool to see a highly skilled mage join our game from who-knows-where and do his/her thing.  Even the wife, who's not particularly good at action games, has enjoyed this one and become a solid contributor.  The developers obviously sacrificed a lot of time and effort to balance the gameplay to perfection.			"

Posted: September 27, 2014
												So 3 of my friends and myself gave the game a go last night. For $15 bucks (each) and based on past Gauntlet games {Legends and Legacy} we figured it was worth a go. Traditional Gauntlet games get a ton of replay value so the $15 should merit that. In either case let me break into the actual reviewGauntlet starts you off by having you play each class; Warrior, Valkyrie, Elf/Archer and Wizard.Warrior plays like in the typical hack and slash style. Valkyrie feel very Captain America'esc but still hack and slashy. Elf/Archer plays like a character from Smash TV. Lastly Wizard plays like Invoker from Dota 2 (to elaborate you have 9 spells and based on what elements you combine {Lightning, Fire, Ice} you get a different spell with each spell having its own cooldown). With each unique character you sort of get a different button schema. Where Warrior and Valkyrie (I might need clarification on this) smash buttons. The Elf/Archer and Wizard utilize the right analog.Once you go through the tutorial you have the ability to start a game or begin a lobby. The lobby system is fantastic. There's no shift tabbing into the steam community to select a person's profile to invite them into a game. You simple click the button to open lobby (for me it was 'Y' on the Xbox control or 'X' on the PS3 based on the conversation software). and it brought up a list of friends currently playing Gauntlet who I could invite. The only gief is I wish it only brought up friends who have / are playing Gauntlet. I still get my full list of steam list friends which I think is silly.Each selection is unique so can't have two Warriors or Valkyries etc. Once your in the game you have worlds to choose from... there's only 3 worlds with 4 levels so that was sort of a let down from the get go.Also in the lobby you decide on your difficult. Easy is like a light version of Normal so you have more health and monsters are not as strong. Normal you get infinite number of re-spawns. Hard requires that you have tokens to re-spawn other players and Unfair you simply don't re-spawn and food rarely/never(?) exist. We went with Normal for our play-through.There's also a shop that sells artifacts however to use the artifacts you must use potions you find in the level. So potions are no longer a generic AOE effect but are used in conjunction with artifacts. Shops items can also be upgraded and few items no longer have the 'one time use' feel. This gives potions sort of a customized feel however ultimately make them useless on boss as no potions spawn on those fights.Another thing that doesn't exist in the shop now is 'stats'. 'Stats' or any sort of character enhancement is gained by spamming a specific character skill (typically bound to a button or in the Wizards case combine two buttons to make a spell). Other character enhancements (which are called Masteries) are gained through eating food, dying and collecting gold provide a passive bonus rather than active.As to the actually game play...it felt super linear at first and unfortunately stayed that way for most of the game. There was very few 'whoops we went the wrong way' or 'did we miss something'. If such situations occurred it was a result of a bad camera angle hiding a wall that wasn't visible rather than a puzzle to figure out.There's of course game elements to try to lighten the mood like players can light barrels of TNT on fire and throw it at friends or destroy food that a friend is about to pick up. There's also preset emotes that players can spam at each other. While were on emotes the characters periodically compliment each other when they get a long kill streak...this is 'cute' at first but due to its frequency gets old fast. The last sort interactive element was the crown which when worn gives the player at the end a gold bonus. However if they get hit the crown drops and another player can pick it up.Level 1 and 2 of each world was typically presenting the theme. Level 3 was typically a small boss battle arena and level 4 was purely focused on the boss. Bosses were a hybrid of spamming the attack key and figuring out puzzles.So general flow of the game was 'pick a world' -> 'pick a level' -> 'playthrough it' -> 'return to town' -> 'debating on buying artifacts' -> 'pick a world' repeat.Now with all that said would I recommend picking up the game... probably not at it's current release price or I would definitely split the $15 bucks among several people and play it via Local. Even then not enough bang for the buck for me to recommend it.As a group of 4 players we beat the game in about 4.3 hours. It really emphasizes on 'party play' and I could see it getting frustrating solo. There's no 'true' leveling system so you don't really feel the progression. You get a new skill to spam or your cool downs on a spell are reduced but your overall power still feels 'fixed'. As I mentioned before there are 'artifacts' that you can buy with gold earned in game but they are nothing game breaking.Once you complete the game you do unlock cosmetic items however they require that you use in-game gold to buy them... so your reward for completing the game on a certain difficulty is unlocking an item in which you have to grind the levels you just beat to get the gold to buy the cosmetic item....yeah...no.On a few minor notes there's a few times where death shows up which leads to comical deaths (Death no longer drains he simple kills you) but is quickly forgotten. There's no alternative classes like Tigress, Jester, Minotaur and etc. After we finished playing we expected that they would be DLC or something silly. Pojo (aka EGG911) is not in the game as well as 'X IS NOW IT' system is out as well.The novelty and hopefully nostalgia you hope to draw out the game is typically gone after the first few hours. At its core it took what made the Gauntlet series unique and made it feel like a generic hack and slash.Oh one last thing before I close this out...the soundtrack is okay but nothing stellar or to write home about.Edits below (due to comments section limitation of 1,000 characters or less)Response to Jareth Gawain on 09/28/2014:Correct Jareth Gawain however I find that overall it pulls more aspects from Legends and Legacy then the original Gauntlet.  The original Gauntlet arcade aspects that differed it from other hack and slash/beat-'em-up arcade games at that time was the concept of a time limit.  Players health totals constantly dropped and there weren't many/any titles prior to this that forced players to find a way to conclude the level in an effective manner.  This game mechanic at the time was complimented by a labyrinth-esc design which futher penalized player for making an incorrect choice for not finding the right way out.  Am I saying that such a mechanic(s) should have been implemented into Gauntlet™?Absolutely not or rather if they did so perhaps it happens on a higher difficulty.  As I stated I did not play on anything higher than 'Normal' so this may already maybe implemented in the game.  The above game mechanic(s) I didn't feel in Gauntlet™.  The game felt very linear and more Legends/Legacy then the arcade versions.To the point regarding Legends and/or Legacys I felt Gauntlet™ drew more from these mondern versions than its predecessors.  Concepts of character progression, item shops, boss battles, quotes such as 'needs food badly' and many others pull from the days of Legends and/or Legacy.  Which to me as a individual playing the game I think is a good thing that they didn't try to keep the pure rustic feel of the past in Gauntlet™.  For these above reasons I feel Gauntlet™ feels more like Legends and/or Legacy than the original arcade boot.			"

												Worst thing about this game - it reminded me that I played the original on the Atari in the late 80s and I feel OLD. If you enjoyed any of the Gauntlet series you should enjoy this. It stays pretty true to the original concept, whilst bringing enough new things and remastered graphics to make it seem worth another remake. If you know nothing of the series (seriously, why?) it's a rampaging dungeon crawler with the very simple aim of kill all the things, collect all the golds and ramp up high scores which obviously improves your e-peen.If you're the competitive sort, the leaderboards (both global and friend-based) will add a ton of replayability, and the masteries system gives incentive to play each of the 4 heroes all of which do actually play surprisingly differently.Some downsides worth noting are that keys aren't currently rebindable (just a simple choice between keyboard or gamepad), and no chat at all. Even just chat in the lobby would be useful when finding random groups on higher difficulties so you can discuss who is prioritizing taking food, or who might shoot it because they've unlocked the masteries etc.As with any co-op game you're going to get the best out of this if you have actual friends and a voice chat. If you have no friends like me (sadface), it's a bit RNG whether you get people who are looking to progress in a game, people who are just looking to have fun and work on masteries, or those just out to troll you. I've still been having a lot of fun playing this single player but I can imagine getting a group of friends together on skype and hitting this up would be awesome.			"

												TLDR: Highly recommended, good fun in single player or multiplayer and ok for people who get motion sick from fps or moba style games.If you're thinking of getting this game, first thing I suggest you do is look at some gameplay on youtube. I have an indepth overview and review with gameplay here 


YouTube™ Video: Indepth Overview & Review with Gameplay of Gauntlet Slayer Edition | Mister Clash 

			Views: 123		

			Gauntlet Slayer Edition: Covering the basics of the characters, game play and review info as well. And where to get the game real cheap.		

 (hour long) and Zerohill has an awesome 20 video playlist you can see here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEg-yDRmLEZ1F0zYiE14ciggS71YnssXX The aim of the gameMorak the magician created the gauntlet for power & got trapped inside. Your job is to fight through hordes or mummies, walking dead, undead, skeletons, grunts, orcs, etc., to bring him 3 shards of a sword so he can escape the gauntlet. In return he promises riches & power.The Characters, their weapons & attacking skillsThor (Warrior): Carries a battle axe and does large sweeping slashes which lay waste to the enemy. Can also do a double handed vertical chop (think log splitting). And when in a bind, a spinning attack which decimates the hordes around him. And can do a charge to barge the enemy out of the way.Thyra (Valkyrie): Has a Shield, sword and speer. For close quarter combat she slashes with her sword. When the enemies are nearby she can throw her shield (Capt America style) and take out groups or lines of enemies. And she has a speer thrust which can also take out a line of enemy fast, as well as get her out of a swarming group. She also has a shield block which reflects projectiles back at the enemy who threw them at her and protects her from the slashes of sharp fingernailed attackers. She can move while she has the shield up, although slower.Questor (Elf): He has a bow and arrow and an elf bomb which he can drop on the ground or attach to his snipe arrows. His normal arrows are rapid fire and short range. His snipe shot is longer range and has more power but isn't as rapid. Use the snipe/bomb arrow to shoot into a Summoning stone from afar - or single enemy troop and the troops around will blow up. His elf bomb can also be dropped into the middle of a horde to blow them up. For quick escapes he has a tumble roll.Merlin (Wizard): He has 9 basic spells to choose from... Close quarter ice (freezes enemy in place), Ice beam (think laser beam) and Ice lob bomb (which creates a frozen circle which slows down the enemy. Fire balls (not as rapid as elf arrows but do more damage), fire lob bomb and can move quickly as a couple of snaking fireball things. Chain lightening, a force blast which knocks over the enemy and a force shield he and others can stand in.Lillith (Necromancer): An add on character which can be purchased seperately to the game itself, her stock standard weapons are a small skeleton which rises to swipe the enemy a distance from her and a large skeleton with a sledge hammer that bashes down on groups of enemy or large items. As she takes out an enemy she gains some of their Soul Energy which she can use to raise a small group of fighters to help her.Weapon AbilitiesEach character can change their main weapon to give it slightly different abilities. E.g. choose a different bow and the elf's bomb becomes a ""keep enemy in place"" bomb and allows you to then kill them while they stand still. His normal arrows are not changed when this bow is used. The warrior can change his axe so that the double handed log splitting chop wipes out all the enemies around him in one blow. Valkyrie and Wiz also have different abilities.TalismansThese change what happens when a potion is used. At the beginning the use of a potion simply blows it up and damages anything in the blast zone. Later they can be changed E.g. One use for the Valkyries becomes creating 3 valks to fight for her. Each character's Taslisman change is different. RelicsTheses are items you can buy in the game (with gold earned in the game) to enhance your character's abilties. Some enable you to move faster, others create a whirlwind around you. One creates illusions of your character which can attack the enemy along side you.Q&A - Answering unasked questions and bad review claimsBad review claim: The game lacks content.My take: Without any elaboration in what way it lacks content, the statement isn't helpful and says more about the reviewer than the game. The game has 30 missions in Campaign mode, which can be played on Easy, Normal or Hard, so it is kind of like 90 different missions. Each can be played with one of four main characters for a total possible 360 possible different mission experiences. Add to this the Endless option which has you go through an endless number of floors which are made up on the fly - and can be done solo or with others. The top players have reached floor 8,192!!! And then there is the Colleseum which pits you against waves of beasties in a one room arena - 6 waves completes the mission and each day there is a new mission with different gameplay in a new arena. I wouldn't call that ""lack of content"".Bad review claim: Only 6 to 8 hrs of game play.My take: At the time of this review I have over 140 hrs of game time. I only have 30 of 46 achievements, have not completed the campaign fully by myself in Normal or Hard mode in any single character. Have only managed to get to floor 79 in Endless mode with a team of people (only managed floor 8 by myself as elf) and have completed only two missions in the Colesseum. Makes me wonder if those who think ""only 6 to 8 hours"" actually tried or just rode along in easy mode multiplayer until the campaign was done and then called it quits, or just found the game too hard. Because with all the achievements, character upgrades and missions, there is no way it can all be done in only 6 to 8 hours.Bad review claim: Boring.Again, without elaboration the statement is meaninless. Boring compared to what? Would they find the classic games like Space Invaders or Pacman or Donkey Kong boring? Millions of people around the globe used to go out of their way to play those games in ""pinball parlors"". There is so much which can be done in this game, any claim it is boring, says more about the reviewer than the game itself.I have a sneaky feeling the ""lacks content"", ""only a few hours game play"" and ""boring"" reviewers are most likely young kids. Maybe it's boring because their mates won't play with them, because maybe their mates think fps is the shiznits and everything else is boring? And I can see ""kids"" completing a room in easy mode and considerig it ""done"" without going back there ever in any other character or harder mode. Or the game is too hard for them so instead of admitting they find it too hard, blame the game for lack of content, not long in hours or boring.Fact is, the graphics are good, the game play is progressively harder (something all good games have in common), it can be played in a mode that suits your skill level and is great for people who suffer video game motion sickness. It can be played on your own whenever you want to spend a few minutes playing, or played with friends or even strangers and can be played in a variety of characters.You do not Need to play it in multiplayer. You can play it by yourself in single player mode without interacting with the server and other players. Most of my gameplay is like this as I use the time to get better with the various characters (so I'll be a good asset to any multiplayer team I join) and when I don't have the time to complete the campaign or whatnot with others and want to spend 15 or 30 minutes playing, or just don't feel like playing with others. Playing solo means you can go at your own pace and fully explore each mission in the campaign.Sometimes, depending on the time of day, finding a stranger to play Campaign is difficult. But if you head into Endless more you will Always find someone in there to play with.			"

												This game just doesn't have the depth of the original Gauntlet Game!! Where are all the characters? colors cumstumization? I mean they basically had a great game all laid out for them and they completely simplified, boring and short. Dissapointing, hoping for an update to change it up.			"

												Had high hopes that this reboot would bring back the classic Gauntlet experience. I just don't feel it's worth the $20 when It can easily be completed in under 5 hours. The developers could have packed a bit more stages and wider variety of monsters to slash through before releasing this. I won't say it's a bad game, just lacking content. And there is no reason you should be able to destroy food. Sorry, I can't recommend this game to anyone whose played the previous Gauntlet titles, It's missing a lot of features.. :/			"

												I'm sorry but I am actually disappointed at this game. I just completed the game on normal and I can't say I want to play it again. The 4 classes are somewhat similar to Legends and Dark Legacy, but the Wizard was way different than the other classes having 9 total spells. The other classes aren't that interesting in comparison. I thought the level design was too simple; it lacked the charm and puzzle solving like in Dark Legacy: hidden invisible walls, switches, boss weapons, mini bosses, cool itmes, gems, etc. Really though, there are a list of things I didn't like in this game. I didn't grow up with the 1985 version, I grew up with Legends and Dark Legacy; games of which had a decent hack and slash system with a good balance of magic and puzzles. Pros:Good graphicsFunny as hellMultiplayer was simple and straight forwardCons:Lack of class design between the charactersSimplistic level designRelics are expensive and can't be used enoughArmor doesn't do anything, cosmeticSHORT ~ 5 hours!Lack of items and elements from previous generationEnemies were boring after about an hourThe Elf couldn't auto attack the generators!!!The story was boring and anticlimaticCouldn't select the same class in multiplayer and couldn't customize muchMasteries didn't change the game much, couldn't even view them in game3/10I was really hoping for more in this game. It easily could have been $50 with more content, customization, and level design. I miss Dark Legacy so much, I expected more from this.   "

												Gauntlet is an action adventure game from Arrowhead Game Studios and WB Games. Let’s get rocking.The GoodI don’t think I’ve ever played the original Gauntlet game, but I played the living hell out of the one on the Playstation. I’m pretty sure it was Gauntlet Legends. Anywho, this Gauntlet is still just as fun as the previous installments.Now, bearing in mind that I haven’t played a Gauntlet game since the days of the PS1, this Gauntlet let’s you change your character’s armor, helmet, and weapon. What’s more, you’re not just throwing your weapon at the enemies in an endless stream anymore. No, you’re actually attacking them with that giant warhammer you’ve got. Warrior class, I’m looking at you. But, in all seriousness, actually being able to hit someone with a battleaxe, instead of throwing one at them repeatedly (as awesome as that may sound) is so much more rewarding.While the game itself is shiny and improved, it still maintains that classic Gauntlet feel. You and your friends (or, in my case, just me) against teeming hordes of monsters and it’s up to you to reduce them all into greasy gore piles, snag the gold, and get out with your lives.The levels are pretty large for what they are. It’ll take you a good ten minutes or more per level, depending on how much of a completionist/explorer you are as a gamer. That being said, there are a ton of levels to play through. And, if you finish them all, there is also an arena mode where you can slaughter monsters to your heart’s content.The BadMaybe it was intended to be so, but the dialog is laughably bad. It doesn’t really detract from the experience, but you’ll wonder how some of it got past quality control.The MehThe game is a bit of a grind and, if you’re not playing with friends, it might start to get monotonous after a while. You’ve been warned.Verdict: YeaAt full price, I probably wouldn’t recommend getting this one. But, if you can get it on sale, I’d recommend adding it to your collection. If you can convince a friend or two to get it and play it as a team, even better.			"

												The game is unplayable. You can't remap the keys, so if you have a broken key, like me, or you are left handed, you are ♥♥♥♥ed. Also, the game crashes when you try to change it to fullscreen, or when you ♥♥♥♥ing click the start game button. And this is AFTER a 777 MB update. Don't waste your money on this pile of garbage, they don't deserve it after proving to have this little foresight. I would comment about how the game is, but I can't. Good thing they pushed back the release date to offer a polished product. 20€ thrown into the trash. ""Thank you for your money, now ♥♥♥♥ off""-Arrowhead Studios			"

												It's a fun multiplayer brawler with nice character variety, with two melee fighters, an agile archer, and a wizard who plays like a stripped down version of Magicka. Unfortunately it's kind of lacking in content right now, with only 9 exploration level + run-quickly level + spawner arena level sets and 3 boss levels, one after each trio of level sets. Except for replaying on harder difficulties or grinding out achievements for ""mastery"" rewards, some of which are obnoxious along the lines of ""kill 50000 enemies"" or ""kill 8000/12000 monsters in one specific way"", there's not much to do in the game, and it only took me about 5 hours (including some time playing the same levels again with different friends) before I completed the campaign. Probably it'd take about 3 if you just went from start to finish.Ultimately, though, for actually being an online multiplayer remake of Gauntlet I have to recommend Hammerwatch instead. It's pixel art instead of 3D, but if you can get over that I think it's by far the better game.			"

												Super disapointing game. And somehow inferior to its previous versions. The game is very short to play through and after that it's just a boring, pointless grind that only rewards you with achievements and vanity gear that you can't really see in game that well anyway. Pros+ Can be fun to play (for a few hours anyway) with a group of friends+Some humorous aspects+The graphics are decentCons-Not fun to play alone.-Not fun in random groups (people can and will screw you over). -You share a screen with your whole group (which causes multiple issues)-Not possible to join a game in progress. If you get dc'd you cant rejoin your friends and they will have to finish without you. -Not much variation in difficulties. Except Unfair which is just stupid. -Most characters have only a couple attacks. Except the wizard which is a weird pain to switch between his spells on the keyboard. -Nothing good to spend your gold on. The gear is all vanity items which is so bad because it doesn't look that special. -You can beat this game in about 5-6 hours and then wish you hadn't bought the game. -Weird bugs where I would randomly fall through the floor or just spontaneously die with no enemies around. -The story is really basic and only really applies to the start and end of the game. All the middle bosses have no meaning. And then of course the ending was predictable and the last boss was easy. To reward you for finishing the game you get to see a slideshow of 3 paintings. Its a very short simple game and it isn't worth more than $5. I wouldn't recommend paying anything more than that for it.			"

												Game was nice at the beginning, but got boring after 2 hours of playing. Everything is the same - the levels, the enemies. The only replay value comes from the 4 classes available - each one has a distinct strategy. Game is nice overall, but is poor value over money. Buy it if it get less than 7$.			"

nukes-viewHi all, nukes here.Gauntlet is a top down, dungeon crawler, which will have you hacking and slashing your way through hordes of enemies. Which sold it for me, who doesn't love running through dark dungeons slaughtering everything you are faced with.Based off of the original 1985 Gauntlet, this version captures its magic beautifully. Still offering four player co-operative locally and online as well. Gauntlet offers a story mode, Endless mode and a Coliseum. Each can be played with friends or on your own.I love this game, as it is easy to pick up and play, playing with friends made my experience even more fun. Although the community is not massive people still do play this online. The Game PlayBefore you jump into raid the dungeons in search of glorious riches. You are able to choose from four playable characters, with a fifth as DLC.Each with very different abilities and play styles.Warrior, Valkyrie, Elf, Wizard and Necromancer (DLC content)Personally my two favourite are the Valkyrie for mirror shield and clone combo, and the Wizard for his awesome spell combinations. Don't get me wrong though all the classes are brilliant.Personally Barbarian felt a little dumb and clumsy to me, Elf well his accent was just to annoying which really put me off his character.DifficultyThe difficulty of this game comes in three flavours. Unfortunately for all you hardcore gamers, as of Slayer edition, the fourth Unfair mode has been removed. With each increase in difficulty monsters have more hit points and run faster. Although more gold for all you looters.Easy - Says it all. Normal - Pretty much default.Hard -Well I am sure you get the point by now.Keep in mind the Colosseum mode the difficulty is fixed.Endless mode gradually increases as you make your way through the levels. (Keep in mind you don't keep gold form this mode, it is specifically for lives etc..)Controls & InterfaceThe controls are simple and easy to pick up, on original release the campaign had a tutorial, this helped with the wizard class. With Slayer edition release this has been removed. It is now in the form of a How to Play page on the main menu, which has controls laid out for each class.This game can be played with keyboard and mouse or a controller making sure you activate the controller before starting the game.Personally I found this game is more suited for controller use, especially with the wizard class.AchievementsThis game has achievements, some of them a fairly straight forward but even now I still haven't got to wave 50 on Endless or killed 15000 Orks.... Hurray for me.Unfortunately some of them are a grind.StoryThe campaign is based on going deeper through a series dungeons to challenge yourself, looting as you go. To find three pieces of sword for a sketchy wizard, on this Gauntlet journey you will encounter many deaths.Once you have completed a map (challenge) you are able to freely navigate to old and new missions plus bonus ones.Combat System, Skills & TraitsThe combat is fairly straight forward, swing here swing there, heads fall off Good ol mash the A button for best results. Least from a Barbarian or Valkyrie's point of view or for Wizard and Elf you use the right analogue to fire your bow or burn, zap and freeze.This game can be fast paced and chaotic at times, keep yourself moving or knowing your choke points will keep you alive. It is easy to lose your character in the commotion. Especially playing with others.Since Slayer edition release the skills and abilities have changed, now equipment you buy will determine what moves and skills you have.Personally why they decided to change it is beyond me, I loved that the items were more cosmetic based.They also removed the perk system for masteries, which again is beyond me completely. As masteries, other than boasting rights are pretty much useless now.Sounds & EffectsSounds decent and fitting for dungeon scene. Although very loud on start up so remove your headset or be deafened.Some of the voice acting can be a bit much.GraphicsThe graphics settings are straight forward, this game is not to demanding although later levels on Endless mode could cause issues for lower spec'd machines.Gore can be turned off for the younger audiences.Humour & TriviaDefinitely a love hate relationship with the voice acting on this game, although humorous to a degree I cannot stand the Elf's strong accent.MultiplayerThis multiplayer on this game works well, as mentioned before can be done locally on a decent sized screen or you will lose your character a lot. Or can be done online with friends or strangers.I have never had problems finding a Story or Endless mode game, although keep in mind if you are joining someone else's game you may not have choice of your favourite character. Multiplayer is stable and I have never had connection issues unless host is in a distant country. If you are unsure just host your own.Story mode progress is saved whether you do it multi or single player.Bugs - ImportantI don't think I came across any game breaking bugs. Only annoyance is I mentioned before, is about starting the game after you turn on or connect your controller as sometimes Gauntlet may not pick it up.ConclusionOverall I found this game very fun to play, par some of the changes to Slayer Edition if you are buying it now you will never know what you have missed so this won't affect you. Although don't get me wrong the additions were great as well.I still play to get last achievements to this day, but I have had many hours of dying to hordes of enemies with friends and strangers.I personally hope they make another Gauntlet down the line sometime with even more content.I felt this game did do the originals games justice and I hope you will feel the same way.Because who doesn't like throwing explosive crates/barrels at their friends.Hope I helped.ηυĸєΜ266 "

												The developers put to much of their own game ""Magicka"" into this new Gauntlet game. Those whom were huge fans of the previous games likely wont enjoy this much. However if you were into Magicka you will likely have a great time. The wizard is basically magicka lite. The story is there but you kind of have to look for it which really pulls you out of the game. So this game should be avoided if your looking for a story. As for a party game , or a game to be played with friends or even on stream with friends this game will hold its own. It's not a 40-60$ game and therefore you get your monies worth. However it is not the Gauntlet that we all deserve. It is still however better than that ""Thing"" we call Sacred 3. However Sacred 3 is  more of an rpg than this. You do no character building. There is no loot. Super limited on upgrades and most of which requires high difficulty play to even unlock. There are 4 characters / classes in the game. Warrior, Archer, Valkyrie, Wizard. The Wizard is a combo based spell caster. Adding different elements creates a different spell. It has more playstyle than anyone else and was very obviously inspired by Magicka, hence the Magicka LITE comment earlier.  The Archer is the most mobile class and seemed to do a decent amount of aoe. The biggest thing you noticed is that you can actually move and attack which is extremely important when playing on higher difficulties. However as an archer you have a harder time destroying the monster spawners. The Warrior is a barbarian. Wielding an axe you chop like the best of em. Pretty generic, Decent survivablity but playing on harder difficulties ... is well... Hard as a melee oriented class.  This is definitely the class that at best is meant for killing monster spawners. Then there is the Valkyrie. The tank. The Paladin... The avenger.... Yea , thats right. I said Avenger. She throws her shield like Captain America. She is pretty beefy, Can do a decent amount of aoe at melee and at range.  Most importantly. She has a block. She is the best at survival. Can fight at melee or ranged.   She is kind of a tank anyway. She has a shield and can block but takes a lot of damage. Use of all of the tools is required to play her. I stuck with the Archer while my co-op partner played a Valkyrie and then later swapped to Wizard. We played through the first door with no issues. However on the first floor of the second door we encountered a game HALTERING bug. Where the key we picked up did not actually acknwledge that we picked it up. However it was no longer in the game world and we could no longer progress. That was the stopping point for me. Once you hit a game breaking bug that rings bells.

												I played it in Co-op (4 players). Some reasons i don't recommend Gauntlet:- Short, 12 chapters (3 of those are just boss battles). About 5 hours.- Can't buy Relics (expensive items that require you to use a potion) inside the chapters, only between them- the bonus from achievements are stupid (like +1% damage)- Relic system is stupid, they are expensive and require you to find potions (those are rare). If you are playing coop with 4 people, don't expect to use relics more than once a chapter. The abilities itself are pretty stupid or worthless, like some seconds of invulnerability (but you cant attack as well) or a gargoyle summon (with an AI programmed to suicide as soon as possible).- Food and potion system is stupid, especially because you can destroy them with abilities if you do so before you pick them up- Lacks character progress- stages and enemies are very similar to Diablo 2, lacking personality- The Wizard class is a copy of Invoker from Dota2 or Magicka- Shallow story- pointless stages with ""Death"" following you around, forcing a time trial- Difficulty is not well implemented. Easy is too easy, anything other than that is too hard. Game over is frustrating as it starts from the beginning of the chapter.- Easy puzzles			"

												Originally the game was good, solid fun (in ""co-op"" - the quotes are becuase this IS Gauntlet so co-operative play where you as an individual get to WIN)It didn't have the ""randomised"" dungeons of the original, but it had a neat progression system (Masteries), that rewarded certain actions in game, meaning the more you played, the better you got.Now we have the ""Slayer Edition"" - which is the version they will be releasing on consoles. So what are the improvments?They removed the Masteries.Yep - the ONE feature that set this game apart and they took it out.I want my old game back :(			"

The changes made in slayer edition absolutely killed the game. Multiplayer is dead.   If they would allow us to selelct the original version of the game, I wouldn't have any complaints, I think very quickly they would see that all of the multiplayer base would go back to version 1.0 or 1.2 Whatever you do, don't buy this game.

												Y'know I really don't like AAA-ish titles, but this one is well done. It takes me back. They captured the old-school feel of Gauntlet very well.They kept it simple, and the core gameplay is alot of fun. Multiplayer is obviously best (I played 3 players), but single player is also fun. I wouldn't buy it for singleplayer, though.Pros:+Fun hack-n-slash gameplay+Classic classes that have very noticable differences between them+Music is really good+Graphics are crisp enough+Controller support is top-notch+Seems like alot of gameplay with several modes and daily challenges!Cons:-Twenty bones is expensive, but it goes on sale frequently (I got it for five, so I picked up the DLC for a buck, too)-DLC worth is debatable - maybe play the core game first and see if its worth it for you, personallyFor local co-op, this is quite fun!

												There's something wrong with this game - and I'm still not sure what it is.Is it well-balanced, fun? YepNow that's out of the way - there's a few very odd design decisions.In putting in the ubiquitous levelling up, story, background and achievements, they've missed something of the original and the sequels - its ""open world"" feel. All of the dungeons are built to a very specific standard and focus you tightly down the next ""surprise"". Even if that's not explained to you what the surprise is - three times I had to return to the hub purely because I'd not done what the designer expected me to.It feels very much like a 2010 game in that all of your choices are made for you and drilled in from the start. There's no discovery curve as sort, just a line of achievements that act as little red ticks from the teacher.Saying that, it's still fun - all of the characters have a different style, the key sound is there - but it's definitely lost some of its charm. DEATH is now an enviromental hazard, Ghosts are now missiles of a sort; and it's set around Boss Monsters rather than Hordes - like every other game.7/10 - Treading the same old path rather than creating a new style. minus another point until they fix issues like swapping characters between games, swapping screen size and swapping keyboard controls. It will get a recommended when that's fixed.			"

												I have played my fair share of Gauntlet games in my day. Originally in the arcades, every death meant I had to pump more quarters into the machine. Now, with the series hitting multiple consoles spanning different generations, Gauntlet is back after a rather long hiatus. Is it back to the feelings we all know and love, or was that really just me looking back with rose-tinted glasses? After playing this, I may be going with the latter.In a very arcadey fashion, Gauntlet puts players in the role of one of four classes. In a top-down view, they will hack and slash (or shoot arrows and fireballs depending on the class) at hoards of enemies while they try to make it through the dungeons while gathering as much gold as they can. Don’t forget getting chased by death himself in some of the more frantic levels.Progression is done not through leveling up, but through masteries. There are even death masteries that will allow characters to not take as much damage from certain traps if they die enough from them. Basically, doing normal stuff throughout the game will allow players to get better at that certain skill. It’s not groundbreaking in any way, but it at least let me improve my characters.The classic classes are all back, and each plays very differently from one another. The Warrior is a brutal melee fighter, the Valkyrie utilizes her shield to both block and attack from afar, the Elf uses bows and bombs and the Wizard combines elements to fire off magical attacks. Each has their own play style and really changes up how the player will handle situations, but in the end, most of it is pretty mindless.The standout here is the co-op play. Online multiplayer with three other people was a frantic, hack n slash mess, but in a good way. Since it didn’t take much thought to play, we ended up have a fun time just hacking away at enemies while talking. Also, fighting for the crown when someone would get hit quickly became the meta-game of it all, even though the crown does nothing except increase points at the end of the level.The story is minimal at best, but the voice acting that is there, along with the comedic overtones are well done and even made me laugh a few times. Sure, there is no “Sexy pants!” being screamed like in Sacred 3, but the dialog that is there never takes itself seriously and gives off a bit of charm that I enjoyed.Gauntlet isn’t much of a thinking man’s game. Find a class you like and have at it. The Wizard will be the one most people avoid, but even then, with a few other buddies along for the ride, it can be a rather fun time. Single player can get a bit more monotonous, but it is the same for the multiplayer; just having some others to share in the mindless action helps out a lot.For $20, players get a rather fun game. Yeah, I still feel more love for the older versions of the game, but I think that’s just the nostalgia in me. Even in single player, I didn’t mind taking on the hoards of enemies with my shield throwing Valkyrie. Jumping online is where the game gets hectic, but way more fun, and the tongue-in-cheek nature of the dialog and story offer up a few laughs at times. I would say pick it up, but if you do, try to at least convince one or two friends to pick it up with you. You’ll all have a more enjoyable time together.Recommended "

												This review is a toss-up between recommend or not.  It's not a great game, but it isn't awful either.  This is simply a mediocre twin stick shooter that does nothing to set itself apart from other games in the genre.  There is no story, no intrigue, and hardly any funny humor (there's plenty of bad humor).  You merely walk through level after level, killing whatever enemies you encounter along the way.  Sometimes you don't even have to kill the enemies and can merely run past them.  The game is fun for a few hours with friends, and that is why I chose the Thumbs Up instead of Thumbs Down review.  I don't recommend it if you're going to play alone or hop in with random people online.Here are my main points of discontent:The characters attack too slowly, making it easy to get swarmed on all sides and unable to move or do anything, causing you to die.  There is not nearly enough gold available so you can't upgrade enough of your equipment.  The game forces you to g rind for hours in endless mode just to get enough gold to upgrade a single character to the best equipment.  Hopefully you never ever want to try out one of the other characters, else you'll have to start the grind all over again.There are hardly any useful items for you to purchase, and most of the upgrades you can get are just for appearance.  None of the choices for the combat equipment (weapon, potion power, and relic power) really provide any meaningful help for you fight better.  Oh, they are certainly necessary and you'll want them upgraded fully, but they cost ridiculous sums of gold for the most minor of benefits.  I honestly found that most of my character's default equipment was better than any of the items I purchased, and that's just dumb.The game also has a silly mechanic that allows you to accidentally (or intentionally) destroy food, taking away the ability for you to heal. This is supposed to be funny, but in practice it's just annoying, especially on the levels that are so dark you can't even see where anything is.  Food is also often placed behind objects you have to destroy, making it likely you'll accidentally destroy your meal instead of eating it for the health you desperately need.The final boss is nearly impossible on Normal difficulty yet ridiculously easy on Easy difficulty.  I made no less than 40 attempts on Normal with various friends.  We could get to the final wave of enemies before killing the boss, but we always ended up dying.  I hate when games make the final boss stupidly difficult just to increase play time.  It's a dumb practice that just makes players resent the game.			"

												If you are a fan of Gauntlet Legends for the N64, this game is a total let down! There is no leveling system which in my mind made Legends great. No one wants to remember 4 different button combos for the wizards different spells. I get that the developer was trying to do something new but they left out all of the parts that made Legends great. The art style is well done I will give them that but the characters dialogue is to childish and made it seem like they were trying to force in anything that would make them sound whitty at any moment.

												This game is incredibly fun if you play it with a group of friends. The gameplay has just enough to it to keep it interesting in ways other than just a simple 8-way shooter, while remaining comfortably familiar to anyone that's ever played the classic Gauntlet games.  With friends, it's a fabulous romp that's well worth the admission fee.However... How did anyone miss the glaring obvious ""Elf can run AND shoot"" imbalance?  The usual ""the other classes have different strengths"" argument will come out, which might be true, but the elf can run, attack AND still be picking up all the gold while every other class has to choose between fighting and looting.   Unfortunately, with the end level 'scores' active, it is a poor thing to have as wildly an imbalancing play option as that.  Hopefully it will improve, because right now I'm not pleased with the open multiplayer balance.  Any competent Elf (that plays selfishly, as the game seems to intend) will make every other player feel like their time spent playing was wasted.  That's a real shame on this otherwise good game.If you play solo, or with a group of cool people on regular occasions, then consider this a recommended game. Otherwise... I cannot recommend this game simply because of this imbalance issues.			"

												I've played the Gauntlet games since I had an NES as a kid.  Between the original and Gauntlet: Dark Legacy I put many many cherished hours into these games.  They were difficult and intricate.  The one thing they lacked was a significant difference between the characters.  This game has that--which I like--I never understood why every character had ranged attacks in previous installments.  That's all it has over the older Gauntlets.  The warrior is purely melee (and the worst class), the Valkyre is primarily melee with limited ranged attacks (and is the second worst class), and the wizard and archer are ranged powerhouses.It took just a few hours to beat the game solo on normal difficulty.There's no real leveling system, just gold to be spent on either gear (whose availability is dependant on what levels you've beaten on what difficulty, plus you have to pay for them) or Relics (which are not unique to your character).  It's kind of fun, and I'm still waiting for my friends to install their copies so I can try three or four player mode, but it's not worth the price tag of $15 or $20.			"

												Not 100% on board with this Slayer update. We used to play this with our kids (6 year olds) and they had a good grasp on it and it was a fun couch co-op. The thing thats the biggest hit for that is that before on Normal as long as 1 person was still alive the other characters could revive after like 12 seconds even if you were out of skull coins. That was great for having a fun time without having such a serious playthrough. We'll see maybe they will fix a few problems a lot of people seem to have with this update.

												I bought this when the Steam Summer 2016 sale was on however I had it in my wishlist for quite some time expecting to pay full price when things got calmer irl.I bought it so my fiancee and I could play together and because I remember playing the arcade version and falling in love with it.My fiancee doesn't play games at all other than a few Match-3s on her phone. She was hooked by Gauntlet and bugged me to play. We managed to get 6 hours in on one day and that is from a woman who doesn't really have much interest in games anymore.If you have a friend to play with locally this game is absolutely amazing. The difficulty pushes the casual player to want to continue and kick some♥♥♥♥♥ The outcome from playing that impressed me the most is the drive from my fiancee to beat a failed stage even though we got our asses handed to us. This is often not the case with casual gamers who will generally quit once thing seem too difficult. She was determined to continue to finish a dungeon.The graphics are amazing although if you're playing on a TV (Steam Link, as we were), it's incredibly easy to lose sight of your character. Your character is incredibly small when not playing solo in front of a PC screen which does unfortunately cause us to sit uncomfortably close to the TV screen and even then it is naturally hard to see where you character is in the midst of combat. Unfortunately changing the resolution of the game does not remedy this and will only scale down the entire image and not 'expand' like most games will.If you are looking for a game you can play with someone sitting on your couch, this is most definately one of the best you'll ever find. They have done the Gauntlet title well with the release of this game. "

												This is a great adaptation of the arcade classic, I'd actually go as far as to say it's the best incarnation of Gauntlet yet. Great fun with three friends, Gauntlet boasts a ton of replayability, there's a nice variation of useful weapons and items to unlock for each character as well as a whole bunch of aesthetic goodies including a daily challenge to unlock new cloaks. The combat is surprisingly deep, both the valkyrie and warrior play in a typically hack and slash style with the warrior boasting more health and brutal offensive capabilities while the valkyrie has a slightly more tactical, defensive style. The elf plays completely differently to both however, utilising twin stick shooter style controls and a nice array of tricks and traps, but it's the wizard that steals the show for me. Three of his attack buttons represent three elements that can be mixed and matched to create nine different spell effects similar to the spell system in Magicka (another great Arrowhead game) to begin with this spell system seems complex but once you master the intricacies of how to cast on the fly the wizard becomes incredibly powerful, utilising both crowd control and damage dealing to the party's benefit. My only gripe with the game and it is a very small one is that the campaign is somewhat short, however thanks to Gauntlet's pick up and play nature it boasts a ton of replayability, especially if you have three friends who are interested in some arcade, dungeon delving.Definitely worth a purchase, don't overlook this arcade gem and if you enjoy it then it's worth looking into Arrowhead's online co-op twin stick shooter Helldivers as they're both quite similar and definitely well worth owning.

I just spent the last 12 hours playing on the couch with a new acquantaince and we totally bonded to Gauntlet haha. I came home and could think of nothing I wanted to do more than tell everyone this game will please! If you're someone who was worried about this being not so great, don't!

												This doesn't even FEEL like Gauntlet. They changed way too much and it has this Torchlight II rip off kind of vibe. Torchlight II is actually way better compared to this. The voiceovers are HORRIBLE. The style is just strange. Not what I was expecting at all!! I feel like it was a waste of my money. Wasn't worth the price at all! It's barely worth $1 in my eyes because it's just not anything like old school Gauntlet. Someone really allowed Gauntlet to be butchered! They need to look back at like Gauntlet Dark Legacy and bring something like that back with a bit of a more modern twist if they'd like and online co-op compatibilities with that. Not this garbage. Within the first few minutes I found out that they basically rigged it where you need others so you can get through it or so you can destroy everything that is breakable OR you have to repeat the same level over and over and over and over and rely on gold. They could have done SOOOO much with this!!! 1) Death should be the original death that was scared away with potions and took away EXP and health.. Not this instant death crap. 2) Potions should be useable right away as welllll magic potions! 3) Loot should only be visible to the player in front of the screen so there isn't any fighting between actual people. 4) There should be an in game chat for it. I've heard plenty of people complaining about this and I haven't found out for myself yet but I don't think I will anyways. 5) The coins thing to revive yourself is a neat idea but I think when in co-op mode other players should be able to run over and revive you no matter what even if it's just a small amount of health and when you're playing alone it should more of the coin based thing or else each person should have their own coins but NOOO! They have to share coins to revive... Lame. 6) They should have gotten better voice actors and actresses!!! 7) The weapons.. Oh come on... With hoards. I miss the old style Gauntlet where they threw the weapons! Now they don't throw the weapons! So sad! 8) They should have the level up system like Gauntlet Dark Legacy where the outfit changed as you got stronger and you got a little ally to help out once you reached like lvl 50 or whatever it was! Not this buy your gear bs. It's not even worth it. 9) There should be more customization to the characters!!!!! The woman looks like a darn tank who had her eye shoveled out. -.- Anddd there's a whole lot more I could go on about but I figure this is enough for one review...I am not pleased. Severely disappointed!!!! I hope my friends don't waste their money.			"

												Wasn't privy to the old glory days of the Gauntlet series however, I played it coop with some friends who did and it was miserable for them. We had gotten this game to re-live the fun (and experience what I missed out on) yet it left a lot lacking. I had an okay time playing in the beginning but it got less fun as the game went on. It was very short lived and trivial. There are 12 levels total and the final boss just drags the last moments of the game on. 4/10			"

												The overall Gauntlet experience can vary between a fun and addictive arcade dungeon crawler and an infuriating, unfair challenge, entirely depending on whether or not you play it in co-op.			"

												It's really a lot of fun, just make sure to play on harder difficulties if you want the game to really last!  Oh, and try to round up some friends to play with, it really enhances the experience. :)

												All of us growing up in the golden age of standup arcade games remember the beast of a machine Gauntlet was. 4 player coop was unheard of at the time and boy did we like it. So this new rendition of Gauntlet takes that basic formula and steps it up a notch by giving each hero some new skills that gives it a much more modern hack 'n slash feel. And it works. It manages to hold a nostalgic presence while still feeling refreshingly new. They've added some character level ups to keep it interesting and there is even a difficulty setting if you feel like adding a little more challenge.The biggest shortcoming with Gauntlet is the disproportionate skill set when it comes to the Wizard. He has way too many abilities and other cool effects than anyone else, so playing anyone else feels kind of under whelming. The other significant blemish is its short campaign length. The first playthrough is fun and exciting, but it quickly loses luster on subsequent playthroughs.The new Gauntlet is indeed fun and best experienced in a full 4-player cooperative, but the game eventually gets stale due to it's short levels and repetitive game play--kind of like the original.

												Bought a 4-pack and wish I could refund it. The multiplayer is awful, you all share the same screen like in Broforce, made sense for 1985, not in 2016. To make it worse all your progression is tied to your gold, which people can use the screen to kill you for and take when you die. Mix that with most of the classes dying in 1-2 hits and it's just not fun. There's absolutely no excuse as to why any modern game should make you share the same camera over the internet. Add in the fact that there's a necromancer add-on that focuses around using dead enemies to summon friendly skeletons, but there's a charm that everyone else can use to do the same thing and make your necromancer abilities worthless, and you've got a lot of head scratching in a game that should be a blast.All of that said, the single player is quite fun, just don't plan on having any sort of fun online with 4 players. Everyone just skips the monsters and pulls the camera ahead so you can't see and collects gold since there's 0 incentive to kill anything in this game, another huge flaw. It needs some sort of exp system to punish players for just skipping to the end of each floor.			"

												It's not just marketing talk when they say this Gauntlet is a completely new experience. I've put hundreds of hours into Gauntlet Legends on the N64, and quite a few into Dark Legacy on the gamecube. I had expectations going into this game.This is a very different game.Is it fun? Yes. It's a good game, and it's fun. We'll get that out of the way first. However, it's nothing like classic Gauntlet games. Each of the classes play very differently; they're not just different allocations of stats. As a matter of fact, there really is no notion of ""stats"" in this game: there's no leveling, no character progression.The only difference in a start-game and end-game character is what gear you have equipped - most of which is only for aesthetic purposes. You have 3 important pieces of gear: Your weapon, an accessory that changes what your potions do, and a relic that gives you an extra cooldown-based ability. The only mechanical difference in your weapons is what your special ability does (in the case of the wizard it seems like ability sets rather than a single ability). More expensive weapons don't mean more damage, more range, or anything like that.Levels in this game vary widely in how long they take. Some only take a couple minutes. Others take up to 10. There also aren't too many levels in the game, and there are only 3 bosses, but all the bosses have very different mechanics.The bottom line is that it's a short but sweet game. I have trouble finishing 4 player co-op games with friends due to conflicting schedules and waning interests, but we had no problem sticking this one out. You can easily get through it your first time in 3 to 6 hours.			"

												I had never played any of the Gauntlet series in the past but my friend was a BIG TIME fan of the series and convinced me to buy this game on release. We started playing and at first nostalgia struck for my friend, but after that it just became the same thing over and over again. To start we ended up beating the entire game on hard difficulty in only a few hours. Every level was pretty much the same design with the same type of monsters with just graphical differences. It was almost like they imported the same monsters same soul stones and just made them look different. The bosses on the other hands were sometimes buggy and not very challenging at all. We found that the first boss we fought was significantly harder than the last one. So far you would think this is a decent game with a few repetetive things that might be a little too easy. But that's not the worst of it. After you build up all yours coins you can buy a few ""relics"" that really don't do much to help you and usually you forget all about them anyways, but the worst part is that you can spend all your hard earned coins on ""Armor and weapons"" WHICH ARE PURELY COSMETIC! If they actually had a bonus or made you better. With all that said let's go over the pros and cons once again.CONS-Way too easy unless you're playing the hardest difficultyFound some graphical bugs that made me have to restart mid-gameHardly any puzzles non of which are challengingNothing of value to spend your coins on making collecting them kind of pointlessLazy level design with more of the same things you've already seen with a graphical revampPROS-A decent co-op experince even if it's too easyPretty good graphics all aroundVery Diverse characters and abilities- CONCLUSIONI wouldn't recommend buying this game because it does not nearly live up to the hype, but if you are a hardcore Gauntlent fan and really must have it I'd say wait for it to go on sale.

												Hack'n Slash at its finest. Being a huge fan of the 8-bit version for NES, I couldn't help preordering this and suffer the whole wait.Some people say the solo game is rather short. That's 50% correct. There's 3 dungeons, each consisting of 4 levels divided into 3 sub-levels each. I've been playing at Normal mode for almost 15 hours and I haven't gone through half the second dungeon yet. There's a S#!t10@D of monsters to kill, and the achievements keeps you replaying a bunch of time (BTW, the achievements level your character up, so it is totally worth)I really don't care about multiplayer, so I have nothing to review about that here. I'm sure it is lots of fun for you multiplayer people.Only drawback are the mage's controls, a big confusion of key combos to get the spells right. Doesn't matter to me cause I play mostly with the warrior (That's hack'n slash, not a harry potter game anyways)10/10 (Yea, about my english, sorry about that. Not my first language)			"

												Tons of hype, decent game. Wouldn't recommend based on difficulty/removal of aspects from Gauntlet Legends. Even maxed out this game is barely difficult, and without the progression leveling system the game has zero draw. Same old, beat a few levels, smash the boss, rinse & repeat. No leveling, no grinding, no reason to bother IMO.12/11/2014 UPDATEDNow with the new release of Necromancer DLC for 4.99 it just reaffirm's the overall ♥♥♥♥♥♥ness of the game, instead of fixing flaw core element's they will sell you more DLC.

												This game is OK when played with friends, but is an awful online experience. Being basically the opposite of what Helldivers offers, where you really have to contribute as a team member to survive, playing Gauntlet public games is anything but cooperative. Terrible idea to make coins and food individual, meaning everyone is rushing to get as much as possible. That kills the whole coop idea making games competitive where they should not be.As for game fighting mechanics, although there are couple of interesting solutions, and it is kept simple, the overall fight is to hectic and chaotic.

												This is about as simple and generic an action-based beat-em-up/semi-RPG you can buy. There's very little imagination to it. The story mode consists of repeating the same three sequences of levels in literally the same boring setting - generic brown/grey ruins. I was extremely disappointed in this title. Before the release the devs were claiming there'd be more to the game than there is, and I was really hoping for longer levels in various unique settings and environments, a la the N64/PS2 titles. Unfortunately that did not come to pass. I highly recommend skipping this game, it just doesn't have anything going for it.			"

Screaming at the person who shot your health.  Laughing as everyone runs from death in oposite directions.  Yep, I cannot wait until we play our next round.Grab four friends and have yourself a blast.Update:  I am close to 11 hours played and I am done for now.  In that time I have beaten the game with my friends.  While I had a great time, I feel like I need to let it sit for a while before I give it another go.  I still think it is worth full price, I just thought I should warn people who might be expecting a longer game.			"

												I was pleasantly suprised by this game when I discovered it was a significant improvment on its predecessors. I enjoyed playing both the original arcade version of Gauntlet Legends and the PS 2 Gauntlet Dark Legacy. Pros: Fantastic and fairly well balanced multiplayer.Each character actually has unique abilities/skills (for once) which make them better in different combat situations.Can be challenging at times, instead of everyone blowing up everything instantly.Fair voice acting and dialogueMoody atmosphere as opposed to really cheesy music blaring constantly.Secret areas require some thought and perception instead of firing weapons randomly and hoping to hit something.Boss fights more innovative and less hit-until-dead.Cons: Sometimes a bit laggy, even with computers that have good specs.Fairly short compared to Dark Legacy, but not a terribly short game overall.All in all, I would give this game a 9.5/10 for its significant gameplay and graphical improvements while still holding true to the feeling of the original games. A solid and well-rounded game with a hint of the childhood classic we remember.			"

												Gauntlet 2014 is a couch co-op action-adventure game with competitive elements. Before I start this review, I have to say that I am not a fan of the original series. Sure, I played a couple of games way back when, then I played games influenced by them, then I got this. I put the game on ""Hard"" because I'm a real man and played it from start to finish with two friends. All I have to say is, don't buy this game.It's competitive aspect falls flat on it's face purely because gold is useless in this game. Players are encouraged to steal relic potions because they are scarce, steal the crown because it effectively doubles your earnings and to generally perform better than their friends in order to get a larger cut of your earnings. With gold you can upgrade your relics, except you don't have to - most of a relic's potential is already available to you from the get-go, besides, you barely get to use relics anyway. You can also spend gold on cosmetic pieces, a grand total of ten per character, excluding pre-order content, that you can barely see because you lose track of your character so often.This game is badly optimized, a staple of Arrowhead games since Magicka, even though it's not graphically impressive. There isn't much difference between low and high settings anyway, aside for VSync and FXAA. Because of a generally drab, boring and sterile aesthetic you lose track of your character easily. It's also severely lacking in enemy variety, averaging in five enemy types per zone.There are three zones in total, three chapters plus boss each. A chapter typically takes around twenty minutes to complete, and even that is generous. As long as you are not terrible or don't lose time quarelling, you can breeze through the game. There is a separate survival mode, Colosseum, but it's short and it's rewards, three cloaks, aren't very tempting.As you can see, I haven't said anything positive yet, because that is of little importance. Sure, the characters were nice, the dialogue was fun, the passive mastery learning system was somewhat interesting, but having all that robbed us of actual ♥♥♥♥ing progression and strategy development. If you are looking for a Gauntlet comeback, I suggest you try Hammerwatch. If you are looking for some co-op action, I suggest you try Hammerwatch, no, I implore you to try Hammerwatch. Not this, please. It does not get better. "

												To those looking for an experience reminiscent of the old-school Gauntlet: Legends, reconsider your purchase. Legends is one of the first quarter-feed games I ever devoted myself to, so when I saw Gauntlet: Slayer Edition, I bought the game without hesitation. Not the best $20 I ever spent. Bearing in mind I wasn't expecting an exact replica of GL, other than the four base characters and the famous ""don't shoot the food"" rule (though it is incessently drilled into your head every time it happens), I did not find much connection to the classic.The game mechanics are simple and easy, which makes for great playability, and the multiplayer factor is has not been lost in this edition; the more, the merrier. Single player is actually quite difficult on its hardest setting due to limited control input and the room to room top-down action (which reminded me more of SmashTV rather than Gauntlet) makes thinning the horde a bit more difficult without the ability to efficiently bottle-neck as you could in GL. Character upgrades are limited only to item purchases (NO LEVEL UP?? IS THIS GAUNTLET??) and is rather unexciting.An okay dungeon crawler. Finding a better one to enjoy with friends is not difficult.Devoted Gauntlet: Legends fans; walk away.			"

												I originally played Gauntlet 2 on the old Commodore 64.  I was super excited when this came out, and bought it.  The humor is spot on and several times my friends and I almost fell out of our chair laughing at some of the dialogue.  Though this isn't quite as unbeatable as the originals with near infinite levels, it's still a great kick-back-and-enjoy game.Animation and artwork are great, dialogue is great, and tracking acheivment scores and stuff in game is nice.  There's also another great minigame in there about who can steal the crown from their friends the most though, and also being a jerk and shooting the food before your friends get it when they're about to die.

												As someone who never played the original Gauntlet titles I was curious to see what made it such a popular series. With 9 titles exisiting dating way back to 1985 I felt I needed to experience this title which dated back through the decades. Now this iteration of the game, as is customary with the other 9 games in the series (or so the wikipedia page tells me), is a hack'n'slash, dungeon crawler. A formula that I somewhat enjoy, having played things like Torchlight as well as Path of Exile, alongside several other games.In this title there are a four different classes to choose from, including a warrior (bashy bashy type class), a valkyrie (sort of like the warrior but with a Captain America-like shield which can be thrown), an Elf (who can shoot stuff and throw bombs) and finally a wizard (who has a range of spells and I've also spent most the time playing). Their skills sets are all fairly versatile ranging from the mere axe swinging antics of the warrior to room clearing fireballs with the wizard. You can also buy upgrades for each class by collecting enough gold in each dungeon level. These upgrades range from several relics, which all classes can use, and vary from radial freezing abilities to summoning gargoyles to fight with you. Alongside the relics you can also buy new weapons which grant your character different abilities, class dependant of course. And of course you can buy cosmetic items to change the look of your class. Do you feel the wizard isn't Gandalf-y enough for you? Buy him a pointy hat. Or is the warrior too scantily clad for your tastes? Then buy him some armour. Each class has about three different cosmetic options for both the head and the body. Armours, hoods, capes and hats. Take your pick. You can also unlock capes by beating numerous waves of enemies in the colosseum, which I tell you now is no easy feat.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall I'd say this latest iteration of Gauntlet has many of the elements that dungeon crawling, hack'n'slash titles have and need. If you've played the other Gauntlet titles or have played titles such as Torchlight or Diablo etc this is definitley worth a look. Good day!			"

A Great LAN/Co-op Game.Pros:It's a great party game. Probably the most fun part aside from working together to smash the hordes of evil, is everyone being greedy ♥♥♥♥♥es.It is a worthy successor to the Gauntlet series. It takes the classic formula and streamlines it for the current generation of games.5 battle classes. Each class plays differently and feels unique. (Necromancer might be additional DLC depending on what edition you have.)Customization options for each character. Armor & clothes options are available for each character at substantial cost of in-game currency.Game runs well, and has a decent amount of graphical options. (Also, has 21:9 display support)Characters will banter with one another throughout the game. It's a nice touch, and usually enjoyable. Voice acting is generally well done.Neutral:With a base price of $20USD, it's about what I'd expect content wise. No way I'd pay more than $20 for this game. Get it on steam sale if you can.If you're planning on buying this to play by yourself, you should probably just skip it. It's great as a co-op experience, but pretty stale as a single player one.Cons:Lots of reused assets. Enemy variance gets stale after awhile. When you really boil it down, the game is 3 levels worth of assets, and each of those levels have a new set of enemies. Sprinkle a handfull of bosses on top. That's about it.The final boss is disproportionately hard compared to the rest of the game.  "

												Gauntlet looks like an amazing arpg at first, but it happens to be extremely repetitive. There are only 3 different environments, no other weapons, no real inventory and the kind of maps you are exploring are always the same for every cave. This is what killed the game for me. The graphics are nice and the game feels good, but it is very short lasting. For me it was kind of fun for about 2 hours, then it became annoying.Buy it only if you really love simplistic arpgs and arcade games and if it is on a heavy discount!			"

												Really wish they would have stuck to the old Gantlet format.  I was very disappointed in this game and didn't find it very fun at all,.  Even when playing with a friend in co-op, the game is lacking, the voice acting is dismal, the level designs are obtuse, and some of the enemy types (such as the redudent spectre) are merely cheesy.Not recommended.

												A solid and Fun game.A solid little game. I bought it for the nostalgia as I loved the multi-player mayhem in the 80's(?) on the commodore 64. Unfortunately as I'm in the wrong time zone from all my old pals I only managed to complete the solo campaign here. Unusually for me I ended up sticking with the wizard. I completed it on normal so I'm sure with 2 layers of toughness above and one layer easier, there is a challenge here for everyone.Nice look and good fun game. It did not feel like a chore going back to this game as I played it over a couple of weeks. The major problem I had was (I think) the saves were pretty far apart and you had to complete all the (3) floors in a chapter to ""save"" the chapter and keep it open/completed for next time. If you have kids or demanding partners that can be quite a problem unless you are happy to game through the wee hours to guarantee not being disturbed. I'd say I took a point off for this.I enjoyed the Collosseum challenges too.As I said, I only did the solo on this game and I am sure the multi-player would be even more fun. As I recall you could have friendly fire on in the old version or at least block your ""friends"" in a part of the same screen where they were screwed.Saying that, it's 6.5/10 from me :)NB I picked this up for $5 so for the hours and Fun I got for $5 I'd reccommend it.

												A polished, modern version of an arcade classic, Gauntlet is pretty much what you expect. If you ever played the free game ""Dead Nation"" for the PS - it's that, but with swords & magic.Enemies swarm you in groups, some are tougher & pose more of a challenge to kill so you need to move around a lot and control the flow of encounters. Timing when to pop your potion, relic or ability can be crucial to not losing control and key-bashing in a panic.Pretty linear design, with a few basic puzzles. There are also a few very dark levels & this is where the game shines, shrouding rooms & hallways in black, as well as any monsters & obstacles. Choose different characters when you get bored because it can be a bit grindy. They all have varied abilities & play styles, and can suit different roles in the battlefield depending how you deck them out. If boredom persists, nudge up the difficulty. For me, I never really feel like I have 'mastered' any one character, so I guess the challenge (& game longevity) is whatever you make it.Great multiplayer support & even has a shared-screen LAN co-op mode from the PS port.

												""Where am I? Oh right, Gauntlet.""I tend to say that quite a lot, but I wish there were more options than ""Yes"" and ""No"" to judge on a game.But alas, that'll have to do. Let's begin with the fact that I believe that one deserves a ""Yes"" rather than the other choice.Now as you probably know if you read some reviews, people tend to be a bit mixed about Gauntlet. I actually hesitated to get it myself due to that fact, but in the end, I don't regret it at all.Let's get to the actual game before explaining why the feedback is so mixed about Gauntlet Slayer Edition, and why it's justified.Graphics: The game looks fine, and it's not very demanding. There's nothing spectacular about it as you can judge from the screenshots, but it does its work just fine, for an isometric 3D game. I also highly recommend you to remove the Bloom.Gameplay: that is where the game really shines. In Gauntlet, you progress in dungeons either on your own or with some people, killing skeletons, orcs, demons, whatever. The game also features 3 bosses, which actually end up in a gameplay change and feel refreshing within Gauntlet. They aren't just meatshields. Also the variability in gameplay makes it so that you just end up switching classes every now and then. The game features 4 classes and another one from a DLC. These classes are Warrior, Elf, Valkyrie, Wizard and Necromancer. Pretty much self explanatory, but it's pretty hard to talk about the gameplay without explaining how the classes work a bit further.- Warrior: the muscles of the group. He's tanky, uses either a two handed hammer or a two handed axe, he's quite good at dispatching groups of enemies and can make himself invincible for a few seconds with some of his abilities. Useful for destroying those summoning towers, but I'll talk about those later.- Elf: this one ain't specialized in strength. He's full on dexterity. Well there are no stats, but you probably get the idea. The elf is a fast moving, ever dodging bow user. He's also able to drop bombs while dodging, which is fantastic to clean up the trash railing up on screen. He's quite feeble though, so you better pay attention.- Valkyrie: my personnal favorite. The Valkyrie, despite her name, isn't really made with the use of spears in mind. She's more of a paladin than anything, able to block pretty much everything. You can actually use spears though, but if you want the character to shine, you'll prefer the other sets of weapons. She can either make some huge, single-target damage with her skill, or clean-up everything around her in a 360 degree radius.- Wizard: now, that one is quite complex. If you played Magicka, the idea behind the wizard is pretty much the same: using a combination of two elements (either the same of different ones), you can ""create"" spells. Whatever the case may be, you are limited to 9 spells. Once you have activated a spell, you're ""stuck"" casting that one until you enter a new combination. Some people are amazing with it, I'm personnaly terrible. Luckilly, there's a weapon that gives a simple spell with a long range that makes him playable even if you don't feel like switching spells.- Necromancer: DLC locked, so I wouldn't know but from what I gathered, she's able to summon minions or spirits after charging her ability, which is done by killing mobs.Now, there's a bit more to it. Which brings us to... items!Items / personnalization:Whatever you do in Gauntlet, you'll want that damn gold. Also food to restore your health, and potions to... nope. Not restore your health.The potions are used to trigger special abilities for each class. Said abilities you can choose for each class, yet you are limited in your choices in a set of three, unique abilities for each character. Some of them are brilliant like the warrior one who makes him grow huge and unkillable, or the wizard with his huge, undestroyable shield that the whole group can benefit from.But yeah, to choose these abilities, you'll need gold. Luckilly, there's some everywhere in Gauntlet. Once you bought the item, it's yours forevers. But it ain't the only thing. You also get a third skill that you can choose in a more varied list, some of which can summon illusions of yourself that actually do some great damage, or others that charms monsters to fight at your side for a few seconds.You can also choose your armor, helmet and weapon, but you'll still need gold for that. It's not an issue at all, and pretty much makes the reason you're playing the game in the first place.I could go on and on, but you probably get the idea. The game is quite fun, there's a sense of progression and it plays pretty much like your typical ARPG, although the goal is totally not the same since Gauntlet revolves around arenas.So why am I saying the mixed views are justified? Well, every now and then, you'll probably wonder why you're doing so terrible with a class or cannot beat that boss. Such thinking can bring you to Google quite quickly, and that's the entire problem.If you aren't aware, Gauntlet was a quite different game in the first place. You unlocked ""masteries"" that were pretty much perks, could personnalize your character a tad more and there was also an ""Unfair"" difficulty mode after the Hard one.For some obscure reason, the devs suddenly decided to remove like 50% of the game and call it ""Slayer Edition"". As you probably guessed, the Unfair mode was removed.So whenever you search for something, make sure the item you're looking at is right from the Slayer Edition and not ""Gauntlet 2014"". After progressing in the game so much, I gotta admit, I for one am ♥♥♥♥ing disappointed by the fact they removed the unfair mode. That actually explains the mixed reviews. Gauntlet Slayer Edition is in no way a bad game. It's just a game constructed on a grave, if that makes any sense to you. Wherever you look, all you see are ghosts of its former glory. Most people were quite♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off by the decision of the devs, which ended up in negative reviews.So yeah. If you feel like the game is gonna please you, go on, play it. But try to ignore the ghosts... I couldn't, which is why I feel so mixed about this game. Alas, I wasn't able to try the ""first"" version of the game but I still feel like something is missing. The devs also stopped development so don't bother making a ticket if you have any issue with it. :)			"

												Completed the game in a four player group.It's Gauntlet. Monster spawners well... spawn monsters and you kill those monsters while using keys to open doors and collecting treasure. It does that aspect of Gauntlet very well and the game is pleasing visually, although the enemies lack variety in terms of design.The individual classes themselves are interesting and while it feels a bit odd not allowing more than one person per class, they make the game interesting. Each of the characters has a focus; the warrior has strong single and arched melee damage output and can take a few more hits than the others, the ranger has high mobility and very high single target damage output at range, the wizard has a variety of AoE's and utility spells and the valkyrie is a well rounded class with tanking tendancies.Aside from the cosmetic costume pieces, the only way to customize your character is through ""relics"", which require potions found while exploring the level in order to use. However every character gets access to the same relics, which reduces a bit of the impact that your choices make. The variety of effects available is interesting, but with short durations, or low damage output, they don't really have as much weight in gameplay as you might expect. The worst decision as far as I'm concerned in regards to relics is that while it takes a substantial amount of gold to fully upgrade a relic, you do not get potions (the items needed to actually USE the relics) during boss fights, at least not on normal difficulty. That would be one time that you would definetely want to bring out all of your character's potential, only to find them somewhat crippled.It's not a bad game by any means, and there are far worse titles that you could spend 15-20 dollars on. You just might not find anything that really wow's you.			"

												Gauntlet is a game worth devoting yourself into for at least a 100h. There is so much more skill and variety than meets the eye. It's one of those games that is easy to get into, but at the same time hard to master. Gauntlet also has great replay value with several weapons on each class, several campaign difficulties and an endless mode. It's a game that is largely based on co-op, but at the same time a game in which there is a huge difference bettween a skilled player and a newbie. Meaning, this is a great co-op game, but also a challeging while not frustraring, at least for the most part, single player game. If you're into games that have a lot of replay value, collectibles, take skill and have a rather ''existant'' community, then by all means buy gauntlet. All that aside, it's also a fun game to just mess around in with a few buddies on a lazy weekend. As a final note, this review is not say that gauntlet is a perfect game. It has its cons, bugs and there are things in the game which may seem ''slightly overpowered'' to newer players and some veterans alike. But when you look past all the non-sense some people claim about class balance issues, there lies a game worth investing time into.Tl;Dr +1 "

												There are two major flaws with this game at the moment:There is no chat so its impossible to communicate between players, asking to slow down, take a pause, look for a cracked wall etc. etc.Its hard to distinguish between players during large fights so i am constantly loosing track of my characters.Other than that - i do like the wizard spell combinations but i find that playing other characters seems less involving and interesting by comparison.Overall this games looks like a much lighter version of ""Diablo 3"", despite the fact that its actually a remake of an earlier game which inspired ""Diablo"" in the first place. I would recommend waiting until they add a chat or at least for a sale.			"

												Looking for a fun, multiplayer arena brawler for friends?  Then move along.  There are far better ones out there.Gauntlet was about frantically running around a maze, fighting off the oncoming hoard of enemies, and trying to seek an exit.  Gauntlet Legends was about exploring stages, over the top attacks, huge bosses, and playing as a chicken.New Gauntlet is about walking around muddy-brown areas that all look the same, getting into one locked arena after another until you reach the end.  Occassionally you have to run from Death and his wonky hit box.  Seriously, though.. all previous Gauntlets are bright, gaudy affairs.  This one is all browns and greys.Most egregious to me, though, is that the game can't detect my PS2 Dual Shock 2 controller.  That's not that it detects it and won't let me remap buttons, but that the game says ""is this a 360 controller? No? Then there is no controller"".  Which is a load of crap in the modern world of PC gaming.And while spell slinging as the Wizard can be fun, there's a game out there that can do it better (Magicka).  In fact, any good point I can think of about Gauntlet is done better by another game.			"

												WoW!!!!!What can i say,apart from what an awesome job they have done here,not only was the Original Arcade Coin Op Smash,a massive hit for around five/six years after its release,circa 1985,it was the first four player game i came across,we had two players already with Konami's Track n field,but this was THE first co-op(as today we call it)multiplayer!,you couldn't fit four fat kids around a Gauntlet machine though!..haha,I can see im going to get sidetracked here,so ill keep this short,,,,,GO BUY IT!!!! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!?you will not be disapointed....10/10...Someone said to me yesterday oh wow it sure looks like abit of diablo2/3?!i couldnt believe my ears!,im old enough to have played on the '85 version many times,so to hear that i was astounded!this is THE Original that ALL the others have copied so if you see something in this game,you know where it originaly came from!!....go get a slice of HISTORY!.....im getting back to my game....Game has had many updates since i bought+reviewed this,still feels good,and is best played with friends just like the original.

												This game is definitely fun to play with people. I'm glad they remade the game because sometimes its nice to just co op a dungeon crawler with a friend. I wasn't fortunate enough to play the original Gauntlet but this one is pretty solid. The controls are comfortable to get use to. I have not tried playing with an actual controller for any character yet so I can't speak for that. The graphics are great. I've only come across a glitch once. A friend and I were doing a run and we cleared the room but the door didn't unlock so we inevitably had to restart but I've only encountered that once. I don't see much point in spending the money on armor but the items used can come in handy, preferably better to hold off on using them till the final dungeons.			"

												Good game to play with friends, not bad to play on public matches either. That's just great arcade fun. It's pick up and play, don't worry about levels and quests, anything to worry like that. It's a bit short, but it's one of those games that are meant to be replayed many times over. They did a nice job on differentiating the character's playstyle, the Elf being the closest to the classic Gauntlet games and the wizard being the most challenging reminiscent of Magicka or Dota's Invoker. Steam Workshop support would make this a must have.			"

												Hmm. Where to begin....Going into this (maybe I should've done more research) I was expecting something similar to previous gauntlet games, where you crawl through long and unique dungeons, slaying everything in your path.  While they did achieve the 'slaying everything in your path' part, everything else was really lackluster.  And I mean everything.First, after beating the first little section in about 10 minutes, I looked around the main base and saw that there there were only 11 other sections like this.  Which meant that this game wasn't going to be a long one.  However, it was pretty fun.  In the post-section report, I saw that after playing a bunch, I could increase some traits for my abilities.  Kind of neat.  Then I saw how little they actually impacted game play.  Sad...After racking up some gold, I went to the shopkeeping dude in the base.  I looked at his wares, to find he has some little trinkets that I could buy and upgrade. Cool! After looking through the 12 or so items, I realized that thats it.  Thats literally all that there is for character advancement.  No levelling.  Just trinkets, and grinding (mediocre at best) skill advancements through gameplay.Frustrated, I buy some random gargoyle thing and move on.  Diving into all the rest of the sections in this act were all the same.  The first level is always just a single path you run thru and kill stuff.  The 2nd is always an arena-like area.  The 3rd is the boss.  We get to the first boss, hes pretty fun, moderately challenging, an appropriate third boss.All the while, I'm just hoping that this game gets better.  My friend and I play through the 2nd act, get to the boss, and its laughably easy.  Seems silly.  Whatever.Finally, we get to the 3rd act.  I've upgraded my trinkets, they're both pretty bad.  I spend all my time drudging through these dungeons, finding hoards of gold to spend it on a couple of trinkets that I end up never using anyway.Beat the 3rd boss.  Somewhat interesting boss fight, but then it's game over.  Beat the whole thing in about 3 hours.This game isn't worth 20 dollars.  I'd say wait until its on a super sale and pay 5 dollars.  I bought a game called hammerwatch for 5 dollars and have had more enjoyment and more content/gameplay. Sad. :(			"

												Very solid mostly-coop game. Why mostly? Because there's a competitive aspect to it when it comes to scoring. Gold pickups are shared, everything else isn't. In fact, you can pretty much pull all sorts of ♥♥♥♥ery like hogging the food and potions, destroying the food, triggering environmental hazards perhaps out of spite for that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who got you to drop the crown. The crown is pretty inconsequential, it just adds to your score at the end of a level and gives everyone something to brag about.You get skull coins for killing special mobs, and it's these skull coins that count as your ""continue coin"" whenever somebody dies. It's shared among the party so once they're all used up, anyone who dies gets a much longer respawn timer (at least in normal difficulty).Much of the levels involve very simple puzzles and killing lots of monsters. You'll have to work together to destroy spawners but also kill the monster while someone else kites them around.Potions are limited use items that let you activate one of two relics you've equipped which are special abilities. You can activate them via LB or RB (Xbox controller) but the game doesn't really teach you this at the start.The equipment are all cosmetic, but masteries are like achievements that give you passive bonuses as you rank them up. Ranking them up involve all sorts of things like doing certain amounts of damage, killing a number of monsters, using skills, even dying.As of launch week, there is a glaring omission of drop-in/out multiplayer (you can only join at the lobby at the very start), needs somewhat better matchmaking (I kept getting an AFK game host, couldn't find any other games), simple in-game chat or voice would be nice, but I understand why it needed to be left out because you really never know what you're getting into with public groups.TL;DR Solid dungeon coop, ♥♥♥♥ with your friends indirectly. BUY IT. 8/10			"

												Gauntlet is a reboot of the 1985 classic arcade game. The 1985 version was memorable for having four characters: Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard, and Elf. Many people pour quarter after quarter to play this game since it was so addictive. The four characters are back with the same abilities that will remind Gauntlet veterans of what it was like back in the day.This game offers modes in single player, multiplayer, and four player co-op. You will have to complete three floors of dungeons in each coliseum to unlock new group of floors. The dungeons are diverse enough and you can accidentally shoot foods like in the original. It does get tedious going through the same dungeons after dying and using up skull coins to get a new life. Once you run out of skull coins you will have to start from the first floor regardless of the floor you were in when you died. So, there are no save points on any floor.Gauntlet also tries to be a little RPG by including Masteries. The Masteries represent the progression of the character you have chosen to play. Believe it or not, dying many times is considered an achievement. Other achievements include taking a lot of damage and using specific moves more than others. It looks to me like the character progression turns out not to be that important since the game is about shooting your way through the dungeons.The gameplay is interesting when playing co-op or multiplayer. You can shoot each other by accident with friendly fire and that can cause some interesting friction between the players. The layout of the dungeons contains many cranks that you can turn to be able to advance to other parts of the dungeon. It is necessary to get used to being attacked by packs of monsters. In many cases you will have to destroy shacks that summon the monsters since destroying the shacks is the only way to keep more monsters from coming. Sometimes the sorcerers add to the challenge by regenerating the health of a shack with their staves and it will be up to you to kill the sorcerer before destroying the shack.The controls are easy enough to understand: they are as simple as WASD and the mouse. Playing with ranged characters such as the Elf and the Wizard take more practice than playing with characters that fight in close quarters. I think Gauntlet is more fun when playing either multiplayer or co-op than single player.The people who experience the original Gauntlet will find this reboot entertaining because of the classic characters and the diverse dungeons. However, if you are a diehard RPG fan looking for deep character customization and progression, you may not like Gauntlet as much as the Gauntlet fans. I think that it is best experienced with other players in multiplayer and co-op modes. The single player mode feels a little boring. This reboot looks better than previous iterations of Gauntlet games that were made after that 1985 original.My Score: 7/10 "

												This should have been a hit and full of nostalgia for me, I played the original arcade game back in high school and enjoyed later iterations both in the arcade and on consoles but this version is not very good.To start with, why on Earth can you not use a native resolution of 1920x1080? In this day and age it's inexcusable to not let us do so. LCD monitors are not meant to be played in sizes other than native, it makes the screen slightly blurry and if you have a monitor like mine it will tell you that every time you start the game. The lack of resolution options alone is enough to kill this game but it also has poor voice acting, the close-up models and especially the Valkyrie look terrible (one can argue that she does not need to be the 'uberbabe' she was in previous versions but at least make the close-ups look decent), the keys cannot be rebound which is another bone-headed move, and as you can see I did not play all that much but the dungeon design is limited and uninspired. Gauntlet was one of the best coop games ever made, and the newer versions like legacy were amazing and despite the simple controls and mechanics were a lot of fun and the dungeons were well done and exciting, this game's only real positive is that at least the various abilites you can use are varied by class, although the wizard can be fiddly and he is much like playing magicka. Unless they patch the resolution at the very least, don't waste your money on this major disappointment.			"

												Gauntlet and Gauntlet legends were some of my fav games as a child much like many of the other players on here. The community in gauntlet is great, the game is pretty fun and can be played local, online and local/online mixed co-op which gives it a thumbs up from me, and the endless mode is great fun. It's ultimately the greatest nostalgia party game in my opinion for 20-40 year olds (even older or younger it doesn't discriminate). I remommend getting a party of your friends who enjoyed it as children with you and doing a local co-op game together for the best experience.I do have some cons however, nothing that can really be helped though. The Story mode is fun however not incredibly replayable and quite short, the game is quite buggy and wb will not be updating the game and/or making a sequel ever as production has finished according to forums I have been on regarding it. Add to this playing by yourself is actually terrible for some strange reason (perhaps the loneliness) I would reccomend 2-4 players.Despite this I have had an enjoyable time playing and would rate the game an 8.5 out of 10. I have played many revamps of gauntlet and this is gauntlet how I most fondly remember it. Thanks WB			"

												A really good game within itself, but much more limited than the original Gauntlet Legends title this game is based on. I thoroughly enjoyed it for about 20 hours and then lost interest entirely. I may come back to it and my review may improve at that point. Not sure. But for now this game gets a 7/10. I do enjoy the built in achievement system that is designed to spark a replayable vibe about the game, but it doesn't quite close the gap for me. I still do recommend people get this game and try it, maybe when it's on sale depending on how patient folks are.			"

												A fantastic revamp of a fantastic classic.Gauntlet is quite possibly the most fun I have had killing skeletons, orcs, deamons and the like.With four (five with dlc) characters to play, who all play differently, you can enjoy hours of slaying.Or, better yet, hop in with your friends and really start harming bodies.With the Slayer Edition, this game has gotten even better. Different abilities, new talismans, and a more interesting layout. What's not to love?If you enjoy 'top down' games, this is a must.If you enjoy somewhat retro advanture/hack and slash games, this is a must.And if you have enjoyed any previous Gauntlet game, how have you not already bought this?

												Gauntlet (Slayer edition) is a modern remake of the classic hack and slash game many people played in arcades and home systems. Besides being 3d, characters now have gear and special abilities that can be purchased with the gold you find in each dungeon. There are also boss fights and “death” makes a return as a nag character in several levels. Multiplayer is pretty much the reason to own this game and they managed to carry forward the absolutely ruthless competition from the original. You will be sprinting to steal gold and deny food to other players all the while prioritizing your own survival as Gauntlet is more of a competitive co-op game than a friendly one. It’s kind of like playing Monopoly where all your friends end up hating each other by the end of the game.The game itself is pretty short and can be completed on normal difficulty in less than 5 hours, leaving the only reason for playing it further to grind for gold to buy all the abilities and cosmetic items. Most useful abilities are very, very expensive which means that during a single playthrough you will be stuck only using a few of them. The dungeons are randomly generated, though, meaning there is at least some replayability to be found. I recommend waiting until the game drops back to it's sale price of around $5 to really get your money's worth. "

												Game is great.Don't get me wrong it has flaws and if you were a fan of the original or the remakes and updates you will find enough similar things in this game to make you smile but not enough to feel like a carbon copy of what came before it.Netcode is great as well.As far as leaderboards go, WB have wiped it once but if you are used to steam you know that any non-vac leader board has been hacked...Except for Sanctum. Maybe that game was too obscure but it is the only game (and I own a lot!) that I have seen with a non hacked leaderboard but I digress. If you want to have fun with you and some friends, this is the game! Be catious when joining randoms though as you can grief in this game pretty easily I'm afraid.Sound, music, controls, they are all good or great and the fact that each class plays radically different is amazing!

The levels and attacks are mundane and repetitive. Having played through it once, I have no motivation to play through it again. There are some secret areas in the game, but they don't unlock special characters, levels, or bosses like in the old games. The secret areas just have more gold, health, and potions. All-in-all, don't buy this if it isn't under $5. There's just not enough game to play through.  "

												I have played Gauntlet since nintendo. I wouldnt exactly call this remake nostalgic.    This is fun for a little bit if you have friends that own the game who are cooperative. alone its not fun, and quick match is really bad in just about every way imaginable. my gf and i beat this game in 6 hours while lollygagging. After you beat this very very short version of a gauntlet title, there isnt much to do but grind to get the random, not so fun achievements and character vanity items.  Gold does little to nothing in this game as its used to buy close to useless ""relics"" which you might only use once or twice per level IF that, and vanity gear which has no stats. The vanity gear for completing the hardest difficulty doesnt even look the best on most chars. my hours played are 23 at the moment and i litterally can not find anything else fun to do in the game and i feel like the only reason im still playing is to get my $20 worth in hours.  if you are a huge gauntlet fan, you might be slightly dissapointed like we were, its a shame this game is $20.00, its worth $5. you can get more hours out of free games.

												Greetings fellow gamers! This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the Action/Adventure Classic, Gauntlet. Gauntlet was released onto Steam on September 23, 2015 by Developer Arrowhead Game Studios and Publisher WB Games. The current version is the final version known as, Gauntlet: Slayer Edition(NOTE: This game was NOT reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher, it was a game I purchased for my own account)Video Review:

The ""Too Long, Didn't Watch"" Review:Oldie but goodie brought to the new era. GREAT Multiplayer fun. Pricey at $20, but often on sale. 4/5The ""Meat & Potatoes"" Review:Chances are, you may be familiar with Gauntlet and don't really need me to run it down. It is at it's best as a 4-player experience, combating waves of enemies as you make your way through the Gauntlet. Classic 80's gaming. Frankly, when this was originally released onto Steam, some people didn't like it. I did, but then I am kind of an old gamer. The Developers worked long and hard and took into consideration a lot of community feedback, and this shows. This is why I wanted to touch on it now. I have been asked quite a few times, recently, about this game. Really, they knocked it out of the park! What we have in the final ""Slayer Edition"" is a really solid game that would be tough to improve further upon. The solo is the only relatviely ""meh"" part of the game. Really, it's a fantastic Multiplayer experience. My friends and I play this often, it's one of our go-to's. Pick your lass, and take on the mobs of enemies swarming after you as you make your way through the dungeon. Our favorite is the new Endless mode, where you simply keep going level after level after level until your party falls. the graphics are awesome, and the sounds superb. The voices for the players are a great touch, as is the snarky narration. This is a plus all the way around if you have some buds to play with. It is often available for VERY cheap around the web, particularily Bundle Stars. This is easily a 4/5 with the solo campaign being the only real drag on the overall score. Grab this one on sale, get a 4-pack for you and your friends. You will not regret it. Happy Gaming!			"

Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingOverall Rating: 8/10Gameplay Rating: 8/10Accessibility Rating: 9/10NotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and accessibility (how the game includes deaf/hoh gamers).  If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below!General GameplayGauntlet is a single player or co-op experience!  This tribute to the older games in its lineage reawakens the fun, top-down dungeon crawling, horde-destroying genius of the original games.Though a bit linear and slightly redundant, Gauntlet is still entertaining in both single and co-op modes.  The Colosseum mode brings together 4 players in classic arcade fashion.The achievements in Gauntlet come for both good and bad events, such as collecting gold or dying, and all make your character just a little better.ReplayabilityAs a co-op game with friends, however, Gauntlet's outstanding history shines through and the game becomes fun, amusing, and challenging.Additional replayability comes from trying to complete the game and all achievements with all of the character types.  If you're a completionist, you may enjoy trying to get this one done.  Just bring a friend!General AccessibilityAccessibility OptionsGauntlet has sound settings controls for master volume, music, effects, and dialogue, as well as captions (subtitles).When you start the game, it goes straight to the main menu, so you can set captions on before any events happen.For gamers with mobility issues, Gauntlet's primary controls are game controller, but it works with keyboard and mouse just as well.  All keys can be rebound to suit your needs.Subtitles & CaptionsCaptions in Gauntlet are great!  Gauntlet is not a very dialogue-rich game, so most of what is said is flavor text, but it all seems to be there.Pros:- Captions for characters are colored according to that character's color (green for elf, for example), and captions from the evil mastermind leading the gauntlet are white.- Captions are easy to read in large font across the bottom of the screen.Cons:- Captions do not indicate who is speaking by name.  Only a *minor* problem because they are colored.Chatting/CommunicatingGauntlet supports in-game chat and colors text according to which character you're playing.---Visit Games Reviews for the Deaf/HoHhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamereviewsforthedeaf "

												A true travesty to the original names of Gauntlet. The game is short, repetative, dull, boring and just all around not fun to play. I beat the game in less than 5 hours and that was doing as much possible while playing through, extra 2 was from beating it again with a friend; I've always enjoyed exploring and collecting but this game severely lacked in every way. If you realllllly want to buy this game wait until it's on sale, then it won't hurt as much when the disappointment sets in. I'm not a die-hard or a fan-boy, but this game is nothing like the originals I spent hours playing split screen with my friends.Final Verdict: 3/10 Played, beat, unistalled.			"

												I remember playing Gauntlet Legends on the Dreamcast like it was yesterday. Vibrant colors, outdoorsy environments and good ole' local multiplayer options.Years later and we get this game, it takes a more darker approach with more features - underground dungeons, caves, with a more matured art style. Add some upgrade components and online multiplayer. However, it keeps that same fun-factor by engaging us in addictive gameplay and dark/sarcastic humor.I feel like I could play this game forever and not get tired. There are 4 characters (5 if you purchase the Necromancer dlc) and each character feels totally different changing the experience.			"

												My previous review for this (Not Recommended) listed it's many faults and was 59% agreed with so I can't be entirely wrong about it!!Much of it's criticisms are addressed in the 'Slayer Update' but are they successful??Good NewsThey removed the need to do 3 levels at-a-time - that was pretty-much universally hated so it's no surprise it's gone and that's a good thing.  They also reworked the progress system to be less linear - it's now easier to avoid the obvious 'junk upgrades' and you can customise your character to your preferences, sooner.Bad NewsNone of that really changes the fact that the game isn't really that great and isn't really that much fun to play - or that you'll run out of content pretty quickly.Single Player remains mostly horrid (the Elf is still the only class which feels like it was intended to be soloed) Multiplayer remains a mixed bag because the variability of the classes is still there - you still need people playing certain classes - and playing them well - to get anywhere.  This isn't a game you can just 'have a laugh' with (ironic when it's coming from Magicka's developers!!)They also messed around with the camera for some reason - it's 'lazy' in the way it follows you now - it's also harder to see which way to progress in the 'chased by Death' levels (and harder to make-out some secrets) - no idea why they did that, it just feels broken - maybe it IS broken?SummaryIf you player it before and didn't like it - you MIGHT like it more now - but don't expect a miracleIt remains a flawed game tho - it just lacks fun factor, lacks a hook to make you want to progress and lacks much content to progress INTOHey ho - top marks for trying to fix it - maybe the next game will do better again, certainly this is a better foundation.

												Between the original on Sega and this one, there hasn't been a great leap in game play development. There will be those who argue with me on this but I feel a lot more could have been done with the environment to make it a more inclusive game for the player. I'm personally not recommending this game but you may find a perks that suit you.Gauntlet is a story of four brave heroes that go into dungeons searching for treasure. They undertake a great task of the gauntlet (onslaught of enemies) in order to achieve their richest of dreams. As players progress through levels, some enemies may simply be hiding behind doors or will keep spawning when obelisks appear. When these obelisks appear, they must be destroyed in order to stop enemies from spawning. There are four classes to choose from. The first is warrior (Thor) who is an up close melee personal type. He has a run charging ability (RT), very effective in close combat with his basic attack (X), heavy attack (Y) and his special (that needs to charge every time after use) attack can be triggered with (B). He has fourth bars of health and can take the most damage of any class. The Valkyrie (Thyra) class has the same controls (less brute force, more speed) but her special launches her shield at opponents. Additionally, the player can use her shield with the right stick to block attacks. Her health consists of only three bars. The wizard class (Merlin) has a vast amount of abilities to choose from (nine to be exact). By combining ice, fire and electricity the player can go nuts with a wide range of attacks. Some include ice ""kamehameha"", fireball bomb drops and a big electrical ball thing that can shock a bunch of opponents. Some spells will take some time to charge up but other spells can be used in the mean time. The archer (Questor) is able to fire multiple arrows at one time. He is also able to roll through enemies without harm and it's recharge time is a lot quicker compared to other class abilities. Questor has a charge shot available that will deal more damage as his attacks do not do a significant amount. There is also a DLC character available but I really think it should have been included in the original game. I find it ridiculous they are charging for an extra character (especially for the games price). The classes are given a decent amount of varying attacks but I find a lot more could have been done to make the player more excited to play those classes. In other words, more attack variances would have been appreciated as it would combat repetitiveness of the game. The variety of enemies is decent at best as some enemies will have you on your toes trying to defeat them. Loot in game shows up in reasonable amounts but if your low on life, it's sometimes hard to get back into the game. You'll be playing a lot more defensive (especially with more players) as health isn't a significant resource in the game. Not only that, your fighting with 3 other people to get it. There are barrels of explosives available to displace or destroy in order to defeat enemies but the game doesn't go over and above that when it comes to breakable objects. Sure you can break a vase and even break your own food. Unfortunately, no walls or rails can be broken with force. The maps themselves are alright and they really try to keep the player engaged with floor traps or jump beacons. Sooner or later though, you'll find yourself struggling to keep playing.The graphics are decent to say the least and the sounds are alright. Players may taunt in game and use some dialogue to communicate to their fellow player to hurry up. Dialogue isn't exactly diverse but you'll hear the players pipe in once in a while. The head guy in charge of the Gauntlet will also chime in once a while with his corny jokes.Overall, if you're a hardcore Gauntlet fan you may like it (or may like it for the fact you played in on Sega). I personally find this game too much of a grind and if I'm not playing with friends, it isn't exactly fun. Even when I do play with friends, we don't often play past a level.RATING : 6.95/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability B- Overall  C+ScreenShots : Merlin is using his ice beam while the necromancer is reviving dead enemies  "

Very few bugs, even the day of launch. Fairly well balanced and unique characters, that each play completely differently from each other. The high level of challenge is definitely welcome.For the small price tag, it's definitely worth picking up.			"

Chock full of treasure, secrets, and endless hordes of enemies, this reboot is everything I could have hoped for in a fun co-op game! Especially with the very resonable $20 pricepoint.The unique special abilities of each character have been well thought out and bring something useful to the party. The upgrade system for these abilities allows for more personalized customization to fit your playstyle.If you're here for nostalgia and good co-op fun: 10/10If you're here for stats tracking and bragging rights: Go back to Call of Duty.

												Nothing like the original game and hardly what is advertised. Gameplay consists entirely of moving from room to room, being locked in and then fighting waves of enemies before proceeding to repeat the cycle. Bosses are annoying puzzles and gimmicks. Weapons and armor are purely cosmetic. Potions are now used solely to power relics. What little 'upgrades' there are come from ""perks,"" which are small bonuses awarded for grinding for hours. Which is what this game is. A mediocre grind. Relics are a waste of gold. Some don't even work properly. Armor is cosmetic. There isn't anything worth spending that hard earned gold on.-Boring, repetitive gameplay-Bad boss design-Bugs that will mess with your game-Lack of items or worthwhile character progressionThe only thing this game has in common with the classic Gauntlet is the name and the four character archetypes.

												I really enjoyed Gauntlet. The first time I played this game I was not an experienced gamer which led me to click 'Thumbs down' on this one. That was a terrible mistake. They have made some changes that makes the game play more optimized and practical. +) All characters have their own advantage. +) Enough kinds of monsters. +) Enough environmental interruption. +) Items are about skills and it is promised as you only need to get more gold. +) Easy mapping. -) I don't really see the point of breaking healing items and even getting achievement from it. -) Difficulty balance is bad. Final stage is just way above the bar: No potions, and the healing items will easily be destroyed by you because it spawns where you are while hitting enemies. -) Sometimes a monster is out of your screen and still attacks you.

												The solid and engaging game mechanics of Gauntlet are undermined by its terrible merchant system. Few relics are truly useful and the loadout gear is simply cosmetic. The value and usefulness of gold degrades far too rapidly, dampening the rewards of prolonged play. However, the competitive nature of the cooperative multiplayer sets the stage for some hilariously enjoyable trolling moments. Bring a buddy and put your friendship to the test! In the end, Gauntlet is a bright star that burns fast and is best enjoyed with friends. 8/10			"

												I'm going to be honest. I bought this expecting Guantlet Dark Legacy. What I got was Guantlet: Magika Edition.Honestly, I don't have any problem with Magika but the fact that this game has absolutely no stat system just ruins it. It's sad attempt at creating some sort of replay value or reward system is just a ridiculously long grind. For example, as a Barbarian I need to kill 20,000 mummies in order to do +10% more damage to mummies. Or I need to take 200,000 points of damage to have an increased HP regen when dropped below 30%. This is not leveling. If I wanted to play a grindy game, there are hundreds of others. If I wanted to play Magika, I would play Magika. Literally every room you enter follows the following formula:1. Kill 3 or 4 mobs.2. Tomb spawns.3. 2nd Tomb spawns.4. Kill both Tombs.5. Get key6. Open up wall.7. Rinse and Repeat.Additionally, there is a ""death"" level every 2nd act where all you do is constantly run away from a being that will instantly slay you. If they wanted to make a game that was similar to Guantlet, why not just remake the damned Guantly Dark Legacy on the n64? I'm almost certain that is what ""most"" of us wanted. Overall, I wouldn't say that the game is not fun, however, I will say it was not what I expected, nor what I wanted. This game has a total of 7 maybe 8 hours of gameplay with a friend or two. It had the potential to be so much more but it isn't.			"

I know people complained about the wizard, but I really enjoyed playing as him. The style is a little harder than the other classes but once you get the button sequences down he owns. I believe the game could benefit if it had DLC but it was way too short and really has no re-playabilty.			"

												For the short amount of time I got to play this before the big update, it was pretty good. Much better than I had expected. The game was actually challenging... granted, I wasn't playing with 4 players, only 2, but still. You really have to stay on your toes to overcome what this game throws at you. And it throws at you some crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥right off the bat. For some basic co-op action this was a very good way to spend time.However, after the big update, I haven't put much time into this. They changed the whole formula around, and the hardest difficulty was made easier. I lost the motivation to continue since then. I'm waiting for the developers to add in the option to turn all food into gold again; THEN it will be closer to the difficulty it had before, and I'll give it another shot. I still recommend it despite this.			"

It's what Diablo 3 should have been, although much simpler than D3, it's also much funner.			"

												I was really excited about this game when I first heard it was coming out. I finally picked it up and played for about 2 hours and was done. This is the EXACT same game that sacred 3 is. We shunned Sacred 3 for being boring and dropping no loot and the like but this game gets a pass!? I can't wait until developers stop catering to peoples nostalgia and actually make something new. You can take an old franchise and breath new life into it, look at Tomb Raider.    This game starts off assuming you've played the older games and has the whole "" I'm not gonna tell you what this does. "" mentality that plagues a lot of games lately so they can say they're not holding your hand. I remember just having a good time when I played the older ones, nothing was rocket science it was just good ol hack and slash. Then I played the wizard for a smash and was just like Why!? Why does his mechanics have to be so wierd and complicated!? Also I get that the co-op is the shining force of the game, but that doesn't mean people don't ever play single player. If you do play single player the game does not scale for single player it just throws huge waves at you until they can get one hit( which translates to about 3-4 hits because you get bounced around like a ping pong ball) while your trying to take down these shrines, almost mocking you and laughing because your friends were'nt around at the time.    Your character is not very nimble either as the move I thought was supposed to atleast get you out of sticky situations has a second and a half start up and goes about six feet in front of you (I'm looking at you Valkyrie) so what's the point? I got tired of the reaper mechanic after the first time I saw it. It's not a very hard mechanic to deal with it's just an annoyance like someone sticking the tip of a feather in your ear every couple of seconds. Another negative is the fact that EVERYTHING DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A COMPETITION! The game goes out of it's way to not let you play who want in a multiplayer game with starngers, which I could over look I guess if it fits the story and all. So why am I fighting everyone for gold and food? This is not fun at all. I want to fight with you not against you, if I wanted to fight against you I would play STREET FIGHTER!    This game does have some good things about. The sound is top notch and makes the combat feel good and hefty. The characters all play very different which is very good. Also...That's all I got. You can't get 1080p either. Basically this game falls victim to the same ol crap. Developers made a game to tickle your nostalgia, thought to themselves that frustration means challenge and does absolutley nothing new. If your one of those gamers that think everything was better way back when and has a nice thick pair of rose-tinted glasses on your night stand then this game is for you, but if you were looking for a rebooted game from the past that was going to BUILD from the the classic itself then no..no I can't reccomend this game at all.

												Gauntlet is a special game series to millions of people, stretching across several generations.  But this isn’t a history lesson or a trip down memory game; it’s a review of the newest incarnation of Gauntlet. Let us start off with the FACT that it is $20.00, a lot of the hate this game gets for being too small or not enough content. For the price this games give a very good amount of content and with the newest update giving us a free arena mode is just icing.Gauntlet is made to be played with friends, and not just randoms you find when looking for an online match through match making, but with real friends, friends you can grind with, friends that are just as likely to act on their vendetta as they are to just let it go, friends you can curse at one second and give grats to 5 seconds later. If you play Gauntlet with friends you’re going to be hard pressed not to have one hell of a good time. It begs to be played like 1996 start on easy play all the dungeon’s rooms on easy and work your way up to unfair, because that’s where the fun is had. Gauntlet is fun plain and simple... well as long as your group accepts the rolls of their chosen character because they are unbalanced as hell. It would be a complete waste to describe what the issues are as the developers are still changing things around, but it bares saying that you’re not going to complete the game on unfair without an Elf & Wizard. The Dungeon’s are fun and quirky especially the when diving around in the dark looking for treasure , dodging fireballs flung from angry volcano or just running from the grim reaper. The games looks nice and has a clever retro option in the menu to let you crank up the nostalgia. Issues with the HUD getting in the way have been addressed in the v1.1 update. The games play is solid but the Valkyrie, Warrior & Elf play best with a controller, and the Wizard is a powerhouse monster when played on a keyboard with macros set up.In the end Gauntlet is a grind fest and that’s okay, on unfair it will take a full cooperation of your entire party to finish the game and it’s a killer great challenging good time. And definitely worth your $20 and if you have friends go ahead and get the 4 pack. Gauntlet just don’t go paying $5.00 for the necromancer. "

Do you hate dealing with mountains of items and sheets of numbers and just want to fight through dungeons?If the answer to all these questions is Yes, Gauntlet is the game for you.			"

Product received for free
												General Overview:      Great Characters and amusing dialogue.  Story is a bit brash and short, but otherwise irrelevant to how the game      plays.  Ending felt rushed, but expected.Players of Gauntlet Legends and/or Gauntlet Dark Legacy:     A slight better than average sequel, enjoyable.  Do not purchase expecting to have the gameplay from the       aforementioned games.New Players to the Gauntlet:     An excellent starting platform; will bring at least 3 hours of enjoyment, more depending on how you feel about top-     down action adventure (such as Diablo III or Marvel Ultimate Alliance).

												Honestly, the game delivers exactly what I expected from it with what I've seen in the trailers and various other gameplay videos.It is a bit short, having only 27 levels and 3 bosses (3 levels per door, 3 doors per 'world', and 3 worlds.. + 1 door each world that is strictly a boss fight). An endless mode somewhat in vein with the original game that this one is meant to reboot would've been awesome... but for the price, I still think it's a pretty good old-school arcade dungeon crawler that harkens back to a more innocent time in my life.It might have played it a little safe when compared to the original 1985 arcade game, and I can understand why... but I liked it for what it is.I'll admit, so far I've only played solo. I imagine it's best played with friends... and I don't mean a PUG. With any luck maybe I can talk my brother and a few others into giving it a spin.EDIT: As of April 2015 I'm finding it hard to recommend this. I still stand by my claim that the game is really fun for what it is, but the utter lack of content leaves it downright forgettable in the long run. There are only so many times you can play through the same thing before it starts feeling both tedious and monotonous. For me, that ended with about 3 times.. granted, all solo plays, but still.So yea.. changing my recommendation because I'm not seeing a future for this at all content-wise. And that's a real shame to me.EDIT 8-12-2015: Well, they released a free update for the PC version of the game to coincide with a PS4 release. I played it for a few hours.. and I can't explain it, but from what I remember before, it feels like it plays much better than it used to. I'm still not used to relics being separate from potions, and having a completely separate potion ability.. but that will probably come in time. I also haven't really tried any of the new weapons and their attacks.I also don't remember the updated take on the Gauntlet II theme being there in the previous version, so when I first heard that... man, I was taken back a couple decades or more.However, the big thing for me is that endless mode is now a thing. The stages are a bit simple and linear, and every few of them is a 'Death chase'.. which is a mode I'm not exactly crazy about, but endless is still nice to have.The stages of the campaign itself have received changes in numerous areas, so it's actually kinda fresh to even play through that again.. which was surprising to me. It's also nice that the 'arena' type levels are optional (at least that first one anyway.. that's as far as I made it really before quitting).The hub area is gone, however, replaced with a rudimentary map style system. It's nice because it allows you to access stages on their own instead of in sets of three.. but the look and feel of the map system is very basic.The devs have acknowledged the sort of lackluster camera in this version, so hopefully that will get fixed soon. It's somewhat annoying living on the edge of the screen until you get to one of those 'encounter areas' where it pans out and more or less centers itself.Anyway, it still plays like a modern arcade game at its core.. and it was pretty much meant to, given the title and game it was meant to reboot. It's a fun hack 'n' slash dungeon crawler, and now that it has an endless mode.. it's very hard to not recommend if you're into that kind of thing.			"

												The Slayer Edition is the proper version of Gauntlet. The game is a carefully balanced eminently playable *real* game; you never get the sense that any challenge is unfair or gimmicky. The screen is still 'shared', as if all players are bound to a single screen, however it is something you can get used to. Somehow - perhaps only illusory - it seems less of a problem in the Slayer Edition.Looking forward to more playable characters, new equipment, new enemies, and new adventures. The developers deserve their price on this one.			"

												It's a pretty damn fun refresh of the classic game. If you were a Gauntlet fan, you'll enjoy this one imo. If you have no idea what Gauntlet is about, it's basically the precursor to games like Diablo. Or you could look at it as a simpler version of Diablo, with simpler RPG elements. The game isn't meant to be crazy profound; just something super fun to play with friends :).Get your friends involved, and it's totally worth it. It's still fun single player though :)			"

												This review is aimed at older players of the Gauntlet games.While this game resembles Gauntlet games in a superficial way, it doesn't really play like a classic Gauntlet game.  At best, this is either a game inspired by Gauntlet, or a clone of Gauntlet, but in my opinion isn't truly worthy of the name.  I cannot recommend this game to anyone familiar with older versions of Gauntlet (especially the arcade versions) for the reasons which follow.Building on the clone-of-Gauntlet idea, in my opinion, there are games older than this one that play better and look better.  Either of the Torchlight games, and by extension the second Diablo game (which is the only one of those that I played, TBH), are good examples for making this point.  Also, any of the Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale games, as well as Temple of Elemental Evil and Pool of Radiance, would work, and the latter two were panned pretty badly.  Even the older versions of Gauntlet are better and even more immersive than this.On a related and not-so-minor note, the game is choppy even at the lowest graphic settings.  This is simply unacceptable, when I consider both all the clones of clones of games coming out these days (especally on the pay-to-win platforms like Android), and the fact that so many games seem to emphasize graphics over gameplay and content these days.  The game really doesn't bring much in terms of graphics as it is--I addressed that already, and I won't belabor that point any further--so I can't imagine why this problem would have gone unnoticed.The keyboard controls are goofy and inconsistent among the characters.  I could probably get used to using WSAD-style controls on this game, except that having only four directions to move (yes, dear reader, you read that right) really takes away from the experience.  It gets worse, though.  The wizard has a completely different set of controls to get used to (except for movement), compared to the others.  I have no problems learning controls, but couldn't the wizard have been made to play closer to the other character types, rather than awkwardly fumbling through different spell schools?  Worse yet, the controls are not customizable.  If I could have modified the controls, I wouldn't even be griping about it.  To be fair, I didn't try using my controller to see if the experience is better; on the other hand, considering that I lost interest in the game content and graphics, I didn't see any point in bothering with the controller.In conclusion, while there are people who might enjoy this game as is, it cannot be rightly considered a true Gauntlet game.

												- WASD Diablo game play- there are no levels or XP, just collecting gold- there is no character progression, just item unlocks purchased with gold- items give abilities, not stats- thus the game is very much reflex-based, like the original Gauntlet, there is no ""out-leveling"" any encounter- ""Normal"" is pretty hard and ""Hard"" is very challengingThat said, recommend if you can get it on sale.

												For the short amount of time I got to play this before the big update, it was pretty good. Much better than I had expected. The game was actually challenging... granted, I wasn't playing with 4 players, only 2, but still. You really have to stay on your toes to overcome what this game throws at you. And it throws at you some crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥right off the bat. For some basic co-op action this was a very good way to spend time.However, after the big update, I haven't put much time into this. They changed the whole formula around, and the hardest difficulty was made easier. I lost the motivation to continue since then. I'm waiting for the developers to add in the option to turn all food into gold again; THEN it will be closer to the difficulty it had before, and I'll give it another shot. I still recommend it despite this.			"

I'd like to see upgrades to the game and more games like this. Just fun, arcade hack-and-slash with upgrades to your character. It's what Diablo 3 should have been, although much simpler than D3, it's also much funner.			"

												The solid and engaging game mechanics of Gauntlet are undermined by its terrible merchant system. Few relics are truly useful and the loadout gear is simply cosmetic. The value and usefulness of gold degrades far too rapidly, dampening the rewards of prolonged play. However, the competitive nature of the cooperative multiplayer sets the stage for some hilariously enjoyable trolling moments. Bring a buddy and put your friendship to the test! In the end, Gauntlet is a bright star that burns fast and is best enjoyed with friends. 8/10			"

I can't do normal by myself, but with a team of 4 it is a lot easier to play the harder difficulties.  The archer is my favorite class to play, because he controls kind of like a twin stick shooter.

												A great redux of the classic arcade smash from the 80's. Fun topdown dungeon crawling of smashing pots avoiding traps and slaughtering thousands of monsters. While this game is extremely fun it pretty much requires other people so bring friends or you will be in for some excruiatingly painful gameplay of many retries. If you love the oldschool no mercy games and have some friends to suffer with you to overcome the unfair mode it is a fun challenging game, if not I wouldn't recommend it. 7/10			"

												The solid and engaging game mechanics of Gauntlet are undermined by its terrible merchant system. Few relics are truly useful and the loadout gear is simply cosmetic. The value and usefulness of gold degrades far too rapidly, dampening the rewards of prolonged play. However, the competitive nature of the cooperative multiplayer sets the stage for some hilariously enjoyable trolling moments. Bring a buddy and put your friendship to the test! In the end, Gauntlet is a bright star that burns fast and is best enjoyed with friends. 8/10			"

												Very disappointed with this game. Went in with high hopes, thinking it would be like the nostalgic games I remember.Things I liked.-Slaying hordes of monsters-Class gameplay-Boss fights-Ranking system-Buyable skillsThings I didn't like.-No way to carry potions to the next dungeons or buy them-Gear is purely cosmetic-NO PUZZLES or critical thinking (imo the biggest flaw with the game)-Really, really short (12 levels? c'mon!)I really think this game has a lot of potential. I know people complained about the wizard, but I really enjoyed playing as him. The style is a little harder than the other classes but once you get the button sequences down he owns. I believe the game could benefit if it had DLC but it was way too short and really has no re-playabilty.			"

												When I first saw this game come to Steam I thought ""It's another Magicka."" I like Magicka, but it was so wrist intense. I was happy to find that this is not like Magicka, my wrists were pleased. You can play as 4 different characters, 5 if you feel like spending 5 bucks on one of them (not worth it). You have to collect 3 shards from 3 different 4 section gauntlets, which you will see when you enter the main area. The game has good graphics, runs smoothly, but can get a bit repetitive afterwhile. By the end of the game I found myself wanting to slap the voice actor for the ranger and the almighty BAIN (Payday 2 reference) voice that popped in all the time as we played. Overall, it was worth the price we paid for it, which was under 10 bucks. I would wait for a sale if it's over that.			"

												Its ""ok"". I feel that this would be a great game to buy while its on sale and play with some friends. There is no ""level up during gameplay"" you don't increase attack speed agility or health by leveling up through each stage kinda a bummer. The warriors seem at an unbalanced disadvantage since they are always up close in the fight and constantly draining health, and when you die, your gold is up for grabs by the other players. Ranged characters can kite from a distance without too much trouble. The customization is minimal at best, yes you can buy a total of maby 20 items right now per character.  These characters arn't as dark as the previous gauntlet, and I was hoping for simply a darker game. I'm playing it on hard and it is certainly that and not a bad game but unless your playing with people you know I think Diablo 3 would be a better investment. And whats this you have to ""purchase"" the necromancer? Eh..  I kinda feel like all the characters in this game should be unlockable. Not sure if the edge of having a necro is worth it even on sale.			"

												I'd give 2 thumbs up if I was able here. This game is fantastic and true to it's heritage.You do ""level"" slightly but it's slight. The weapons and armor you have are only for vanity to show your level of completeion to the random groups you set out into. The PUGs can be great and they can be devistating, but such is the internet. You never know who you are going to run into. Is it a clever elf or some wizard stroking his wand? The first floor of any area will tell you, and sometimes even the first room.I highly recomend this game to any one who was a fan of the original, or anyone who likes fun Co-Op play. Normal is, well, pretty easy. Not easyenough to through in your peggle champ and have them excell but if they ever touched a Nintendo or Arcade machine when younger they'll do just fine. Hard is a good challenge and Unfair is brutal but rewarding when you finally take down the level or boss. Each room can feel like an acheavement in Unfair mode. The bad, you can't join in while game is in progress, and if you DC, then you are just out unless the group wants to start that set over to invite you back.Match making, you can't do it by character so if you want to be something specific odds are you'll have to host, and if we all host then no-one is going to join heh. Playing with friends is the best way to go but you can still find some fun with the random pick up groups from the match making system.Each character is unique. In their strengths and weaknesses. They are completely different play styles as well.I sugest trying them all out at least for a little while. I've been on a hard Warrior rampage but I'm going to switch over to the Elf next.Have fun and enjoy the game.			"

												This an amazing re-imagining of one of my favorite series. It has managed to stay faithful to the series and assert its own brand new style.Gauntlet has achieved a balance of difficulty and simple mechanics and controls that has become extremely rare in modern games.Play it for hours on your day off, play it for twenty minutes before work, play it while you wait in que to play other inferior games, Gauntlet fits any schedule.From here on out this will be the benchmark I use to compare other Hack and Slash games.

												For all those who have played the co-op of the original Gauntlet late into the afternoon or evening at a buddy's house, this game isn't going to invoke that feeling of nostalgia; it's just not the same game. It feels shorter than its predecessor and there's just not as much going on. The ""floors"" or levels of each chapter are very formulaic in their design with nearly identical enemies each time; first there's a classic dungeon crawl, then there's a ""race to the finish"" and then you have a brawl to kill the enemy spawners. And the final floor is always a boss fight. A lot of the replay value will be from increasing the difficulty and challenging yourself and your friends.This review may make the game sound unappealing, but it's pretty fantastic for what it is, which is a $20 reboot of a classic game. It has its flaws, but it also has its own charms which shouldn't be overlooked. For those of you who just want a way to spend some time online with friends and have a good time killing monsters, it's a relatively cheap pick-up and worth its price.			"

												If you are looking for that classic Gauntlet where you can roam around the four elemental castles to find rings and eventually unlock the fifth to battle a dragon as you slowly improve your character stats.... get a sega emulator because this isn't it.  It does carry with it many of the elements of the earlier gauntlet we had on Sega but also adds impressive graphics and the ability to blow s#!@ up!.  It has an extremely easy to use interface.   We all sat down and without speaking immediately took up our old characters.  The quick little elf, the bull headed warrior and the mystical wizard have had their abilities greatly expanded.  My wife even enjoys the Valkaryte so she can huddle in a corner and bounce enemies off her shield.  After several hours of play (and a sale) we even opted to try out the necromancer but alas, I am the elf.  I am always the elf! ... and always the last one standing.  If you get mad at the elf shooting the food...move faster and don't get hit!			"

												This game. Wow.  Well, let me get started wiht the fact that this game managed to keep a lot of the same ideas from the original NES editions.  The same 4 characters, keys, walls, potions, chests, ghosts, but it is a much more modern approach.  This game is far from a remake, and is fun to play by means of today's standards.  20 bucks is asking more than most games on Steam, but when you look at how much went into this, you will understand why.

Being very limited with veriety in spells / combos of any kind, I felt as if my only option was to button mash my entire way through with some slight ""dont stand in the fire"" style dodging. Myself and some friends carelessly beat the game on its normal difficulty in just a couple hours. I don't have much to say outside of that. was fun while it lasted? but nothing to keep me coming back to even attempt the harder difficulties at all.

												I've actually been enjoying this game a great deal.  It's challenging and the classes are interesting because of their abilities.  I've only played a bit of multiplayer, this is definitely better with other people, especially friends you can skype with.  The hack and slash action may be considered repetitive and people may argue that the game gets dry because of similar level design, but seeing the game for what it is, what it presents, it is definitely fun and offers enough incentives to try and play on the higher difficulties and do well.  This game is good for it's face value, and worth it if you are the type who likes challenges.			"

												One of those rare remakes that is actually better than the original classic.Anyone over 30 should remember Gauntlet with a fair amount of nostalgia. Over the years, there have been many remakes, many fun, but all flawed in one way or another. But this, THIS remake, is a dream come true. 4 player hack 'n slash 'n shoot 'n cast action. Each of the four characters has a unique play style to master. Level up and get new powers. And because its online, you can always play 4 players. This game is AWESOME. BUY IT NOW.			"

												Really dissapointed it wasn't more like gauntlet for the xbox.It is still a really fun game although the difficulty only comes from having to fight hordes of enemies all the time instead of actually having enemies who are a challenge.			"

												This game is lots of fun, but it has some real problems. It took my friend and I four tries to kill the first boss, took one to kill the second and we spent about 3 hours trying to kill the last boss on normal difficulty untill we set the game to easy and managed to do it in one try. I have other minor gripes like the lack of intresting visuals; the game has three diffrent themes levels cone in but doesn't try any harder than that for varity. The game over all is pretty fun though.PS, The cultist enemy is also kinda bs.			"

												I really like Guantlet. I remember cursing at the original, and couldn't resist getting this. I'm really on the fence about the thumbs up/down rating...and I'm going to give it thumbs down because some basic changes are needed to make this game what it should be. The intro is a tutorial that cycles through each character with steps that must be completed to progress. This intro foreshadows the faults in the game to come. There is a clear lack of direction in the tutorial, and this is underscored by a madness-enducing introduction to the Wizard's controls. Don't give up; there are guides that explain Merlin...yeah...The controls are wonky at best. The game claims to be best while played with a controller. I agree that it felt best with the controller, but I would have preferred the option to set my own keybindings. I know there are workarounds for this, but this is a basic option for PC games and when it's not there it makes games feel like a lazy port. Thankfully keybindings can be set with a keyboard/mouse, but auto-aim mucks controls up a fair amount at harder difficulties and cannot be turned off.Merlin's controls are hilarious. I had to fight the urge to spin in my chair to change a spell as I felt I was doing everything but that. I'm sure practice makes perfect, or macros would bridge the gap...but like controller emulation...beyond what I want to do. Why, oh why, not utilize the mouse wheel to switch between spells, or lcontrol, tab, etc.? The problem is the controls are too limited. Limiting all actions to 4 keys (basic combat actions) on a keyboard really sucks.I wish the loadout equipment was beyond cosmetic...I really do. Thankfully the relics are quite usefull, and the masteries prove to be alot more useful than regular achievments of most games. It's like a limited skill tree that I wish was a little more than kill 80, then 8000; there could be more inbetween to make the grind between mastery levels seem less arduous.I always struggled with Guantlet and even just at the hard difficulty this game does not dissapoint. There is minor grind for gold, cosmetics (if your into that) and a decent grind for masteries...but none of those are really required. The game is fun, but the controls make the game too frustrating to endure for anything but short bouts, which wasn't the case for the original that this game hopes to compare to.			"

Gauntlet - Beast Of Orox(Low Resolution) 
A Video of Gauntlet™ 
By: Munkee

			I had to record this. I shot all the food because I couldn't see, and had to show what I see during the game.. xD Ima show them how we do it in the elf country.		


 (Video what you will get. Low resolution, since.. it is just a example of the graphic issues.)But you can fix the framerate with a guide and changing the resolution to 800 or 640.Hate the new update. My reasons below. vV Down there VvQuestor(the elf), his dodge is still broken to hell, I say dodge left, he goes up into a mob and killed. I said jump down, he goes down, then I say to go back up and he goes right into a mob and dies.You used to have a SLIGHT invinciblity moment after getting hit, giving you a second to avoid 1 more time. Now, you get hit once you continue getting hit. I got hit 5 times before the game let me roll away again.Enemies won't stop spawning, I ran in a large circle, didn't kill 1 person, and every 3 seconds more spawned. Which broke solo playing because I can't survive a small room with 2 liches who spawn stuff every few seconds, I was actually outnumber around 40 to 1 in a tiny room having to avoid the entire mob while 2 liches shot icebeams at me. I get this is always meant to be played as a group, I loved all the gauntlets up till now. Before the update, it was fun, I could run through normal alone, then hard with my friend. Now, on easy, 1 hit takes almost 50% health. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, something got ♥♥♥♥ed up.Basically, unless you got friends to play this with everytime or you want to sit around and only play this for so long you are hercules in it, I wouldn't bother.Easy pretty much replaced Unfair difficulty, because I never remember it ever being this hard to beat.As for good things, they definitely made it easier to get cosmetic items or use relics than before. Though I hate they pretty much made my favorites useless, still cool.and they made combat a bit easier on destroying spawners, and gave different weapons different abilities to give you multiple playing styles.I am still deciding if I want to uninstall or keep incase I am up for a game with my friend.

												The game really lives up to its expectations and appeal for Gauntlet fans without over complicating things.  I'll keep my review short and objective.  The pros and cons I've found below:Pros:- No level grinding trying to find better gear if you just want to jump in a game and not wonder if you are the right level and geared up.  Those games are great but sometimes we just want a quick session of fun!- Game sticks to its roots with all four original classes.  I've found the Elf the easiest to use and stay alive.  Merlin is cool too but my reflexes are not fast enough to dish out those nice spells.  So whatever your playstyle is whether it be magic, ranged combat, or melee it's all here!- Level design is neatly layed out so you don't get lost.- Graphics are surprisingly great.- Plenty of achievements to invest in mastery of each of the four classes.- Nice spells with the potions.  You can carry max of 5 potions so you can equip two pieces of gear before entering dungeons.- Great local co-op fun too.  My mom and I connected two conrollers and had a blast.  She is new to games so she fought melee while I covered her with my Elf.  It is quite a blast if you have other local players to with.  Brings back memories of 4 player co-op at the arcade!Cons:- Tried quick match for multiplayer and was unable to join a match.  I also opened my game to public but during entire session no one joined my game.  This might be a glitch.  I'm sure this will be fixed soon.  This is really my only con so far.Great hack'n'slash fun for everyone whether you are playing for 10-15 minutes or several hours!			"

												I played Gauntlet Legends on the N64, and if you've played any other Gauntlet game, you'll enjoy this reboot.Gauntlet's mechanics, in terms of fighting enemies, attack styles, and movement are fantastic. It doesn't feel clunky, and enemies are predictable but not boring. Each class is bound to fit your playstyle in some way. Even though when compared to Gauntlet Legends, each character doesn't have quite the array of abilities and items to use, this version of Gauntlet makes it work.As far as the story goes, don't expect much. The story of Gauntlet isn't really one that matters all too much to the game, and there isn't much there. The character's personalities come out a bit in the banter between them at level starts, which is entertaining.Gauntlet's worth picking up, and dropping a 4-pack for you and your friends. It's bound to bring a lot of fun and tense moments (especially on unfair mode).			"

												It's the rare good reboot of a classic arcade game. There is a lot which reminds one of Diablo, but that's probably because Diablo owes a lot to the original version of this game. The upgrades in detail, character differences, lite-RPG features, gameplay, etc. are all very nice. Probably the best part. though, is the local multiplayer (which I'd like to see on more games like this). There are no negative points that I have seen so far. For the price, it's a must-have if you want a local co-op game for your PC.			"

												Great rendition of the original. Very fun after a few hours, can't speak to the replay value as I haven't been through the whole game yet, but it is well designed and haven't ran into any bugs.Character building is fun, but doesn't necessarily improve the character, rather change the abilities. This is interesting, but I find myself going back to my original weapons because I like them and am more used to them.Fun for local and online co-op with friends. Definitely worth the sale price.It's a shame that they're stopping development. I was hoping for some more content being that the story line is kind of quick. I was also hoping they would make some more characters.Overall, I'd say don't pay full price but DEFINITELY pick it up when it's on sale. It's a really fun dungeon arcade that you will be happy you experienced.			"

												Hella good arcade classic game. Even if you dont know it, it's fun to pick up and play with friends. Not complicated but can be tricky or hard at times, takes a bit of skill, knowledge and teamwork. The ways to kill your allies on  accident or purpose is fun. Shooting food is mean but if someone is being a weenie and you kill their food, well maybe they wont act like a twinkie anymore. Extra fun if you got 3 other friends but the matchmaking works VERY well you're in a game of your similar level very quickly and you can learn a lot by playing with new people. It's on sale, buy it, heck, buy the 4 pack and ask some friends if they'd be interested in playing.This game for sure plays better on a controller. I like to use mouse and keyboard for mostly every game but this game just flows much better with it, I feel it's easier to aim and not as clunky. 4.5/5			"

												Not sure why people are complaining about this game.  If you play  by yourself your probably going to have a so so time with it.  With friends its 100% better.  If you don't have friends, move onto another game as this is gauntlet, the game of Drinking with your buddies and pissen them off stealing money and shooting food.    It's not exactly like the orignals but it has alot of charm and fun to be had.  The game could do with a lot more spells, but make them easier to use I keep forgetting on Merlin which combination is the spells I need.  Eventually I just used 3-4 I could recall.    Its not a bad game except they want you to pay to play the necromancer for 5 dollars.  No thanks not even a budge on the winter sale.			"

												It's Gauntlet, and Gauntlet is always best played with friends.Pros:-great multiplayer game, expect competition over who gets the most gold-easy to control and play-gorgeous environments-entertaining voice acting/well-written and fun dialog-really neat weapon options and unlockables for changing up/customizing gameplayCons:-color system of the past is gone/no multi-classes (in other words, no RED WIZARD and BLUE WIZARD, etc., just one class per team)-enemy variety is cool but missing classic monsters like lobbers and super sorcerers-clicky hack-'n-slash gameplay is arcadey and can ultimately feel shallow to people who aren't expecting it, or are playing aloneAll in all tho it's loads of fun with friends and definitely worth it, in my opinion. I spent hours upon hours playing Gauntlet II with my cousin when we were both little so I'm kind of a sucker for this stuff tho.

												This game is a yes filled with success. Yes, I intended that rhyme. This here game is perfect for grabbing as much as three other people, then jumping into dungeons and beatin' the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta every living thing in sight. Running around, grabbing gold, and being rewarded for the things you do--Even rewarded for death. That's right. Death. You earn various masteries, and get bonuses for them. Go on and pick up that lit powder keg, it'll get you a mastery too. Less AoE damage. There's not very many ways for players to troll eachother either, since the most people can even do to troll is either idle, or destroy food on sight. But hey, the host can kick, so who cares? Enjoy the game, if you like games like Dota 2, or Diablo, then or top-down medieval dungeoneering in general, then buy it. Do it. Now.			"

												This is a fantastic game.  If you look at it and think it might even be a little fun, get it.  You will not be disappointed.It feels very much like the classic Gauntlet games in that it has plenty of enemies, spawners, food that is needed badly, and so forth.  However it's also a highly tactical game that rewards creative play.  Each of the classes plays quite differently and skill with any of them can let you completely dominate enemies.This is one my favorite games for both couch coop and over-the-Internet coop and everything inbetween thanks to drop-in/drop-out multiplayer and with the endless dungeon mode there's no reason to stop playing.

												Wow. Big Update, changing everything to the better! FOR FREE. Not as a new game or DLC. So much Respect there.Now Reasons why you should Play this game:+ You have friends? This is gonna be a BLAST+ You don't Have friends? STILL A BLAST+ This game is Crucifyingly hard on hard :) i love it. You will die sometimes alongside your friends :)+ variety in gameplay with each character+ brings oldschool hack'n slay back in a new outfit- Food is destroyable, that just annoys.--- Food is destroyable by autotargeting abilities like merlin's chain lightning, destroying food randomly, making these skills virtually useless unless you know the game in and out.

												NOTE: This review is for the Slayer Edition.+++ Polished, consistent experience+++ Great gameplay difference between the four characters--- Uninspired art direction--- Repetitive slog with little variance between the proposed challenges--- Short and forgettable campaign, coupled with an overly drawn-out Endless Mode--- Multiplayer gameplay friendly to griefingGauntlet attempts the impossible task of recapturing the allure of a long bygone era when coin-op arcades were king.  For the exercise, although it did produce a fairly solid foundation, fact remains that the project is doomed to failure: the classic Gauntlet game just cannot exist in today's world without profound changes.  In keeping its design philosophy close to the now thirty year-old original, Gauntlet by its own definition offers but little replay value.  A paper-thin story is laid on top of enough artifices to make it all seem like a modern game, but the facade quickly shatters away, and the game's true nature is revealed within minutes: room after room of same-y monsters and spawners, lost in a maze with little personality of its own.Gauntlet feels a lot like a proof of concept, more than a genuine full-fledged game, and though Slayer Edition vastly improved on the first version, there is still a lot of work to be done for this to consider itself in any fashion a modern game adapted to today's world.  Right now, for the price, there are much more engrossing games in the same genre out there, with a lot more content and replay value.			"

												To be completely honest, this was probably the most dissapointing game ive ever bought. Is it bad? No, just not that much fun. I get that the appeal of the gauntlet series lies in its multi-player performance rather than going through the game solo. It is true that the game is a lot more enjoyable with a buddy, or two, or even three. Additionally, i like what they did with the personality of the main characters; in that they either follow tropes (Thor and Wizard) or break them entirely (like Thief and Valkyrie). They're easily the best interpretations of the original 4 classes in gauntlet because this aspect has rarely been focused on in previous entries. As for the gameplay itself.... It's pretty repetitive. If you enjoy taking on hoardes of enemies using a small yet well animated number of combo's then you might enjoy this. However, what you may not enjoy is the length of the game. The main story line is short, As in there were three main bosses since last I played this. The first is a pretty well done first boss, the second is an intense boss fight, while the third is.... pretty dissapointing as the game was building up to something a lot more intense.Now I'll give credit where its due, and that goes to the dev team. Like many early access games, Gauntlet's day one build was pretty messy, with the multiplayer being accessed via hub. Unlike most early access games, the Dev team has actually been responding to complaints, glitch reports, balancing etc; and has been suprisingly dedicated to this game despite that its already hit its sales peak. They're admirable for what they're doing so I greatly appreciate that aspect of the game.In conclusion this was a dissapointing game upon release, but it also makes me optimistic that this same team could make a much better sequel.7/10 "

												I would have prefered a new Gauntlet in the style that Dark Legacy was done, but this is the resurrection of a nostalgic series in a new style, inviting to new players for a hack and slash experience with little to no down time.Thank you for the hard difficulty, I've never required this much Ham before.

												Gauntlet: Slayer Edition is a remake of a classic arcade game by Atari from 1985 and was developed by Arrowhead during 2014. Basically a dungeon clawler, hack and slash videogame, Gauntlet's (extremely scarce) premise is about a group of heroes being summoned by a powerful wizard to overcome the challenges of the titular gauntlet to gain acess to a great treasure.Gauntlet can be played either by a single player or up to four, with each controlling a single hero. The main objective of the game, regardless of the mode chosen, is about to advance through the current dungeon till its end while destroying the enemies thrown at you and dodging the various hazards. The player can choose between five different heroes, each with his/her own strong suit and weaknesses, gear and abilities of choice:- The warrior is a heavy-hitter melee character capable of a great damage output, but he spots a worse mobility than the other heroes (althought his charge/evade move can knock enemies over)- The elf is a fast character who specializes into striking enemies from afar with his arrows and has the best evading manuver: his main weakness is however being extremely fragile if the enemies manage to catch up with him- The valkyrie, much like the warrior, is a melee-oriented character, but she's most effective in defence than in sheer attack power: her shield can block incoming damage and withstand enemy pressure while the other heroes do the damaging- The wizard is arguably the hardest hero to master properly: he can use a grand total of nine spells by mixing up his three elements. You can use one spell at a time and each has a single purpose: one spell is able to freeze foes in a cone in front of the wizard, while another will help him teleport out of harm's reach. As such, the wizard can bring to the party a lot of utility, but will be a load if misused, given he has poor speed and damage reduction- The necromancer (which is the content of a paid DLC and not available in the base game) is a hero capable to use both offensive spells and summoned minions to divert enemy attentionWhile riding Gauntlet's dungeons is important for each hero to watch out for food, which is the only way to replenish one's health. Should a character die, he/she can be brought back with a skull coin: such coins are available after a certain number of enemies has been killed by the party. If there are no coins available, the game is over and the dungeon must be repeated from the very beginning. Another important resource for heroes is gold, which can be used between levels to purchase additional gear for the heroes. Aside from the purely cosmetics purchases (which, truth be told, costs far too much gold each), a hero can purchase a relic (which gives him/her an useful activated ability), a talisman (which holds a specific passive ability) or a new weapon (since different weapons carry different activated abilities).The game has three modes. The story mode, which is somehow brief, is made of several mandatory dungeons plus some optional arena-like levels the players can run to gain more gold: the mode also spots unique but few boss characters who can be best described as puzzle bosses and are fairly challenging in their own right. The colosseum mode pits the players against waves after waves of enemies in a single arena map and is fairly challenging (to the point that even playing on normal difficulty will see your hero die in short order if you are not careful). The endless mode is instead, as the name implies, a mode where the heroes can navigate an endless stream of dungeons without any clear objective or end in sight: the challenge is about clearing as many dungeon's floors as possible. The dungeons and enemies you get to meet in this mode are basically entirely recycled from the story mode plain and simple.Gauntlet: Slayer Edition is, by any means, a nice hack and slash game which is extremely enjoyable if played with friends, but it suffers somehow by a very brief story mode, a basically pointless and redundant endless mode and an incredibly hard and not that anjoyable arena mode			"

												Great rendition of the original. Very fun after a few hours, can't speak to the replay value as I haven't been through the whole game yet, but it is well designed and haven't ran into any bugs.Character building is fun, but doesn't necessarily improve the character, rather change the abilities. This is interesting, but I find myself going back to my original weapons because I like them and am more used to them.Fun for local and online co-op with friends. Definitely worth the sale price.It's a shame that they're stopping development. I was hoping for some more content being that the story line is kind of quick. I was also hoping they would make some more characters.Overall, I'd say don't pay full price but DEFINITELY pick it up when it's on sale. It's a really fun dungeon arcade that you will be happy you experienced.			"

												Hella good arcade classic game. Even if you dont know it, it's fun to pick up and play with friends. Not complicated but can be tricky or hard at times, takes a bit of skill, knowledge and teamwork. The ways to kill your allies on  accident or purpose is fun. Shooting food is mean but if someone is being a weenie and you kill their food, well maybe they wont act like a twinkie anymore. Extra fun if you got 3 other friends but the matchmaking works VERY well you're in a game of your similar level very quickly and you can learn a lot by playing with new people. It's on sale, buy it, heck, buy the 4 pack and ask some friends if they'd be interested in playing.This game for sure plays better on a controller. I like to use mouse and keyboard for mostly every game but this game just flows much better with it, I feel it's easier to aim and not as clunky. 4.5/5			"

												I never played the original gauntlet but with that said growing up me and my friends would always play gauntlet legends on the n64 or at the arcade and we would later move onto gauntlet dark legacy on the gamecube. For me my favorite still after playing gauntlet 2014 is gauntlet dark legacy. The shear amount of characters that dark legacy had and the numerous levels that you could go thru were a treat and i still havent played as all the characters to this day. With that said i was setting my hopes for this game to be somewhat like that and well it isnt at all they feel completely different. Gauntlet 2014 is still a blast to play with friends. The problems being not that many levels but you get what you paid for here there is definitly 20$ worth of value in this game. Back in 2002 i believe i bought dark legacy for 39.99$ and if u compare the games they were worth the price tenfold. Gauntlet 2014 brings a new feature where you can choose your armor and runes which kinda act like skills but serve a better use for the potions then in previous gauntlets. The biggest problem i have with this game is only having four characters and having them color locked like why cant i be a red wizard or a green warrior that was one corner that shouldnt and didnt have to been cut. After spending about 5 hours with gauntlet 2014 i found myself and my friends wanting to go play dark legacy more than what was right in front of our face. Gauntlet 2014 is still a treat with freinds and if uve never played gauntlet before than this is a great buy but if you have fond memories of the older gauntlets u might be better having your friends over and enjoying whats been with us for the last 15 years. In the end Gauntlet 2014 is its own game and is fun with friends. if you and your friends are looking for a game to play that is cheap you cant go wrong and thats why i give this game a 7/10			"

												Gauntlet is a pretty entertaining game.It's fun to play with friends and you can kill some time with it too. The mechanics of the game is pretty stable and not so unbalanced, the story brings you up on a world of hell where you basicly fight skeletons and other different creature to get to the end of the profecy. I personally enjoy the game more when i'm playing with someone then alone, but so is it with all the other games too so it's a littlebit up to you how you want to spend the gameplay time. Beautiful art and level design, also some funny lines which they say in the game. All to all i would give this about 7/10			"

I know they are unforgiving but death by camera due to weird and dated camera design is not one I wanted in a game I buy.Co-op would be good if your own camera stayed on you and not the other player who pinned you to a wall or blew up the barrel next to you.Play if you want but I know enough people who wouldn't.

												Surprisingly poorly optimized. I can run games with much better graphics than this with no problems, but Gauntlet is basically unplayable. I'm sure if you've got a new gaming rig this won't be a problem, but if like me you wanted this as a laptop game... watch out.			"

												Fun, but nothing like the older gauntlets. Levels are uninspired and same-y, nothing like the variety of Legends and Dark Legacy. Each stage has like 3 zones with exactly the same special rules every time. Gets tiring. Definitely play this game on Hard, it seems like the real difficulty. Normal is way too easy with unlimited respawns. Game is crazy short, less than 5 hours to entirely beat the story. Final boss was lame and obvious. Game is fun to play as a romp with friends, but I got it on sale for 5 and still feel like it was barely worth it. Let alone $20. I enjoy the competitiveness of separate gold and the Crown added a fun challenge for friends			"

												If you palyed the origninal back in the day like I did, stand up arcade and apple II for me, you will probably really dig it, great nostalgia experience. Even if you didn't its a good little game. Nicely done, updated to modern standards without losing the original feel and game play. They kept it nice and simple and retained all of the cool elements from the original.  I wished they had somehow worked the original level exit spins though:) Thats about all that was missing. Looks like Diablo, Grim Dawn, Torch Light, etc. but totally different game play and nice arcade experience well worth 20 bucks.			"

												This isn't Gauntlet.This is a modern version of SmashTV, pretending to be Gauntlet.This is perfectly fine, if you like SmashTV... which I do.The path you take through the game is fairly linear. As you go through the game, you will constantly find yourself in self-sealing mini-arena rooms that suddenly spawn monster generators, spamming you with low-level mobs from multiple sides that can be taken out in 1 or 2 hits, and throwing a few medium or high-powered threats in with the swarms of cannon-fodder attackers. The rooms will remain locked tight until all the mobs and generators are destroyed, and only then can you proceed. In between clearing the rooms, you'll pick up treasure, food, and potions which fuel your purchased relic power-ups. The rooms, in any of the three worlds, will all look and feel very similar to each other with little variations. The pattern of kiting around the enemies, using speed to lead them into manageable groupings, and then taking them out when you have the tactical advantage will remain constant throughout the whole game.Even the cheesy, smarmy dialog between your character and the dungeon controller is similar to SmashTV.And, its fun... its actually a LOT of fun...... but its not Gauntlet.Classic Gauntlet, at its core, has just one simple game mechanic: Control the pacing.From the second you pressed start, your life force was a timer. Enemies reduced your time. Death drained your time. Traps stole some time and stunned you in place for a few precious seconds. The mazes, shifting walls, and teleporters all disoriented and frustratingly led you down the wrong paths, eating up time. The destrucible walls forced you to spend time to get through them. Hidden objects in plain-looking walls made you trade time for their advantages. Doors that led to only treasure made you spend your time in looting. Being ""It"" drew the monsters to you, devouring time. Special potions and abilities either assisted or made things more difficult, costing you those few seconds to decide if they were worth the time. Food replenished just a little time.Every new dungeon level had all of the monster generators in place at the start, pumping out mobs every second, and you had to manipulate the swarms by shooting, hand-to-hand battling, sniping through corners, absorbing the damage, or evading past them if it was advantageous... all to get to the exit with as much time as possible left in your life-force, and then do it again, and again, and again until the game was over in a pile of bones and keys.... and this new game has absolutely NONE of that in it. There is no sense of urgency, and very little to push your pace faster than you care to go.Your life bar never drains on its own. You can take 2-5 hits before dying. Food will fill the life bar toward its maximum, but no further.You can kite and circle your foes for as long as you want, in fact its to your advantage to do so as killing multiple mobs in continual succession gives you a bonus to your Kill-Streak, which helps to build up points toward Skull-Tokens, your Continues.Exploring is somewhat pointless... there are no secret walls that aren't visibly marked with cracks and nearby convenient barrels for blasting them open.There is just the somewhat direct path through the dungeon levels with pre-scripted encounters in arena rooms, with just enough keys to make it through the level you are on, and no random encounters to speak of. Major swarms of enemies can't really wander out of their areas because the generators don't appear until you enter the room and trigger the encounter, so your ability to use choke-points and the dungeon layout is limited, at best.This game is GREAT and a LOT of fun at what it really is... SmashTV dressed up to look and feel like Gauntlet.... its just not Gauntlet.(Incidentally, Devs?... SmashTV dressed up to look like SmashTV with this game engine at its core? I'd TOTALLY buy that for a dollar!!)			"

												Wizard probably blue screened himself in Magicka and wound up here, Valkyrie is basically your generic tank with fast melee attacks and a rather nice lunging thrust attack, warrior is your generic spin2win stereotype, and elf is.. Well, he's an elf. Probably the most suited to soloing unfair due to being able to move while spamming ranged attacks.If you're expecting a remake of something like Dark Legacy or Legends, you'll be disappointed, but if you liked the older games in the series, you'll like this.

												The Developers have managed to pull off a wonderful feat with this reboot. They have captured the nostalgia of the original while providing new and exciting gameplay. The characters are gold and the voices perfectly humorous. The combos are all unique and drastically change the feel of gameplay while special items allow you to customize your style even further. I also have to compliment the devs on having a day one launch game where everything just worked. I played with my wife, my three year old son, and three controllers. If you are considering purchasing this game for the nostalgia or the local co-op it is twenty dollars well spent.			"

												People seem upset by the fact that this game is a ""grinder,"" but I think that is what keeps part of the appeal of the game.  The main questline can be completed in probably 5-8 hours with friends playing on normal difficulty but the real fun of the game is in trying to do it an higher difficulties or solo.  The ""grind"" is related to the fact that each character has separate money, separate ""masteries"", and separate achievements for the colosseum.   The masteries being separated is somewhat of a pain because many of them involve killing several thousand enemies of different types but it makes the game feel more like an arcade game where youre simply trying to beat your previous scores and for completionists, these time consuming achievements give the game replay value.  My only real issues with the game are that WBplay, an optional feature, will not allow me to link my account nomatter what i try; this does not affect game play at all but prevents me from getting some free skins for the characters.  The colosseum provides more levels to test yourself against either alone or with friends, my only gripe with the colosseum is that they are established as ""seasons"" and once you miss a season you cannot try those levels again nor can you get the rewards.  I dont think there is a need for the season system to exist since this is not a competitive game and having the colosseum levels set up as a repository of challenges would probably mae more sense in the future.

												This is a modern take on Gauntlet from the Nintendo Entertainment System released in 1987, a game which was also very fun and if you have an NES, might be worth looking for.  You play as one of four classes (Valkyrie <3) , alone or with up to 3 friends, and make your way through difficult hordes of enemies in dungeons and fight massive bosses.  Dodge traps, discover secret rooms, gain new spells and armor through a shop at the main hub, and more.  This game definitely has some flaws.  The video settings are a bit lacking.  Also my computer has a hard time running it in certain areas, even though it doesn't look like a very demanding game.  However my enjoyment of the game has surpassed my annoyance of any problems it has, and I am hoping they are working hard to fix them.  It's definitely worth playing.			"

												I have never played any Gauntlet game in my life but I knew what it was all about and when this one was announced it picked my interest immediately. It didn't disappoint.It carries that ""arcade type of game"" vibe with some modern concepts to spice things up. It won't generate random maps, which is a bummer for some, but others will find amusing to memorize all the choking points, barrel bomb positions, spawners, secret rooms... Just like an arcade game of the good old days. Gauntlet 2014 is an action game with some RPG elements. This is no Diablo. If you want to dodge an incoming attack you better get out of the way. If you want to block you better push the block button. There's no chance dictated by status here. You either do it or get hit and they hit hard. The game is quite a challenge.The four classes are well implemented and they are completely different from each other. The animations are good and the moves are consistent to the class. The way developers managed to make they work in sinergy during multiplayer, each playing its role, is commendable and it adds a lot to the fantasy setting and fun. This game solo is quite good. Play it online and you're going to have a blast. Gauntlet 2014 is a simple/deep kind of game. You pick the basics right away but it takes some time to trully master it.Graphically speaking its a nice game. It won't win any ""best graphics of the year"" prize but its not ugly at all. If you're like me, far from a high end PC, Gauntlet might be a good surprise. The same can be said about sound. The music is dynamic. Calm and enigmatc when no monster is around and tense for that moment you see a horde coming your way. Sound effects are also good. Clash of weapons, magic being cast, voices... They are all nice and add a lot to the overall experience. Talking about voice, some dialogs here are going to put a smile on your face.I see a lot of people complaining about lack of content and most of them have played the game for less than 15 hours and rushed to the final boss. Indeed, if you're looking for a huge amount of stages and all you do is push foward you're in for a disappointment but if you like games where you must trully learn a class to reach ""suck my Yoda"" type of mastery look no further. The game also offers some very lite RPG elements like relics that are basically skills you can use in battle, masteries that increase your character strenght and defense the more you play and some cosmetic equips beating the game on multiple difficulties. When you're done, master another class and have fun for more 20 or 30 hours.I'm having lotsa fun with this game but I do understand its not for everyone. If you exclusively like games that offer infinite ammount of random generated dungeons and/or deep and complex character development, stay away. This is not for you. If you're looking for a game with a gameplay thats simple and deep at the same time, addictive and most of all, fun, you can't go wrong with Gauntlet 2014.Uptade 10-dec-14:New content! Colosseum free!New class Necromancer!!! 5 bucks!!! (you know its cheap - you know you want it)			"

												WARNING!!!If you enjoy Gauntlet Games please read this!!!First off i am very disappointed with this version of Gauntlet, This fell WAY short of Gauntlet Legends 64 in many ways.Quick rundown1. The leveling system - gone, no more yellow wizard has leveled up. And no leveling up to 1-99. your the same level all the time.2. Game is way shorter then the version from 1998, if anything it should have been longer. can be beaten in less then 3 hours alone.3. Uncreative level design, no different worlds , just doors with numbers. Plus most levels looked alike to me, either it was in a dark cave or in hell is seemed. What happened to like, Mountain, Castle, Town, Cathedral,  Battlefield, and the Underworld.  And having to travel to get there.    4.  Not being able to make yourself stronger sucks, you have to buy relics that you can't even use unless you find a potion. and all the armor/weapon upgrades are just for show. ruining any reason for me to play the game again. meaning ZERO replay value to me.5. This game honestly looks like a not free version of Crimson Alliance, except Crimson Alliance it better in everyway. Making it, in my opinion a ripe off of that game.I had such high hopes for this game and i felt they really dropped the ball on this one. I was really looking forward on my down time to play this game a few hours a week and level up all the classes to see how they played when maxed out. And that will not be happening without a leveling system, making no reason for me to play the game again after i beat it. And all the uncreative level design also really ruined the experience even more. then finding out i can't even upgrade my characters, except relics which are one of the dumbest features that are upgraded with gold not XP. And to top it of, to find out it is like a rip off of another game and not even like its former self. Tops it off for me. And this makes this the worst game i ever spent my money on with steam. So Save your money if you expect to have a flashback to 1998 gaunlet series.Over all my opinion on this game, is it's bad and thats that.:(			"

												A great remaster of a great game from my childhood.  The game has great visuals, good control both fluid and no lag.  I have yet to dive into a multiplayer game but I can't wait.  The replayablity of the game seems to be from the ability to play each of the four classes, unlocking stat boosts along the way for each one.  Worth the money and the time to play it.			"

												Waaay too grindy without nearly enough variety in the levels. The rooms all seem super flat wtihout any variety in height. I remember classic gauntlet games had waterfalls, sprawling valleys, immense wooden towers, human slaughterhouses, cryptic collectables, several diverse bosses, familiars, the circus of the damned, hell, graveyards, plains saturated in green vomitous zepplin filth, caves, cooperative attacks, the list goes on and on.All that's left is *kill 1000 enemies and you'll do five percent more damage* bonuses that rehash the gameplay as poorly as killing floor, alongside what feels like no variety in the dungeons.Worst part is every level wtih death chasing you the graphics go haywire and artifacts make it impossible to see. No other game I play does that so I'm thinking it's not my video card.			"

												As you can see, I recommend this game, but it comes with a few caveats.If you're wanting an experience similar to the classic Gauntlet games, or even like the newer 3D versions like Dark Legacy, this is probably not the game you're looking for. You want to go look at Hammerwatch instead. Trust me.That's not to say this is a bad game, but it has a lot of short comings, and many gameplay elements of Gauntlet have been dropped, some new ones added, and it just doesn't really feel like the Gauntlet I grew up with. Which to be fair, is one of my favorite games of all time. Both the classic versions and the 3D ones.Dungeon floors aren't randomized, and while I know this wasn't a feature in the other games in this series, in the current game market this just feels lazy. I'm already getting sick of running the same (very few) levels over and over with the only change being which character I play as. Secrets and the like are also mysteriously lacking.We might as well talk about those characters, actually. Each one plays differently, and not just in regard to how they attack or what skills they use. They fundamentally control different from each other. The Wizard, for instance, mixes two elements together to create one of a number of spells. The Elf plays similar to a twin stick shooter character, akin to Smash TV or Beat Hazard. The Warrior and Valkyrie are kind of similar, but the Valkyrie has the ability to tank, and defend the party with her shield.She's also very overpowered compared to the other characters (in my opinion at least) once you learn to use her effectively. A lot of people don't even play her as a tank, and instead spear rush nonstop, which does a lot of damage very quickly. This makes it easy to lead a game in points from having a really high kill score compared to the other players. This is especially true if they haven't learned how to use their character yet.Each character also has a set of challenges that come with them, which unlock little passive buffs when you complete them. Kill 2000 mummies, get +10% damage against them. Things like this. Progress is not shared across characters, so if you have been mainly playing as one class, then join a multiplayer game where that class is already taken, you'll be missing all the unlocked bonuses for that character, as well as any relics they have bought. There are a couple minor bugs and AI quirks (enemies can't walk under bridges that are on a higher level than them?), but nothing that is a huge issue. I've only had one instance of the game bugging out and putting me in a state where I could not progress because of a gate not opening as it should have.It's a co-op game, but not really. What I mean is that it is in your best interest (even if it's not the parties best interest) to hog everything for yourself, let other people die so you can steal the gold they drop, and generally act like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to people you don't know.  While I really don't have a problem with the game allowing that, it has never been how I played Gauntlet with my friends. You always do a lot better if you work as a damn team, even if your score won't be as high from being selfish. Joining online games is a real chore, and it usually takes me upwards of ten attempts before it finally joins a game without either giving me a timeout error or saying the game is already full.There's no way to communicate with the other players, outside of four nearly useless emotes that are mapped to the D-pad.  Maybe this was the intent, but when I can just shift+tab to talk to the people via Steam's built in chat, this just feels like an oversight and creates an extra step (and one that takes me out of the game) to offer advice. The biggest problem with not being able to communicate, to me at least, is that it is really bothersome to try to figure out which level everyone wants to do when starting a multiplayer game. Again, this isn't a bad game, but if you really want something like Gauntlet, go pick up Hammerwatch instead. Otherwise, I'd really wait for a sale for this one.			"

												An excellent homage to the old school arcade game, this reiteration plays exactly like you would expect. You have four characters, each with their own skills and abilities, and you team up with friends to obliterate huge waves of enemies, all while splitting up (or fighting over) the spoils. The voice acting is very witty and entertaining for all the characters, and each character has ""masteries"" which you unlock by doing certain things in game, such as killing x amount of a certain monster, or even dying multiple times on a level. These masteries unlock subtle but useful passive abilities on that character, such as slightly increased damage, or a longer spawn protection. While rather linear, this is a great dungeon crawler game, especially with friends. And at a modest price of $20 (like Torchlight II), you can't go wrong.			"

												I do love the game.  While the fun hack and slash co-op feel of the original is wonderfully preserved, the new reboot adds new depth through diversifying the playstyles of the classes.  The in-game interaction between the 4 heroes who are old friends (since 1985) is endearing and nostalgic, the music and stages are beautiful.  Controls feel nice and fluid, and the difficulty levels are well balanced.  While many of the negative reviews are true (ie: short content, lack of communication features, need for better matchmaking), the developers of the game do monitor the forums for feedback. Bottom line is: it is great fun, and there's more to come.Edit (Dec 1, 2014): as of this edit, patch 1.04 had gone live, improving many features such as the matchmaking, in-game communication, and rebalancing the classes.  I recommend the game even more highly now.			"

												The nostalgia is strong with this one, I was ten years old in 1985 & my favourite game at the local Arcades was Gauntlet. I played this to death with my friends and this remake does the original justice. Another game from the same era was Smash TV, it involved kiting yourself around avoiding waves of incoming enemy's. There are many similarities between the two games, both involved avoiding zerging waves of enemies which created a high thrill ""seat of your pants"" gameplay. Gauntlet can be compared to many games including Diablo and other action RPG's though it is still very unique in its style. This was a genre defining game that has never been equalled and without doubt is a must play for all Action RPG fans. I give this remake a 9/10, it is very true to the original and that's what makes it great.WARNING: This is not a game for those who need Epic L00t as there is none. The gear you unlock by completing certain stages at different difficulty levels is purely cosmetic. Relics and Mastery levels add some abilities and increased power to your characters but these are the only none cosmetic customisations available.			"

												I bought this game as a 4 pack thinking my friends would enjoy it (4 of us total).   However, we all found the game more tedious and annoying than enjoyable.   The reward system in the game makes you want to gouge your eyes out with a dull spoon.   They tie the relics to potions which don't drop frequently enough to make them useful.  You end up ""saving"" the few you do get to the point where they become useless.   A better system would be that the potions boost the effectiveness of your relics.  The relics if not boosted, would be on some timer.  This would give you the thrill of feeling like you had some nice power to use in tight situations, but not make the game seem too easy.   Having potions to boost the effectiveness would give you the option to save the power until a very tough fight or simply clean house when you had the boost active.  The other annoying detail is the destructibility of the healing and relic powering potions.  The tight quarters force you to use your powerful aoe spells to survive.  However, those same spells blow up your only means of a) powering your relics and b) healing yourself.  I found myself driven into a frenzy of madness.  You are slivers away from death, surrounded, and forced to use your only means of defense to blow up enemies and unintentionally, your salvation.   We all gave up before we could finish it since the joy was sucked out of the game with annoying mechanics and a terrible loot / reward system. "

												Brilliant game with the essence of (at least what I remember of) Gauntlet. Might get boring if played alone, but the Quick Play or the hosting capacity of the game makes this problem only a minor setback. The classes are somewhat easy to grasp and get a hold of (except maybe the Wizard, but hey, you're Merlin, come on, cast some spells if it is THAT easy). Only 3 different worlds with 4 levels in each but on higher difficulties, you will have what you paid for. Bring in some friends and brace yourselves, because enemies are coming... and they won't stop soon.Tl;DR : Rolled into an explosive barrel with my archer and burst into pieces, 12/10, would buy again.

												A ""Diablo lite"".Manages to capture a portion of the feeling of the 1985 original. However, by today's standards the game doesn't offer much variety. Only a handful of useful items to purchase and not much in the way of character development. This does have the benefit of new players being able to jump right in to play with old players' characters, as a new character can be almost as useful as an old one. The flipside is that character development doesn't offer much incentive to keep playing.The campaign is a bit short, I'd estimate it will be over in 6-8 hours, but for 20 Eur it's an okay deal and the harder difficulty levels can extend its lifetime a bit.The real meat of the game is the co-op. The more friends you play with, the more fun you have, and although the game itself doesn't offer voice chat, using it is definitely recommended.At the time of the release the game seemed a bit unpolished and suffered from some cosmetic bugs (the end level mastery achievement descriptions seemed to have some wonky numbers) and some other small annoyances (enemies get rarely stuck inside obstacles making them difficult to kill, no text or voice chat etc.). Nothing gamebreaking though, and they'll hopefully be fixed in future updates.In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this for single players, but groups of friends will have a blast. Don't shoot the food, man.			"

												I was reasonably interested to hear that a new Gauntlet game was in the pipeline BUT at that stage I didn't know which pipeline it was in. I hoped it wouldn't be coming from the same one which has blurted forth the gaming equivalent of hot, liquid turds in the name of Gauntlet since the 1980's.It seems that instead of serving us up complete effluent they have instead managed some kind of plumbing tomfoolery which has resulted in the effluent being mixed with cool, pure water. The resulting fluid can fill a glass but it is possibly not a glass one would choose to drink from. Some of the benefits of the game...1) Graphics are nice and (vaguely) evocative of the original game. Nothing looks bad and the game runs well. Everything looks reasonable for an arpg, tbh. Fairly stereotypical but then Gauntlet was pretty much first on the block for this kind of thing. However, there is little to no variation within a dungeon ""set"", which isn't in line with the original, there are just themed ""worlds"" which are not unlike the crap we had to munch through with ""Gauntlet: Dark Legacy""2) Multiplayer works well, netcode seems tight. Now that the ""cannot connect to Gauntlet online"" random messages have ceased thanks to a post release patch, the netcode works well. Compared to something like Magicka which is still, imo, in a broken ""online"" state, Gauntlet runs perfectly. No real problems to report, no lag issues as such. 3) It's a good game for a little while, especially for fans of the original BUT this only lasts a short time. One of the key factors of the original was that there were a lot of different dungeons pooled randomly from a larger set, many of which could be flipped and changed in ways by the game before they were presented to the player. No two playthroughs would be quite the same. This is not the case in the new version, with only a few levels being occasionally ""flipped"" but they're very familiar whatever way round you do them after a very few playthroughs.BAD POINTS1) Skill trees have been added but instead of making the game something one would return to in order to ""level up"" items etc we are presented with something that's nothing more than a skin buying interface (buying skins with ingame money does nothing to your character and they are barely visible) and the option to buy ""spells"" (more on these on point 2). You can collect more than enough money very quickly to buy all of these things. Also, each upgrade is NOT character specific, with only 2 skills being particular to each character. This is nonsense. It just means, basically, that you're endlessly playing the game to unlock more of the same stuff (unlocks do not migrate across characters)2) Spells are terrible. ""Potions"" in the original Gauntlet worked as ""Smart bombs"" which would destroy onscreen monsters, particularly ""Death"" (More on this explained in point 3) but instead of keeping them the same the developers saw fit to wangle them into some rubbish kind of ""Special move"" enabling fandango. Preposterous. So, basically, you have to have a potion in your possession to perform your Special move. This means players simply signpost points in levels, grind out enough potions then all just launch the same kind of devastating, battle winning special. This renders the game really boring and, as a direct result of how the game progresses coupled with this stupid idea, the ""end of level"" bosses actually get progressively easier as the players become more invincible (in chosen situations). It's a really stupid, crappy system. They should have based these Special abilities on kills or a rage meter or something like that and kept potions the same. In the original game, the wizard could clear a screen by firing off a potion, with the other characters doing progressively less damage with them (warrior being least proficient). Potions were more rare, usually, whereas I feel the new version gives too many, with everyone able to just blast out specials by the time you reach the end of a particular dungeon set.3) Death is rubbish in this game. People who play/played Gauntlet will know what I mean but for the benefit of those not familiar, Death in Gauntlet is a physical character. In the original he would chase the players and steal health unless someone used a potion. Using a potion ""killed"" him, for the time being. There could be multiple ""deaths"" on one level, though. They were quite fun and an interesting alternative to ploughing through loads of ""nasties"". Anyway, ""Death"" is nothing like that in the new version. Instead of being in the main levels, he gets his own set of levels which really DO NOT WORK. They're not much fun and get old very quick. He appears, chases you for a bit, then disappears. This happens as you're pushed through a linear set of rooms and, yeah, gets old. Death is not remotely troublesome, either, and you can simply run round and round him. He even smashes crates/pots by passing over them so you can use him to collect money. He's basically rubbish in this version of the game, pushed into a sidequest of sorts (which is short and lame YET counts as a ""main level"")4) GENERATORS. GENERATORS, FOR CHRISTS SAKES, NOT ""SUMMONING STONES"". JESUS ! WTF !? The summoning stones are a BAD idea. They even sound rubbish. ""GENERATOR"" sounds so much more malevolent and directionless. ""Summoning stones"" take the place of generators in this version of the game but they're a really lame replacement. In the original, Generators were in place in the level anyway. You could see them from far away. In this version you will usually walk into a room, the doors will shut, and a Summoning Stone will appear. From this, enemies will come and you smash them up then smash the stone. Doors open. Proceed. Pretty lame, tbh. There are no ""levels"" of summoning stone, either, whereas the original game had varying strengths of Generator that spewed various strengths of creature. Also, there were ghost generators in the original game. In this game, ghosts are confined to just appearing on the ""death"" mini-levels. They just appear in tiny groups, following him. Useless. Gone are the days of masses of monsters (including ghosts, see LEVEL ONE IN THE ORIGINAL GAME FFS) generating and pushing at the backs of doors, instead we get the occasional room that's been ""set up"" with standing monsters but nothing like the original dungeons, creaking with scum to be destroyed. It's like everything in this game is just waiting for you to turn up before it'll appear, which takes away from the ""world of absolute violence"" vibe that many so loved about the original. Then again, that might just have been me. I'm asian.5) This is a SHORT game. It's not got anywhere near the replayability of the original and in a couple of playthroughs (or less) you'll most likely have enough gold to max everything on your (not very unique) character. It's really hurt by not having random levels of the kind offered by stuff like Full Mojo Rampage (and many other such games). With no real need (or, perhaps, desire ?) to replay for more xp and to enjoy some different levels, there's little to return to this game for and we, once again, encounter the same problem that has plagued all of the more modern Gauntlet updates. NOT ENOUGH GAME. Why, when the original paved the way for randomising such a large amount of gameplay elements do we have to put up with this NONSENSE ? We were even promised such things in this version of the game but there is no such thing (99% of the time) here. 6) Price. It's too expensive for what it is and the new character should have been free DLC. The base game doesn't contain a fair few things that were promised and just feels, well, way too short and shallow. It's good fun and the engine is sweet, the characters ""play"" well and all the new moves are fine but there need to be many more levels to make this worthwhile.6/10. I recommend Full Mojo Rampage instead.			"

GauntletRating: 5 / 10(Played this game as a single player so this small review has been based upon that.)The Gauntlet is an action-rpg primarily focused on co-op party, but going in as a solo player is no problem. The game is a dungeon crawler so that's basically the only environment you encounter which becomes very boring after a while. As this is controller friendly, you loot and pick up items just by walking over them, and don't have to worry about an inventory because there isn't any. Upgrades of your equipment you buy at your local shop for the money you collect while grinding through the levels. There is no story at all, so you don't have to make choices or encounter npc's. The game focuses 100% on combat and when you're solo in the game this feels a bit lonely. The graphics aren't that great, the rendering distance is a bit too far. What I like is that you can dodge missiles and make use of your class specific skills. Crossing a dangerous floor is easier as a ranger than a warrior, just because you are quicker. Sound logical but in ARPG that isn't always the case.Fighting is clicking the right buttons. Warrior is the easiest, mage the most difficult as you have to remember button sequences which sounds a bit dated to me. Press this, than this and finally this to cast a spell. Very arcade yes, but hardly modern.As a solo player I can't recommend this because it is too boring and bland. There are lots of better action rpg's in the world to devote your time to. As a party game I can imagine it can be fun to play. For a while that is as the variety seems a little low. "

												Did you expect Diablo III or Torchlight II when you bought this game? If so, you're not going to have a very good time, as this game most certainly does not have the same level of character development and depth that either of those titles have.Did you expect this to be like FORCED, a co-operative puzzle game masquerading as a top-down ARPG? Again, you're going to be disappointed. While there is some degree of puzzle-solving (especially with the bosses), this is most definitely not the kind of game you're going to require sober friends for.What this is, is an honest, faithful reinvention of the original Gauntlet game for the arcade, peppered with modern features and graphics. The fun is striking that intricate balance between teamwork and sabotage, trying to hinder your competitors while helping them enough to finish the mission.Pros:- Combat is fluid and requires some degree of attention to finer detail. This isn't simply a button masher, and with the Wizard especially, a fair bit of concentration is required to come out of things with your skin intact.- Balance is strong; you never feel so overwhelmed that failure is the only option, but you're rarely bored either.- Along with Hammerwatch, it probably serves as the top choice for controller-supported 4-player couch co-op in the fantasy genre.- Fantastic game intro, giving you all you need to know about how to play the game in under 5 minutes.Cons:- Maximum supported resolution is 1600x900, and the fullscreen settings are finnicky, often reverting to windowed mode with a simple alt+tab.- Scenery is a bit drab and could use some variety and an expanded color palette.- Dungeons seem a bit too repetitive; random generation might need a revision or two later on.All in all, the game is well worth having in your library if you've got friends over enough to warrant it. There are definitely better solo options in the world than this.7.5/10			"

This game is everything i could have wanted in a new Gauntlet title and so much more, i HIGHLY recommend it if your into dungeon crawlers or just another game to sit down with some friends and play. Whats nice is that if you use a gamepad, a buddy can jump on your PC and play along with you for some local co-op fun.			"

No ""ready"" or ""pause"" button in lobby (really ? not in a multiplayer game ?)Though on forums the PR person has said some of these will be fixed, but that is just talk until it happens.

												This 2014 edition of Gauntlet is a game I want to like, but that's simply impossible. It's a tedious, monotonous game with serious design problems. The game recently got polished into Gauntlet: Slayer Edition, but the problems remained.Conclusion: looks good, but not worth of any money. Maybe, if you get it for free, or as a part of humble bundle. Otherwise, no.Regrettably, this game is not fun to play at all.After 4 to 5 first levels the game starts to repeat itself. First levels are fairly enjoyable, but after that: nothing new. Controlling game characters (4 different + 1 dlc) is not rewarding, because most of the time your character is very hard to spot from the screen. That's because of three of the worst design flaws: walls obstruct your view, the viewpoint (camera) is zoomed out way too far away from your character AND the levels have very few light sources.Playing the game makes you wish you had binoculars and a flashlight pointed at the screen.How about multiplayer mode? You need a friend for that, because there is never anyone playing multiplayer otherwise. Once you get online with your friend, you will experience even more design flaws. You think you cannot get motion sickness from a game? I dare you to try this one on multiplayer mode. Have a bucket next to you when you try. I mean, what were the devs thinking? On single-player you have to strain your eyes to be able see your tiny character on a dim screen, and on multiplayer mode the screen jumps and jolts around making sure you'll vomit, or at least get a headache.Even if I pretend I can endure the flaws I mentioned, the boring map design and clearing a floor after a floor from the same enemies over and over again is just not worth the time. It is very sad to give this game thumbs down, because I really loved previous Gauntlet games, such as Gauntlet: Dark Legacy and the original Gauntlet and Gauntlet 2. Yes, even the original Gauntlet is less monotonous than this one. At least the original Gauntlet had proper level design and a feeling of progress in the game.			"

												Honestly this game dissapointed at every turn. As a long time fan of Gauntlet I have loved the action, unique world, humor and challenge of many gauntlet games but non of those appear in this rehash of a beloveld fanchise. All humor has been removed (which is ok, Gauntlet doesn't need to be funny) but it's replaced with dry attempt at what I can only guess is ""wit"" written to be understood by a 5 year old. The gameplay is stale, it's your typical button mash dungeon crawler with each class having a ""unique"" set of attacks. Unfortunately this leads to the final issue of difficulty, there is none. You will have no problems clearing mobs with simple repetition even on the hardest difficulties.			"

												I was extremely pleased to see that an this remake of a classic game did not create a sexpot Valkryie for fan service. She looks similar to the other characters in that she is scarred, she looks strong, and she obviously has some issues in her past.  I fully approve. Her frame is realistic to a warrior while still keping feminine traits, this is how it should be done.On actual game play; I have only played alone or with friends and I'm not sure this game would be fun with strangers online. It's really funny destroying the food when I'm alone but I can see that being frustrating as hell when trying to co-operate with others, for them and me.Game seems far, far too short. Hoping more levels will be added at later dates, hopefully for no rediculous fees but really... DLC quest really took the cake for satire humor that we're all pretty well used to. I'm sure there will be DLC in the future, I just hope they aren't too expensive and that they add extra characters and maybe skins as well as levels.Despite my complaints however, I do recommend this game.  It's difficult, it's challenging, it's funny, it's Gauntlet; even if it is a weak-sauce version of it.			"

												For $10 or less, sure this game is a decent pickup and will give you a couple hours of solid entertainment, but it grows old very quickly. You will be doing the same 4 levels over and over again in increasing levels of difficulty but that can only hold ones attention for so long before getting stale. Get Torchlight I or II instead - same type of mechanics, better loot, better character building and much more replay value.			"

												Very fun game. It definitely smells of nostalgia. Graphics and sound are good and it definitely shows that the game is using the Magicka engine. Controls are fluid and responsive, however, I did find the pace of the game a bit slow. The mobs are massive and reminicent of the original.Multiplayer is a lot of fun and I don't think I'll ever play it on single player mode. Relics and items are ok, not really my thing, but hopefully, later on they'll add more items.This game has a lot of potential, but it hasn't reached it yet. I expect a ton of DLC to be released since there is a DLC folder in the game's installation.Big gripes right now is that I can't reconfigure the keys and I'm not sure how multiplayer will do in the future. As of now, since the game is new, it's pretty easy to hop on and find a game.Definitely recommend. I'd say this game is a 7.5 - 8 out of 10.			"

If you want to enjoy a relatively short gaming session with friends and still achieve something in the end then this is the game for you. I absolutely enjoyed Get Medieval so getting Gauntlet to play with my friends was really a no-brainer. From the looks of it the developers are listening to feedback and working on new content so I will definitely be coming back to this game. PM me if you need a Merlin! :)			"

												I used to spend my evenings playing Gauntlet at the local pub during my college years. Later on, I got the game on the Amiga. Since then, I have waited to find a faithful successor to the original game. After having played this version of Gauntlet, I can honestly say that I found it. This game is as addictive as the original. You get that kind of rush when your life is almost depleeted and you are looking for a little bit of food. Great game, I highly recommend it!			"

												This 2014 edition of Gauntlet is a game I want to like, but that's simply impossible. It's a tedious, monotonous game with serious design problems. The game recently got polished into Gauntlet: Slayer Edition, but the problems remained.Conclusion: looks good, but not worth of any money. Maybe, if you get it for free, or as a part of humble bundle. Otherwise, no.Regrettably, this game is not fun to play at all.After 4 to 5 first levels the game starts to repeat itself. First levels are fairly enjoyable, but after that: nothing new. Controlling game characters (4 different + 1 dlc) is not rewarding, because most of the time your character is very hard to spot from the screen. That's because of three of the worst design flaws: walls obstruct your view, the viewpoint (camera) is zoomed out way too far away from your character AND the levels have very few light sources.Playing the game makes you wish you had binoculars and a flashlight pointed at the screen.How about multiplayer mode? You need a friend for that, because there is never anyone playing multiplayer otherwise. Once you get online with your friend, you will experience even more design flaws. You think you cannot get motion sickness from a game? I dare you to try this one on multiplayer mode. Have a bucket next to you when you try. I mean, what were the devs thinking? On single-player you have to strain your eyes to be able see your tiny character on a dim screen, and on multiplayer mode the screen jumps and jolts around making sure you'll vomit, or at least get a headache.Even if I pretend I can endure the flaws I mentioned, the boring map design and clearing a floor after a floor from the same enemies over and over again is just not worth the time. It is very sad to give this game thumbs down, because I really loved previous Gauntlet games, such as Gauntlet: Dark Legacy and the original Gauntlet and Gauntlet 2. Yes, even the original Gauntlet is less monotonous than this one. At least the original Gauntlet had proper level design and a feeling of progress in the game.			"

												The game is fun, offering a decent addition to the hack and slash genre. The 4 classes provide enough diversity that you can easily pick them up. The one major flaw, the game is VERY short in comparison to other titles. Hard mode isn't that difficult if you have another person to play with. The rewards aren't as ""rewarding"" for grinding the same 3 levels continuous times. It's evident at this point in time that the developers have no intentions in updating and expanding the game.I can recommend this game if you wish to cut a few hours away of your life, but for the price of 19.99 I don't believe it's worth it.

												Did you expect Diablo III or Torchlight II when you bought this game? If so, you're not going to have a very good time, as this game most certainly does not have the same level of character development and depth that either of those titles have.Did you expect this to be like FORCED, a co-operative puzzle game masquerading as a top-down ARPG? Again, you're going to be disappointed. While there is some degree of puzzle-solving (especially with the bosses), this is most definitely not the kind of game you're going to require sober friends for.What this is, is an honest, faithful reinvention of the original Gauntlet game for the arcade, peppered with modern features and graphics. The fun is striking that intricate balance between teamwork and sabotage, trying to hinder your competitors while helping them enough to finish the mission.Pros:- Combat is fluid and requires some degree of attention to finer detail. This isn't simply a button masher, and with the Wizard especially, a fair bit of concentration is required to come out of things with your skin intact.- Balance is strong; you never feel so overwhelmed that failure is the only option, but you're rarely bored either.- Along with Hammerwatch, it probably serves as the top choice for controller-supported 4-player couch co-op in the fantasy genre.- Fantastic game intro, giving you all you need to know about how to play the game in under 5 minutes.Cons:- Maximum supported resolution is 1600x900, and the fullscreen settings are finnicky, often reverting to windowed mode with a simple alt+tab.- Scenery is a bit drab and could use some variety and an expanded color palette.- Dungeons seem a bit too repetitive; random generation might need a revision or two later on.All in all, the game is well worth having in your library if you've got friends over enough to warrant it. There are definitely better solo options in the world than this.7.5/10			"

												Gauntlet is back, kind of!  Some wizard wants to build a sword or something, but it's in pieces and scattered through The Gauntlet, and it's up to you to find them.  You have four* intrepid adventurers to choose from, with varying stats, moves, and strengths, but all sharing one major weakness.  The controls in this game are awful.  Movement is simple, but from your top-down view, you better see and plan all your moves way in advance, because characters will commit to sword swings, queue up commands, not actually get the invincibility frames the in-game help claims some moves have, and otherwise get you killed, a lot.  A hack-n-slash simply demands more responsive, maybe even twitchy controls, especially when every single room surrounds you with enemies.  If you want to play Dark Souls zoomed way out and surrounded by enemies, try Gauntlet.  If you want a game that has the frenetic, responsive, coherent feel of old-school Gauntlet...this game doesn't have that.			"

												Good game to play with your friends if you just want to kick back and have some competitive fun. The heroes all work really well and the game itself is fun as hell to blast your way through. Only downside in my opinion is the length. Having never played the arcade I was able to solo run through this the 2nd time in about an hour and a half. Took 2 Hours for 3 of us the first go around. My advice here would be to look for a good discount. It's a damn good game but not worth more than maybe $5 just due to length. Anymore than $5 and you don't really feel like you're getting your money's worth.			"

Also, the voice acting can be a bit cheesy at times (It sounds like the person voicing the elf is faking the accent.) But it's hard to not enjoy a good hack and slash game.

												I have fond memories of the original Gauntlet. I remember playing the Amstrad CPC version for a whole day, only taking breaks for food. I also had the Gauntlet Legacy games which I thought were ok but too different from the original game. This latest incarnation of Gauntlet does not disappoint. It retains aspects of the original: 4p co-op, overwhelming numbers of enemies and a good dose of humour. It's a great homage to the original with many elements that have been updated to modern standards.This game surpasses the original in my opinion which is no mean feat. Each character plays very differently. My favourite is the wizard who is tricky to use at first but when mastered can be very powerful.I've seen some reviews which accuse the game of being repetitive. There is some truth in that, especially when you have to restart a level from the beginning. The action is so fun that I don't mind repeating the same level again and it also allows you to gain more gold and level up your character.			"

I really was not expecting too much from this game as I have already heard that its purposes from the devs were to be the surpasser of the original 1985 Gauntlet and not Dark Legacy or Legends, but I am silenced by its gameplay and mechanics. The masteries, relics, and loadout armors definitely keep you hooked, regardless of soloing or group play! I would most certainly recommend using an Xbox 360 controller with this game as it is much easier than mouse/keyboard.			"

												listen, I'll try to make this quick alright. So if your looking for a fun experecn and you know you like gauntlet then go ahead and buy it, however if you dont like Gauntlet then dont buy it. Now I will admit it right now it can feel limiting or maybe boring but it's not really at all it quite awesome actually. But (to make a counter-argument) it can feel like its almost the same game but with better grahics but, they have added new stuff and made the wizard, valkeriy?, and I think the theif, have all been change, Escpily the fact that you can buy equitment now. But yeah other than I would defently reccommed you buying this game. (would like to say now that the reason this sounds so one sided is because right now I'm acting like a 5 year old boy whos mad that people be dis-ing one of my favorite childhood games and also Gaben)			"

												So addictive to play with friends. Was searching for a game that reminded me of Champions of Norrath on the PS2. Couldn't have matched the description more when I saw Gauntlet. 10 Hrs on first day so far, the hard modes are really challenging matched with the time you have to spend restarting the dungeon again.Hope there'll be more DLC for this in the future!

												Arrowhead has adopted the franchise from Midway Games and has decided to reboot it. Not re-iterate the story, not make a sequel, but to reboot it. In order to do so, they decided to go back to the original arcade games from the 1980's and take a few pointer tips for their inspiration of level design.However, instead of endless dungeons that the originals produced, this game focuses on more of a linear storyline.Three worlds - One Boss per worldFour levels each -Three stages per level (Explore, Race, Challenge Arena)Four difficulties - Easy, Normal, Hard, UnfairFour characters to select, five with DLC - Warrior, Knight, Wizard, Elf, & Necromancer*Online and Local Co-op with up to three other players!Different Masteries per character to unlockGone are the days of treasure chests and a variety of potions to unleash upon the hordes.Nowadays we are prone to smashing pots and boxes for gold. You do collect a potion throughout the entire game, you use these to display your special ability in combat. Special abilties can be bought at the in-game store and you can have up to two at once.Different skins for your weapon and character are buyable as well, but they are just for looks.Many complain this game is bland, but it is really just inspired by the ""bland-ness"" of 1980's retro arcade games. The look and feel is all intentional. If you enjoy that nostalgia, then the price is worth it.It is a retro rpg - hack and slash - dungeon crawler. You either love it or you shame it. 8/10			"

												Purchased this to play online with my clan buddies as some light relief..While originally fun to play this soon turned to frustration. 'Death' chasing you every other level is monotonous, evade him by running round in circles, he finally disappears only to return 10 seconds later. This makes progression slow and tedious.A save game feature at the end of each level would also be helpful !			"

												This could be a fun little arcade co-op game with 3 of your pals.  There's just one issue, it's unplayable with M&K.  Sure they have some keys (the arrow keys for movement), but this game is fast paced and requires some twitch and precision aiming/dodging.  That just ain't happening by using the arrow keys to move.I don't need the wtf bro it's 2015 get a controller already, it's the future bro.  So save your vapid insipidity.   I'm just  here to inform anyone else out there that, if you don't have a controller, don't get this game.I'm gonna vote it no, until I get a controller and play it.  I have purchased too many games before checking the efficacy of playing with a M&K.  It will damage my pride, but I think it's time get comfortable with a controller.			"

												This game is awful. I enjoyed Gauntlet Legends on the old consoles - this is nothing like it. There are only 4 characters (+1 if you buy a ridiculously expensive addon), and they don't learn any new abilities ever. Equipment is all cosmetic, so there are practically no upgrades except for a small ""perk"" system which you won't feel unless you log a lot of playtime. The levels are boring and flat with few puzzles that the old games had, and the bosses are totally uninteresting. There is not even the token storyline that the old game had, and the basic characters they did add in are ugly. I don't know what kind of nostalgia feeling other people are getting from this, but I had no enjoyment at all.			"

												""Stay a while and listen"" (blizzy pls don't sue me, k, thx, bai!) ... or in this case, read a wall of text  :PWhat I first noticed about the game is its menu, it's simple, clear, all a menu should be.Then the game started with the tutorial, forcing me to play it. I did not see a ""skip tutorial"" button (my bad if there was but pretty sure there wasn't).Not nice forcing people to do something they don't want to, give them the option to choose.And if you are going to argue that they had to do that the way they did so people would learn about the characters and their mechanics then i say to you: ""I'm sorry but I do not agree!""There are better ways to introduce important stuff then forcing it on people, hide it like Portal and Portal 2 did - almost the whole game is a tutorial preparing the player for what is to come, but we are not here to talk about Portal, Gauntlet time.The tutorial on its own was put together nicely, introducing the characters and their mechanics through gameplay rather then through text, which is always nice.The characters are ok-ish defined.The Warrior being a warrior can take damage as well as dish out damage of his own.The Elf uses range attacks to defeat his enemies, although his range isn't that great. I expected more from an elf ranger.The Valkyrie is a nice mix of the two (i particularly liked the Captain America like shield throw).These three characters are pretty straightforward, but the Wizard is a bit more complicated.Having 9 spells to choose from, the Wizard can access his spells with a certain button combination. The desired spell is then ready to use, assuming its not on cooldown.Not too intuitive, and a bit confusing at first but fiddle around with the spell combinations and you will get the hang of it.I must point out that the ice spells were not as useful to me as the other two types of spells (fire and lightning) and i ended up playing mostly with fire and lightning spells, and even here with not all of them.The Fire Bomb is useless if you are near a doorway or a low ceiling-ish area it will hit the ceiling and explode dealing no damage to the monsters below it or it won't end up exploding where you expected it to cause it ended up hitting something you did not thought possible (could be a bug or just bad design).Also Lightning Discharge was of no use to me, if i wanted to knock someone back I can use my Storm Barrier, so I ended up using it only when I incorrectly combined buttons to get a spell.The RPG elements are kind of wierd in concept and implementation.If you buy armour and weapons you only get a cosmetic change. But you can also buy relics to give you buffs to your speed, damage, attack speed or the ability to summon illusions or a demonic gargoyle to fight by your side.However you can only have 2 relics and can not use any without potions. These potions you can not buy, they can only be found throughout the levels, as well as food which restores hit points.Instead of gaining traditional levels for each character, you can only improve your stats by performing achievement-like actions called Masteries. For example killing 10,000 monsters grants a 10 % damage bonus.First time around, the structure of the game is interesting and the level design is a mix of pre-made and randomly generated environment.Some levels are more complex than others, tasking you or the group to push blocks, insert statues into spots, or fill a lava pool to raise a bridge and then finally an okay-ish boss battle.The campaign is broken up into three acts, with four stages, four repetitive stages.Each set of those stages unfolds in the same way:First you start with a standard level, then you move on to a shorter level with a frustrating twist like being chased by death which btw is bad at its job and its not so hard to outrun (just frustrating) or a dark cave eating away at your nerves as you try to hold back the urge to pluck out your hair and then (as i already mentioned) a boss fight.Higher difficulty only makes enemies more resistant to damage and drop more gold.Once the campaign is finished there’s not much incentive to revisit and replay the game.The A.I. is not to bright either. Getting stuck frequently on each other, corners, doorways and other stuff lying around the level.After some time you notice how they move and can kite them around the level making them easy targets. Easier than they would have been on their own.And a one last thing, the camera, oh boy ... The view is zoomed out far enough to cover an area, but not far enough for a four player co-op play through. The camera does not follow any player controlled characters but hovers above an area of the level and its easy to lose sight of your character.Additionally if any teammate goes idle you can't move on without them cause the camera will stand still in an area and try to cover all players.I am sure that Arrowhead did their best but they neither went full retro nor did they break from the past.As i see this game, its like they tried to stay close to the original (Gauntlet from 1985) but not to close cause people my not like it today and tried to make it an appealing 2014 role-play, dungeon crawl, hack and slash game but actually got stuck in the middle of it all resulting in a not so good game.In short its repetitive and overly simplistic, awkward camera, an uninteresting upgrade system and too little substance or variety to satisfy players.However, with four committed players the co-op works well, and it’s certainly not the worst Gauntlet revamp there’s ever been.All in all IMHO this game is a 5.5 / 10, nice try but u failed, sry and i do not recommend this game.

												I've been a fan of Gauntlet for a long time, and this game is fun, but it really lacks that Gauntlet feel. My friend and I nearly finished it in four hours, and it was all very layed out, ver predictable. I was kind of disappointed to find that there are zero collectables, no level up systems, and some pretty weak secrets.The levels should be more divers, there should be challenging puzzles and where is my color choice? Also there are only about half of the characters and 1/3 the worlds to play! I would very much love to see this fleshed out more, because it is fun to play, but it's just not... Gauntlet.			"

The game runs smooth and ...Well, the review above pretty much shows my experience with this game. I've replayed the first dungeon multiple times and it just keeps crashing. I've only been able to complete it once and it crashed right after finishing it. I tried different settings, re-installing, verifying cache, killing background apps, etc. The game runs smooth while it works but the constant crashing obviously makes it unplayable for me. I have a decent PC that runs other much more demanding games without any issues so the game itself seems to be the issue. If anyone has any tips to get it to work it would be appreciated and I wouldn't mind changing the review to positive. But for now it seems like that's $10 down the drain.			"

The only extra thing you can get by paying is the Necromancer which is over powered and literally fills the screen with minions making other players feel lost.Yes, buy it for a 4 hour party but don't expect more.There are hardly any players online but this is not the point, you won't be either after playing it for 2 days.

It reminds me more of Bastion but Bastion is much better.  This a rogue-like game but with NO RPG elements.  Your character does not get better at all.  But the monsters get tougher and more plentiful.The achievement masteries, I guess, are supposed to be the RPG elements.  But adding 1% damage does nothing as an achievement payoff.  That's like giving a whale a tic-tac.  The potions are almost useless.  Some sections you get very few so you cant use the relics you buy.Believe the other reviews that say it short.  VERY short.  And the replay value is absolutely boring.  The developers expect  you to play each character (5 with the DLC) on each difficulty level (4).  To be a completist and unlock all the masteries, this is what you have to do.  And playing the wizard is a grindfest.I bought this day one because I love the Gauntlet franchise.  I pumped many quarters in the original arcade machine and played all the nintendo games.  It's fun but this is not Guantlet.  DONOT spend full price.  Wait for an 80% off sale.Graphics 9/10Audio 9/10Controls/UI 9/10Immersion 7/10Grind Level 8/10Replay Value 2/10Overall fun 5/10			"

												The game is mediocre at best.  I never played any of the previous Gauntlets so I never felt any nostalgia people wrote in their reviews.  I felt the game had a lot of potential but it fell flat.  The graphics were decent and made the game looked very interesting in the screenshots.  However, the game was extremely repetitive.  You literally grind variations of the same 3 path dungeon 3 times (so you play each path 3 times) then you reach boss.  There is absolutely no replay value.I played D3 when it first launched and I thought it was fast.  Well, this game is even faster.  However, there is incentive to grind in D3 for better gear.  Here, you grind to level up your skill but really you just get a longer duration or deal more damage with your skill most of the time.A lot of people said this is a coop game and I imagine this might be the reason.  I played single player and felt the game was really boring the whole time.  The only real replay incentive is if you want to beat at the highest level of difficulty (there are easy, normal, hard and unfair).  I bought this with a discount so it didn't hurt me as much but I rather have spent it on another game now that I know this one is bad.  I really hated the voice acting for the elf.  The voice acting fits a thief character where he sounds a bit sly.  I honestly imagine the best class would be wizard with complex skills... but I really am not interested enough to want to find out.			"

												Gauntlet is a series of games consist of hack n' slash dungeon crawlers.  The games have been pretty straightforward and enjoyable, and this version of Gauntlet doesn't deviate too far from the formula.  Gauntlet isn't an HD remake of the first game.  It is a modernized retelling, keeping some things but adding in a few new things to change things up---with mixed results.Gauntlet is a decent looking game that plays pretty well.  The game's strongest point is how each character plays.  The four choices (Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard, and Elf) have relatively unique playstyles.  You'll have to excuse my controller references coming up, but the Warrior and Valkyrie can be most closely associated with ""button mashers,"" relying more on the face buttons to perform commands.  The Wizard and Elf, on the other hand, are ""twin-stick"" shooters, relying on heavy use of the right analog stick.  Each character also has special abilities to offer further variety, but the most diverse character is the Wizard.  While the other characters are easily accessible, the Wizard has a learning curve due to the number of abilities he has (in comparison to the others).The game still stays true to its hack n' slash, dungeon crawling roots.  The game tries to have some kind of story for why the characters are thrust into the Gauntlet, but it is paper-thin---almost unnecessary.  I know we're supposed to be collecting shards for a sword, but I really just wanted to kill some monsters with my friends.  Now, something that makes this game stand apart from other dungeon crawlers is the lack of a leveling system.  Your character doesn't gain levels (they do gain ""masteries,"" but more on this shortly), and is just about fully equiped with every ability they will ever have.  I find this to be a welcome break, and it helps keep the game accessible to anyone.Unfortunately, I found there to be more negatives than positives to this game.  The game offers up ""masteries,"" which are basically perks that require a lot of investment.  Most of the revolve around killing enemies, but having to continuously play through levels to kill enemies is rather annoying.  If, perhaps, the mastery requirements were lower or if they were shared across all characters (where applicable), I wouldn't be as annoyed with the mechanic.  However, the amount of work and time needed to entirely unlock them isn't worth it, in most cases.  The rewards are so incremental that it makes me wonder why they're there.Something that may also help is a stronger level variety.  There are 30 levels in the game.  27 of them are part of 9 ""standard"" levels and the other 3 are boss levels.  When selecting a non-boss level, you are committed to a three-level endurance run that, despite the aesthetic changes, all follow the same formula: 1st level is a ""long, standard"" level, 2nd level is a ""short, environment hazard"" level, and 3rd level is an ""arena"" fight.  Given that the levels are not procedurally generated (a ""hot"" item in more recent dungeon crawlers), the replayability falls short.  The bosses aren't incredibly fun to fight either, making them rather underwhelming.Another downfall about the level structure is the ""hub"" area.  After completing either the series of 3 levels or a boss level, all players are transported to the hub area to select a new level or purchase items.  The game offers the players items in the form of relics---which can only be used if potions are collected, or loadouts---which are only cosmetic permutations for the characters.  The relics offer a little more variety to the potions (instead of just ""clear the screen of enemies"") and the permutations don't hurt the game at all, but relics can never be used on bosses and the loadouts require us to beat the bosses and specific difficulties to unlock (and even then they cost gold to purchase).  This game also harkens back to the original Gauntlet by restricting the group to one unique character per player.  We cannot all play as Wizards or Warriors in a 4-player group.  I like the idea of having team variety, but forcing it typically leads to a lot of players quitting from a game since they can't play as a character they've invested time into.  However, as with most games, playing this game with more people is always a good time, and with a recent patch text chat has been made available.  On top of the other tweaks that have happened since the game's launch in September, it is apparent that the developer's aren't just letting this game settle.  They plan to keep improving it.SummaryPros:Graphics aren't terrible; very likely this game will run on anything.Controller supportEach character has a unique playstyleCo-op is fun; online and LAN.Developers still working out the kinks and making updates.Cons:Game is a bit on the short side.Not enough levels, and not enough level variety to keep things interesting.Can't have multiple people playing as the same character.Game wants you to grind, but not get the benefit of gaining levels.Relics and loadouts don't really offer much to the game.Poor, and at times laughable voice acting.Suggestions:Start using procedural level design.  While it isn't a perfect fix, having a structured level design when having to replay levels makes the experience too linear and predictable.Get crazier with the boss and level designs.  Maybe have something that requires more teamwork, or include some more variety with the environmental hazards.  Adding puzzles would definitely be a plus.Add an endurance mode.  All levels must be played in succession; no hub area breaks.  Even better: 100 levels, like the original game.Allow mutliple people to play as the same character.  The group may not be as varied this way, but I'd rather have another player in the group than have them drop out due to their character being taken already.Drop the relics, or make potions transfer from area to area.  Not having relics for boss fights is a poor design choice.Drop the loadouts for character creation.  Sure, the characters we play as are fully-voiced characters with small stories.  I'd rather see them not truly be characters but rather avatars for ourselves.  We can customize them, and unlocking these permutations actually unlocks them---no grinding for gold to buy them after unlocking them.Drop the masteries, or have them be cumulative across all characters when applicable.  Getting 50,000 kills for one character for a 25% damage output increase is a tall order.  Asking for that for all four characters is ridiculous.  Having shared masteries would also make the transition from playing as one character to another a bit easier on the player.Despite my lists of complaints, I am still recommending the game.  I do not think this game has earned my $20 just yet, but perhaps with additional updates down the road it will get even better.  Right now, I'd say the game is worth a $10 purchase.			"

												I love Gauntlet!  The series, the feel of the game, and all that the Gauntlet series has offered up to this point.  However, I'm a bit dissapointed with Gauntlet for the PC.  Briefly put, this game falls short of my expectations.  I expected to see more levels, abilitys, and monsters.  To start, the feel of the original Gauntlet is missing.  I jumped into the first few levels, and didn't feel absorbed into the Gauntlet world, and the feel of the levels fall a bit short as well.  The game boasts 12 levels and in the end it just doesn't feel like enough.  An endless mode, or additional levels would be nice to see in the game.The game isn't horrible, but it's not what I like in Gauntlet games.  I expect to jump into a game and play with 4 people and feel like I'm playing Gauntlet.  I feel that this game may meet that potential after a few updates.  I will still be playing the game, but it does not meet these expectations.  I hope that some changes are made. "

The only extra thing you can get by paying is the Necromancer which is over powered and literally fills the screen with minions making other players feel lost.Yes, buy it for a 4 hour party but don't expect more.There are hardly any players online but this is not the point, you won't be either after playing it for 2 days.

												Challenges can be fun. And Gauntlet has the fundamentals of a great challenge: interesting tools for split-second decision making, and difficult encounters that demand you play your very best.Unfortunately, there are some awful design decisions and sloppy glitches that spoil what would otherwise have been a classic action game.First, the pacing: Gauntlet has historically been a very fast-paced game. But the obstacles in this Gauntlet are often extremely tedious. Monster spawners take ages to destroy, and you'll have to do it over and over again. Once you've found the right strategy, you'll just be repeating that approach every time, while hoping that one of the game's many glitches doesn't ruin your attempt.Among these bugs: Enemies will get stuck, invincibly, inside walls; the player character will get stuck in the world; collision detection screws up frequently; attacks will miss enemies directly in front of you; small elevation changes will render abilities useless (God help you if you try to fight on stairs); your defensive skills will sometimes fail to work; and relics can cause your character to lock up.Any of these glitches can lead to a cheap death, and that often means losing 20+ minutes worth of progress, since the game's rewards are gated behind challenges like ""complete three levels in a row on the hardest difficulty without dying once,"" while your character dies in a split second if you screw up, or the game does.While Gauntlet seems suited for a quick jump-in, jump-out pace, the level structure actually requires completing several very lengthy levels in a row, which gets very tiring, especially when they consist of the same obstacles over and over. The level design itself is poor, with lots of boring, winding paths, thoughtless blob-shaped rooms, and cheap traps. In one of the randomly-selected sections, there's a room that can trap your character by requiring a key to exit yet not including a key anywhere in the room, or any way to backtrack, forcing a restart.There are fun elements here, but it's a sloppy product.

												I have fond memories of the original Gauntlet. I remember playing the Amstrad CPC version for a whole day, only taking breaks for food. I also had the Gauntlet Legacy games which I thought were ok but too different from the original game. This latest incarnation of Gauntlet does not disappoint. It retains aspects of the original: 4p co-op, overwhelming numbers of enemies and a good dose of humour. It's a great homage to the original with many elements that have been updated to modern standards.This game surpasses the original in my opinion which is no mean feat. Each character plays very differently. My favourite is the wizard who is tricky to use at first but when mastered can be very powerful.I've seen some reviews which accuse the game of being repetitive. There is some truth in that, especially when you have to restart a level from the beginning. The action is so fun that I don't mind repeating the same level again and it also allows you to gain more gold and level up your character.			"

												I shot an elite silver platter of roasted turkey and got insulted by a wizard. 10/10This is a great game, while not spectacular on the graphics, it is extremely challenging and does require a lot of team work. Everyone seems to have expected this to be some easy hack'n'slash game but it really takes more talent then smashing B button while charging like rambo into mobs. With a great team, it's easily one of the most fun Co-ops I've played in awhile. I wish more games like this would get out there and expand a lot more.My only complain is it has a lack of levels, it boasted how they would be random every time but I really don't see a difference when I play, they all look the exact same to me. Total you get about 12 maps to play on and 4 difficulties, which even as sad as that amount of content is, it's still a lot of fun to play with friends.However, I will say that joining random teams is a real pain. Everyone wants to be archer or wizard and refuses to even try the melee class. Many players scream about how terrible they are, and I do think it is a little unfair that the wizard gets 9 spells and everyone else only has 3 skills, BUT they are not weak and, while playing the wizard, I have seen the Valk/Thor kill so much so fast I couldnt even get kills. I actually have a friend that is a beast at playing the valk and have seen Thor♥♥♥♥♥♥the entire map by himself on a 4-player.I definitely say it's worth buying for some co-op fun, but I do hope to see some serious content expansion in the future. I'd sugggest buying it from {LINK REMOVED} since 20$ is a high price for it in its current state. I bought it for about 13$.			"

												This is actually a surprisingly fun and addictive game. I really was not expecting too much from this game as I have already heard that its purposes from the devs were to be the surpasser of the original 1985 Gauntlet and not Dark Legacy or Legends, but I am silenced by its gameplay and mechanics. The masteries, relics, and loadout armors definitely keep you hooked, regardless of soloing or group play! I would most certainly recommend using an Xbox 360 controller with this game as it is much easier than mouse/keyboard.			"

												listen, I'll try to make this quick alright. So if your looking for a fun experecn and you know you like gauntlet then go ahead and buy it, however if you dont like Gauntlet then dont buy it. Now I will admit it right now it can feel limiting or maybe boring but it's not really at all it quite awesome actually. But (to make a counter-argument) it can feel like its almost the same game but with better grahics but, they have added new stuff and made the wizard, valkeriy?, and I think the theif, have all been change, Escpily the fact that you can buy equitment now. But yeah other than I would defently reccommed you buying this game. (would like to say now that the reason this sounds so one sided is because right now I'm acting like a 5 year old boy whos mad that people be dis-ing one of my favorite childhood games and also Gaben)			"

												So addictive to play with friends. Was searching for a game that reminded me of Champions of Norrath on the PS2. Couldn't have matched the description more when I saw Gauntlet. 10 Hrs on first day so far, the hard modes are really challenging matched with the time you have to spend restarting the dungeon again.Hope there'll be more DLC for this in the future!

												This is modern Gauntlet. You could call it a remake, but it's not really that. It's so much better. It's a dungeon crawler and arena twin-stick shooter. It's Gauntlet on steroids, but it hasn't lost that old-school charm. Best played with others, especially when you get into Hard and above.The biggest flaws I've seen are a lack of variation on encounters. This was a chance for the team to take Gauntlet even farther, but they stuck with something more tried and true. Granted, it's been refined so that the annoyances of a generation ago aren't still here. There's also a new relic system to give you some sense of progression other than making it through the dungeon. But at it's core, it's the same sets of encounters over and over again, and when you've seen them once, you've seen them.My other big gripe is that the loadouts do nothing but change how your character is dressed. Certainly they could have given some other bonus, especially with some of them requiring you beat certain levels on specific difficulties. At the very least, they could have made the loadouts be more visually interesting, because right now, they're a bit boring. I'm not really interested in spending my hard-earned gold on them for such little gain.That doesn't make the game not great though. The normal campaign will last you about 6-8 hours depending on your abilities and that's not bad. Add in additional difficulty levels and you've got a competent remake. The added charm of the announcer quipping about Warrior needing food, badly, or the food being shot by the clever wizard harken back to the game we all know and love.The story is a bit drab and predictable, but you're not here for the story, so who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥ The visuals are great, the sound and music fit the game perfectly, and the difficulty scales well. All-in-all, the Arrowhead team has done a great job! I look forward to Gauntlet 2.			"

												The game is nice.Only for a day or two and especially if you plan to play with friends.After beating it twice in a single day there is nothing else to do.There is no future plans. The only extra thing you can get by paying is the Necromancer which is over powered and literally fills the screen with minions making other players feel lost.Yes, buy it for a 4 hour party but don't expect more.There are hardly any players online but this is not the point, you won't be either after playing it for 2 days.

Posted: November 29, 2014
												Gauntlet is a series of games consist of hack n' slash dungeon crawlers.  The games have been pretty straightforward and enjoyable, and this version of Gauntlet doesn't deviate too far from the formula.  Gauntlet isn't an HD remake of the first game.  It is a modernized retelling, keeping some things but adding in a few new things to change things up---with mixed results.Gauntlet is a decent looking game that plays pretty well.  The game's strongest point is how each character plays.  The four choices (Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard, and Elf) have relatively unique playstyles.  You'll have to excuse my controller references coming up, but the Warrior and Valkyrie can be most closely associated with ""button mashers,"" relying more on the face buttons to perform commands.  The Wizard and Elf, on the other hand, are ""twin-stick"" shooters, relying on heavy use of the right analog stick.  Each character also has special abilities to offer further variety, but the most diverse character is the Wizard.  While the other characters are easily accessible, the Wizard has a learning curve due to the number of abilities he has (in comparison to the others).The game still stays true to its hack n' slash, dungeon crawling roots.  The game tries to have some kind of story for why the characters are thrust into the Gauntlet, but it is paper-thin---almost unnecessary.  I know we're supposed to be collecting shards for a sword, but I really just wanted to kill some monsters with my friends.  Now, something that makes this game stand apart from other dungeon crawlers is the lack of a leveling system.  Your character doesn't gain levels (they do gain ""masteries,"" but more on this shortly), and is just about fully equiped with every ability they will ever have.  I find this to be a welcome break, and it helps keep the game accessible to anyone.Unfortunately, I found there to be more negatives than positives to this game.  The game offers up ""masteries,"" which are basically perks that require a lot of investment.  Most of the revolve around killing enemies, but having to continuously play through levels to kill enemies is rather annoying.  If, perhaps, the mastery requirements were lower or if they were shared across all characters (where applicable), I wouldn't be as annoyed with the mechanic.  However, the amount of work and time needed to entirely unlock them isn't worth it, in most cases.  The rewards are so incremental that it makes me wonder why they're there.Something that may also help is a stronger level variety.  There are 30 levels in the game.  27 of them are part of 9 ""standard"" levels and the other 3 are boss levels.  When selecting a non-boss level, you are committed to a three-level endurance run that, despite the aesthetic changes, all follow the same formula: 1st level is a ""long, standard"" level, 2nd level is a ""short, environment hazard"" level, and 3rd level is an ""arena"" fight.  Given that the levels are not procedurally generated (a ""hot"" item in more recent dungeon crawlers), the replayability falls short.  The bosses aren't incredibly fun to fight either, making them rather underwhelming.Another downfall about the level structure is the ""hub"" area.  After completing either the series of 3 levels or a boss level, all players are transported to the hub area to select a new level or purchase items.  The game offers the players items in the form of relics---which can only be used if potions are collected, or loadouts---which are only cosmetic permutations for the characters.  The relics offer a little more variety to the potions (instead of just ""clear the screen of enemies"") and the permutations don't hurt the game at all, but relics can never be used on bosses and the loadouts require us to beat the bosses and specific difficulties to unlock (and even then they cost gold to purchase).  This game also harkens back to the original Gauntlet by restricting the group to one unique character per player.  We cannot all play as Wizards or Warriors in a 4-player group.  I like the idea of having team variety, but forcing it typically leads to a lot of players quitting from a game since they can't play as a character they've invested time into.  However, as with most games, playing this game with more people is always a good time, and with a recent patch text chat has been made available.  On top of the other tweaks that have happened since the game's launch in September, it is apparent that the developer's aren't just letting this game settle.  They plan to keep improving it.SummaryPros:Graphics aren't terrible; very likely this game will run on anything.Controller supportEach character has a unique playstyleCo-op is fun; online and LAN.Developers still working out the kinks and making updates.Cons:Game is a bit on the short side.Not enough levels, and not enough level variety to keep things interesting.Can't have multiple people playing as the same character.Game wants you to grind, but not get the benefit of gaining levels.Relics and loadouts don't really offer much to the game.Poor, and at times laughable voice acting.Suggestions:Start using procedural level design.  While it isn't a perfect fix, having a structured level design when having to replay levels makes the experience too linear and predictable.Get crazier with the boss and level designs.  Maybe have something that requires more teamwork, or include some more variety with the environmental hazards.  Adding puzzles would definitely be a plus.Add an endurance mode.  All levels must be played in succession; no hub area breaks.  Even better: 100 levels, like the original game.Allow mutliple people to play as the same character.  The group may not be as varied this way, but I'd rather have another player in the group than have them drop out due to their character being taken already.Drop the relics, or make potions transfer from area to area.  Not having relics for boss fights is a poor design choice.Drop the loadouts for character creation.  Sure, the characters we play as are fully-voiced characters with small stories.  I'd rather see them not truly be characters but rather avatars for ourselves.  We can customize them, and unlocking these permutations actually unlocks them---no grinding for gold to buy them after unlocking them.Drop the masteries, or have them be cumulative across all characters when applicable.  Getting 50,000 kills for one character for a 25% damage output increase is a tall order.  Asking for that for all four characters is ridiculous.  Having shared masteries would also make the transition from playing as one character to another a bit easier on the player.Despite my lists of complaints, I am still recommending the game.  I do not think this game has earned my $20 just yet, but perhaps with additional updates down the road it will get even better.  Right now, I'd say the game is worth a $10 purchase.			"

												I shot an elite silver platter of roasted turkey and got insulted by a wizard. 10/10This is a great game, while not spectacular on the graphics, it is extremely challenging and does require a lot of team work. Everyone seems to have expected this to be some easy hack'n'slash game but it really takes more talent then smashing B button while charging like rambo into mobs. With a great team, it's easily one of the most fun Co-ops I've played in awhile. I wish more games like this would get out there and expand a lot more.My only complain is it has a lack of levels, it boasted how they would be random every time but I really don't see a difference when I play, they all look the exact same to me. Total you get about 12 maps to play on and 4 difficulties, which even as sad as that amount of content is, it's still a lot of fun to play with friends.However, I will say that joining random teams is a real pain. Everyone wants to be archer or wizard and refuses to even try the melee class. Many players scream about how terrible they are, and I do think it is a little unfair that the wizard gets 9 spells and everyone else only has 3 skills, BUT they are not weak and, while playing the wizard, I have seen the Valk/Thor kill so much so fast I couldnt even get kills. I actually have a friend that is a beast at playing the valk and have seen Thor♥♥♥♥♥♥the entire map by himself on a 4-player.I definitely say it's worth buying for some co-op fun, but I do hope to see some serious content expansion in the future. I'd sugggest buying it from {LINK REMOVED} since 20$ is a high price for it in its current state. I bought it for about 13$.			"

												I have very mixed reviews about this game. First off, I have heard a lot of the Gauntlet series and the only one I've ever played was Dark Legacy on Gamecube. It had crappy graphics, lame gameplay, nothing complicated but it had something that this Gauntlet did not have..The charm to make me laugh.Gauntlet, a dungeon crawler I have not played for a long time is a fairly decent game. Comparing it with Diablo would be unfair, since Diablo was a very unbalanced game. Gauntlet is a very well balanced game with no over-powered character and completely very different play styles between the 4 classes with Wizard being the most complicated but most rewardingly exciting character to wield. Good graphics and pretty much zero story is normal for a game like this. It is straight-forward and simple to get used to.But Gauntlet's greatest strength for balanced gameplay and better graphics is its very own downfall. It kept the basic skeleton of what Gauntlet is, but it lacked the charm and uniqueness to stand apart from any other dungeon crawler game, let alone apart from Dark Legacy. It was straightforward, but that's all it is, straightforward with a spice of linear and a topping of repetitionWhat made Dark Legacy truly great is how wacky it was with stupid skills, range attacks for all classes and melee when your character was dealing face-to-face against an enemy. Of course, some excel in one thing while others excel in theirs. Death was also wacky as heck, chasing us like mad while leeching our lives. It had a load of flaws...but those flaws (like Halo1) was it's biggest asset and uniqueness that made me and my friends laugh through the night.This Gauntlet has stripped away all that charm and replaced it with standard issued factory produced games that can be found anywhere at their bare skeleton. Sure the game requires some skill to play, esspecially with the wizard, but it's not enough to compensate for the lack of fun factor. It's a serious dungeon crawler...and very little levels and character classes. Leveling should have been the better option to keep me playing since there are so few classes. But if there were a ton more kinds of classes, it's current balanced style would have complimented it. Much to experience and much to experiment.With so little dungeons, unworthy winnings barely worth gaining, very little items to buy...Gauntlet is a decent game, and that's all it is. Decent. I haven't even laughed once since I started playing this game online. It truly made me believe that Dark Legacy was truly better than this Gauntlet.5 out of 10 is all I can give it. It's a little fun and has it's moments of intensity which I enjoyed. But I'm not laughing and going gaga over this game. I'm already bored of it.The developers should have taken risks, and did something stupid yet playable rather than trying so hard to make this game perfect and flawless. It's flaws and improvements are both professionally unfun to endure compared to Dark Legacy. It's genericly fun for few hours. That's the most you'd get out of it.			"

												I really liked the old Gauntlet. This one requires teamwork and a lot of trial and error. You will die, very easily.The classes are varied and fun to play with. My favorite is the Elf. It runs really well with never a dip in frames or stutters when the mobs fill the screen.There isn't too much replay value. You do unlock different powers and cosmetic gear but thats about it. Playing with friends wether online, local or even both is where the meat of the game is. As of this writing I had no problem finding people to p[lay with. It's fun and worth the $20 price. Just don't expect the depth of Hammerwatch or Torchlight.If you like dungeon crawlers and co-op games this is a goodie. 8/10			"

												This is the greatest thing to happen to the Gauntlet Franchise.  It's very fun, the difficulty comes in Easy and Hard and of course NORMAL but also something called UNFAIR for a super dee-duper challenge.  Warrior is BOSS DPS, Elf and Wizard do dps of course, but in different ways, Elf is like a Demon Hunter from Blizzard Diablo 3, and Wizard is a super dps but very not-maneuverable.  Then there's Valkyrie, she's the boss, the MAIN TANK.   I play her always. :D			"

												Fantastic Gauntlet remake and a real riot to play with friends. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a nice and light action RPG. The combat is deceptively simple and actually quite deep if you want to survive the challenging harder difficulties.Make sure you have a controller if you want to have the full experience though.

												Awesome if you like the style of gameplay from the original Gauntlet. If you like the preview videos of the gameplay, chances are you'll like the game. There is one annoying thing, though. Playing Merlin online. You compete for gold with the other players, and he has, by far, the longest cooldown on his dash ability. This means you're pretty much always getting the least gold. He also has more utility, but he has to use a lot more skills to be on equal ground to other characters. If you like challenges he'll be a great character. Seems to have a few OP abilities, but the cooldown on them is long enough to make him boring for me. But if you don't mind slightly longer cooldowns but a lot more options, maybe he'll be good for you. Just be sure to save that dash for getting gold, if possible (half the time it's not possible). Players are brutal on this game when it comes to gold, but it's all in good fun.10/10			"

Usually you have to attack with basic attack and thats make game to much basic. More complex attack make game more funny. Thats why only good chracter is wizard. Only complex chracter of this game. Relic system is very bad. Because you have to use potion to use relic and potions are rare. When potions are rare i dont want to use relics. Needs to change that system. Something like cooldown system or filling up some kind of rage and using relics will be better. Sometimes become 4 player in lobby is hard Wepons and armors are only cosmetic (I think so.

												Are you wishing to find something similar to good old Diablo 2, but with the ability to move with the WASD-keys, aim with the mouse and more or less wave-zombie-survival-like gameplay? Look no further.Gauntlet is a great game for both playing solo or in a party. Choose one of five classic characters: Barbarian (aka The Warrior)Valkyre (aka The Tank)Archer (-_-)Wizard (aka Invoker's little bro)or Necromancer (aka The DLC-chick)and get into the fight through the vast dungeons full of monsters, traps, TURKEY and GOLD! The more you play and the more you kill - the more powerful you get, opening new bonuses and abilities.Sharpen your axe and spear, stretch your bow or ....? your spellbook and dive into action!			"

												The game is immersive with graphics that, although not cutting edge, seem right for the overall plot. Control system for the keyboard will take a little getting used to as movement is by seperate keybindings and targeting is by curser. Charcters begin with sufficient skills to enable advancement, and despite the possibly overcomplicated wizard spell system, all playable. Necro is however possibly the best character to use - just ensure you have space to use abilities. Multiplayer is recommended.			"

												While its not going to revolutionize the Gauntlet name or make it onto anyone's Top 10 games of 2014, Gauntlet is still a fun romp that gets better with friends, and is an excellent restart for the franchise. The gameplay is largely mindless, not many decisions need to be made even if you're playing as the most complex class, but feels rewarding and enjoyable if you can stomach the grindy nature of it. Harder difficulties are recommended, turning the game into a zombie/demon/orc melee extravaganza that requires a good amount of skill or luck to get through unscathed. Story is almost non-existant, but the characters are amusing and good for a few laughs, especially if paired together in co-op where they will play off each other. Playable solo, but much more grindy in nature this way. This is the type of game to play on a friday night with some friends and some beers, it doesn't take too much effort but can still be challenging and leads to some fun stories.			"

												Unplayable due to terrible controls.Fighting and moving are very difficult.  It's hard to get your character to do what you tell it to.  There are a bunch of special moves and combos and such, but you end up doing them in the wrong direction or missing the enemy that is right next to you.It starts in a tutorial level.  There is one enemy zombie, just walking around in a circle, slowly.  You have to kill the zombie.  It takes 1 or 2 hits.  But doing that will take 5-10 tries and getting the 15 feet to the enemy will require effort.It is frustrating.Of note is that I have 0.2 hours into this game, and that is the most of anybody in my friends list.

												Gauntlet may seem like the standard dungeon crawler at first but the gameplay is nothing short of glorious. As you tear through swarms of goons like a kid and christmas presents, the first glimpse you catch is the Warrior spinning his axe. Then you spot the Elf rapid-firing shots from a distance. Amidst the chaos you notice the Wizard blasting off spells and the Valkyie handing out slayings. What makes the game special is that four player unity. Together the players bring out the best of what a modern co-op game should, and in harmonious fashion. The evidence is in the legacy. The game isn't perfect. Then again the best things never are.Note: This is for Pre-Slayer Edition. RIP.			"

												""Stay a while and listen"" (blizzy pls don't sue me, k, thx, bai!) ... or in this case, read a wall of text  :PWhat I first noticed about the game is its menu, it's simple, clear, all a menu should be.Then the game started with the tutorial, forcing me to play it. I did not see a ""skip tutorial"" button (my bad if there was but pretty sure there wasn't).Not nice forcing people to do something they don't want to, give them the option to choose.And if you are going to argue that they had to do that the way they did so people would learn about the characters and their mechanics then i say to you: ""I'm sorry but I do not agree!""There are better ways to introduce important stuff then forcing it on people, hide it like Portal and Portal 2 did - almost the whole game is a tutorial preparing the player for what is to come, but we are not here to talk about Portal, Gauntlet time.The tutorial on its own was put together nicely, introducing the characters and their mechanics through gameplay rather then through text, which is always nice.The characters are ok-ish defined.The Warrior being a warrior can take damage as well as dish out damage of his own.The Elf uses range attacks to defeat his enemies, although his range isn't that great. I expected more from an elf ranger.The Valkyrie is a nice mix of the two (i particularly liked the Captain America like shield throw).These three characters are pretty straightforward, but the Wizard is a bit more complicated.Having 9 spells to choose from, the Wizard can access his spells with a certain button combination. The desired spell is then ready to use, assuming its not on cooldown.Not too intuitive, and a bit confusing at first but fiddle around with the spell combinations and you will get the hang of it.I must point out that the ice spells were not as useful to me as the other two types of spells (fire and lightning) and i ended up playing mostly with fire and lightning spells, and even here with not all of them.The Fire Bomb is useless if you are near a doorway or a low ceiling-ish area it will hit the ceiling and explode dealing no damage to the monsters below it or it won't end up exploding where you expected it to cause it ended up hitting something you did not thought possible (could be a bug or just bad design).Also Lightning Discharge was of no use to me, if i wanted to knock someone back I can use my Storm Barrier, so I ended up using it only when I incorrectly combined buttons to get a spell.The RPG elements are kind of wierd in concept and implementation.If you buy armour and weapons you only get a cosmetic change. But you can also buy relics to give you buffs to your speed, damage, attack speed or the ability to summon illusions or a demonic gargoyle to fight by your side.However you can only have 2 relics and can not use any without potions. These potions you can not buy, they can only be found throughout the levels, as well as food which restores hit points.Instead of gaining traditional levels for each character, you can only improve your stats by performing achievement-like actions called Masteries. For example killing 10,000 monsters grants a 10 % damage bonus.First time around, the structure of the game is interesting and the level design is a mix of pre-made and randomly generated environment.Some levels are more complex than others, tasking you or the group to push blocks, insert statues into spots, or fill a lava pool to raise a bridge and then finally an okay-ish boss battle.The campaign is broken up into three acts, with four stages, four repetitive stages.Each set of those stages unfolds in the same way:First you start with a standard level, then you move on to a shorter level with a frustrating twist like being chased by death which btw is bad at its job and its not so hard to outrun (just frustrating) or a dark cave eating away at your nerves as you try to hold back the urge to pluck out your hair and then (as i already mentioned) a boss fight.Higher difficulty only makes enemies more resistant to damage and drop more gold.Once the campaign is finished there’s not much incentive to revisit and replay the game.The A.I. is not to bright either. Getting stuck frequently on each other, corners, doorways and other stuff lying around the level.After some time you notice how they move and can kite them around the level making them easy targets. Easier than they would have been on their own.And a one last thing, the camera, oh boy ... The view is zoomed out far enough to cover an area, but not far enough for a four player co-op play through. The camera does not follow any player controlled characters but hovers above an area of the level and its easy to lose sight of your character.Additionally if any teammate goes idle you can't move on without them cause the camera will stand still in an area and try to cover all players.I am sure that Arrowhead did their best but they neither went full retro nor did they break from the past.As i see this game, its like they tried to stay close to the original (Gauntlet from 1985) but not to close cause people my not like it today and tried to make it an appealing 2014 role-play, dungeon crawl, hack and slash game but actually got stuck in the middle of it all resulting in a not so good game.In short its repetitive and overly simplistic, awkward camera, an uninteresting upgrade system and too little substance or variety to satisfy players.However, with four committed players the co-op works well, and it’s certainly not the worst Gauntlet revamp there’s ever been.All in all IMHO this game is a 5.5 / 10, nice try but u failed, sry and i do not recommend this game.

												This could be a fun little arcade co-op game with 3 of your pals.  There's just one issue, it's unplayable with M&K.  Sure they have some keys (the arrow keys for movement), but this game is fast paced and requires some twitch and precision aiming/dodging.  That just ain't happening by using the arrow keys to move.I don't need the wtf bro it's 2015 get a controller already, it's the future bro.  So save your vapid insipidity.   I'm just  here to inform anyone else out there that, if you don't have a controller, don't get this game.I'm gonna vote it no, until I get a controller and play it.  I have purchased too many games before checking the efficacy of playing with a M&K.  It will damage my pride, but I think it's time get comfortable with a controller.			"

												This game is awful. I enjoyed Gauntlet Legends on the old consoles - this is nothing like it. There are only 4 characters (+1 if you buy a ridiculously expensive addon), and they don't learn any new abilities ever. Equipment is all cosmetic, so there are practically no upgrades except for a small ""perk"" system which you won't feel unless you log a lot of playtime. The levels are boring and flat with few puzzles that the old games had, and the bosses are totally uninteresting. There is not even the token storyline that the old game had, and the basic characters they did add in are ugly. I don't know what kind of nostalgia feeling other people are getting from this, but I had no enjoyment at all.			"

The game runs smooth and ...Well, the review above pretty much shows my experience with this game. I've replayed the first dungeon multiple times and it just keeps crashing. I've only been able to complete it once and it crashed right after finishing it. I tried different settings, re-installing, verifying cache, killing background apps, etc. The game runs smooth while it works but the constant crashing obviously makes it unplayable for me. I have a decent PC that runs other much more demanding games without any issues so the game itself seems to be the issue. If anyone has any tips to get it to work it would be appreciated and I wouldn't mind changing the review to positive. But for now it seems like that's $10 down the drain.			"

												I've been a fan of Gauntlet for a long time, and this game is fun, but it really lacks that Gauntlet feel. My friend and I nearly finished it in four hours, and it was all very layed out, ver predictable. I was kind of disappointed to find that there are zero collectables, no level up systems, and some pretty weak secrets.The levels should be more divers, there should be challenging puzzles and where is my color choice? Also there are only about half of the characters and 1/3 the worlds to play! I would very much love to see this fleshed out more, because it is fun to play, but it's just not... Gauntlet.			"

												One of the worst games I've ever played. Very cheap rip off of the gauntlet franchise. The gameplay is very linear and boring. For dungeons they have just copypasted the first map of each dungeon, added few corners and corridors and that's it. Same goes for the monsters. Every level has the same monsters and spawners, but with a diffrent skin.They should have taken a look at what Gauntlet: Dark Legacy was like and learned from that. This game is just garbage. 3/10			"

It's really annoying when I roll to dodge, and suddenly I'm attacking the wrong way or dodge again back into the spiketrap I just rolled to avoid.I dont recomend the game simply because the devs have no sympathy for people that bought this game and want at least a fixed SP camera, in MP thats a feature of the game and I wouldnt want it anyother way.

												I like it but I do have a few reservations. It does capture the feel of classic quarter eating Gauntlet - to a point. But, I think it is also trying to be a Diablo type game and it falls short trying to be two things at once.  There is a great C64 game published by EA called Raid on Doomfang. It featured 100 levels and a level designer - good times!Also, I am puzzled as to why this game is poorly optimized. It runs very HOT whereas games like Kingdoms of Amalur - admittedly not a Cry Engine GPU killer - barely cause a blip in GPU temps.I am hopeful that either level randomization and/or a leve editor will be added to Gauntelt 2014 to give it some legs. As it stands now, it is fun for VERY short bursts of time. Come on devs, please flesh ut the skeleton?			"

It's really annoying when I roll to dodge, and suddenly I'm attacking the wrong way or dodge again back into the spiketrap I just rolled to avoid.I dont recomend the game simply because the devs have no sympathy for people that bought this game and want at least a fixed SP camera, in MP thats a feature of the game and I wouldnt want it anyother way. But hey if you have a 4k moniter and radeon cards they listen a little bit better.again the game is fun but the camera needs to be worked at			"

												Score: 5 / 10Price/Value: $5 or lessTime: 3 HoursDifficulty: HardThis particular version of Gauntlet just leaves you wishing you were playing the original. While it is a solid effort to update the game and add new mechanics, they end up not functioning properly or are designed to be useless. Gauntlet, for those of you not familiar with the series, has you playing as either a warrior, elf, wizard or valkyrie fighting your way through a randomly generated dungeon for loot. Being an arcade game originally, health used to deteriorate over time, needing to be replenished through food - this is no longer the case even on the highest difficulty. Dungeons are also no longer randomly generated; it seems to be the same maps & paths for every character.The visuals and audio are nothing to write home about, so I'm just going to move onto the game mechanics.One of the most important things for any game, especially one focused on crowd control, is the controls themselves. Shift-key abilities such as the Elf's 'dodge' don't often trigger when pressed or have a starting and ending delay for the animation which causes instant death on higher difficulties. As you might imagine, this can make a character useless when main abilities are broken in this manner. Throwing potions is also another ability broken by animation delays causing death. This makes two out of three skills for your character worthless. The wizard is crippled by a Magicka-like system of magic where clicks and the shift key are used to combine elements for spells. If you are going to play the wizard, make sure you have a printout of the various spell combinations or memorize them. In my opinion, this makes the wizard another broken class. I can't comment on the Valkyrie, having given up on this particular title before even testing the class.  UPDATE: Having played the Valkyrie I can safely say it's as broken as all the other classes, your space-bar ability is all you will spam over and over.All in all, unless you -really- enjoy Gauntlet and want to see some modern mechanics that detract from the experience then pass this by and fire up the original.

												Gauntlet is well...a pretty simple experience. The eponymous gauntlet is full of hordes of monsters and you have to destroy them, along with the summoning stones that spawn them, in order to reach the heart of the maze while collecting gold and eating/destroying food along the way. The complications arise around how to complete that straightforward task. The choice between warrior, valkyrie, elf, or wizard consists of more than a set of strengths and weaknesses; each represents a unique playstyle, from hack and slash to twin-stick shooter. It's that variety of tools, not the diversity of problems to solve, that lends the experience its interest. Joyful hours are spent not just killing the small number of unique enemies spread over a miniscule three environment types and learning the rudimentary story which is implied more than actually told, but in finding new and inventive ways to do so. The heart of Gauntlet has little to do with anything other than answering the very arcade-like question of how to reach the exit with your limited number of (skull) coins.			"

												I don't remember Gauntlet Legends levels being this plain and boring. Seriously, if you want an example of a modern *level design* failure - play this. No juice in them at all, only paper.Other than that you probably gonna have fun at least for the first 4-6 hrs. After that it's more of the 'perfecting the character play' or learning other characters you haven't played yet.On high difficulties reminded me of *Alien Swarm* - requires great cooperation, coordinated planning. Anyone who wants to have the same experience once again should probably really get recommended to play this. -Buy ONLY when the price if low. Really low. Or find real friends and play old gauntlets.(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEXJppB2BCE fu cking look at this sh it. Basically the main difference: you had LEVEL progress pefore and constant characters, now you have short levels and CHARACTER level\progess, and even that is not that deep.)			"

												Alright, this game is AWESOME. It's THAT type of couch co-op where you actually have to cooperate.While single-player seems to be quite well - though a little bit harder for some classes - multi-player is the bomb. Not only it allows local coop, but online works wonderful. And let me tell you - multiplayer is a blast. You get a couple of friends on skype - and you will have hours of non-stop fun.And itself it's a pretty good game, though some classes seem to be harder to play/master. Levels are nicely decorated, announcer doesn't annoy you, classes are useful in their own way and generally it's enjoyable. Keyboard works fine, though I yet have to try the controller.While it seems that ""Getting 3 shards of whatever"" will be pretty quick (the first chapter took 3 of us 2 hours), the replay value is in different classes, because they differ A LOT. Warrior deals massive damage to tours and fat monsters while elf thins out small crowds of weaklings and mage supports with slowdowns and ignitions. And because of this variety everybody plays differently.I would say it is DEFINITELY worth the money if you have a couple of friends who'll join you.			"

												I'd give Gauntlet a ""meh"" rating and a don't buy unless it is cheap. I have used it with the keyboard/mouse as well as with a XBOX 360 controller and find that neither seems to work great. I find the keyboard/mouse combo to be more precise in aiming by a significant margin. The xbox 360 controller only gives you so fine of an angual adjustment and I find myself being one tick off from where I really mean to be aiming a lot of the time. Neither control scheme works particularly well at the end of the day.Gameplay is repetitive and uninspiring and I find that my group of friends doesn't use the potions to great effect. Overall we have some fun but the controls aren't good and the game is too repititious which I guess works in favor with the game being short.			"

												20$ for this piece of shhh.- 3 worlds- 4 classes; can't have two of the same class in one game- Equipment pieces offer no bonuses whatsoever and have barely any cosmetic value- Unfunny characters trying to be witty and failing miserably- Previous Gauntlet games had stories that nobody cared about, but never as forgettable, asinine and all around laughably pointless- There are like 10 purchasable skills total but you'll be using only 2 or 3 for the duration of your entire ""adventure""- By the end of the game, you will neither know nor care about the skills that you haven't tested yet- Harder game difficulties don't make the game any better- Literally nothing worthwhile postgame- Like many multiplayer games, this one was meant to be played with friends, and even then, it's still not all that. To play in Single Player mode is to condemn yourself to the torments that are boredom and regretGauntlet™ like the biggest cashgrab of 2014. It just feels like Arrowhead Game Studios (and WB Games of course) rushed an half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bargain bin shovelware type of game and slapped the GAUNTLET name on it for that sweet, sweet fanboy dosh. This game is worse than a good many indie games that are produced on a much lower budget and that cost  considerably less than a whopping, arrogant 20$. I'm sorry if I might've hurt Arrowhead's hard-working employees' feelings, but that's how it is. Maybe they had no say in the creative process. Maybe they were forced to make a game they knew the fans would feel insulted and disgusted by. I hope that's the case.Keep your money. Man, I still cannot believe how mediocre Gauntlet™ turned out to be.			"

Play the right way using a gamepad, sit back, and enjoy this love letter to the old school. I've played all of the gauntlet games from gauntlet 1 to seven sorrows, and this gauntlet is the best of the series. I love that I can play gauntlet as a pure hack-n-slash (warrior), twin stick shooter (elf & wiz) or as captain america (valkyire). Don't expect a diablo or a mouse driven action rpg, this game is arcade action with lite rpg elements. Must buy for people who enjoyed any of the gauntlet games.			"

Instead im this stupid valkarie who derps when you attack with your shield up. Because  there is hardly no scaling of the characters, the game is senslessly repetative, boring and infuriating when get through the levels. I couldnt make it past the first set of levels without getting bored. This game just leaves a whole in my heart. I mean, why u no include pojo? I wanted to be a chicken. And The whole trinket or whatever the heck they are, system is kinda stupid. And when I picked up potions I was looking forward to killing some wraith thingys. But no. The potions are sucky like the rest of the game. I would sooner recomend pokemon channel over this piece of trash. The graphics are meh, i mean they are not terrible, but if you are gonna have a sucky game then atleast make it a pretty piece of crap.

												This game is everything I was praying it would be. The four characters available have differences in their playing styles which makes the game worth playing multiple times. The enemies are difficult at times but this forces the player to get creative rather than fall into the same murderous trance over and over again. Each floor contains something different from bosses, to death incarnate, to just flat out treasure troves. To make things better, the game contains many upgrades in the form of relics and you can even customize your hero with new armor and weapons in the shop in the hub room. This game is made even more fun when you play with your friends, the teamwork element makes strategies more fun and gathering more loot than your friend is always a fun contest. I cannot wait to see how this game progresses. It is a fantastic reboot and is more fun than most games I've played this year. So yea 10/10 :)			"

												Now some people may think ""co-op"" is about strategy dependent on the strength of a team working together. However, these people are idiots who don't understand that the true path to victory lies in thinking only of one's own needs, and the one class that currently embodies this most Gauntlet of all ideals is the Elf. Long range attacks with little to no effort in aiming them at food or potions the lesser classes may require, and most importantly, the broken ability to dodge roll or otherwise go faster than the slower fools and gain all of the treasure and E-sports glory for one's self.  Remember, the intelligent player runs towards the elf and silently mocks whoever picks the other classes; even if the Wizard is some sort of Magika trained savant and easily input spell combos on the fly, the key is to keep the meat shields around so that you can profit from their mistake of not picking the right class. Make them believe you care about them, but out do them in all things as the most broken of all characters.			"

While it stays pretty true to classic Gauntlet, it also adds a few new adjustments to gameplay. Things like masterys were added for the sake of character progression, they add little buffs here and there for completing gameplay challanges. For example, if you kill a ton of a certain enemy type (which is pretty likely) you get a small damage bonus against those enemy types. Characters also have a small variety of attacks, usually consisting mainly of a standard, heavy, and special move with some small variants depending on the class. The only class that deviates heavily from this is the wizard, who has combination attacks much like how attacks work in Magicka. Characters can also gain further abilities by purchasing relics, which grant powers such as setting the ground on fire where you walk.While the game is mostly fine on a technical level, there are some issues. The UI at the bottom is fairly large and can sometimes block your view enough to get you killed by enemies you cant see. The framerate can dip dramatically in some instances, usually due to large amounts of enemies being on the screen at once, which is something that happens quite frequently in the game. There are also no custom keyboard control settings, which is strange for a PC release (apparently it will be coming in a future patch). While these issues are certainly not game-breaking, they are something to consider.Overall, its a pretty great game if you're a fan of classic Gauntlet, or Gauntlet-like gameplay. Highly Recommended.			"

												Gauntlet is an incredibly enjoyable co-op hack-and-slash dungeon crawler that is highly reminiscent of the original, while offering Arrowhead’s own spin on the foundations previously set. The game plays well and is a lot of fun with friends, co-op definitely being the recommended way to go, although is still viable as single player. It’s certainly a little lacking in places, especially when it can occasionally feel a little repetitive, but overall this doesn’t hinder it too much. The game looks and feels great, and is something I would not hesitate recommending to fans of the hack-and-slash dungeon crawler genre. Summary:+ Fantastic class revamp and disparity.+ Enjoyable combat and gameplay.+ Nicely stylised visuals.+ Good difficulty variety.+ Decent boss battles for the most-part.- Some level mechanics feel too gimmicky.- Levels can feel a little repetitive.

												This version of Gauntlet is an ode to the original arcade and NES versions of Gauntlet. It feature the four heroes from the originals with the respected colors. It holds the classic arcade style hack and slash that inspired games like Diablo, with the additive of armor and relics that give the game a little bit more depth and a sense of progression. Ontop of that each character has it's own unique feel and move set, not a single character is alike in this game and it gives a very unique challenge of overcoming each stage with certain limits and abilities. It does not have many levels, but you will find that is because you build up in difficulty through them, starting in normal to unlock your first armor pieces that you will use to complete the levels in hard more, and so forth. As it is right now it has a ton of replayability and is very fun for multiplayer. There are not many levels in the base but for an asking price of 15 dollars you really get your moneys worth, and hopefully future DLC will add more levels and armor to the game. All in all I give this version of Gauntlet a 8/10. It's got rather well placed music, a very decent challenge even on normal difficulties and a nice sense of progression.			"

												Man this is dull. Claw your own parts off dull. There is better level design to be seen from wheeling a cart slightly quickly around Ikea. If you put a shelf in the cart from the not-cheapest-but-close range, the graphics would be better too.You need to eat every 20 seconds for no apparent reason, otherwise Bad Things Happen. Possibly they run out of meatballs in the shop at the end.The coop multiplayer is stable and doesnt require port forwarding, which is good. Everything else is bad. Bad.			"

												Definitely a faithful representation of the original, and even better. One of the best top-down action games I have ever played. All of the classes are fun to play, especially the wizard. The way you double tap two-button combinations on the controller (XX, YB, etc.) is really smart and is the only real way you could possibly get to each spell quick enough while fighting, because you do need to be able to switch to the right spells at the right time to survive, especially on unfair mode. However it can still get confusing trying to navigate all of his spells (9 total) while being swarmed in combat, especially in unfair mode. One thing that I dislike is that bosses themselves serve no challenge. The difficulty from boss fights comes from being swarmed by other enemies while fighting the bosses. The sounds and music are very memorable, the graphics and art direction are superb, and the effects are also very well done. Probably the only complaint I have is that sometimes in 4 player games there is so much♥♥♥♥♥♥going on at once that it is very easy to get lost in the action or take hits when you otherwise would not have. Multiplayer is a blast and is one of the most fun games to play online. The more people there are, the harder the difficulty is. So in unfair mode with 4 players get ready for some pain.Also, the fact that beating tougher levels on hard/unfair unlocks new gear for looks, not stats, is a joke. It's a top-down game, nobody is going to notice but you. There should be more purposeful rewards for playing through the campaign more than once. Or at least make the gear look better.I got this when it first came out on Nuuvem (Steam is blocking Nuu vem, are you ♥♥♥♥ing serious) for $13.50 and that was a steal. It has plenty of content to justify its $20 price tag, but don't expect it to be any longer than the average length of a $20 game. If anything, I cannot wait for its inevitable expansions. I mean I hope.8/10 after 50+ hours it is getting extremely repetitive. It needs a dlc badly.			"

												Was tempted to give it a thumbs up - Really solid game with some solid points. I do  however have far too many gripes to warrant thisThe Good:- Great sound track - Musics great!- New meets old styled gameplay - I like the varied moves, big cooldown styled attacks and the way they did the Wizard and Elf. Feels like Diablo 3 gave some inspiration to this game and it's very much welcomed.- Local Multiplayer mixed with online- Can you say awesome? Because more games need more local multiplayer ESPECIALLY on the PC. The Bad:- Progression is non existant - The relics are neat, but im a bit disapointed with the gear. Getting more gold? Meh. It wont give me a bigger axe or make me hit any harder or put me in some shiney new armor that does something neat for me. I was hoping for deeper rpg elements.- Incredibly short - Games far too short. Can be cleared too quickly.- Dejavu with dungeon elements - Playing through a few specific dungeons I felt they ""dragon aged"" it. By that I mean they copy and pasted parts of other dungeons into it.- Weak multiplayer elements - Game encourages you to take items and food from other players.- Few minor bugs - I got a crown knocked off my head and it landed on a part of the map I couldn't get at. Thanks game.- No colour palette swapping - ""Red Wizard needs food badly"" ""Blue Warrior is about to die"" - I miss the colours.. Having four warriors or four wizards would have made this better, why not? :(All in all I'd say pass on this unless it's on a 50%+ sale. For 5-10 bucks you'll get a decent ammount of fun for a day with a couple of your friends for local multiplayer, but the lack of replay-ability, non-existant RPG elements really make this a tough one to purchase at the now asking price of CDN$ 21.99 "

												A well made take on the old classic Atari game Gauntlet, that i can recommend to anyone who wants to enjoy a simple yet deep hack n' slash experience. The game features fun mechanics, an interesting aesthetic style, as well as having a badass soundtrack, that harkens back to the old preceding Gauntlet games.Besides the obvious traits of each character (the elf has a bow and the warrior a melee weapon, etc). Each of the characters feature different skills and mechanics that you have to adapt to, in order to maximise your effectiveness. And you can also customize your character with artifacts to suit your style of play.However when i played this game i didn't do it for the character customization. This game just makes killing feel good. Especially when you get yourself into a trance where everything just clicks and you eviscerate 20 opponents in a matter or seconds.My only beef with this game is, that compared to the older gauntlet games, the ""puzzles"" in this game are too easy. It often feels like the game is taking your hand and leading you to where you need to place the dynamite or throwing you an extra key to open one of the locked doors. In the older Gauntlet games, the game would force you to think about managing your keys, and solving the puzzles in the correct order. However in this version this is not the case and takes some of the more cognitive aspects of the game away. I can't say much about the multiplayer experience, since i've yet to play it with another friend  ( :c ).  But other than that Gauntlet has been a fun experience and i would definately play more of this in the future.			"

												Luckily, I had the day off from work today, and got to spend pretty much the entire day playing the remake of one of my favorite classic games, Gauntlet. Arrowhead did a superb job from what I've seen so far. The graphics aren't anything phenomenal, nonetheless, the game looks pretty good and runs smooth. The gameplay is fast paced and well fleshed out. Playing online with random players is just as brutal as you would expect from a new age remake of Gauntlet. You don't always feel like your party members are your friends. If feels like you and 3 other heroes are just trying to survive the death trap you've been thrown into, and you can either help each other, or take what you can for yourself. This can be frustrating but also extremely fun. It adds an element to the game that is Gauntlets signiature and they did a great job resurrecting this classic, adding modern features without subtracting from the old school arcade feel. They added masteries and relics, which is the closest thing to ""leveling up""the game has. So over time your characters will get a bit stronger. But still, DO NOT get this game if you want just like to grind. You won't be building an immortal barbarian with super l33t gear in this game.  If you aren't bringing some effort and skill to the game, you will die. It's best played with at least 2 or more people, but solo can be fun as well.   I do think theres some balancing that needs to be done, and I'd like to see more levels added in the near future, but as of now it is totally worth 20$.			"

												I have been a huge fan of Gauntlet for a very long time, and when this game came out I was very excited to try it, after warner took Mortal Kombat under it's wing and it's done so well I had high expectations for this game, and unfortunately NONE of them were met.The game tossed out every previous good idea in the last couple installments so things like 3way shot thunder hammer those no longer seem to exist.The Classes you can choose are severely lacking with only a selection of 5 [4 from the start]The customization is nearly non existant and what little you do have is set ""on the top shelf"" so you're quite aware the game is going to be exactly the same it is when you start it and nothing really amazing is going to happen.The Potions have been changed into something else, now they are solely for using your items you can buy which you're only able to carry 2, not only that you can no longer stock pile them so if you don't use them the level you find them, you lose them. You can also only carry so many of them as if they're really all that great anymore.The level design is extremely stale and as soon as you start the game you get the notion ""I'm going to see a lot of the same S***"" through this game""In conclusion when I got this game I was pumped after all the years I'd been trying to get a better computer to run it properly and in all the years I've played video games I've NEVER played a game I completely hated and felt cheated, for buying it and I've enjoyed some games people really cannot stand. If you're a fan of the older games, especially the last couple releases like ""Dark Legacy"" and ""Legends"" this is not the game for you, you will be SEVERELY disappointed. If you're a fan of the orginal you're SLIGHTLY better off, but I STILL do not recommend it, What makes games like Mortal Kombat so good is they kept what made the games great initially while adding content to the games that improved it, what makes this game bad is they tried to dumb it down all the way until it was simple like the originals, and then tried to make it more ""real"" which is dumb for such a game that was built for the kind of ""cheesie goodness"" kind of feelMy comment: Why doesn't Warner Brothers just put funding into a ""Gauntlet Dark Legacy HD"" that plays online and add content to that? That would have been MUCH better.			"

												Luckily, I had the day off from work today, and got to spend pretty much the entire day playing the remake of one of my favorite classic games, Gauntlet. Arrowhead did a superb job from what I've seen so far. The graphics aren't anything phenomenal, nonetheless, the game looks pretty good and runs smooth. The gameplay is fast paced and well fleshed out. Playing online with random players is just as brutal as you would expect from a new age remake of Gauntlet. You don't always feel like your party members are your friends. If feels like you and 3 other heroes are just trying to survive the death trap you've been thrown into, and you can either help each other, or take what you can for yourself. This can be frustrating but also extremely fun. It adds an element to the game that is Gauntlets signiature and they did a great job resurrecting this classic, adding modern features without subtracting from the old school arcade feel. They added masteries and relics, which is the closest thing to ""leveling up""the game has. So over time your characters will get a bit stronger. But still, DO NOT get this game if you want just like to grind. You won't be building an immortal barbarian with super l33t gear in this game.  If you aren't bringing some effort and skill to the game, you will die. It's best played with at least 2 or more people, but solo can be fun as well.   I do think theres some balancing that needs to be done, and I'd like to see more levels added in the near future, but as of now it is totally worth 20$.			"

												Do not buy if you're looking for an old gauntlet experience, this game fails at that on so many levels. I wont bother to list them. Just read the other reviews for this game and you will understand why this game doesn't work for nostalgia trip.Only pro is that you can play it with your friends, everything else is a con, especially the ""arena battles"", where the game locks you in a room and forces you to fight enemies.I admit  that I was hoping for a old gauntlet like smash 'em to pieces with single hit, not this kind of puke like every hack n' slash rpg where you have to slash a single enemy a hundred times before it dies, and most of all that pisses me off, this game is so bad at this. Baldurs gate dark alliance was better on a console than this game!Maybe I'll just stick to the emulators and try to remember the good old days with my cousin, playing this awesome game, before this crap. I recommend the same thing to anyone who's looking at this game and thinking ""maybe I should buy it for nostalgia"". I was stupid enough to buy it ""pre-order""... I feel like they cheated with their promises, but hey, I'm the stupid one for believing it before it was launched.			"

												I've always loved the Gauntlet series(especially the N64 game), but this newest version of ""gauntlet"" was a truely horrible disaster. Not only is this game incredibly short but it was very cheaply made with alot of ""copy and paste"" in the measely 12 levels they give you. The game has literally no storyline, other than some mysterious voice that captured you in the beginning and forces you to fight these levels for him. In the end, it appears he used you to get shards for some sword (that he never explained anything about) and then says ""This must be the final test. My final test."" and then proceeds to attack you. The battle is easier than the levels and is very short. You get a little bit of dialogue with a total of three pictures ( literal non-moving pictures) for your ending. All in all, I'd say if you really wanna play this pathetic game then wait til it goes on sale for $0.50 or it's free for a weekend(as you can prolly beat it in two hours). Also, there is only one character that is worth playing as (Valkryie) and is incredibly unbalanced with the other players. So, the creators of this game NEVER need to make another game and I would like my money back. Also, I would like to kick them in the balls for ruining one of my favorite games.			"

												Despite some issues at launch including choppy sound and an issue getting a non-xbox360 gamepad to work (i must have gotten luck), this game is an absolute nostalgic blast. It's simple to understand and challenging. Would put more down, but haven't had the chance to really play through the entire game. It does seem fairly short, however the masteries make it interesting and help add to the replayablity of it on a higher difficulty. Definitely worth the 20 bucks, also got to mention that there as of now is no in-game chat which can make it difficult to communicate when playing a quick match, but if your playing with friends just open steam voice chat. Also, the game has huge amounts of promise in that there seems no reason for the devs to release more dungeons and content or possibly even a sequel.			"

												Buggy, but fun.It's certainly very Gauntlety. Pretty true to the name of the series, with spammy hack-and-slash co-op fun. Food you can shoot and gold you can grab before your allies do are the highlights of the game. I'm not too sure about the ""masteries"" system and long grind to get more (or any) items on multiple characters, but each character is good enough at the start for someone to jump into the last levels of normal without having anything. Not sure about higher difficulties.There are some problems though. The crown will often bounce onto various objects you can't collect it from, or straight through a wall, off the map and hang around in midair until it expires. You can spawn or get spawned into lava for immediate death. The global leaderboards barely work (played on launch day, my teammates often were not listed as part of my team for our records, or didn't show up in the score listings despite being 2nd or 3rd according to my leaderboard).  Framerate drops like crazy on many levels, even on good computers.Overall, it was a good time, especially considering the relatively low price point.			"

												So I'm here to talk about this new game, Gauntlet, an- HEY! Stop shooting the food!Gauntlet comes back from the glory days of the arcade after a few moderate attempts to revive the franchise.What's presented to us here is an interesting take on an old-school idea:Grab your friends (Online or offline), choose between four classes, enter the arena, and slash/shoot/blow up your way to victory!Just...stop shooting the food please.Gauntlet is centered around fun with your friends. From the beginning you will be facing hordes of enemies that can be dealt with better as a group than by yourself. While nowadays some may draw a comparison to Dynasty Warriors or other hack-n-slash games, the different game mechanics presented with each character help spice things up.Like Magicka? the wizard might be up you alley.Like a stick shooter? Pick the ElfWanna button mash your way to victory? The Warrior and Valkyrie might be the choice for you.With reviews coming in for about 6-7 hours of completion time, Gauntlet seems to be a little on the short side of the gameplay factor. And yet, it will probably have you coming back for more, as you try different characters and relics combinations that add more variety for the game.For its price point, it seems like a very fair deal as it's not trying to market itself as a AAA title, but more of a fun afternoon/night time fun with your friends after work.For those who want some nostalgia with a new kick to it, or those who have never heard of Gauntlet!

												Personally I'm in between whether this game was good or not. I have experienced past Gauntlet games (pretty much every one of them) and found the level scheme to be a bit on the lacking side. I like the idea of stages inside each level, that is nice, but the down side is there are also very few levels in each chapter and given that there are only 3 chapters I expected more from this Gauntlet Game. Too much Hype not enough content. I do recommend this game because even though it is short it is a lot of fun. I understand there are more difficulty levels and more items to unlock and upgrade. But I need more Gauntlet action than these levels provided. If there is more Level content going to be added to the game (PLEASE!!!) there is a lot mroe room in the main dungeon before entering the doors to add more areas to branch off of and add more doors or even portals to new realms that have tons more doors and chapters to play. Just please consider this in the near future.			"

												Every now and then, you have an itch that you simply must scratch. Video games in particular have a way of tapping into your brain bank and embedding themselves into your memory.Gauntlet (2014) does an excellent job of tapping into the 'nostalgia' factor that recent releases of classic franchises tend to rely so heavily on. When I say that, I mean that it reminds me quite a bit of the classic gauntlet from the mid 1980s. When I was younger, the local diner had an old cabinet that I wasted my quarters on. I can't help but have a warm feeling playing this game. It isn't as rich as Dark Legacy and there are undoubtedly better top-down dungeon crawlers. But this is Gauntlet. I'm not sure if I would pay the full price of $20, but it was an easy purchase at $5. I picked up an extra copy to play with a buddy and I'm glad I did. We've had a lot of fun stealing gold and food from one another. "

												Beautifully clean and fluid game mechanics under layer upon layer of polish. This game is a labor of love and it's so apparent. The classes are all very interesting, but the wizard outshines all the others in how well thought out it is. I wish that the other classes had the same level of player experimentation and versatility as the wizard, as it would make this game shine even more.The levels are really well designed and can get extremely challenging even on Normal, which is the difficulty I played on. They're atmospheric and not gimmicky. This is a couch co-op game in the truest sense, and it is incredibly easy to get a game up and running with other people even if you have no real life friends around. I applaud the devs of this game, they really did something cool here and I'm glad that I get to have this game in my library for future fun with friends.			"

												If you enjoyed the classic Gauntlet games, or are a fan of hack n slash rpg's in general, this is the game for you. It is a bit short, usually taking anywhere from 3-8 hours to finish as a single player on normal difficulty. There are quite a bit of unlockables and a leaderboard to provide some replayability. Unfortunately the gold/points leaderboard is rife with cheaters and hackers. The speed run leaderboards seem to be reliable, however. Just like any Gauntlet, or hack and slash game, the gameplay is repetitive. The ending seems rushed, and I'm personally hoping they will add a REAL ending in a patch. All in all I'd say its worth the full price of $20. I wouldn't give it game of the year, but its fun none the less.			"

Probably better played with friends you know then strangers who play like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.Don't get too excited over the classic mode. I thought it would look and play exactly like the arcade version - but it just turns the game into a horrible pixellated mess.			"

												Easy = NormalNormal = Decently HardHard = Memorize the area and events to win, lose half the time to one stupid enemy managing to get a last hit.Unfair = ImpossibleColliseum seasons will have you breaking your head into your keyboard; they are ridiculously hard for the only reward being pointless clothing for your character/bragging rights. The only other way to get cool items is beating the regular campaign levels on harder difficulties, but the only actually cool items require Unfair difficulty which is legitimately UNFAIR.So what do you have left for this game? Oh the actual regular gameplay... well.  Its sort of boring, and I only go through it to complete challenges, get new♥♥♥♥♥♥ progress in the game, etc. The replay value? None. Game mechanics are intentionally simple, which is fine, but when the challenge in this game is the stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""setups"" they have for you to die in this game (inclosed area, ridiculous spam amount of enemies, Death, etc.) and not interesting or creative ways to help challenge the player, all it does it♥♥♥♥♥♥me the ♥♥♥♥ off when I die and if I don't die, its so repetitive It makes me not want to play the game for longer than an hour. I can't do this game any justice, besides the different realms (set of levels, whatever its called) the variety of different scenarios is very limitied, and ♥♥♥♥ there are only 3 realms in the whole game. Yeah, this game is short as♥♥♥♥♥♥ You think I haven't played enough hours in the game to be able to write a review? Ive sped through most of the game, like 55% in what... two hours? Again, semi-understandable given this is like a coin-op styled game, but guess what kiddoes.... ITS STILL SHORT AND REPETIVE AND OVERLY DIFFICULT DUE TO POOR GAME MECHANICS AND SETUPS. Highest graphics look like blended♥♥♥♥♥textures as if it was on a medium graphics setting for a normal game.Reviews for this game are even dumb, im sorry but if you even watch IGN reviews in general you are apart of the 13 year old minecraft, CoD, PewDiePie fan club conformists, because IGN is completely bias and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in their reviews. The people who gave this game an accurate rating was Gamespot's Justin Clark who wrote in the FIRST SENTENCE...""In some sense, the world already has a series that carries on the Gauntlet legacy; it's called Diablo""Go buy Diablo, Go buy Torchlight, ♥♥♥♥ even get any clones of the sort because Gauntlet just feels like a cocktease Diablo, to be completely honest. Diablo 1 was released on December 31, 1996 and provides more variety than this game.You know what this game is? 1. ""omg a new Gauntlet game"" hype  2. Obviously rushed production of game for release around Christmas time 3. Game feels like a demo 4. Price is way too ♥♥♥♥ing high 5. Mostly boring gameplay and♥♥♥♥♥♥graphics for its time 6. This isnt 1985 anymore so there's no excuse for this lack in varietyThis game is a pile of garbage with ""Gauntlet"" slapped on the front.5/10; my head hurts from banging it ten times after trying to beat the season 1 unfair difficulty for the millioneth time (Im not even joking) "

												First off, if you are on the fence about buying this, i beg you not to look at the forums first. Most of it is people screaming ""OMG RIP OFF GIVE ME REFUND BAD GAME -1/10"" Its simply not true and ill explain why in a moment.Secondly, i will say right off the bat that im not a Gauntlet veteran. I played the game at the age of 6 for a few years, totalling probably about only 10 hours at most in my life. Since i was about 9-10, i havent touched the franchise since. I bring this up because i just want to make it clear that although i do have a nostalgia for the game, seeing as it was a game i was brought up on, i was never a huge fan on the franchise as a whole like i am in series such as the Elder Scrolls. I just dont want people to look at this review and neglect everything i say because i dont have a feeling of what the classic game brought, but i also dont want people to think that im a die hard fan and will defend it no matter what.*NOTE* Im sorry if i leave false comparisons and miss out features that the original had. Its been so long since ive played it i forget what mechanics it had. Comment if i get anything wrongWith that out of the way, ill start off with saying that i think this game is a great tribute to the 80's classic. The reboot comes with updated graphics, new powers and relics, yet keeps the feel to the original within the base of the game. You continue with your four classic characters: Warrior, Valkyrie, Elf and Wizard, each wielding unique attacks and mechanics. The one hope i had this game would have is that they would not only keep true to the original, but add onto it; constructing new methods to the way we fight and loot. And they did this superbly. One thing that i was extremley impressed with was the development they have made with the Wizard class. As stated before, i dont know how the Wizard worked past Gauntlet II, but the way combat is used in this title is Magicka esque, and i found the combat in Magicka to be incredibly satisfying. Combat on all the other characters has been enchanced too, adding several new moves for each character. The game also is no longer limited to 8 directions, which as whole makes the game feel much smoother and more enjoyable. Collecting gold, potions and keys is still within the basics of the game. Gold is now not only used for score purposes, but acts as a currency (Gold being used as a currency in a fantasy game?! Never!). You are able to purchase new apparel and relics from a store between levels. The relic system has been implemented very nicely. Now you use collected potions to to use the powers your relics give you. From a gust of wind that send your foes flying back or summoning a creature to fight alongside you, the game makes you feel like you are a true champion fighting through the tests of a dungeon.I cant comment on the multiplayer as ive only played just over an hour of the single player to see what its like, but from 2 friends of mine, theyve said theyve had no issues with it, so expect a fun, action packed quest with people around the world. Traps, unlockable doors, secrets and variations on foes are all back from the classic and they are stronger than everBut with all the praise does come negatives, and i couldnt write a review without explaining them.A major issue that people have had with the game comes technically, and it is all linked with your method of playing the game. Many people on the forums have shown disappointment in the lack of both controller support and key rebindings. I have found messages from the game's devs stating that they will fix this asap, but at launch in 2014, you shouldnt expect a game to lack a rebinding feature. Until this gets fixed, fixes have sprouted up for the controller support side. Currently, it seems that only Xbox controllers are properly supported, but many have resorted to programs such as XPadder to get their pads to work.Even though there is a fix, games shouldnt be being released with lack of basic features. Another thing that i found not to my liking is the skill shot aiming system for a few characters' skills, Valkerie's Y move expecially. You notice it in the tutorial when using a controller, and you just dont seem to have as much precision as you should. Its the same problem for some of the wizards skills also.The final gripe i have with the game is the way it handles  boss-like enemy, Death. In the previous games, Death was this powerful creature that could inflict immese amounts of damage and also held a high HP count. This take of Death i found to be more than anything, annoying. Some stages are Death stages, as in Death is present throughout the whole level. You may just think that im just bad at the game and cant kill him, but his attributes have no changed. He is now invinsible and his attacks are instant death. No special attack or relic can save you from him, you are left with just running. And this forces you to rush through levels at an absurd pace. I want challenge, but i dont think this is what i wanted. With challenge i wanted collosal hordes of enemies swarming me, not a big floating ghost shuffeling me along the level. As a whole, this game is fantastic. I want to try and compare this game to Diablo; a dungeon crawler with lots of enemies and tons of death. But without the in depth character inventory and skill trees, it kinda misses out on being like that. It instead is an action adventure hack n slash. And boy does it perfect it.			"

												Great casual game to pick up for 20 minute romps with three good friends. The levels are designed in such a way that you can easily break up your play time if needed or play through the night just as easily. The character classes have interesting unique play mechanics and controls that make switching from class to class much more fun that a simple change of appearance. In general, a solid game for those that enjoy a little co-op with a lot of replay value.			"

												I loved the classic NES version and Gauntlet Legends so I got this expecting something similar. However this one is for sure the weakest of all the Gauntlets I've played, the camera is way too far from the action, the story mode is way too short, the unlockables don't do anything or offer anything other than better looks (which is completely irrelevant since you can barely see the characters), you can't even choose a class in a different color like in previous Gauntlet releases, you are stuck with 4 generic unimaginative poorly written characters.I won't even give it extra points for the low price. It's just not good enough. Sure it is kind of fun to play with friends online, but you make most of the fun, not the game. It has some minor bugs here and there, nothing game breaking so overall is not a bad game, It's just not a good game either and for sure not nearly as good as a Gauntlet game should be. The greatest let down is probably the length of the game. Sure I can play it again in different difficulties, or try the extra modes to unlock content that does absolutely nothing. But why would I want to do that? If you expect some sort of nostalgia factor or even some fun multiplayer dungeon crawling action with your friends, this game might let you a little disappointed, but if wasting time doing the same thing over and over again for little reward is your thing, then this game is for you.

												Beautifully clean and fluid game mechanics under layer upon layer of polish. This game is a labor of love and it's so apparent. The classes are all very interesting, but the wizard outshines all the others in how well thought out it is. I wish that the other classes had the same level of player experimentation and versatility as the wizard, as it would make this game shine even more.The levels are really well designed and can get extremely challenging even on Normal, which is the difficulty I played on. They're atmospheric and not gimmicky. This is a couch co-op game in the truest sense, and it is incredibly easy to get a game up and running with other people even if you have no real life friends around. I applaud the devs of this game, they really did something cool here and I'm glad that I get to have this game in my library for future fun with friends.			"

												If you enjoyed the classic Gauntlet games, or are a fan of hack n slash rpg's in general, this is the game for you. It is a bit short, usually taking anywhere from 3-8 hours to finish as a single player on normal difficulty. There are quite a bit of unlockables and a leaderboard to provide some replayability. Unfortunately the gold/points leaderboard is rife with cheaters and hackers. The speed run leaderboards seem to be reliable, however. Just like any Gauntlet, or hack and slash game, the gameplay is repetitive. The ending seems rushed, and I'm personally hoping they will add a REAL ending in a patch. All in all I'd say its worth the full price of $20. I wouldn't give it game of the year, but its fun none the less.			"

												I've been waiting for this baby for a while because of its similarity to Diablo 3, and because I played this with mysister when I was 8 years old back in the 90's.I was a bit shocked that we were delayed by 3 weeks and still the game had launch issues like having to press ALT TABin order to actually open the game, and having to find out in the forums that you can switch to 1920x1080 resolution onlyby selecting it in the options menu blindly, since it was invisible to the eye. Then there was the lack of information aboutcombining skills.But once all that was finished, me and my nephew hit it up on skype and played the Warrior and the Elf, for 2 and a half hours straight. We had so much fun and laugh, it was incredible. Especially the food destruction and the gold distribution, and the stress from Death coming at you on certain levels, was really funny.The graphics are marvelous, physics are great, and monsters provide a nice variety of challenge to conquer.I hated the fact that visual upgrades are only cosmetical, and they don't look that great especially on the Wizard.I also disliked the fact that the Wizard is way too complicated to play with, since you have to memorize every spellcombination in order to be effective. I actually bypassed this difficulty by setting macros to bind the 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9keys, and choose my spell according to a key. Made my game much more enjoyable.Another downside is the lack of controller support, again I had to go to the forums and search for a solution on how toplay with my PS3 controller.The important part is that once you get those little things fixed, you start enjoying a really fun game.Despite the flaws, for 19 bucks, you get a ton of fun and maybe 10-20 minutes of headache.I say worth!

												I love how the game went back to its roots. That is definately one good thing that WB Games is good at.The graphics are fair, but im not really complaing. the graphics are fine the way they are and runs very smoothly. It is technically a classic that has been remastered.The controls are very simple. You dont have to do crazy hotkeys to do at least one magic trick.The levels (depending on the difficulty) are very challenging, unless you do it on multiplayer, which takes a serious load off. Sure the levels get a bit blan, but like the discrition says, its a ""classic dungeon crawler.""The mechanics they brought to the game with the characters special abilities rather than the old everyone shoots the same, but with a different character and a different weapon. it really makes use of each character and how they can contribute to the team.My only big issue is the multiplayer. It takes a bit of time for people to get in your lobby. And usually for some gawd awful reason, they leave in the middle of the game, making hard difficulty that much harder.Overall, its a good game. WB Games has been doing grand bringing games back to its roots.			"

												If you're looking to play a Gauntlet Legends, or a Gauntlet Dark Legacy remake, you've come to the wrong place. If you're looking for a Gauntlet Seven Sorrows type game, go jump off a cliff. If however, you're looking for a fast paced, old style Gauntlet game with a new twist to it, this is for you. Being a kid in the 90's, one of my favorite games for N64 was Gauntlet Legends. I must've put in 300+ hours. Then I had Gauntlet Dark Legacy, and played it for years. I was so excited for Gauntlet Seven Sorrows, and it was one of the biggest let downs in my video gaming playing ( Diablo 3 was #1). This is so different from those 3, but not for the bad. I love this game. Every class plays so different, making it so replayable. I know I'll be putting in quite a few hours into this one.    Pros.-Great music-Good atmosphere-Ton of Replability-Classes aren't copy and pasted-Not too RPGish    Cons.-Game is pretty short-No hidden characters ( Just my inner Gauntlet Dark Legacy side talking)Overall a great game. Highly recommend!			"

												Excellent revival of an old and solid classic. Each class is extremely unique in the way they play (For example the Mage powers are a more simplified version of the mix and cast Magicka combat system which is amazing) and the gameplay is fun and frantic. The game is also extremely beautiful with very good lighting and a lightly cartoonish style to the world. A serious fun arcade game for the co-op lover :D			"

												I grew up throwing quarters in to this coin-op game. I bought it on the early consoles but it just wasnt the same.This game is not exactly the same as the one you grew up with. But it is a great 21st century gauntlet. If you liked gauntlet of the 80's, youll love this version! If you took gauntlet of the 80's and updated to the 2014 version, you would get this game.Ive played about 3 or 4 hours so far and I love it! The replay value is very high as each of the 4 characters have seperate individual progress, scores, skills, and cash to buy upgrades. As you progress with each character, they get different skills and upgrades through using potions and using slots for certain skills.Like the original, you have to collect keys to advance to different rooms. Collect treasure, kill minsters, find hidden rooms, _ And of course get chased by death every once and a while. There are actually death levels where you have to advance through the level as fast you can; whipping by enemies at the same time. Its a challenge because some parts you have to advance by getting keys to unlock doors. The catch is- some monsters have the key, so you cant just run by all the monsters, you have to kill them for the key while death is right on your tail!Playing in a public rooms or with friends; where all 4 characters are being used is wicked fun too!Its on sale for $19.99 right now and thats well worth it! If you get it cheaper, its a steal!!!			"

												Classic arcade style, with some updated graphics and gameplay.  A neat concept of progression by failure is incorporated into the game, as well.  I've only played four levels but it was very casual fun.I was't about to connect for quick play yet.  I'm not sure if its just tomporarly down or what, but I'd have like to see how pick up games went. If you have any nostalgia for Guantlet, I'd recommend the game.			"

												okay so if you are on the fence about buying this game, just do it. it's so much like the arcade classic that we were all playing in the arcade or at the movies or resturaunt where they had the 4 player Cabinet, and they put it onto PC. there are a few changes like Merlin (the wizard) is extremely hard to survive with in single player because he has 9 different spells now that each have their own cooldown and button combination to go with them. All in all i do believe that if you liked playing the older one you're going to like this one.			"

												I love this game so much you wont be dissapointed. Dont listen to the complainers about keybindings and software problems thats ussuall for a release! I downloaded the game last night and have been playing all day. Arrow Head has done great work. Its probably the most fun I have had in a very long time since D2 in my dungeon crawling days and I don't say that lightly games that have come out in the past 3-5 years have been quite garbage this brings me back. I really feel this can be a long term game with DLC and perhaps PVP if done correctly all that to say again thank you sooo much its such a blessing to play with friends.  #DontShootTheFood Cheers Chris Knight			"

												An extremely enjoyable modernization of the classic action game. It's challenging, fast-paced and exciting. Each of the five playable characters are well differentiated and have their own unique unlockables. Team play is cooperative with minor competitive aspects that add to the fun. A surprisingly lengthy progression of levels packed with monsters to slay means there's never a dull moment.			"

												Good fun with a dedicated group of players. Haven't had any real success online so would recommend having friends that want to stick to this and finish the story.Aside from story-dungeon crawling, the other modes offer a bit of fun but are pretty much the same mechanically.Good for what I paid - £3.74 but not full price. I also do not own DLC which may make it more interesting.			"

												Gauntlet is not a terrible game to kill some time with, especially if you play with friends but if you choose to pick it up I suggest that you only get it on sale.  It has too many flaws for me to recommend it at full price.It strays a bit from the classic titles but is still a pretty simple arcade-style game and does not get too bogged down with overly complex additions.  There are some light gear grinds in the game, you have a few different weapons and other items which you can purchase with gold and some cosmetic cloaks you can unlock through arenas, but that is about it.  It is pretty easy to get gold in the game although it can be a bit monotonous to grind enough to buy everything.  There is a campaign mode with three difficulties but no real story to speak of, not that this type of game needs one.  There is also an endless floor mode which starts extremely easy but ramps up to be quite difficult in a hurry.    Endless mode should be where the game shines, unfortunately the levels are terribly unbalanced and you can go through several floors in a row that are easy enough to be boring only to have a floor with a very small room so packed with enemies that it is nearly impossible to kite, making it extremely tedious to proceed.  Also the camera in this game is absolutely horrible so if you are playing with friends and you end up kiting in opposite directions it will attempt to keep  all of you on screen rather than focusing on your character.  This can lead to you being stuck at the very edge of your screen not able to see what is happening around you.  I would say the camera was responsible for more of my cooperative play deaths than anything else.The Death mob is present but works differently than in Gauntlet 2.  He takes up quite a bit of screen real estate and has a huge aura which can sometimes make it hard to see other enemies and projectiles.  If he touches you it is an instant kill, at least on the classes I have played.  This could actually be somewhat fun on long corridors when you are constantly running and killing  what you can as you go, but when you get locked into a room with a large number of mobs, spawners and bullet-sponge minibosses and also have death and his giant blob of color to deal with, it stops feeling challenging and just feels cheap.  The old Gauntlet games threw ridiculous hordes at you but the gameplay was just more enjoyable than it is here.   If Death was not quite as obnoxious and the camera did not continually cause problems I would find it easier to recommend.  If you want an okay coop game that you can get ten or twenty hours out of, pick it up on sale but do not expect too much out of it.  If you want to scratch the Gauntlet itch, just go fire up one of the old arcade titles because this game misses that mark.			"

												Why it doesn't suck: It looks pretty good for a co-op dungeon crawler at this price point, it plays allright and feels fair and balanced.Why it sucks: It is not Gauntlet. Level themes are fairly mundane compared to the old school Midway versions that I was hoping this game would be. It seems there is nothing in terms of character progression other than movesets that really don't feel unique from playthrough to playthrough. Short.Rating: a box of Cracker Jacks /10: its definitely not as good as what you remember (or even resemble it) but its filling and the multiplayer is the prize in the box. Nothing beats shaming someone for shooting food even though it seems like this is the only connection to the original Gauntlets. But the value is all gone once you realize that the campaign is drawing to an end and the achievments left to unlock are just grindfests to kill monsters and collect pointless loot.			"

So, now I can finally recommend this game!What is Gauntlet? It's a coop action-rpg dugeon crawler with tons of enemies, traps and all that stuff.You have 4 classes to pick and every class has a pretty unique gameplay style. Which is pretty cool.Game play perfectly better with a controller rahter than a keyboard.And if you want to play alone - this is probably not for you. WAY more fun to play with someone.So, yeah, pretty awesome coop action rpg thingy. Not recommended for single player experience, friends only :)			"

												Some people are being very misleading about characters being super unbalanced and only one class being viable when I think that is the farthest thing from the truth. So here is my quick Definition of each character and their ROLES.      WARRIOR- Warrior is the nistalgic class of beat'em up with the mantra that, ""a good defence is having everyone around you die before you do"". All his attacks are melee with only a charge up dash for means to escape. Overall The Warrior is meant to be in the middle of action while yelling, ""I HAVE THE POWWWWWERRRRRR!!!!"" Abilities- Attack, Heavy attack, Spin attack(only ability wth a cool down), charge run.      VALKYRIE- Is the class That I have heared being called the better warrior, or Over Powered, or Easy mode. 'Tis true she is easy but that is only because she has the most resources that take smaller interactions but higher persistance. Example; Valkyrie has 3 combat moves that make her very agile with disposing of small creatures, and 1 defensive measure that can make her a stand alone immoble but invunerable tank. She can hack at enemies swiftly, throw her sheild and not block for a very short time but do a lot of damage to multiple people, and she has a dash attack that kills smaller creatures instantly and still does a fair amount of damage to things not executed by it. This dash does have prep and recovery frames but no cooldown really. One can abuse it to fly through easier levels, but once you step up the difficulty her role is not the 'no sweat' offence based character portrayed by other people. Once her dash cant solve many of her own problems, her blocking skill comes into play. She has the ability to Block all damage with this sheild as long as she hold the block button toward the source of damage and even minorly hurt smaller enemies and reflect projectiles. In a true team situation she is the single mother (and only women) of the team. Keeping her children from harm while paving a path for them for safe passage. She is a Gardian      WIZARD- The wizard is so fun in this game. He has 9 different spells he can use with no mana costs and all spells having separate cooldown timers. You input the spells by tapping 2 spell buttons in any order. I play with a 360 controller so I have X Y and B to make all my spells. Their are spells like fireball which is a small fast firing fireball, Ice ray fires a small low damage beam of ice to slow any one who touches it and damages them slowly, to spells like Flame serpant that sends yourself flying accrose the screen as a living flame that makes you almost invunerable and sets fire to all who touches you. The Wizard has a spell for all conditions as long as you know all spell cominations (a liitle difficult to master); however, he has very litttle health and has no true basic attack. All of your preformance is up to you picking the right spells from the 3 buttons input system. His true role can be anywhere from a high Artillery and AOE ( area of effect ) to a more support type of a class because he can make barriers and slow down a whole pocket of enemies with or completely freeze a small group. (3 spells i did not define)Shock Barrier- a barrier that repels most enimies and destroys projectileFreeze Blast- a small blast freezing enemiesFrost Grenade- a ball that exploads a small distance away and slows all enemies in the radius greatly(P.S this names of these spells are not official but what i refer to them as, sorry for my lack of knowledge)    ALL SPELLS- Ice beam, fireball, shock barrier, freeze blast, big fireball/mortar, chain lightning, frost grenade, thunder punch, firedash/flame serpant    ARCHER- or the adventurer as he calls himself, The Archer is the most under appreciated class in the whole game. The archer is know for as that guy who is faster than everyone else and takes all the gold and does no damage. LIES!! ALLL LIES! The Archer has a very unique role in this game that not man people realize to its full potential. He is an assassin. many people are probably thinking, ""HOW CAN HE ASSASSINATE ANYTHING WITH NO DAMAGE?!?!?!"" shut up voices in my head, let me talk. The Archers kit makes him the most mobile and slippery player in this game. His kit consists ofFiring arrows- who would of guest it, the cant damage spawners but they can take out plenty of enemies quicklyCharge shot- Charge an arrow to get the farthest ranged attack in the game and do good damageBomb- Lay down a bomb with good AOE and good damageDive Role- Role a short distance away, can go through targets, very short cooldownBombshot- later in the game you get this ability and it mix's charge shot and bomb to create a explosive bolt that sticks to walls or enemies     ROLE OF ARCHER CONTINUED- so with all of these abilities yes he does takes gold because he's faster but think of him as a hitman. He has precise skills to take out thos enemies that do way too much damage from way too far away. and like an assassin he goes into danger ( Diving; something you cant do without dying ) and kills things that are unreachable to you. Every Assassin has a price though, some are just douchier than others and take EVERYTHING.... but then again this is still a gauntlet game           OVERALL- this game is a blast of nistalgia with a hint of something new ( an interactive rewarding combat system ). I think it is soooooooo worth playing! And like all Gauntlet games the more friends that play with you, the more fun you can have.For a Re-Boot-10/10            OVERALL REGRETS- accidently bought 2 conditioners instead of 1 shampoo and 1 conditioner... poop			"

												Very fun game. Very Gauntlet feeling. Really brings back the old school arcade action hack n slash fun.Pros:- Up to 4 players at once- Smooth, fast paced combat- Replayability via harder difficulty modes- 4 very different classes- Fun graphics. Easy to look at and enjoy- Great music- No crashes (yet)- Only $20.- Works amazing well with a controllerCons:- Limited replayability based on actual content. This game needs a map maker, or endless levels.- 4 very different classes that are very poorly balanced with each other. Some are clearly more OP than others, which means the ""competitive"" aspect results in the same classes coming out on top 99% of the time for the end of level bonus.- Hackers (hopefully they can fix this soon. At the very least, ban them and remove them from the global scoreboard.)- Buggy class abilities cause inconsistancy and unreliability when you need them to work as they are intended.- Obviously designed with paid DLC in mind to keep the game more replayable. (the ending credits even hint at it).- Works pretty badly with keyboard and mouse. Awkward and limiting.Over all, despite the cons, the game is very fun. A great game to jump in for a short to mid duration action spree with your friends. If this had been at the arcade, I would have easily spent 20 bucks in quarters just trying to beat it. So yeah, its worth the buy.			"

												Fun time killer, but I'm not sure if it was worth the $20. It will run on a multi-monitor system, however, that does not mean that it's multi-monitor friendly. Playing at 5760x1080, the zoom (FOV) is not adjustable and makes it very hard to play at the fixed position.Maybe there will be updates to address this issue, but I won't be holding my breath.			"

												Lots of fun, wish i had some friends to come lan all the time for this one. It's a quite short, which is dissapointing, but its very replayable and there are many difficulties. I wish it was more arcade like - and that people could jump in whenever so you dont need to go to the lobby all the time to try to get more people as its most fun with a group of 4. It's a little unbalanced it feels, the warrior feels much weaker than everyone else and no one likes to pick him but they will likely patch to balance the characters a bit more (everyone wants the elf).

												Great casual game to pick up for 20 minute romps with three good friends. The levels are designed in such a way that you can easily break up your play time if needed or play through the night just as easily. The character classes have interesting unique play mechanics and controls that make switching from class to class much more fun that a simple change of appearance. In general, a solid game for those that enjoy a little co-op with a lot of replay value.			"

												First off, if you are on the fence about buying this, i beg you not to look at the forums first. Most of it is people screaming ""OMG RIP OFF GIVE ME REFUND BAD GAME -1/10"" Its simply not true and ill explain why in a moment.Secondly, i will say right off the bat that im not a Gauntlet veteran. I played the game at the age of 6 for a few years, totalling probably about only 10 hours at most in my life. Since i was about 9-10, i havent touched the franchise since. I bring this up because i just want to make it clear that although i do have a nostalgia for the game, seeing as it was a game i was brought up on, i was never a huge fan on the franchise as a whole like i am in series such as the Elder Scrolls. I just dont want people to look at this review and neglect everything i say because i dont have a feeling of what the classic game brought, but i also dont want people to think that im a die hard fan and will defend it no matter what.*NOTE* Im sorry if i leave false comparisons and miss out features that the original had. Its been so long since ive played it i forget what mechanics it had. Comment if i get anything wrongWith that out of the way, ill start off with saying that i think this game is a great tribute to the 80's classic. The reboot comes with updated graphics, new powers and relics, yet keeps the feel to the original within the base of the game. You continue with your four classic characters: Warrior, Valkyrie, Elf and Wizard, each wielding unique attacks and mechanics. The one hope i had this game would have is that they would not only keep true to the original, but add onto it; constructing new methods to the way we fight and loot. And they did this superbly. One thing that i was extremley impressed with was the development they have made with the Wizard class. As stated before, i dont know how the Wizard worked past Gauntlet II, but the way combat is used in this title is Magicka esque, and i found the combat in Magicka to be incredibly satisfying. Combat on all the other characters has been enchanced too, adding several new moves for each character. The game also is no longer limited to 8 directions, which as whole makes the game feel much smoother and more enjoyable. Collecting gold, potions and keys is still within the basics of the game. Gold is now not only used for score purposes, but acts as a currency (Gold being used as a currency in a fantasy game?! Never!). You are able to purchase new apparel and relics from a store between levels. The relic system has been implemented very nicely. Now you use collected potions to to use the powers your relics give you. From a gust of wind that send your foes flying back or summoning a creature to fight alongside you, the game makes you feel like you are a true champion fighting through the tests of a dungeon.I cant comment on the multiplayer as ive only played just over an hour of the single player to see what its like, but from 2 friends of mine, theyve said theyve had no issues with it, so expect a fun, action packed quest with people around the world. Traps, unlockable doors, secrets and variations on foes are all back from the classic and they are stronger than everBut with all the praise does come negatives, and i couldnt write a review without explaining them.A major issue that people have had with the game comes technically, and it is all linked with your method of playing the game. Many people on the forums have shown disappointment in the lack of both controller support and key rebindings. I have found messages from the game's devs stating that they will fix this asap, but at launch in 2014, you shouldnt expect a game to lack a rebinding feature. Until this gets fixed, fixes have sprouted up for the controller support side. Currently, it seems that only Xbox controllers are properly supported, but many have resorted to programs such as XPadder to get their pads to work.Even though there is a fix, games shouldnt be being released with lack of basic features. Another thing that i found not to my liking is the skill shot aiming system for a few characters' skills, Valkerie's Y move expecially. You notice it in the tutorial when using a controller, and you just dont seem to have as much precision as you should. Its the same problem for some of the wizards skills also.The final gripe i have with the game is the way it handles  boss-like enemy, Death. In the previous games, Death was this powerful creature that could inflict immese amounts of damage and also held a high HP count. This take of Death i found to be more than anything, annoying. Some stages are Death stages, as in Death is present throughout the whole level. You may just think that im just bad at the game and cant kill him, but his attributes have no changed. He is now invinsible and his attacks are instant death. No special attack or relic can save you from him, you are left with just running. And this forces you to rush through levels at an absurd pace. I want challenge, but i dont think this is what i wanted. With challenge i wanted collosal hordes of enemies swarming me, not a big floating ghost shuffeling me along the level. As a whole, this game is fantastic. I want to try and compare this game to Diablo; a dungeon crawler with lots of enemies and tons of death. But without the in depth character inventory and skill trees, it kinda misses out on being like that. It instead is an action adventure hack n slash. And boy does it perfect it.			"

												This game is everything I wanted it to be. It's fantastic, the gameplay is solid, buying a controller for my computer was without a doubt the best choice I could have made. My only problem is that the game is a slight bit buggy. I do have my graphics set on low so the game runs better; but, things like chains and such sort of appear and vanish randomly as well as things like lamps appearing somewhere thy shouldn't and spazzing out. Overall, I love the game and it was worth my month long wait, but the game is sort of buggy for me. Worth every last penny. I really love this game.			"

												Good game gives you the Gauntlet feel that you are looking for.  there are bugs and misshaps at launch the  bigest are: Sound erros, resolution probolems, and the lack of ""Full"" controler support as it says.  Despite the formentioned negitives, Its a good game and its Fun, best wiht the full 4 this is not a game that you will want to play by yourself.  From what I understand the developers are working to fix the major problems I mentioned and once an update comes thought for this game I think It will be one of if not the best Local C0-OP's on Steam.

												A fun, but repetitive, hack n slash dungeon crawler with local or online multiplayer for up to 4 people.The new Slayer Edition update does help with the repetitive problems that the game has. The upgrade system makes more sense now: Clear dungeons, get gold, buy/upgrade items. The classes feel more distinct and have a nice selection of new ""Ultimate"" Abilities.However, these new abilities are limited by potions, please change this! Either put them on a cooldown or let them fill up as you kill monsters (Kind of like the skull coin system) It is very frustrating (and boring) having to save potions for either bosses or minion spawners. Also, having 5 potions at a time can trivialize most encounters, by you just using your ultimate ability 5 times in a row. It would make much more sense to just have them be on a cooldown, of appropriate length of course, they should not be spammable.These new abilities are very cool and help spice up the gameplay, so please let people use them regularly!

												Gauntlet is a nice reboot of this classic franchise. The classes and style will be familiar with anyone interested in the ARPG genre. While there is nothing particularly new with this franchise reboot - meaning it plays it remarkably safe and close to home plate - what it does offer is solid. Gameplay, sound design, art-style, level design are all good. A recommended title to those familiar with the ARPG genre.			"

Now in the process of trying to get a refund for the game because I can no longer play it as originally intended on an OS they failed to port too. Best part is: They are delivering the game to a console (PS4) which was not originally announced (whereas linux was) which is pretty much a f**k you to everyone who bought it. Thanks for the slight enjoyment from the game only to tell me ""Your copy will forever go to waste."" I will be making sure everyone I know that is even slightly interested in the game still will not buy it. Well played.			"

Ok solo, but definitely more fun playing with friends. Something enjoyable about stealing food away from your friend when he's about to die and you have full health ;) Replayability will probably be so-so but again, this game is 100% about playing with your friends.

												That's a great game to play with friends, lots and lots of challenges through the different dungeons.Fun different modes and a neverending level, what else?Some characters might be harder than others, but it all create a balanced party, even if as soloplay it might be hard for certain classes. Buy it and you won't regret your choice ( best to play with friends)			"

												An extremely enjoyable modernization of the classic action game. It's challenging, fast-paced and exciting. Each of the five playable characters are well differentiated and have their own unique unlockables. Team play is cooperative with minor competitive aspects that add to the fun. A surprisingly lengthy progression of levels packed with monsters to slay means there's never a dull moment.			"

												Good fun with a dedicated group of players. Haven't had any real success online so would recommend having friends that want to stick to this and finish the story.Aside from story-dungeon crawling, the other modes offer a bit of fun but are pretty much the same mechanically.Good for what I paid - £3.74 but not full price. I also do not own DLC which may make it more interesting.			"

												Gauntlet is a nice reboot of this classic franchise. The classes and style will be familiar with anyone interested in the ARPG genre. While there is nothing particularly new with this franchise reboot - meaning it plays it remarkably safe and close to home plate - what it does offer is solid. Gameplay, sound design, art-style, level design are all good. A recommended title to those familiar with the ARPG genre.			"

												I didn't play the original Gauntlet or any of its follow-ups, so this is coming from a fresh perspective, and I won't be drawing any comparisons between this game and earlier iterations of Gauntlet.This game is simple, but robust; four characters, each having a more-or-less unique play style (the warrior plays sort of like the valkyrie, but I'm getting ahead of myself). I was skeptical when I heard Arrowhead were making this game; I liked Magicka, but I couldn't bring myself to play it for very long because it was quite buggy, especially the multiplayer, and the singleplayer got old partway through the game. The humor was also extremely hit-and-miss.This game has the tightness and polish that Magicka sorely needed. As many would say nowadays, this game just ""feels"" right. I was using a PS4 controller to play this game, and it played excellently. I have not tried the keyboard and mouse configuration, but while being a member of the ""PC master race,"" I believe one of the PC's greatest strengths is to be able to use a wide array of peripherals -- not just keyboard and mouse. Skilled players can weave through seemingly impossible crowds of enemies, staying just out of melee range while getting into good position to use their abilities.And that's the thing I appreciate the most about this game: when you start becoming good at it, it feels quite good. This is especially noticeable with the Wizard, probably in my opinion the most powerful, but also the hardest character. Arrowhead have clearly revealed themselves to be avid D&D fans at this point; two games featuring ALL-POWERFUL MAGES AND JUST LOOK AT ALL THESE ENEMIES FALL BEFORE MY ARCANE MIGHT. Those of us who have played 3rd edition know exactly what I'm talking about, and Arrowhead made it quite explicit with the cheeky reference to Gary Gygax in the Wizard's dialogue. Other characters are no cakewalk either, but the Wizard demands that you memorize each of his spell combos before you can even begin to play him properly. It's a similar system to Magicka's spells, except you only have three elements to mix (mapped to the face buttons) and you only need to mix two at a time, resulting in far fewer unique spells than Magicka. However, they're also radically different from each other, unlike most of Magicka's spells.The Warrior can also be difficult; he is a melee powerhouse with little-to-no defense, instead relying on his brute strength to cut down enemies before he's cut down himself. He has a lot of hitpoints, but the combination of melee and no defensive actions means you'll probably get hit a lot. He is extremely efficient at killing the dreaded Summoning Stones, though, even moreso than the Wizard. I think the Warrior deals the most raw damage-per-second, if his foe stands there and takes it. In a solo game, the player will find himself using the Rush maneuver often, which allows the Warrior to charge through enemies, knocking them away like leaves to a rake. His light attack swing is very wide, which actually makes the Warrior effective when cornered, allowing him to stunlock all enemies in melee range until they die while his back is protected. This doesn't work as well in later levels, where the enemies are more varied and have more potent abilities.The Valkyrie is a master of mobility and defense, using her Spear Thrust to charge forward and deal damage, or quickly escape. She can also block with her shield at any time, rendering her invulnerable from a side. She can throw her shield like Captain America, which deals a lot of damage, and bounces between enemies as long as they're close to one another. It also hits enemies on the return path. She's possibly the most versatile character, perhaps even the easiest to solo the game with. I ended up soloing the game with the Warrior and Wizard, though.I didn't play the Elf at all beyond the tutorial, but playing him is a lot like playing a twin-stick shooter. The player uses the left stick to move and the right stick to shoot arrows like some kind of green machinegun. He also drops bombs and later gets an ability that allows him to shoot bomb arrows, and shoots powerful sniper shots (he has to be still to aim them, though).I think the biggest issue with this game would have to be the nature of the encounters; they all have the same basic setup. One or a few mage enemies support a horde of melee enemies, who all protect a Summoning Stone, which slowly summons reinforcements. This has the potential to get old, but the enemies do vary enough to keep it enjoyable. Later, the mages can channel into the Summoning Stone to have it summon faster, which might result in the player being overwhelmed if he does not kill the mage responsible.It also helps that, every other stage, the game has a ""gimmick"" or something to throw in the mix, just to change the levels up a bit. Don't fret when the same gimmick is used more than once early on -- they change completely later.Overall, this is quite a solid game that's worth sitting down with a few friends when you get that itchy ""gotta kill 243 orcs"" feeling.

												At first I was unsure about this game. It was pretty fun at least in multiplayer with 3+ players. It was short though, we burned through all of it in one ""all-nighter."" So I wasn't sure if it was worth the money, though I did buy the 4-pack so I could share.However, I notice today that there is a 1.5GB update and the devs have added things and changed some of the systems (seemingly for the better). This is great, I love when devs keep working on their games and adding content and changing things. Redigit (Terraria) is a great example of this. That game is the best money I have ever spent.In short, I am no longer unsure about whether this game was worth it and I'm very glad that I bought and enjoyed this game with my friends. We will probably play it again soon to see the new things and changes to old systems.			"

												The new slayer edition of this game pretty much made things worse overall.first off it reset my progress, doesnt matter so much if youre planning on buying but i was on the last level of the game...The game still isnt very well optimized in fact i'd say it's worse, according to the system requirements i should be able to run this game on mid-high, unfortuntely i'm chugging 15 frames on the lowest settings possible.I have an Intel i5 3rd generation proccessor, with 6gbs of ram, and a 2gb 740M  dedicated nvidia card.The respawn system previously worked very nicely in co-op, skull coins (earmed by killing enemies) would grant you a 5 second respawn time, this is still the case. however if you didnt have skull coins you could respawn, you'd just have to wait for 20 seconds and hope your friends dont die. the new respawn system makes it so that after youre out of skull coins you cant respawn anymore. This could potentially mean that in some levels (where enemies are scarce) that you could die, and not respawn to help your team mate for almost the whole level.The difficulty isnt all that difficult outside of the bosses either, the AI monsters will either swarm you or try to take you from range, with a more nimble class such as the elf or valkyrie dodging is easy unless swarmed, even at 15 FPS.they did bring some improvements into the game, namely they changed the leveling system, equipment is unlocked through coins instead of beating a game on a certain difficulty, and the health difference between a low armor class (half of the classes) to a heavy armor class (the warrior) is more apparent, however it should be said that more health really doesnt make a difference since the warrior is melee only so he will be getting beat up quite a bit. They also added some more enemies (that teleport! or maybe they just introduced old enemies sooner) but again it's pretty much attack at range or a numbers sort of thing.Overall, unless you have friends to play with and a mid-high range gaming pc this isnt worth your time. the game will take you at most 6-7 hours to beat, there's also a horde mode which is basically survive as long as possible, gets pretty boring after an hour or so since it's very repetitive.While i welcome some changes made to the game in the new slayer edition, i can't recommend this game for it's overall horrible optimization and lack of interesting game play. it's fun with friends but it wont last you very long.

												I really wanted to like this game, but it lacks in content and unlockables.  It's also very short.  There are 3 zones, each having 3 levels and 1 boss; this amount of content feels like a beta at best.  I tried playing it a bunch of times to rekindle the love of the old Gauntlet games, but no luck, just another hack-em-up dungeon crawler that's boring as hell.  Hopefully the devs will get a clue and release more levels, unlockables, and rewards; until then, I wouldn't bother.  Or wait until it's $4.99.			"

												Anyone who is a huge fan of the previous Gauntlet for the N64 is in for a real let down. When they said, ""The classic Gauntlet ... returns in a completely new experience!"" They weren't kidding...Character controls are completely different. Warrior and valkyrie have zero ranged attacks, while ranger and wizard owns the entire game.Warrior- Next to useless, DPS, Good timed-based attacks.Valkyrie- Infinite defence against everything besides AOE, next to useless.Ranger- Dodge skill, ranged base attacks.Wizard- Magicka-esque controlls. Combination of 3 skills for various effects. Completely steals majority of loot.Level design have zero regards for the previous Gauntlet since they're short, very boring and leave no impressions like, ""Oh, remember that one time at the sand level..."" Enemies are simple, spawn at regular intervals and the spawner is a sponge for damage. Enemy designs are boring and uninteresting. Little/No replay value as loot are purely cosmetic or used as a 'super.' Leveling up does nothing.			"

												Gauntlet is a fun game ot play...but it has alot of cons to it.... for example:-If your playing with other people...you share the same screen so its fustrating when you want to go one way but u cant becuase someone else is going another way. It makes exploring the game a bit fustrating.-Looting; When you collect gold coins u all share the gold but if someone dies that person loses there pocket change. Which would also allow someone to pick it up after u drop giving that player who picked it up more money. -Classes; okay...I have to be honest....being a melee class...really sucks....Because the Wizard and the archer are the only characters that can get any kills and stay alive while the melee classes could barely get any kills in. Melee classes also die alot if they dont have any space to run back and forth to the monsters...run in, hit once...run back... thats it for melees while the ranged classes will kill everything before it even touches them. another diffrence is, melees are really good at taking spawners down...so thats a plus for being a melee...right..? not really the spawned mobs will just suround u and you'll die if your not careful. However, i would still give it a try. Expecially if you got friends you can play with.			"

												When I saw the announcement for this I was ecstatic. My friends and I eagerly awaited release, and even when it got pushed back started guessing that they were making more content or enhancing the game.I guess in our minds it was to be Gauntlet Legends  with a retro style option (like the Sonic 2d/3d retro/modern crossover game) We were all pretty let down.The wizard controls were probably the single greatest disappointment. They render the character a punishment to a party of 4 players. The fact you can have only 1 of each class hurt too>All in all, very let down, and really hoping they patch/upgrade the game for free to rectify the short comings. Would love to see a Gauntlet game like Dark legacy brought back with procedurally generated maps, questing system, item collection, unlockable characters/classes, a leveling system with player chosen stat increases, DLC expansions, Workshop support, character appearance customization (minor would be plenty) and better character controls.If you are looking for games like this one, get Hammerwatch. It has better balance, larger maps, more classes. and the same feel graphics and mob-wise.			"

												Oh yes, this game is quite fun, but it ain't Gaultlet like I used to play it in the early 90s. This 'Gauntlet' is an action RPG shooter with large open spaces and hordes of monsters running at you, while the original Gauntlet games were more maze games where you had to find the exit and outsmart the monsters doing it (yes there were hordes of monsters back then as well).In all, I think this new 'Gauntlet' is a nice game, but if you want to relive the old Gauntlet games like I did, better skip this one...

Checked out my PC, nothing is wrong with it, not having any problems otherwise (a PC which runs higher taxing games effortlessly, btw), only to find out that it is in fact something wrong with the game itself.I've never done a 6 minute refund before, but it's happening. I really, really wanted to try out this game because I'm a HUGE fan of the old Gauntlet games (Dark Legacy, mm), but this right here is unplayable. I don't understand how others are having no difficulty, but I got hit with every problem you could think of before I even got in to a game. Hopefully they fix this ridiculously buggy crap..			"

												Got this title pre-sale and had to wait 20 or so days. fine.. launch day downloaded it and played it a little bit. As a 80's arcade Gauntlet vet I tried and tried to like this game. tried multi and didn't like the no chat,so no communication. The mechanics is off balance. I played the warrior first and what a joke. tried the rest and was not much better. Another down to the game is you couldn't redefine the keys! WASD is problematic with longer fingers and with a hand injury so its a BIG drawback. The game is too short along with locking doors forever so if you leave food there for emergencies you cant go back up and get it even when everything is clear. The gameplay is Meh for a gauntlet title and is NOT worth 20 bucks the way it currently is. I should of waited to buy this game. There is no gear drops either, and there is no ""I want my money back"" button either lol. Maybe I will change my review if things get better with time.			"

The recent Slayer Edition update seems to have fixed every gripe I had with the game.  Now it is a streamlined and enjoyable experience.  They added gameplay depth  in the way of weapons that affect how your characters abilities work, the way potions work with the new talisman items, and relics being on cooldown instead of using potions.I can't really compare this game to previous Gauntlet games.  I only played the original a few times at the arcade a long time ago.  I enjoy the this game with the Slayer Edition update.To sum up:  If you played this game before Slayer Edition and were disappointed, then definitely update and try it out again.			"

												this surprisingly does capture the feel of gauntlet 1 & 2, about as close as you can get on a modern engine on a pc. while making the classes feel more unique without spoiling the feel of it. I played the original on an arcade machine as a kid once ina while, and had the second gauntlet on nes also and played it quite a lot. I'm missing the 'It' thing now (in the second one) that I think about it heh. perhaps an update could add something like that some day. all hell breaking loose on some sorry player LOL.			"

												Definitely worth it if you were a fan of any previous Gauntlet games. Even Hammerwatch makes reference to the first Gauntlet in a bonus level of their game.Unlock artifacts and armor as you battle swarms of underworld minions. Detroy spawners or they will overrun you until you die. Every stage has an end boss to battle. The wizard spell casting system is unlike anything I've seen to date. Something simple as a combination of 3 buttons can choose between some like 30 different spells all based around fire, ice, and lightning.Looking forward to buying the Necromancer DLC so I can test that out and see how well she plays.

												I bought the 4-pack because I was desparate to get my kids onto something other than Minecraft.  It worked, for a little bit anyway.  But, for me, I was happily tickling my completionist bone until 1.1 landed.  New character, you say?  Sweet!  $5 more?  Um, well... okay, I guess... it is a fun game, so sure!  Completely massacre my masteries so as to render them effectively useless against the onslaught, and deliver a one-two punch knock-out to my ability to enjoy the game solo?  No thanks.  Hard and Unfair were already challenges, and now they're outright impossible.  Damage from the Wizard, across the board, has been rendered so ineffective, that creatures spawn faster than they can be put down, even with the strongest spell cycles.  I feel like I was bait and switched.Look, Arrowhead, I appreciate new stuff, and don't even mind buying it... but if it ain't broke, don't fix it.			"

												I love this game, even more so now that the 'Slayer Edition' is out. It's a great way to spend a night with friends online or local with freinds or family. If you love hack and slash, this is the game for you. The upgrades to the 'Slayer Edition' allow you to really customize your play style. The only down side is that the camera as of the last patch still needs work. The prior version of the game had a better setup for the camera, but I'm sure they'll get that fixed up soon. Swarmed by skeletons, and would be swarmed again.9/10 (10/10 once the camera issues are fixed)			"

												Got this title pre-sale and had to wait 20 or so days. fine.. launch day downloaded it and played it a little bit. As a 80's arcade Gauntlet vet I tried and tried to like this game. tried multi and didn't like the no chat,so no communication. The mechanics is off balance. I played the warrior first and what a joke. tried the rest and was not much better. Another down to the game is you couldn't redefine the keys! WASD is problematic with longer fingers and with a hand injury so its a BIG drawback. The game is too short along with locking doors forever so if you leave food there for emergencies you cant go back up and get it even when everything is clear. The gameplay is Meh for a gauntlet title and is NOT worth 20 bucks the way it currently is. I should of waited to buy this game. There is no gear drops either, and there is no ""I want my money back"" button either lol. Maybe I will change my review if things get better with time.			"

												TLDR: $20 gets you a fun coop experience with a few bugs that need to be hashed out.  Game is not that deep, but what were you expecting from a more faithful reboot of an arcade game from 1985?  Definitely worth it if you have friends.Let's just get this out first and foremost: This is a $20 reboot of a classic arcade game.  Have you played the original arcade game in a while?  It is about as vanilla of an experience as you can get.  It could easily be described as a fantasy themed, slower paced, robotron with keys in a maze.  Am I bashing the original game?  Hell no, it's a classic and a blast - but I wouldnt call it deep.  If you are looking for a complete reimagining of the series, then stick to Dark Legends or many of the other 4 player top down / isometric cooperative games that are more modern (Diablo, Sacred 3, etc)So what do we get for our $20?  We get a much prettier 1985 Gauntlet with a few modern twists in the form of relics and perks.  Level flow is very methodical.  It's handcrafted dungeon (as per described in the trailer), procedurally generated level with some kind of theme (Death, Darkness, Lava bombs per world respectively), Arena Fight, then boss.  You can beat the game in about 3-5 hours on normal.  Honestly after beating it 2P with my wife, I have to agree that the real game shines on hard or insane with 4P.  This is where cooperation is key and little set backs (like the famed shooting the food) create that fun ""tension"" between the players.  We get the original 4 classes, with some significant differences between them.  The Valkarie has a defensive shield, a spear dash, and a Captain America-esque sheild throw.  She is a defensive player that can trade her best defensive skill for her best offensive skill (shield throw disables block).  The Elf has rapid fire arrows, a high powered sniper shot, and bombs (that eventually become tied to the sniper shot).  This is your low hp hit and run character with burst damage.  Then we get to the two most (appropriately in a thematic sense) opposite characters in the game - The wizard and the warrior.  The warrior is rather bland with a medium cooldown AOE attack, two basic melee attacks, and a dash with a rather long charge time.  Some of his perks seek to spice him up slightly, but it feels like he is simply not quite as unique as the remaining characters.  He needs something to stand out, and it feels like the least amount of time was devoted to fleshing him out.  He has a powerful cleave that can one shot basic enemies - but it has a small area of effect thus rendering it really only useful towards attacking spawners.  Maybe he improves with perks, but he feels initially weak - which is not the impression to make with a hulking muscle bound killing machine with a 5 foot long broad axe.The wizard on the other hand is the utility character.  Many will note that the game is made by the same team who worked on Magicka, and his spell system is very similar to a watered down version of the one found in said game.  For those accustomed to DOTA2, he is very similar to Invoker.  He has low hp, but has the most versatile skill set of the entire game.  Merlin has various forms of AOE crowd control, a teleport, and decent damage output.  He has the potential to be the single most powerful character in the game once you are practiced with switching between his nine(!) available spells.  This is entirely my opinion - but the Wizard is aboslutely brilliant and is by far the most entertaining character to play in the entire game.So, as has been noted by fellow reviewers, there are some balance issues in the game.  Some characters are simply more well rounded than others.   Some are exceedingly more complicated, but far more rewarding as well (Im looking at you Merlin).  It feels that the relic system, which allows characters to purchase special abilities that are useable via potions found in the dungeons, could have been used to balance this better - but everybody can purchase and use the same relics.  It may sound restrictive in a sense, but perhaps it would have been best to allow only certain characters to purchase certain relics.  Especially in the case of the very vanilla warrior and the overly versatile wizard.  There are some definite bugs as well - Crypts (World 1) 1-2 has a reoccuring bug where doors will not open or keys will not spawn.  I've encountered this bug at least 3-4 times, and it forced us to restart the level to progress.  My wife and I have experienced crashing issues.  There are issues selecting resolutions in the graphical settings and the game doesnt play especially friendly with dual monitor configurations.  Some players are noting GPU overheating issues when vsync is disabled as well.Overall, however, I felt the need to write this review because I am sincerely enjoying the game.  It really shines with 4 players on hard or insane, but is a fun romp even on normal with 2 players.  I feel the price is perfectly acceptable for the amount of content this game provides, as well as the ability to play it online or couch coop.  If you approach the game with the expectations of what it really is - a more faithful remake of an arcade classic - then I am sure you will not be disappointed.			"

												Absolutely amazing game. Highly recommended if you're a fan of the classic Gauntlet games from both the 80's and the more modern era (Gauntlet Legends in the arcade and N64 come to mind) I personally found it was very very similar to Gauntlet Legends with the top down perspective being slightly different but nonetheless welcoming. Well worth the $19.99 I paid for it on preorder. Only thing I think is silly about this game is that the items in the loadout section do NOTHING for your character but make them look cool. Where you want to focus your money is the relics. In the older games the loadouts would be different weapons and such to improve your character but not here seems almost like the prestige system from COD to me. Overall I'd give it a 4/5 5 being if it was actually possible to get new weapons rather than have to rely on relics which takes potions to power to boost your character.			"

												This game is awesome.  Most of the players are pretty decent to play with and the updates seem to be coming quick.  Player controls are really fun and the customization system is simple, but gives you some cool choices for each character.  Hopefully they release some DLC for this sometime in the near future that would be great.  - Also, a text chat function.  - I kind of miss the original 4 player character selection screen.  (The 4 1/4 bar divisions for each toon)- I can't choose colors for any characters which is a bummer, but I can see where it would be better left alone.Overall can't complain, I'm hooked.  Coming from a huge n64 version fan, I know this is more like the OG Gauntlet, but it's playing super smooth! "

												So I put about 5 hours into this game. Safe to say it is a quick hack n slash with really no story line. The only replay value is playing through with each character buying their respected gear and leveling up what gear you can.  I had bought this on sale with the DLC and played through with the necromancer on normal and I think I died once, maybe twice throughout the entire game and then I got destroyed by the last boss having to battle him around 10 times to finally kill him. There weren't really any puzzles. Just follow the path, hack n slash and that's about it. There is some occasional voice dialogues but nothing special. I believe there could have been a lot more added to this game but since I got it on sale I feel like I got what I paid for which was around 5 bucks. If I had paid full price I would of been extremely dissapointed. I understand the dev's wanting to keep it similar to the classics but that was 15 years ago. We need more and a lot has changed with gammers needing certain things to keep the replay value up like skill trees and character leveling. Otherwise you play through once and then uninstall.Would I recommend this game? Sure. Its a quick hack n slash. Is there replay value? Afar from playing with different characters there is no replay value in my personal opinion so I suggest getting it on sale because that is how much it's really worth in play value.			"

												Use to love this game.  Loved the grinding and leveling up.  Then poof, developers gave us an update that we will surely love free of charge, hurrah.  Well, what we got is a dumbed down consolized slayers edition.  Massive overhaul of the leveling system that completely wipes out hours of work.  Unfair level removed  to pander to consoles.  Played the slayers edition for a couple of hours and couldn't stand it anymore.  What a bore.  Wish the developers would give us an option and allow us to play the ""classic"" mode.  That was what I paid money for, slayers edition is not.  Slayers edition is a completely different game.			"

It's multiplayer was of limited joy after three sessions, and held little hope in my eyes in redeeming itself.The biggest issue however is that development on this game has stopped entirely, meaning any issues are issues forever now.

												It is the Gauntlet name, theme, and characters, but it just didn't ""feel"" like gauntlet to me.  The static top-down view and other major differences in the game cause me not to get that nostalgic Gaunlet feel that I was looking for.  Don't get me wrong, the game itself is enjoyable.  I played one character (Wizard) through most of the game, but I honestly don't know if I would play through it again.  There are just too many differences.1. While  the characters may be the same, their abilities are different entirely. For example: Wizard, while challening and fun, has its own skill system by combining two elements to come up with 9 different unique attacks.  That has nothing to do with the original Gauntlet game for consoles / arcade.2. The storyline and levels are completely different.  If anything, it now feels more like a cross between old school Diablo and Magicka.  3. Character progression is awkward.  Instead of leveling up, in this game you can get mastery levels that provide certain bonuses to that character.  This is similar to an ""achievement"" system, where for example you kill 1,000 enemies with fire spells you get a 5% cooldown reduction on one of your fire skills.  The damage doesn't change, just the cooldown.  I miss the idea of just leveling up like the original Guantlet!  They could have had an achievement system, which is usually a great idea; but tieing it into character progression hurt the game in my opinion.4. The Magic Potions are more or less removed from the game.  Instead of a potion you can throw out to kill everything on the screen, you now use ""potions"" as currency for using one of your two equippable artifacts that all have their own abilities.  While I like the artifacts, I would have enjoyed them so much more if they had their own charges and potions were still something in the game.  When you see this game's version of ""Death"" in some levels, you can't use a magic potion (or anything else for that matter) to get rid of him.  You just keep running away until he goes away.All in all, the game is decently fun to play.  Not a blow-you-away-amazing kind of game, but it's a good little time sink.  Unfortunately though, I do have to caution that this really isn't ""Gauntlet"" in anything but name.  It isn't going to give you that nostalgic feel that you expect, so you will have to look eslewhere for that.			"

												I really wanted to like this game but it is just not up to expectations.The orginal Gauntlet had a few key aspects to its gameplay that have not been adopted or translated in this remake.  The play is often way too 'fiddly' and detached.  It looks nice but all that polish has had a significant impact on being able to see yourself when playing with a group and being able to spot when someone is in trouble is often impossible with all the snazzy effects flying around.  Crucially, there is no real feeling of group (why abandon the Blue, Green, Yellow elf / wizard / valk - G1 had grouping nailed by a simple colour scheme) just 4 individuals contrained by the same view of the play area bumbling through rooms.  In summary, lots of issues, not enough ups			"

												I dont need to go into great detail - I simply echo the other reviewers who have voted down this game. Its short, repetitive and therefore does not have much longevity. The relics are useful but largely gimmicky and good players will finish the game before they have even bought up the relics or attained most of the character masteries.Sure the devs may introduce some other new game modes, as they have started to do, but i expect it will require $$$ for DLC and frankly the game doesnt warrant the investment. I also bought the Lilith character and she is terrible. There are major design issues with the character.			"

												The game feels like its not complete, as if they had to launch it earlier or, more likely, they took many features out in order to earn more later with downloadable content. The ""items"" are actually only outfits, not giving any bonuses. The relics are very few, only around 10. The levels feel nothing like the original, There is NOTHING randomized. Every time I repeat a dungeon, it feels like the same thing over and over again. The original had 5 worlds with tons of levels each that made you feel like you were in an epic adventure, finding your way in a huge labyrinth. In this version there are only 12 levels, and most of them are way too linear. Not to mention the bugs.... my character oftens becomes extremely slow, as if I was in slow motion, then I have to watch everyone else kill everything while I can barely walk.With all that said, its still nostalgic and yet innovative, considering the price, I would still recommend it for fans of the original.

												Pure dungeon crawling - you and up to 3 other players take on the Gauntlet, a giant magical labyrinth summoned by the powerful wizard Morak. You control your character (there are for - the heavy hitting warrior, the quick and defensive Valkyrie, the Wizard who deals in a large number of spells, and the Elf archer) from a bird's eye perspective, killing monsters and picking up loot. The eventual objective is to find 3 amulets and give them to Morak for power unimaginable.The graphics are reasonably good looking without interfering too much with the gameplay - a plethora of effects add a splash of colour to a game that is otherwise somewhat dull (greys n browns). You'll be too busy paying attention to the horde of mummies running after you to really pay that much attention. The view distance is also high enough that you don't really need to worry much about fine details. Music is a simple background melody encouraging you to keep on hacking and slashing - as for effects, monsters grunt, missiles bounce off the valkyrie's shield with a DINK and the wizard spells zap and boom entertainingly. Voice acting is rather lacklustre but is hardly an integral part of the game.From a control perspective, each character has their own set of light attacks, heavy attacks and special abilities - the wizard using a 2 button combo system to cast a wide variety of spells from 3 elements (storm, earth and fire). The response on both gamepad and Keyboard/Mouse is good, with minimal delays in the character doing what you want. The game does feel like it lacks a bit of variety - the problem with being a faithful remake is that after a little while things start to get a bit samey, but adding a friend or two to the mix can bring up the replay value immensely. There's even an element of competitiveness as the game tracks how much gold you obtain and how many kills you make, as well as a ""crown"" that can be taken off monsters each level to give a single player a significant bonus. Watching a group of people chase after a shiny hat while more and more mummies pop out of the ground is amusing, to say the least.Overall, Gauntlet takes a simple concept and does it well. It's definitely a good match for Diablo or Torchlight players, even though there is minimal progression aside from upgrading your relics and masteries (which provide minor bonuses) the game has few lulls and keeps your attention through constant, unrelenting action.

												First off.. this is a well executed game. It is much like the original Gauntlet (which I spent too much money on) It's very loyal to the original game. The original is one of the first true multiplayer experiences (way back in prehistory) And I think this is an excellent game to gather some friends, have something to drink and play together for a while. It is a hack and slash fest, just like Diablo, but unlike the latter, this doesn't take itself seriously. Now, the praises aside, it does have a few minor chinks in it's armour. Multiplayer invites doesn't work properly. For some (at least for me) unfathomable reason, you need to have the friends window open, so to see the invite, that upon clicking it.. will launch the multiplayer properly. How they thought *that* was a good idea, I'll never understand (and I should probably point the finger at Steam, since more games have this peculiar behavior) The second is that you can't click past the intial tutorials.. I find that very very annoying! But still, it is a fun and enjoyable game, but I am not certain of the longevity. EDIT: I cleaned up the review a little, and shortened it. But the essentials are the same.			"

												After waiting for so long since the last Gauntlet release. What I anticipated, was delivered above and beyond!The wizard class is amazing and has evolved into something grand. Bringing back the original Warrior and Valkerie classes got me excited as well as the Elf class. I foresee a future of DLC being released as well! This Gauntlet release is one of my favorites, along side of the original release for the NES and the amazing release for the N64. I plan to spend most of my free time, like 80% of it, playing this title. It's just as addiciting as the original Gauntlet for NES and the one for N64. I'm not going to reveal too much if anything about this title, because I say that it's worth the money spent on it and you have to get/buy this title immediately! "

												A decent remake. Though, it strays from the path of traditional gauntlet games somehow. They added plenty of great aspects like character progression and you can purchase ""relics"" that help out quite a bit. But somewhere down the line it just doesn't quite feel like gauntlet should in my opinion. I remember Gauntlet Dark Legacy and Gauntlet for the Nintendo Entertainment System/Famicom Gauntlet for the NES had tons of random exit portals that would take you from a golden treasure ladden world to having monsters rushing you from the gate. Dark Legacy brought personality to the game through numerous unlockable characters and plenty of diversity through the ""color"" of your character to bring specific properties to your magic and special attacks not to mention the terrific voice acting for its time. where those games excelled this game really falls short. The levels are pretty linear and predicatable and the voices and personalities of the characters are pretty awful. My review is mixed due to the fact I was simply expecting more. It's a great time with friends and local co-op is always a welcome addition to any of my PC games. I'd give it a solid 6/10 for gameplay until any DLC for characters or a more arcade like experience. And a very low 3/10 for the voices. I have more personality in my sleep than my poor Elf does any time.  I Recommend this game only because despite its flaws it is entertaining and for the 15 dollars I paid for it it's a welcome addition to my library, especially if I have friends over.			"

												A very good game that you can easily sink quite a few hours into. The gameplay is simple and each class/character feels distinct. Each character has very few skills, but the game has yet to become repetitive. The game used to give you power increases for completing objectives as each character essentially ranking up that character, but that has been removed. Since the big update, weapons now have abilities and some very nice QoL changes were made. Sadly Arrowhead games is no longer supporting the game, but WB still is. I recommend this game, especially if you can get it on sale. It's a blast playing with friends in coop, but is still very fun solo.			"

												Let's be honest here...The game is good. It's a game that has a lot of different content available, and 4 classes. It's not the best; but it's good.The biggest falling grace of this game, is level content.There are 12 levels; each with 3 floors.The 2nd floor is the same in each level, and it's simple artificial difficulty that punishes you for making a simple mistake; and makes it annoying, or impossible to actually explore.Simply put; the game does not have enough levels at this time to be worth $20.Do I recommend the game, yes. For one reason; what we have in the game is absolutely wonderful.Soon, we may seem some updates that include new levels (6 months?); at that point, you may be able to get the game at $14.99 on sale. It's worth it then; but not now.If number of levels isn't something that concerns you; it's worth the $20 now. If it is. Wait.That simple.			"

												Is this a great game? Yes.Is this a great Gauntlet game? Not really.I might be blinded by nostalgia (this is a nostalgia review) but, Gauntlet Legend on N64 forged in my mind what a Gauntlet game should be. Then, I got Gauntlet Dark Legacy on GameCube and the game kept everything I loved in the N64 version and added a crazy amount of content.Sadly, this game went away from a lot of element I loved about the past 3D Gauntlet. From what I played so far, it did bring some new interesting ideas, but sadly it got rid of a lot of what I consider the ""core"" of Gauntlet. In this state, it felt a bit more like a clone of Diablo 3.-- Improvement from previous Gauntlets --- Small puzzle to make the game feel a bit less repetitive. (Sadly they do reuse the same kind of puzzle a bit too often)- Actions like grabbing an explosive barrel. (Didn't like that the barrel could respawn)- Achievements to upgrade your hero.- Boss that require more thinking to kill effectively.- The potion use for the special ability is a great mechanic.- Unique way to play each type of hero.-- What is missing from previous Gauntlets --- Collectible! Where are my runes?- A lively overworld. (It does look really dull without theme levels)- Not a fan of the new way enemy portals works. (My biggest complaint)- No levelling up! (I did love the level grind when I was to weak for some boss)- No easy way to upgrade what your hero needs. (Strength / Speed / Armor / Magic)- Don't like how often you need to kill all enemies in a room to open gates.- Keys are too static and don't give the player much choices. (I miss these trap chest! haha)-- TLDR --Overall, if you like the dungeon crawling style in general, for the price, this is a great game.On the other hand, if you expect something like Gauntlet Legends or Gauntlet Dark Legacy, you might be disappointed.

												I loved Gauntlet, it's probably one of the strongest memories I have of playing arcade games with mates and this is a really polished reimagining of one of my childhood classics.The title theme has nods back to the original theme, the original four characters are there (with vocals this time). They play a little differently, no longer bound by just one attack, a change I'm still on the fence about. The Wizard for example works very much like a cut-down version of a Magicka character, pressing two button combinations to change the attack to Chain Lightning or a force push-back or a fire-bomb or a charge attack that turns you into twin fireballs that set enemies alight.The little nods back to the original are a nice touch and the combat is still as frenetic as I remember. There is even a classic mode which turns the graphics back to grubby 8-bit, currently made popular by all the dogshit indie games.I feel a bit down that the people who I used to play real Gauntlet with back in the day are not really gamers anymore because I think they would love this as much as I do.

The upgrades don't do much but give you different looking stuff, not that there is anything wrong with cosmetic upgrades.  Relics are a nice touch and give players a life line when they are in serious trouble.  I would recommend playing the game on normal to start with as at higher difficulties enemis spawn quicker and become tougher which is hard to deal with when first starting out.  The actual character upgrades come from achievements completed throughout the game, death being part of those achievements.  I played through the game with a wizard and I would STRONGLY suggest to play with a controller and not a keyboard and mouse, it is very much designed with controllers in mind.  Wizard works in an interesting way where you press a combination of buttons to set a certain spell to attack with.  Each spell having a different range and bringing different benefits with it.  Each floor is setup in three stages: Exploration, escape/run for your life, and Survival (in that order).  It can become repetative and nothing really changes through different playthroughs.  All of this said, it is still an enjoyable experience.  The kind of joy that comes from taking hordes of monsters head on and coming out of it victorious.  It is still very much a Gauntlet game in its roots.  Fight large hordes, pillage all the loot, look for keys, and eat some of that sweet sweet food.  If afters reading this you have reservations about the price then I would wait a while until it goes on sale but I do suggest that at some point you give it a try because I believe it is worth your time.

												12 levels. 3 dungeons one boss, 3 dungeons one boss, 3 dungeons one boss. End, replay value comes from higher difficulty and playing mulitplayer, game is fun regardless if you play single player or multi player. It's a fun game, but as of now feels incomplete needs a survival game mode, will be interesting to see if they release some DLC. Either way a fun game, made me miss legends, and dark legacy. those should be on steam.			"

												Gauntlet is one of those party type games. Do not go in expecting a story, but if you have a friend or 3 and you are all playing this together you can expect a good time. I am old enough to have played this in the arcades as a wee lad and over the years I have purchased various releases of the original as this game is close to my heart. This is exactly what I wanted out of remake. It is possible to play this with a keyboard but ideally you want a controller.			"

												Has launch bugs which are currently being patched. So long as your connection stays good, its one of the best co-op games i've played in a long while. Good pacing and unique control schemes for classes make this game plenty of fun with friends. Solo experience isn't bad, but there is definitely a high multiplayer focus and that is where it shines. For $20 this game is quite the catch.			"

												A major point that others have made that I do not agree with:""Faithful to the original.""It's not all that faithful really! Other than the same 4 player characters the game is different in major ways.1st, the maps are always the same (though I might have not played enough yet to see if this is true). In the original, other than a few maps like the first one, the maps are random generated so you often have the challenge of finding your way through the dungeon.2nd, all the characters in the original were able to use the potions to a lesser effect than the wizzard. So far in my time playing I have been unable to use any of the collected potions on either the elf or the warrior, what's the point of collecting them?3rd, in the original you were able to kill the Death enemy using said potions!4th, you are unable to change characters when you die. The original, as long as there is another player in the game alive, you could switch class of character before resurrection. In Gauntlet 2 you could even choose a character that is already playing, leading to quotes of ""Green elf shot at food"" and ""Yellow warrior is about to die!""And 5th, missing a fun feature of the second Gauntlet (again I might not have played enough to verify this fully): The game of ""It"" (or ""Tag"" for Americans). Best in team play because when a special enemy when killed, the player who killed it becomes 'it' and all the enemies flock towards them. They have to stay alive of course and try to tag another player to make them 'it'. Was such fun running round trying to avoid the enemies and tag my brothers :PAnother minor issue is that others have said the game is polished and well made. I guess they missed the fact the character animation is not properly matched to the speed of movement, they kind of look like they are running on a slightly icy surface! (It’s more noticeable with the characters where you can see the legs). But hey, it's a minor issue as I said :)Despite all those points above I would still recommend this game on its own merits. It looks great and is much fun to play. It's not a faithful modern remake of the originals but it a great modern sequel to them :) "

												So I think I played the one back on PS1 which it seems quite similar too, honestly its a great feeling playing an remake of an old game and seeing the fact they have kept it decently hard. Honestly, finding a challenging co-op game is hard these days and honestly they have done really well. I havent played very far yet but I must say it is really enjoyable with friends, cant comment on solo yet. In regards to optimisation, in settings in resolution some of the res's are hidden so you need to press down arrow when you are clicked on the last visible res and press enter then apply. After I found this out I was a lot happier. The music, can be repetative but it is nostalgic and well put together. The keyboard controlls are quite good really, cant comment on controller but rebinding may be something the devs should look into (if they arent already) The level design is good and the random generation at times is nice from what I have seen. I will update as I progress further, hope you guys enjoy it.			"

												I haven't played the original, but it give off a strong Magicka feel (if you enjoyed that you'll enjoy this reboot.) Man this game is difficult, I find myself getting stuck in the center of a crowd of mummies and being battered to death. Though the game is fun, it's repetitive and not for those that require an impeccable storyline and artwork. This is just for highscore, a couple of hours and an awesome multiplayer experience. I do recommend it, but watch some gameplay first!			"

												While it has a handful of baffling limitations, this iteration of Gauntlet is super fun to play, and that's what matters.Playing with a friend or two (or three!), I had a blast getting through the first section of the game. Each character plays differently with fun abilities, so it doesn't get boring when you're switching characters. The monsters are fun to stave off, and the first boss fight, at least, was a great blend of puzzle and survival. I love the humor in the game, especially the contextual dialogue.Especially if you have a couple friends to tool around with in this game, I definitely recommend it.Now the nit picks:I feel like there's a bit of input lag when using a controller.I don't need to remap my controls, but it'd be a good option to have.The game isn't exactly the best optimized, graphically. Sure, I've got a crappy laptop, but there are more graphically intensive games that I can play on high settings with a much better framerate. That said, the game looks great even on the lowest settings.I'd love to be able to drop in and out of games, at the discretion of the person hosting the game.If the host drops, the game out to pass on to another player, making them the host.

												Gauntlet 2014 harkens back to the good old days of coin munching arcade games. It's fairly faithful to the original with the 4 classes; Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard and Elf (why isn't this guy called Archer?), shooting food, grabbing gold and fighting over the crown for high scores at the end of each level.The game's a ton of fun and easy to pick up and play but hard to master. It's a little light on content at the moment. 3 distinct areas each with 4 levels comprised of 3 floors each. The last level is a boss for 3 total. I expect there to be DLC for new levels in the future. I highly recommend this game for couch co-op fun. Be ready to punch your friends when they steal the crown or shoot the food when you're low hp! At $20.00 (or $15.00 at GMG) it's an easy purchase.			"

												You know I absolutely LOVED the arcade and N64 versions of Gauntlet so I'm bias as far as that goes but I really have to say that day one bugs really turn me off.  Strike one for this company was the ungodly frustrating bugs in Magicka.  This is strike two for Arrowhead Game Studios and if the Gauntlet bugs aren't seriously addressed in later releases, they've lost a customer for life.FAIR WARNING:  I'm writing this review with 1.6hrs of gameplay under my belt so draw your own conclusions on what I noticed during my brief time.  In complete honesty, after the game crashed 1.6hrs in, I didn't bother loading it up again and played Civ 5 instead.  I'm really irked about my ill-Magicka feelings bleeding through onto this review, but that's what happens when you don't address defects in your software.Pros: Nostalgia, graphics, puzzle environment, online multiplayer, levels load very fast.Cons: oh boy, here we go...-Full screen video.  The game start with your windows start bar displaying.  You can change it to full screen but the full screen setting doesn't always stick.-Games in Progress:  You can't join (or have your friends join) a game that has already started. Highly annoying.-Character Selection: You can't select more than one character type at the same time.  i.e. you can't have four warriors at the same time.  You should be able to have a red/blue/green/yellow warrior but you no can haz!-Upon death: I would love to have the ability to change character classes but since I'm locked to one class once I join the game, I can't do that.-The camera.  I played with two other players and all of us were on the same half of the screen, yet, the camera doesn't move to compensate unless you touch the edge of the screen.  This leads you to burn up keys that you've collected.-Auto Fire:  When using the mouse, you can hold the left click to auto-fire with the archer, but none of the other characters have an auto-fire ability.  This leads to insane amounts of clicking and can get really tiresome.  I haven't tested this with my USB Logitech selectable auto-fire controller but I'm going to be forced to use it if this feature doesn't get added.-Buggy:  Random crashes reminiscent of Magicka that turned you off to Magicka in the first place.  I was lucky enough to get to unlock level 4 with two of my friends in one sitting before the first crash occurred.-Collision:  Collision should be an option to be turned on or off.  It's upsetting when your friend blocks a doorway and you die because can't get past him.-Random spawn timers:  I've died and have had to wait anywhere from 5 seconds to 20 seconds to spawn and have no idea why the timers are different.-Wizard:  The gameplay is challenging enough as it is, and your character is already always on the move dodging enemies, so why introduce ""Magicka style"" 3 or 4 button combinations needed to cast a magic spell?  It's my opinion that the wizard will be the least used character because of this.-Warrior and Valkyrie:  The HP attributes on these two characters needs to be improved, either that or make the fighting space a lot larger, have have the baddies do less damage, or introduce a slight knock back on every attack.Hopefully these issues will be addressed in future updates.

												I've been hearing about how previous Gauntlets are awesome, and also found this game seemingly very good while watching Twitch broadcasting it. But I have to say, despite this is a great game, the bugs don't cut it. TOO MANY BUGS. Just way too many to consider that this is an acutal released game. Beta or early access, sure. But actual released game? Not only bugs, but if you have ever played any other games, and tested out the game thoroughly, you know what interface needs to be changed. I'd say programmer sucks a bunch and shame on you. Do not buy this game.... unless these are fixed. This is why I am not buying the extra DLC.			"

												Let's be honest here...The game is good. It's a game that has a lot of different content available, and 4 classes. It's not the best; but it's good.The biggest falling grace of this game, is level content.There are 12 levels; each with 3 floors.The 2nd floor is the same in each level, and it's simple artificial difficulty that punishes you for making a simple mistake; and makes it annoying, or impossible to actually explore.Simply put; the game does not have enough levels at this time to be worth $20.Do I recommend the game, yes. For one reason; what we have in the game is absolutely wonderful.Soon, we may seem some updates that include new levels (6 months?); at that point, you may be able to get the game at $14.99 on sale. It's worth it then; but not now.If number of levels isn't something that concerns you; it's worth the $20 now. If it is. Wait.That simple.			"

												Is this a great game? Yes.Is this a great Gauntlet game? Not really.I might be blinded by nostalgia (this is a nostalgia review) but, Gauntlet Legend on N64 forged in my mind what a Gauntlet game should be. Then, I got Gauntlet Dark Legacy on GameCube and the game kept everything I loved in the N64 version and added a crazy amount of content.Sadly, this game went away from a lot of element I loved about the past 3D Gauntlet. From what I played so far, it did bring some new interesting ideas, but sadly it got rid of a lot of what I consider the ""core"" of Gauntlet. In this state, it felt a bit more like a clone of Diablo 3.-- Improvement from previous Gauntlets --- Small puzzle to make the game feel a bit less repetitive. (Sadly they do reuse the same kind of puzzle a bit too often)- Actions like grabbing an explosive barrel. (Didn't like that the barrel could respawn)- Achievements to upgrade your hero.- Boss that require more thinking to kill effectively.- The potion use for the special ability is a great mechanic.- Unique way to play each type of hero.-- What is missing from previous Gauntlets --- Collectible! Where are my runes?- A lively overworld. (It does look really dull without theme levels)- Not a fan of the new way enemy portals works. (My biggest complaint)- No levelling up! (I did love the level grind when I was to weak for some boss)- No easy way to upgrade what your hero needs. (Strength / Speed / Armor / Magic)- Don't like how often you need to kill all enemies in a room to open gates.- Keys are too static and don't give the player much choices. (I miss these trap chest! haha)-- TLDR --Overall, if you like the dungeon crawling style in general, for the price, this is a great game.On the other hand, if you expect something like Gauntlet Legends or Gauntlet Dark Legacy, you might be disappointed.

												I loved Gauntlet, it's probably one of the strongest memories I have of playing arcade games with mates and this is a really polished reimagining of one of my childhood classics.The title theme has nods back to the original theme, the original four characters are there (with vocals this time). They play a little differently, no longer bound by just one attack, a change I'm still on the fence about. The Wizard for example works very much like a cut-down version of a Magicka character, pressing two button combinations to change the attack to Chain Lightning or a force push-back or a fire-bomb or a charge attack that turns you into twin fireballs that set enemies alight.The little nods back to the original are a nice touch and the combat is still as frenetic as I remember. There is even a classic mode which turns the graphics back to grubby 8-bit, currently made popular by all the dogshit indie games.I feel a bit down that the people who I used to play real Gauntlet with back in the day are not really gamers anymore because I think they would love this as much as I do.

												Cons: Wayyyyy to short for $20 in my opinion. Pros:The mix of classes and the different control schemes keeps it fun and interesting.Graphics are pretty good for genre.Game plays well(phyics, movment, combat)Local Co-Op is included and is needed for the future of pc gaming steam boxes etc.			"

												This is something of a Marmite game - you either love it or hate it. There's some very justifiable criticism out there but in some cases at least I think it's down to people's expectations.For me, this is all about nostalgia for those of us who remember pumping 10p coins into the arcade machine. It'd be a hoot playing with friends too. It reproduces the spirit of the original Gauntlet in an updated game.That means that the negative points are all correct. Yes, it's simplistic; you shoot stuff and collect gold. No character development, no massive story, it's all in the instant gratification of hurling firepower at suicidal enemies and watching them drop like flies. It's the kind of game you can pick up, blast for ten minutes and put down with a grin.Other bad points are harder to justify. It's very, very short for starters - only twelve levels which you'll clear in a few hours on the normal difficulty. The writeup claims ""randomly generated levels"", implying (again, maybe only for those old enough to remember) a massive variety of semi-randomised levels once the twelve designed ones are dispensed with. Sadly, this just isn't true. There are twelve levels, full stop. Some people claim that one or two levels might be partly random but one of those is a ""darkness"" level, where you can only see a short distance from your character, so it's difficult to tell because most of the screen is just black. And if it's difficult to tell, it might as well not be random. If it is, which I doubt.At present you can't change the key bindings if you don't have or like the gamepad. And since the best control scheme is ""WAXD"" and not, as the world seems to incorrectly believe, ""WASD"", that's a real pain. Maybe I just have unnaturally short thumbs.Final gripe: un-sodding-skippable chuffing cut scenes! The final level (that's number twelve, in case you missed the ""short"" comments above) is, not surprisingly, a boss battle. You're gonna die. Lots. And every time you do, you have to sit through the same. God-damn. Cutscene. It's not a five-second intro either, we're talking the best part of a minute to cool your heels after narrowly being smooshed in mid-lunge towards the food. I went postal on the gamepad after the first half-dozen times and after that, the monologuing wizard went silent in all later replays. Maybe he was embarrassed. He still acted the part out though. In full. Every time.Do I recommend it? Yes - it looks good, controls well (with a gamepad at least), and most importantly of all it recaptures the feel of the original. It desperately needs more places to explore though, at least as randomly-generated maps. Much better would be a Steam Workshop tie-in.Gauntlet needs level editor. Badly. "

												TLDR: $20 gets you a fun coop experience with a few bugs that need to be hashed out.  Game is not that deep, but what were you expecting from a more faithful reboot of an arcade game from 1985?  Definitely worth it if you have friends.Let's just get this out first and foremost: This is a $20 reboot of a classic arcade game.  Have you played the original arcade game in a while?  It is about as vanilla of an experience as you can get.  It could easily be described as a fantasy themed, slower paced, robotron with keys in a maze.  Am I bashing the original game?  Hell no, it's a classic and a blast - but I wouldnt call it deep.  If you are looking for a complete reimagining of the series, then stick to Dark Legends or many of the other 4 player top down / isometric cooperative games that are more modern (Diablo, Sacred 3, etc)So what do we get for our $20?  We get a much prettier 1985 Gauntlet with a few modern twists in the form of relics and perks.  Level flow is very methodical.  It's handcrafted dungeon (as per described in the trailer), procedurally generated level with some kind of theme (Death, Darkness, Lava bombs per world respectively), Arena Fight, then boss.  You can beat the game in about 3-5 hours on normal.  Honestly after beating it 2P with my wife, I have to agree that the real game shines on hard or insane with 4P.  This is where cooperation is key and little set backs (like the famed shooting the food) create that fun ""tension"" between the players.  We get the original 4 classes, with some significant differences between them.  The Valkarie has a defensive shield, a spear dash, and a Captain America-esque sheild throw.  She is a defensive player that can trade her best defensive skill for her best offensive skill (shield throw disables block).  The Elf has rapid fire arrows, a high powered sniper shot, and bombs (that eventually become tied to the sniper shot).  This is your low hp hit and run character with burst damage.  Then we get to the two most (appropriately in a thematic sense) opposite characters in the game - The wizard and the warrior.  The warrior is rather bland with a medium cooldown AOE attack, two basic melee attacks, and a dash with a rather long charge time.  Some of his perks seek to spice him up slightly, but it feels like he is simply not quite as unique as the remaining characters.  He needs something to stand out, and it feels like the least amount of time was devoted to fleshing him out.  He has a powerful cleave that can one shot basic enemies - but it has a small area of effect thus rendering it really only useful towards attacking spawners.  Maybe he improves with perks, but he feels initially weak - which is not the impression to make with a hulking muscle bound killing machine with a 5 foot long broad axe.The wizard on the other hand is the utility character.  Many will note that the game is made by the same team who worked on Magicka, and his spell system is very similar to a watered down version of the one found in said game.  For those accustomed to DOTA2, he is very similar to Invoker.  He has low hp, but has the most versatile skill set of the entire game.  Merlin has various forms of AOE crowd control, a teleport, and decent damage output.  He has the potential to be the single most powerful character in the game once you are practiced with switching between his nine(!) available spells.  This is entirely my opinion - but the Wizard is aboslutely brilliant and is by far the most entertaining character to play in the entire game.So, as has been noted by fellow reviewers, there are some balance issues in the game.  Some characters are simply more well rounded than others.   Some are exceedingly more complicated, but far more rewarding as well (Im looking at you Merlin).  It feels that the relic system, which allows characters to purchase special abilities that are useable via potions found in the dungeons, could have been used to balance this better - but everybody can purchase and use the same relics.  It may sound restrictive in a sense, but perhaps it would have been best to allow only certain characters to purchase certain relics.  Especially in the case of the very vanilla warrior and the overly versatile wizard.  There are some definite bugs as well - Crypts (World 1) 1-2 has a reoccuring bug where doors will not open or keys will not spawn.  I've encountered this bug at least 3-4 times, and it forced us to restart the level to progress.  My wife and I have experienced crashing issues.  There are issues selecting resolutions in the graphical settings and the game doesnt play especially friendly with dual monitor configurations.  Some players are noting GPU overheating issues when vsync is disabled as well.Overall, however, I felt the need to write this review because I am sincerely enjoying the game.  It really shines with 4 players on hard or insane, but is a fun romp even on normal with 2 players.  I feel the price is perfectly acceptable for the amount of content this game provides, as well as the ability to play it online or couch coop.  If you approach the game with the expectations of what it really is - a more faithful remake of an arcade classic - then I am sure you will not be disappointed.			"

												Pros: Some great co-op action for fans of Gauntlet and for people who just want a dungeon crawler where they can smash stuff. Provides a good challenge, especially on harder difficulties.Controls work decently well on mouse and keyboards.Game is good, simple fun. Blowing up a huge group of enemies with a well timed bomb or whirlwind is insanely satisfying. Cons: Balance issues. At the moment, the classes don't feel very balanced, especially the warrior who feels underpowered compared to the other 3 classes. The default controls work well, but there doesn't seem to be a way to rebind them, which some people might not like.No drop-in multiplayer, party has to be formed before starting.Can only have one of each class per game, so there can't be multiple warriors or valkyries, etc. This is slightly problematic because gold, unlocks, and masteries are tied to character. So you can end up being forced to play on a character that you have nothing unlocked on if the role is already chosen. "

												Absolutely amazing game. Highly recommended if you're a fan of the classic Gauntlet games from both the 80's and the more modern era (Gauntlet Legends in the arcade and N64 come to mind) I personally found it was very very similar to Gauntlet Legends with the top down perspective being slightly different but nonetheless welcoming. Well worth the $19.99 I paid for it on preorder. Only thing I think is silly about this game is that the items in the loadout section do NOTHING for your character but make them look cool. Where you want to focus your money is the relics. In the older games the loadouts would be different weapons and such to improve your character but not here seems almost like the prestige system from COD to me. Overall I'd give it a 4/5 5 being if it was actually possible to get new weapons rather than have to rely on relics which takes potions to power to boost your character.			"

												Put on your nostalgia pants guys. This one is a blast from the past. There are so many good things to be said about this game that I really don't know where to begin... On yes, that's right, its GAUNTLET! The one action ""RPG"" that defined the genre for a generation. This version stays true to the original hack and slash fun! The co-op is a blast, being very ""competitive-ish"" like the original. The only thing that is missing is the friendly fire. If you are looking for a great hack-and-slash'er with alot of replay value, this is a MUST OWN! Beware: Your social life ... is about to die!			"

												I am going to be honest.  The game itself is short.  Does not take too long to play through the entire game.  The upgrades don't do much but give you different looking stuff, not that there is anything wrong with cosmetic upgrades.  Relics are a nice touch and give players a life line when they are in serious trouble.  I would recommend playing the game on normal to start with as at higher difficulties enemis spawn quicker and become tougher which is hard to deal with when first starting out.  The actual character upgrades come from achievements completed throughout the game, death being part of those achievements.  I played through the game with a wizard and I would STRONGLY suggest to play with a controller and not a keyboard and mouse, it is very much designed with controllers in mind.  Wizard works in an interesting way where you press a combination of buttons to set a certain spell to attack with.  Each spell having a different range and bringing different benefits with it.  Each floor is setup in three stages: Exploration, escape/run for your life, and Survival (in that order).  It can become repetative and nothing really changes through different playthroughs.  All of this said, it is still an enjoyable experience.  The kind of joy that comes from taking hordes of monsters head on and coming out of it victorious.  It is still very much a Gauntlet game in its roots.  Fight large hordes, pillage all the loot, look for keys, and eat some of that sweet sweet food.  If afters reading this you have reservations about the price then I would wait a while until it goes on sale but I do suggest that at some point you give it a try because I believe it is worth your time.

												TL;DR version: Gauntlet  is good.The new Gauntlet game on steam is delightfully fun. Each character has a very unique play style. The levels are all well designed, with little to no down time in the action. The game flows pretty smoothly, and the inclusion of local multiplayer means you can have your friends over, pop on some usb controllers and have a great time together.A few friends and I beat the game last night, after about 6-8 hours of play. At $20, that's about what I was expecting for completion time. There is a decent amount of replay with the challenges, and the unlockables.The story was very minimalistic, not a lot to it. Which can be expected from a title in the Gauntlet series.The character customization leaves a lot to yearn for. There are different clothing items and weapons you can wear, that are aesthetics only. There are relics that you can equip to compliment your playstyle, but they aren't game breaking on their own.Graphics are smooth, run well, and have a few options that allow this to work well on older computers. It also has a 'classic' filter you can apply to the game that puts a layer of pixelization over the game. It's a fun throwback, but makes aiming ranged attacks difficult, and can make it hard to differentiate between certain enemies.All in all I'd rate this game highly mostly for the nostalgia factor. 7.5/10. Best if played with friends.			"

												12 levels. 3 dungeons one boss, 3 dungeons one boss, 3 dungeons one boss. End, replay value comes from higher difficulty and playing mulitplayer, game is fun regardless if you play single player or multi player. It's a fun game, but as of now feels incomplete needs a survival game mode, will be interesting to see if they release some DLC. Either way a fun game, made me miss legends, and dark legacy. those should be on steam.			"

												The, purposefully encouraged, backstabbing of the original is all still intact (you can loot an ally’s corpse, so shooting food so they can’t heal themselves now has a very tangible reward) and Arrowhead clearly have a genuine fondness for the original game, but they – like so many before them – have failed to find a way to make it relevant for the modern era.In Short: It’s certainly not the worst Gauntlet revamp there’s ever been, but there’s too little substance or variety to satisfy either new fans or old.Pros: The characters have been sensibly updated and there’s a clear love of the original evident throughout. With four committed players the co-op works well.Cons: Repetitive and overly simplistic, and that’s even ignoring there’s only three worlds. Awkward camera and interface, bland visuals and enemies, and uninteresting upgrade system.			"

												First off.. this is a well executed game. It is much like the original Gauntlet (which I spent too much money on) It's very loyal to the original game. The original is one of the first true multiplayer experiences (way back in prehistory) And I think this is an excellent game to gather some friends, have something to drink and play together for a while. It is a hack and slash fest, just like Diablo, but unlike the latter, this doesn't take itself seriously. Now, the praises aside, it does have a few minor chinks in it's armour. Multiplayer invites doesn't work properly. For some (at least for me) unfathomable reason, you need to have the friends window open, so to see the invite, that upon clicking it.. will launch the multiplayer properly. How they thought *that* was a good idea, I'll never understand (and I should probably point the finger at Steam, since more games have this peculiar behavior) The second is that you can't click past the intial tutorials.. I find that very very annoying! But still, it is a fun and enjoyable game, but I am not certain of the longevity. EDIT: I cleaned up the review a little, and shortened it. But the essentials are the same.			"

												After waiting for so long since the last Gauntlet release. What I anticipated, was delivered above and beyond!The wizard class is amazing and has evolved into something grand. Bringing back the original Warrior and Valkerie classes got me excited as well as the Elf class. I foresee a future of DLC being released as well! This Gauntlet release is one of my favorites, along side of the original release for the NES and the amazing release for the N64. I plan to spend most of my free time, like 80% of it, playing this title. It's just as addiciting as the original Gauntlet for NES and the one for N64. I'm not going to reveal too much if anything about this title, because I say that it's worth the money spent on it and you have to get/buy this title immediately! "

												A very good game that you can easily sink quite a few hours into. The gameplay is simple and each class/character feels distinct. Each character has very few skills, but the game has yet to become repetitive. The game used to give you power increases for completing objectives as each character essentially ranking up that character, but that has been removed. Since the big update, weapons now have abilities and some very nice QoL changes were made. Sadly Arrowhead games is no longer supporting the game, but WB still is. I recommend this game, especially if you can get it on sale. It's a blast playing with friends in coop, but is still very fun solo.			"

												Sadly, I cannot recommend this game. It should be much cheaper for the content that it offers. It is extremely short and mechanics are very repetitive (spawning mechanisms over and over again, mid-levels between chapters). The graphics are good, but all the grunts look almost the same, so I had to switch to lower resolution and not to play with necromancer in order to be able to see my character on the screen. I had a good time, playing with a frend, but Gauntled did not stood up to my expectations (and I played the original a lot on Atari and coin machines).Score: 5/10.pros:- it is almost like gauntlet- graphics is good- sound and voice acting is good- enjoyable in cooperationcons:- very repetitive- short- no interesting story- low budget ending- overall disappointment "

												WTF? Is this game someone's idea of a sick joke? Once again someone had to take a dumpload on one of my childhood icons!It's not even a fun game. People make Diablo comparisons but Diablo (and Diablo II) were at least fun (and had a plot too). TBH, playing this game Solo it is far harder than it should be due to procedurally generated dungeons creating choke-points and unstobbable, unkillable Death chasing you from behind causing you to die between a rock and a hardplace and have to start the Tier all over again. Might be more fun with 3 other people if you could find 3 people in Multiplayer. Eventually you give up on GauntletTM because you are always playing by yourself and not having fun to speak of and realize that if you were at least spanking the monkey you'd still be playing by yourself but at least you'd finally be having some fun.10/10 would spank monkey again rather than play this drek.

												Growing up I played Gauntlet: Dark Legacy on Gamecube....New Gauntlet comes out, instant nostalgia and amazement at how well the classic was brought into the modern era of gaming. Same type of gameplay, same classic fun when you steal the food from your friend and watch them die. Even with what little I have played, I already know that this will be another favorite of mine.

												Gauntlet 2014 harkens back to the good old days of coin munching arcade games. It's fairly faithful to the original with the 4 classes; Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard and Elf (why isn't this guy called Archer?), shooting food, grabbing gold and fighting over the crown for high scores at the end of each level.The game's a ton of fun and easy to pick up and play but hard to master. It's a little light on content at the moment. 3 distinct areas each with 4 levels comprised of 3 floors each. The last level is a boss for 3 total. I expect there to be DLC for new levels in the future. I highly recommend this game for couch co-op fun. Be ready to punch your friends when they steal the crown or shoot the food when you're low hp! At $20.00 (or $15.00 at GMG) it's an easy purchase.			"

												I bought the 4-pack because I was desparate to get my kids onto something other than Minecraft.  It worked, for a little bit anyway.  But, for me, I was happily tickling my completionist bone until 1.1 landed.  New character, you say?  Sweet!  $5 more?  Um, well... okay, I guess... it is a fun game, so sure!  Completely massacre my masteries so as to render them effectively useless against the onslaught, and deliver a one-two punch knock-out to my ability to enjoy the game solo?  No thanks.  Hard and Unfair were already challenges, and now they're outright impossible.  Damage from the Wizard, across the board, has been rendered so ineffective, that creatures spawn faster than they can be put down, even with the strongest spell cycles.  I feel like I was bait and switched.Look, Arrowhead, I appreciate new stuff, and don't even mind buying it... but if it ain't broke, don't fix it.			"

												Definitely worth it if you were a fan of any previous Gauntlet games. Even Hammerwatch makes reference to the first Gauntlet in a bonus level of their game.Unlock artifacts and armor as you battle swarms of underworld minions. Detroy spawners or they will overrun you until you die. Every stage has an end boss to battle. The wizard spell casting system is unlike anything I've seen to date. Something simple as a combination of 3 buttons can choose between some like 30 different spells all based around fire, ice, and lightning.Looking forward to buying the Necromancer DLC so I can test that out and see how well she plays.

												It is the Gauntlet name, theme, and characters, but it just didn't ""feel"" like gauntlet to me.  The static top-down view and other major differences in the game cause me not to get that nostalgic Gaunlet feel that I was looking for.  Don't get me wrong, the game itself is enjoyable.  I played one character (Wizard) through most of the game, but I honestly don't know if I would play through it again.  There are just too many differences.1. While  the characters may be the same, their abilities are different entirely. For example: Wizard, while challening and fun, has its own skill system by combining two elements to come up with 9 different unique attacks.  That has nothing to do with the original Gauntlet game for consoles / arcade.2. The storyline and levels are completely different.  If anything, it now feels more like a cross between old school Diablo and Magicka.  3. Character progression is awkward.  Instead of leveling up, in this game you can get mastery levels that provide certain bonuses to that character.  This is similar to an ""achievement"" system, where for example you kill 1,000 enemies with fire spells you get a 5% cooldown reduction on one of your fire skills.  The damage doesn't change, just the cooldown.  I miss the idea of just leveling up like the original Guantlet!  They could have had an achievement system, which is usually a great idea; but tieing it into character progression hurt the game in my opinion.4. The Magic Potions are more or less removed from the game.  Instead of a potion you can throw out to kill everything on the screen, you now use ""potions"" as currency for using one of your two equippable artifacts that all have their own abilities.  While I like the artifacts, I would have enjoyed them so much more if they had their own charges and potions were still something in the game.  When you see this game's version of ""Death"" in some levels, you can't use a magic potion (or anything else for that matter) to get rid of him.  You just keep running away until he goes away.All in all, the game is decently fun to play.  Not a blow-you-away-amazing kind of game, but it's a good little time sink.  Unfortunately though, I do have to caution that this really isn't ""Gauntlet"" in anything but name.  It isn't going to give you that nostalgic feel that you expect, so you will have to look eslewhere for that.			"

												I really wanted to like this game but it is just not up to expectations.The orginal Gauntlet had a few key aspects to its gameplay that have not been adopted or translated in this remake.  The play is often way too 'fiddly' and detached.  It looks nice but all that polish has had a significant impact on being able to see yourself when playing with a group and being able to spot when someone is in trouble is often impossible with all the snazzy effects flying around.  Crucially, there is no real feeling of group (why abandon the Blue, Green, Yellow elf / wizard / valk - G1 had grouping nailed by a simple colour scheme) just 4 individuals contrained by the same view of the play area bumbling through rooms.  In summary, lots of issues, not enough ups			"

												I dont need to go into great detail - I simply echo the other reviewers who have voted down this game. Its short, repetitive and therefore does not have much longevity. The relics are useful but largely gimmicky and good players will finish the game before they have even bought up the relics or attained most of the character masteries.Sure the devs may introduce some other new game modes, as they have started to do, but i expect it will require $$$ for DLC and frankly the game doesnt warrant the investment. I also bought the Lilith character and she is terrible. There are major design issues with the character.			"

												Gauntlet returns in glory, bringing in a lot of co-op fun.You play as either Elf, Wizard, Warrior or Valkyria.Elf - a constant barrage of ranged damage, special skill is a bomb that does AoE damage.Warrior - Warrior flies on a magic carpet, with a sniper rifle and rocket launcher as a special skill.No. Warrior hacks and slashes. What did you expect? His special is even more hacking and slashing.Valkyria - Less offensive than warrior, seconadary attack is actually a shield block instead, special allows for a more flexible attack.Wizard - Has a lot of different spells, so it kind of feels like few classes cramed into one. Has supportive spells, variety of offensive spells from long range, medium or close. Is is the most difficult class, but overall can be most usefull as well.Game only offers 12 stages of varying length (3 of those are boss battles, that are rather short). You can play those on Easy, Medium, Hard and Very Hard modes. Those were balanced quite well. I mean, hard IS hard.The difficulty raises with more players present. Playing alone can quickly get boring, but playing with a team of 4 randoms usually turns into frantic running.For me it feels the best to play with 4 players that you know or 2 when joining/hosting randomly - that way it is easy to coordinate and share stuff between players, even without any form of communication inside the game.You can unlock a variety of items and upgrade them up to 3 levels. They give additional skills (up to 2 at a time) but those need potion pickups to be used. In 4 player team, that will be quite rare.The game can be finished in 3-4 hours, but it is meant to be replayed a lot.Overall, it can get boring over time, unless more areas (DLCs?) arrive.7.5/10 would be my score. Not saying the game is bad, it just feels small... In size, vision, length. Otherwise it delivers a lot of fun and I can recommend it. Old school to the bone :)			"

												Got this title pre-sale and had to wait 20 or so days. fine.. launch day downloaded it and played it a little bit. As a 80's arcade Gauntlet vet I tried and tried to like this game. tried multi and didn't like the no chat,so no communication. The mechanics is off balance. I played the warrior first and what a joke. tried the rest and was not much better. Another down to the game is you couldn't redefine the keys! WASD is problematic with longer fingers and with a hand injury so its a BIG drawback. The game is too short along with locking doors forever so if you leave food there for emergencies you cant go back up and get it even when everything is clear. The gameplay is Meh for a gauntlet title and is NOT worth 20 bucks the way it currently is. I should of waited to buy this game. There is no gear drops either, and there is no ""I want my money back"" button either lol. Maybe I will change my review if things get better with time.			"

												Perhaps you bought this thinking, hey, Gauntlet, that game was great to play with friends on the NES. And hey, Gauntlet Dark Legacy, that game was awesome too. So you may think, hey, another Gauntlet game, it's been years since Dark Legacy, surely this one will be even better. You'd think that, and you'd be WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG.Instead they decided to make this garbage. This 1.79 GB bloated shovelware that indicates they got lazy and made this in some game making program instead of a real programming language that actually deserves to be on Steam. All that space surely isn't being taken by the music that some high schooler who downloaded a MIDI program wrote. Nor the extremely repetetive level layouts. Or was it just bloated on purpose because nobody would take a 50MB game seriously?Finally, what's with the videos showing 4 people playing? It is impossible to find a single other person playing this no matter how long you wait to find other players. I would have an easier time going to various game stores, finding one that has the old PS2 Gauntlet Dark Legacy, then knocking on random people's doors asking, ""hey, you want to play Gauntlet Dark Legacy"", until someone says ""yes, as long as it doesn't suck as much as that terrbile Gauntlet for PC game"", and taking them to my place and playing it, than it would be to find someone who actually wants to play this online.

												Though I was very excited about the game I have to say that on a variety of levels it is sadly a disappointment. Play is generally pretty flat, single-player is mostly unengaging, multi-player is often more frustrating than exciting, and there simply isn't enough variation in play to make it compelling. Perhaps it is unfair to expect it to have more in common with Diablo but when it is flat even compared to clones a mere modern version of the arcade classic lacks depth or interest. I'd even say console titles like Dark Legacy were probably more engaging, just something is missing, perhaps patches or something will make it work better.			"

												I was disappointed by this game. I was expecting a fun hack n' slash local co-op game to play with a friend but the truth is that this game is just plain boring. Everything about it, the combat, the levels, the enemies, the abilities and the gear is very plain, uninteresting and dull. I never tried it with 4 players so maybe that's where the fun is and why most people seem to enjoy this game, but as a two-player experience it's no fun.			"

												A fun, light hearted hack'n'slash romp through monster filled dungeons.  Hearkens to Baldur's Gate as well as original Gauntlet.  Only real issue is lack of in-game chat options, but these are easily dealt with via other chat options.  Thoroughly entertaining.			"

												This is great. You have to buy it for your friends on Steam. Just a great romp through the levels, and with some friends it's icing on the cake. I was a big arcade Gauntlet fan and this is a worthy follow up. If you like some mindless dungeon blasting, this is probably the best out there. There are too many rogue-like games on Steam. This is how it is meant to be. My only issue with any Gauntlet followup though is that I just loved the originals so much I really really really want just an up to date clone of what it was. Then I would throw coins at my computer til the end of time.			"

(Slayer Edition)With endless mode added and tweeks they made Gauntled has become a dungeon crawler, I will bring the score to 7/10 but still need some balancing and improvements on game mechanics...They need to put the theme song on gameplay not only at the opening this classical tune is what bring our most nostalgic feelings!!!.

												If you're expecting a remake to the original arcade Gauntlet,(video below) I recomend this game.


YouTube™ Video: Gauntlet - Arcade 

			Views: 253,087		

			Gauntlet (c) 12/1985 Atari Games. Up to four players take on the role of either Elf, Valkyrie, Wizard or Warrior in this classic Dungeons & Dragons-inspired shoot-em-up.		

If you're expecting a Gauntlet Dark Legacy remake,(video below) I don't recommend this game.


YouTube™ Video: Gauntlet Dark Legacy (PS2) 

			Views: 33,142		

			Technically sold as an expansion to Gauntlet Legends, Dark Legacy could be called more of an enhanced remake to the 1999 arcade hit than a sequel.		

If you're new to Gauntlet I recommend it. It's a fun laid back coop game. It's not trying to be the next Diablo. Gauntlet has always been about smashing through waves of enemies down endless dungeons with other people. Grabbing all the gold and not shooting the food. Only one copy needed for couch coop.			"

												Very Good, but not Great.  This game is all about Co-op.

Character balance is so so, with the Warrior being a food hog because he lacks any defense and soaks up damage.

												The game is great, especially with friends, but I've had several problems- first, when playing online, I've been kicked out for various reasons, whether appcrash or some other magic, when I've returned, everything is gone.  In a similar vein, I've had Gauntlet crash several times when playing, more frequently than any other game I own.  This is a little disparaging, but for the fun and minion crushing, well worth the time.The game has pushed the series closer towards hack and slash than its puzzle origins, but this was evident even after Gauntlet: legends.  Expect more slaughtering than puzzles.  Haven't tried the necormancer yet, not sure if I'll bother purchasing the character.  Some classes like wizard I suggest only using with friends as they are extremely vulnerable by themselves.			"

												Really poor game and a massive let down to anyone who has played the origional Gauntlet series. Only one of the characters (Wiz) is actually interesting to use. Game is extermly short and multi-player is boring and frustrating. If you play multi-player with a half decent wizard he will just wh0r3 all the score and consumables, if you are playing as Elf you can kind of keep up, but the elf's game play is SO BORING! If you play as either the two melee characters then just get ready to die a lot and basically get no score for upgrades etc. Also, upgrades are dull and unintersting.TL:DRBasically, all the elements are there for a good game, however lazy design decisions and an overall lack of any interesting content make this a big let down to anyone who liked the Gauntlets game.2/10 Garbage!

												Pros:- Nostalgia (it's a fairly honest remake)- Enjoyable Co-op experience- Reasonably priced- Some humor (most of it doesn't ""work"")- Watching your friends die because you shot the food / potion / fire barrel (and the Narrator lets them know that)Cons:- No F*$KING ""Gauntlet"" theme (as someone who played the original, this really bothers me)- The matchmaking service is f'ing horrible, made worse by the relatively low number of players- Characters are locked - join a game that already has your best / favorite character? Too f'ing bad.- Enemies and bossfights are samey-samey.  - The ""loadout"" system is completely cosmetic, yet still requires a ton of gold and specific boss kills (or signing up for Warner Bros.'s stu pid ""gaming service"" ).- Obtaining genuine damage / health / abilities upgrades requires grinding out thousands (if not tens of thousands) of kills.  In other words: either you play this game for hundreds of hours, killsteal like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or you spend a lot of time solo.			"

												Gauntlet is a game where you just want to kill hordes of monsters. And it does a beautiful job. It is like art work when endless numbers of enemies throw themselves at you and you can just dominate each one. This game is best played with friends. Otherwise, it can easily become repetitive. 7/10. A classic dungeon crawler with a variety of characters. But it slightly becomes old after 50+hrs.			"

												We were looking for a co-op game to play with out of town family, and when we found Gauntlet it was the perfect fit.  This was a casual game that we could play once a week for an evening, and something that even my (non-gamer) wife could, and did, enjoy with us.  The game was short, but even after completing it we could mix up the characters that we played or increase the masteries of our favorite class.  This was our favorite game.When we saw that the game had been given some love, we looked forward to a little polishing and even hoped for additional levels.  Unfortunately, what we got was some graphics polishing that added odd stutter and erratic movements to the display, deterioration of the camera control, and the removal of the RPG element of character advancement through the abilities improved through masteries.  Worse of all for our players was the elimination of “endless lives” when in a group (easy and normal difficulty prior to the patch), which had allowed the most casual to enjoy the game; those players are no longer interested in playing.  So, please bring this back in some form, maybe just to the easy difficulty level, or as an option in the game setup for the host (these scores do not need to be included in the leaderboards – some of us just want to allow more people to enjoy the game and not just try to game the high score). Sadly, I can no longer recommend this game. "

												The new, ""Slayer, "" Edition ruined what I liked about the 1.0 release version of this game. Of the many changes the removal of masteries is my biggest gripe. In past versions completing mastery challenges would net a player increased damage, movment, skill cool downs, and class abilities. All of that has since been removed in favor masteries ONLY increasing the amount of gold dropped.TLDR1.0 was superior to 2.0Stay away from this disappointment.			"

												I enjoyed Gauntlet a lot, especially with a team.  This game is definitely worth $20.  Although it's not quite as arcad-ey as the old Gauntlet coin-op, it's still a worthy successor to the franchise.My only complaint is that they don't allow players to be the same character on a team, for example you can't have 2 wizards and 2 warriors.  Hopefully they will fix this in a future patch, as well as adding more dungeons.Overall, well done!			"

Feels good to be back!When you enjoyed this game on your C64 and in arcades back in the day, Gauntlet is for you. The game mechanics(fight demons, find gold and keys, get through the maze) of the original have been nicely polished and ported to the present, while the classic top-down viewmodel was kept. The online multiplayer seems to be dead by now, but it is still possible to play multiplayer locally.This makes Gauntlet a nice party game(e.g. for Halloween).			"

												On balance I would recommend Gauntlet but ONLY at the (frequently repeated) 75% off discount level. Unless you have friends to co-op with the gameplay (which is just as much fun as the arcade original) just does not have the depth to give extended longevity. That said, the fast-paced action is frantically enjoyable (more so in short bursts) and shooting food is still as facepalmingly annoying as it ever was.			"

Eh who needs the story...endless hordes of monster slashing fun is what this game is all about.  So if you enjoyed the original quarter eater then you should fall right back in love/disgust with this one.  Pros: Classic characters with new abilitiesFast paced and full of actionRune system which makes use of collected goldCo-op is near lag free and tons of funCons: Being the last person in your party and being stuck playing as the warriorStory elements are weak and out of placeThe game is very short(12 levels)Prospects:Steam Workshop support may be added in the future			"

												Don't waste you money on this game. It's only a matter of time before its free. Not worth it at all.  Unless they do a major overhaul on everything there is about this game. It is not worth the money. Game is 3 chapters and 4 dungeons/levels per chapter and 4 difficulties. So once you completed easy, you have done it all. So basically a total of 12 maps, other then that. It’s just more monsters and higher hit points. Its really to bad that such a great game from the 80's has been so cheaply redone.  I will never buy another warner bro's game again. warner needs to stick with the cartoons and leave the gaming to the Pro's.

												I'm old enough to have played the original Gauntlet arcade game, back in ~1985. This new steam version, is based on that, rather than the newer versions that came out in the 1990's.I never liked the original arcade game. The repetition of spamming the fire button, while you fed the machine quarters, to increase your slowly, yet inevitably draining life, never appealed to me. I loved the music and digitized speech though. Arrowhead, the developers of this new game also created the game, Majicka. I found the demo of Majicka mediocre.I do love this new version of Gauntlet. Let me start with the negatives:- There is no lobby chat, in-game chat or world chat. There's no chat period. It is strange, noticeable and frustrating.- The game is not properly integrated into Steam, so there's no way to add players that you played with. Social networking is a pain and something that is done in the community hub.- The game will randomly disconnect you from a game, due to some kind of flaw in the networking code. The game does have a ""rushed-out-the-door"" feeling to it.- Some people who played the game on easy or normal complain at the ""lack of content"", since they finished the game in 3 - 7 hours. I have only only ever played the game on Hard and Unfair.- A couple of days ago, I saw my first hacker. The game had high score hacks, on day zero. That did not matter to me. However, I recently played with a warrior, with no cooldown on his abilities, which is a huge cheat! A friend also saw a valkyrie using an infinite health hack. I'm seeing more people talking about hackers in the community forum and I think that eventually, this game might end up the same way that Max Payne 3 multiplayer did ( overrun by hackers ). I don't think that developers care about hackers, to be honest ( they got their money ). Somebody mentioned on the forum, that saves are client side, therefore hacks were inevitable:{LINK REMOVED}http://www.cheathappens.com/20352-PC-Gauntlet_cheats

- The population is rapidly dropping to less than 3,000 players, from a peak of 12,669:http://steamcharts.com/app/258970#Allhttp://steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&appid=258970The positives:- I love the challenging combat and AI on Hard and Unfair. The melee characters are fairly basic. Warrior has a heavy cleave attack, a 360 degree spin attack and dash, which knocks over enemies. Valkyrie has: a spear thrust; a shield defence, that renders her immune to attacks; a shield throw, where she uses her shield as a killer frisbee ( like in the 1980's movie, Krull ). Elf is a dynamic bowman that can tumble, drop bombs and snipe at long ranges. He can also attach bombs to his arrows, which is an excellent game mechanic. Wizard, my favourite character, has to juggle 9 spells: light fireball, heavy fireball, teleportation, spherical shield, ice freeze, area effect ice slow, short range electric shotgun arc, long range electric shock. Wizard alone, makes having an XBOX controller for PC, a must.- I love the orchestral music, which seems to change depending on what is going on in the environment.- I really enjoy the level design. I think that a lot of thought was put into the aesthetics. There's a stereotypical temple setting, a scary, cavernous, spider crypt and a fiery, lava realm.Value:Using a level 49 Wizard, I have solod the harder realms, on the hardest difficulty level. There are about 10 levels per realm, for a total of roughly 30 levels. The developers could have added another 3 - 6 realms but at the same time, the game was available for $20 and through trading, I actually paid $10. It's hard to say how much value you will get out of the game because it depends on what difficulty level you play and which, ( if any ) characters appeal to you. I enjoy playing the valkyrie, elf and wizard. I find the warrior painfully boring but will play him occasionally.			"

												Well the wait is over, does the game live up to expectations?  So far I've played Elf and am enjoying it a ton.  Here are the positives:+Sound design is excellent+monters are tough but not too tough, challenging+instances are well thought out+menu screen is simple to navigate+tons of achievements ingame that actually help you progress+graphics and gameplay are smooth as butter even with tons of stuff happening+fun coop so far, but I have only played once with a friend but so far so good!+background music is very good, voice overs by classes and protagonist are all good+secret areas to discover, some puzzles, monsters have different abilities and different game modesAnd now the negatvies:-NO ABILITY TO REBIND CONTROLLER OR KEYBOARD?  W - T - F1. Elf light shot is bound to RS which is OK but why not trigger?  Or give us the option to swap stuff around2. Other classes have same issue though least annoying is Valkyre and Thor**I cannot believe, in this day and age of consumers demanding certain things as given and standard NO ability to rebind anything is going to really annoy many people.  What if you were left handed using a controller?  What if, you just wanted to have Light Attack on a trigger rather than a button.  This speak of LAZY design, they even pushed the game back to give more time to finish things up.  I can only hope they patch this in later.  -Unbalanced characters:1.  Thor has no evasive moves, typically a meat shield will have a dodge or a shield or something, he only has Bull Rush which in most instances is useless.2.  Merlin has no defensive skills that can be used conveniantly, have discovered a lightning shield but with a long cooldown makes him very weak and hard to play.3.  Elf seems the easiest to play as auto attack, AOE bomb as well as dodge whenever he wants makes him very easy.4.  Valkyre is good but you need to keep pressure up and use her charge ability but once that is mastered you're good to go.  To sum up:  Single Player Merlin:  Very weak defensively, strong damage.Thor:  Weak defensively, average damageElf:  Excellant damage and with his dodge very good defensivelyValkyre:  Good damage and can have Average/Good defense if you use aggression properly*The player abilities may work better as a team in coop, these are my opionions from first runs through with classes.I recommend this game, IF you can get past not being able to rebind your keys - we need to, as a community raise a big stink about this one!  I do recommend the game though, it is fun as hell despite this rather major shortfall.My 0.02 cents.  Back to monster killing!  :-)			"

												Full Controller Support - This is a lie, it does not have anything like such a claimJust check the forums and you will see the swathe of controller issue threads... and should you be lucky enough to use one of the 3 supported controller types that the devs consider full support, then you can't even re-map the buttons to your own play style.A € 20 game you would do well to avoid until you see a sale - then do some major research and check your controller will work.

												If Gauntlet was the original hack and slash game, this is a very poor cosplay of it. Warner Brothers, while famous as a movie studio, are not well known for (publishing) good games. (Arrowhead Games Studio developed it.) They say that when you go to a pizza place, don't order the salad because it's not their specialty and will probably be terrible.(03.18.17) To expand on my initial comments, if you're looking for better, similiar style gameplay to this version of the Gauntlet, I  recommend you check out Torchlight II. This (Arrowhead Games Studio developed) Gaunlet changes too much from the other more playable versions, and is a bit of a mess on the PC. It doesn't take very long playing it to recognize how much they changed the Guantlet formula. In my opinion, the previous publishers (Atari, Tengen, and Midway Games) all did a much better job.EDIT: From a comment, ""Arrowhead Game Studios made this game. WB just published it."" My revised review makes note of that.			"

												I am a massive fan of the original so an updated version was always long awaited....I have had barely any time to play due to work so when I got the chance I was straight in to have some good old Arcade fun! Sure - There was going tobe new stuff but hwo can you go wrong with such a classic title?So lets get to the good:Graphics are AMAZING! Simple as...All the Old Character Classes, Nicely updated with unique Special AbilitiesMore Monster Types than EVER!Some great Puzzles as well as combat!Sorry but thats it... I have not tried the Multiplayer yet so cannot comment on that... But this is Gauntlet? How could anything be wrong?So lets go THE BAD:Controls are DAMN AWKWARD! Why? This is such a simple game - Why make it so complex... ??? There is NO NEED!Sound - Or at least lack therof... My Computer meets all the specifications and more... But I have NO SOUND, NO MUSIC! NO NOTHING!NO Health - No its a Three Hit System!!! Again - WHY Change something so PERFECT in the original???I have not worked out if you can zoom in either - I jumped straight in but if there is no zoom then the Sprites are SO DAMN TINY! Honestly, The Original Aracde game just need a Graphical Revamp but they had to CHANGE THE ENTIRE GAME! I really wanted to Love this game - I truly did! I have been waiting SO LONG for an updated Arcade Classic...I missed the previous versions (Yes I have been waiting that long to get a PC capable of playing the game!!!) that featured Leveling, which has also annoyed players after its removal - So I cannot comment on that. Overall:Graphics 7/10 Sprites seem way too small on intial playSound 0/10 I have NONE!Controls 5/10 Why??? So needlessly complex!!!Gameplay 6/10 It has potential... But most of it unrealisedFinal Score: 6/10A game that should easilly have been a 9 in the right hands... But made too much like so many other games instead of being pure arcade action! Seriously let down!!!The Bugs leave me no real choice but to apply for a refund...			"

												I would definitely recommend this game to anybody looking for a more simplified and more skill based ARPG experience. While it may be tempting at first glance to compare this game to other ARPGs like Torchlight, for most part the only similarities are the top view action. While I would recommend this to hardcore and softcore players alike, I think the best element of this game is the challenge. While there are some RPG elements, they are somewhat limited in scope and some are purely esthetic. I believe softcore players would not get their money's worth at the moment, so for $20 I can only recommend this to hardcore gamers who are looking to challenge themselves by using teamwork to conquer the game on its hardest difficulties.The game also rewards players who play a lot, as there are many achievements which grant permanent passive perks such as increased damage, moving speed and decreased cooldown for certain skills, which is very nice and gives the player an incentive to play a lot and perform well. This however is probably only more necessary on harder difficulties, as this is one of those games that relies more on the player's skill rather than gear, equipment, skill tree, etc... You will find none of these elements in this game as this is a remake of an arcade classic.While you can play this game solo for a while, you will need teammates who know what they're doing on latter difficulties. You can also play up to 4 players locally, so as long as there are enough controllers plugged in the USBs. There is also no in-game chat, which can be a double edged blade in my opinion. On one hand, it prevents needless distraction and conversations (mostly complaining), which helps to keep the focus on the actual game as it's fairly easy to die when not paying attention to the right elements on screen.There are four playable classes, each of them having their own style, which all feel very unique and contribute in different ways. Only one of these characters may be used at a time, so it may be important to learn how to use every class.- The Warrior, having high armor and hit points is the natural meatshield of the bunch, deals medium damage in an area of effect or an arc and can bum rush through hordes. However outside of using his skills he can be pretty slow moving. His whirlwind special attack will devastate any enemies standing in his path.- The Valkyrie, is a hybrid DPS-Tank class with high maneuverability. His main attack pierces through enemy lines and is very effective in taking out cannon fodder units, but may leave him momentarily vulnerable to stronger units. He can also take quite a beating, but not as much as the warrior. However, the ability to block incoming missles gives the Valkyrie a huge advantage in combat, which can be a great for protecting the Elf while he deals ranged damage. Quite an effective combination in my opinion. The Valkyrie's special attack is a devastating chain-damage shield throw that is very effective against hordes, but leaves him unable to block until the shield returns.- The Elf, is a basic ranged character that can effectively evade anything it comes across, as well as delivering precisie sniper shots to often elusive elite enemies with special abilities that can wreak havoc onto your party. In addition the dealing massive damage to enemies, the Elf is able to drop or attach a bomb onto one of his arrows to deal even bigger damage to radius. The Elf's evade ability can also be key when used offensively in order to reach spawn towers to drop bombs when the action becomes so heavy that no teammates have access to destroy the key units.- The Wizard, with a staggering 9 spells from which to choose from, is easily one of the most important characters due to his abilities. Each element has 3 spells (fire, ice, lightning) that are all very unique and renders the Wizard one of the most versitile character that can adapt to deal with almost any situation. From shotgun-style ice shards to your face, to mighty exploding orbs that deliver the highest DPS in an area of effect in the game, to chain-lightning and slow aura, the Wizard can quickly dispatch of hordes of enemies while supporting the rest of the party. However, this is the class with the highest learning curve due to his versitality and is by far the most complex character to play in the game.In the end, this is a great game with a lot of challenge and no drama what's so ever when playing online. I'd recommend to this game to anybody who enjoys and misses the old school arcade-type games.PROS:+ Four unique classes, each with their own roles+ Four player local or online co-op+ Challenging team-based gameplay+ No in-game chat, no drama!+ Pick up and play - Simple interface allows for quickly setting up and starting gamesCONS:- Game balance issues depending on party member play styles and preferences- Nature of gameplay may sometimes encourage players to be greedy, however this only affects post-game rankings- A little pricey at $20VERDICT: 7.2/10 - Highly recommended!

												Sadly, the original version of this game didn’t get a full year before it got its upgrade, but it’s not without its charm. Essentially it is the same game as when it was released but a few tweaks and minor issues fixed, as well as a few added.The original HUB where you chose levels is now fixed so the Host is the one who picks instead of everyone running around trying to play their favorite level over and over.There’s now a mode called Endless where bad guys come in large waves and each level gets harder. I made it to level 30 before we got overrun and ran out of tokens. This mode is kind of cool because your gold outside the mode isn’t used for purchases, instead the gold you collect as you go is the only gold you get so fighting over the crown becomes crucial. You can also buy skull tokens for lives, potions, and food at the start of each floor. My advice, buy skull tokens any time you can – you will need them and they aren’t offered on every floor.By far the biggest overhaul to the gameplay at least that I saw was the reconstruction of Relic items; they don’t use potions anymore and instead use a cooldown mechanic. Talisman items are what old Relics were and require potions to use and they still have the same flaw in that if people don’t have a Talisman and pick up a potion the potion is used up and forfeit. I guess it’s a fair deal considering we have cooldown abilities now. Characters now have abilities unique to their weapon choice. The Warrior’s hammer can do the spin attack it was known for or can create a powerful shockwave. The Valkyrie can call down lightning or throw her shield like Captain America. And the Wizard has invisibility and hellfire abilities. The Necromancer can choose skeleton warrior, archer, or ghosts as her minions. Best addition so far.Enemies got an overhaul too and aside from different models here’s what I’ve seen so far:-Zombie giants have a bit more health and can pop up at random, so look for coffins.-Zombie champions come in shield and archer variant and have faster rush abilities and can call down ice arrows. A nice addition for some challenge.-Necromancers can now come in two-stage fights, kind of like a mini boss. One fight will be their mortal form and the other in their ghost form which changed very little.The first boss didn’t change at all, but now you can fight zombie giants during his fight.-Grunts look different and can be empowered by the Shaman.-Shaman look different and now shoot bolts of green that break off and turn into more bolts rather than the skull that follows you around like in the original version.-Giant Orcs can break their hammers and charge. Watch out.-New Minions: Spider soldiers. They are smaller version of Spider queens but can’t do much damage and can be stun-locked.-Spider queens look different and seem to have a little more health but no real change.-The second boss had more lighting added to the level. Thank you.-Cultist that turned into demon in the original version now explode when they die, sending purple bolts in a four-way patter. Watch out.-The cult leader got a new look and his sparkly bolt thing seems to be pretty inaccurate. Okay.-Basic demons gave the lion share of the update and can now stun lock enemies, and look different. Really watch out.That’s what I got so far. I haven’t gotten too far yet.Unfair mode is gone now and I say good riddance. It was nice unlocking certain masteries quicker but I hated being reminded I needed food when there was no food in the level. Stay dead and buried, unfair mode.Armor and weapons don’t need to be unlocked by beating certain levels in higher difficulties, now they can just be bought, which is okay I guess.All and all I like it and still recommend it. I play both single player and multiplayer.Pros- Cooldown abilities give the game a nice customization tool and good feel to gameplay.- Endless Mode for those brave enough to venture into the deep of the game.- Connection issues seemed to get a big fix. Big plus in my book.Meh- Some level layouts remain the same – some good, some still needing work.- During the Lobby scene people can put the Ready screen in an endless lobby hitting Ready/Not Ready and resetting the 30 second timer.- You can just buy the armor now instead of having to unlock it.Cons- Masters redone – abilities like less damage from the Valkyrie, coming back to life as Necromancer, and Warrior Regeneration are gone. No damage bonuses for killing so many of one foe.- Some items are still pretty worthless.			"

												Gauntlet is a remake of an old arcade / nintendo game I played a lot as a kid.   This version of it stays true to the original setting while improving on game play and game mechanics.  I've played it for 3 hours so far and I'm dying to get back in and play some more.Game mechanics are fair, intuitive, and fun.  I've yet to encounter a bug while playing which is always a plus.  Character dialogue is entertaining and helps to set the mood.  I like that there is a story here, but it's not being forced on you through extensive cut scenes.Multi-player is fair, making sure that people can't grief loot (all treasure is split among players).  Having people in your group really helps, but is not necessary.  I've already played through the first dozen levels solo.   I've also spent an hour in multiplayer.  It's really fun to play with friends if you have a voice chat server running.Just a heads up if you use the quick join function:  Depending on who is hosting, you may experience lag or some severe latency, if you hit that, you can always jump out and try a different game or start your own.  I do question the leader board scores, just seems....unlikely that someone earned THAT many kills/gold without an exploit...but that's just my opinion.Overall, I'd say it's definitely worth the 20 dollars to buy it.

The four different characters actually provice a decent ammount of play difference between them and the game gives enough progression to keep you going.09/10  Not sure about the multiplayer yet, when it works it is great but it seems a bit tempermental, can't knock it too much on that though since it is launchday.

												The Good:(1) The game is fast paced, not overly complex and competitive. Graphics are pleasing.(2) It's $20.(3) Mastery levels of each character improves your character the more you play.The Bad:(1) It's short. About 6 hours in I had completed most of normal mode. (2) There isn't much of a story. It's hack and slash.(3) Your camera is locked. In single-player this isn't an issue, in multi-player it centers the view to the median between were each of the four players are on the screen. In chaotic situations it's very easy to lose track of your character. All players have to move forward to continue. Players can get stuck by terrain if the group moves forward without them, forcing the entire group to backtrack to allow them to continue.The Ugly:(1) No in-game chat (text or voice), which makes it so you can't even coordinate with people to use a 3rd party voice system. You're limited to 4 emotes. Matchmaking could be greatly improved. I like playing wizard, and it's really infuriating when I join a game, wizard is already taken and I'm forced into another role that I don't want to play.The game play is basic and could be improved upon. I anticipate there will be DLC that will unlock additional content.			"

												The reviews by people complaining about the classes not being balanced are hilarious. THIS GAME IS A REMAKE OF A GAME FROM BEFORE GAMES HOLDING YOUR HAND. BALANCE THIS! Each Character is extremely useful and wonderful to have on your team. THIS GAME DOES NOT HOLD YOUR HAND. If you want a game that lets you do whatever with no consuquences, go play Diablo 3. If you want a fun, teeth grinding, hardcore experience play this game. This game is not for the faint of heart.10/10 many thumbs up!			"

												Gauntlet is a revered classic IMO.   I've spent countless quarters playing Gauntlet in endless frustration.  This adapatation stays true to the classic while adding a modern spin on the game.  The controls are fluid and easy to pick up on for the Barbarian, Valkrie, and Elf.  However the Wizard is IMO difficult to control and play with due to the change in spells and targeting.  However it is not a limitation that others can not over come.  I'd highly reccomend this game if you are a fan of the old Gauntlet.			"

												Takes me back several years.  Still feels very much like the original with a slight twist. The relics are nice, even if I am hesitant to buy any as I don't know which are best.  But The armor is also nice, nothing is givne to you and it all must be earned within the gauntlet.  The perk system is nice too.  You can gain perks from death and just about everything else.  These perks are minor but for sure make for a easier gameplay the more you get.The competitive feel of this game is top notch.  I find myself scrambling for gold, potions, and crowns before my teammates so that I can be rewards well and be able to buy upgraded relics, armor, etc...  It makes me consider if I should steal/destroy that food or let the teammate who is 5% health have it, knowing he's been grabbing a lot of the gold in a level.  By letting a teammate die they drop a small portion of the gold they have collected and you are allowed to pick it up.  Down side is if you do this to often your teammate will catch on and begin stealing food from you as well.  The over all game play feels nice, and mouse and keyboard are adopted to the game very well.  As far as classes go Valky, Wizard, and Ranger are all about equal with their own strengths and weaknesses.  The warrior however seems very lack luster.  With a charge that has to charge up for about .75 seconds and low durabilty (from what is seems), he can't really take a beating though he is required to be in the fray of fighting. Valky, brings a melee style play to the game with a bit more durability and even some range.  She can shield to block attacks and with her shield throw can handle 2 halves of a room at once.  The archer, though limited range is very adept at staying just out of range of enemies while still staying relevant in the fight. The wizard is a more technical class and casts spells depending on what button combos you press to ready his next spell with.  But is very strong range damage.I have just scratched the surface of this game and I look forward to diving deeper into the game in the following days and weeks.  4 out of 5 stars, due to the grindy feel and warrior being a lack luster choice in comparison to the other classes.

												The game got a lot better with the slayer variation. If the you played the old version, you might have felt like it left something to be desired. This update changed a lot of that for me, and It made me want to give this game a recommendation to you guys. This is a really good local or online co-op game with up to four players, you explore the depths of dungeons, unlock powerful abilities and have a great time doing it. Honestly if you played Gauntlets earlier games and enjoyed them, I'd highly suggest picking this one up.I think 20 dollars is honestly a decent price, but if you're unsure, get it on sale and you'll have a good time. Even moreso if you have someone to play with online or locally.8.5/10 "

												So there's this dude named Morak. He's got all kinds of Wiz-biz, smack talk, and spare time. So he thinks to himself 'Hey, I've got a great idea: Why don't I summon a mad evil dungeon that's laid dormant for tens of thousands of years, and get a bunch of lackeys to go through them for me?'So he does, and that's where Gauntlet begins. You're Morak's lacky, just like you're the lackey for your overbearing manager at your 9-5 every day job. There are mad zombies that need to be told to ♥♥♥♥ off, There's skeletons that look like Tara Reid, and they need to eat something. And lastly, there are fire demons that don't suck the sperm out of your balls, they just suck the soul out of your bod. Morak taunts you all the way through these dungeons like an impatient child wanting that new video game or your undivided attention. I’m not going to spoil the game for you. If you have half of a brain, I’m sure your incompetent self can figure out the rest. This isn’t Gauntlet Legends, so I wouldn’t be doing backflips over it. But it’s a great hack and slash, and everyone that writes negative reviews on it are either unskilled p*u*s*s*i*e*s*, or they don’t really know how to have fun. It’s a game worth its value, and if you disagree with me: you’re an idiot and you’re wrong.			"

												Worst $4.99 I ever spent even with my friends, I feel bad that it was my idea to try this game when it went on sale.Pros:  Feels like Gauntlet for the most part and very compedetive and button mashing fun.Hearing my friend Points complain the whole time that Nintendo doesn't ""suck"".Cons:  Potions aren't useful and  I'd prefer their original format like in the original.  Relics aren't that powerful vs their cost.VERY SHORT and NO Storyline.  It took only two playthrough sessions to finish the game with friends.Might be worth a buck but that's about it.  Heck the original NES verison was BETTER AND longer!*drops the mic* "

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCaHM2FZ3Tk&list=PLcbACK_uiNo6tJkIjTRifrjGSYW94VZJr&index=7That is a full LP of us doing this game on Youtube. And we're pretty damn disappointed with it. If it wasn't for the sake of the LP, we probably wouldn't even have bothered finishing it. This game is so sloppy, so lazy, so repetitive, so boring, that I just don't know why it was even made. It comes off as a cash grab, but seems to have gotten more effort put into it than those kind of games generally get. But it still feels like it was made by a computer, ""game developer bot v2.1"", as opposed to any kind of relatable or passionate Human being that likes video games.I was bored to death for most the game because of how repetitive it is. Levels are painfully short, sometimes not more than a few minutes, and it's the same thing over and over again. Enter room, kill enemies, proceed to next room, repeat. There's no story, quests, choices, or exploration once so ever. Other than a few character options, there's no choices to make with this game once so ever. The most they could be bothered to do was put destructable walls in a few areas. Hey, how about making each level a labyrinth where we have to explore to find the exit? No? You're just going to give us a 100% linear path? 1 way in, 1 way out, level after level? Yawn. And the ""puzzles"" in this game amount to little more than pulling levers that are awkwardly placed right before the doors they open, as I point out in frustration a few times in the LP. When there is only 1 path, and 1 possible lever to pull, why even bother? The lava stage was a great chance to do a real puzzle where we had to run around and pull the correct levers to get the bridge up, but nope... just go forward and there's no way you can ""not"" get it right. Everything in the game feels pointless like this.Almost every enemy in the game is the same, with the game recycling enemies and just changing their model to pretend it's different. The game could have benefited from around 10x as many unique bosses, but no, they are far and few between... yawn. Is that all you could come up with? How about longer non linear levels? If this was the best you could do, there should have been like 100 levels...The LP was so depressing that at the end we started talking about better games you could have spent your 20$ on instead of this crap, and our host literally raged at the game, because as an original Gauntlet player, he expected so much more. My recommendation is to not buy this. I don't care if you were an original fan or not. This is just pitiful. There's so many better more fun games you could get for 10-20$, really. We uninstalled right after the LP, and you won't be seeing us ever putting in more hours again. This game was disappointing enough for me to come review it, and we feel ripped off for the 20$ we wasted into this. We could have been playing Torchlight 2 instead.			"

												It didn't occur to me right away that this was made by the Magicka team, because the game actually runs, and works. It occurred to me that this was made by the Magicka team after playing as the Wizard, and noticing how horribly optimized the game is. I can run Killing Floor 2 on full detail with no issue, I should not be getting massive slowdown from this.All in all, a fairly short, simple top-down hack 'n slash. Varies between regular dungeon levels, fleeing from Death, and arena levels, with a few bossfights to cap it off. 9 stages not counting the bosses, but each one has at least 3 parts to it. Combat feels pretty responsive and doesn't screw around in terms of difficulty. It's definitely built for co-op, and entertaining as such, although the classes are a bit imbalanced. Most specifically the Wizard is hilariously OP if you can remember your button combos, he's like 3 classes in one. Each class has a set of equippable relics to buy with your amassed gold, and grindy not-achievements to achieve for marginal passive effects... although they're all identical between classes, but still must be earned separately for each. Questionable.It doesn't hold a candle to Gauntlet Legends, no, but in the absence of a native PC version of that with netplay, it's worth getting on sale to go through once or twice with friends.

												I wouldn't call this a Gauntlet game.Perhaps that's because my understanding of Gauntlet came from Gauntlet Legends and Gauntlet: Dark Legacy. Both excellent games with hours and hours of gameplay and tons of playable characters with alternate costumes (so you and a friend could both be warriors but look entirely different) and discoverable characters, leveling up, familiars, and a vast array of locations with interesting themes for each.Maybe it was too much to hope this game would return to styles of those forementioned, but instead fell just as flat as Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows. I even had to Google that title up because I had forgotten what it was called. Anyway, if you're wanting a game like Legends or Dark Legacy, this is not the game for you.			"

												While I actually find this game reasonably fun in spite of performance issues, what has lead to me not recommending this title was based on pre-order promises by the devs that Gauntlet™ [pre-Slayer Edition] would be coming to Linux/SteamOS - which is even still mentioned under accolades!As you can tell, they decided to change their minds about that one later on and added stuff to the as-of-now Windows-only version. Mind you, I bought the game under the impression that it was always Windows-only, but discovering this fact has soured my opinion of Arrowhead somewhat.Lesson to take home here is to NEVER PRE-ORDER GAMES IN [CURRENT YEAR].

There is very little character progression, you don't really level up, you cant turn into a chicken you dont get to put points into stats, the gamecube version blows this version out of the water,  guess ill just download an emulater and play that instead.

												The Slayer Edition has made some great changes that increase the replayability, some so-so changes that let you change your characters look for a price, difficulty changes that will prevent less-skilled players from ever playing this game without friends and some dog-dumb interface changes that make me wonder if they even ran this through a usability study.You now need controller 1 for EVERYTHING. Oh, you can still play by yourself with any controller, but as soon as you want to choose the next level or anything in the main hub you have to grab controller 1 again. Even logging into your WB account will require a keyboard to type username and password and, you guessed it, controller 1 to cycle through the fields and even click the submit button!I enjoyed Gauntlet when I bought it and hope to do so again, but for now the Slayer Edition feels like an alpha version in desperate need of some further testing an updates.

For 20 bucks it's a great pickup...just be sure you have a supported controller on hand and some good friends to play with (Shooting a stranger's food isn't nearly as satisfying as your buddy's). The new relic system is implemented well as is the progression system (Kind of like achievements with perks).  I had a great time playing as the elf, Questor, but I'm not entirely sure why he's got a scottish accent.

												Though there's a few things wrong with it (character selection, lobbies, and sometimes the map breaks) Gauntlet (2014) is a decidedly fun romp with tight, well-balanced gameplay (""hard"" is, indeed, hard).  It's pretty short, you could easily finish all the maps in a day, but there is a bit of replayability because each of the characters plays differently and you need to beat higher difficulties to unlock everything.  The $20 release-day price tag is pretty reasonable, and it will be a shoe-in on a half-off sale a few months from now.  Here's hoping for a Gauntlet 2 that's even better.			"

												This is how a reboot should be done. Taking the general mechanics of the old Gauntlet games, tarting them up a bit and then rebuilding just about everything else from the ground up.I will stress, however, that the game is best played co op, especially local co op. If by yourself, the hordes can be a little difficult to deal with and the fights can quickly get repetitive. But the combat is really nice and visceral and exploring the levels with a friend can be fun and interesting.Buy it if you plan on playing it with friends.

												Great old school fun ProsGreat spiritual successor to the original, fun, rewarding, hard to put down.ConsToo short, not enough content. Hopefully they add more dungeons to crawlSuggestions for improvement Player made dungeon designer - that would have been brilliant and given the game an exponential lifespan. More relic/gear upgrade options "

												Ok let me start out by saying this game is NOT multiplayer firendly. You dont share gold but you do get gold depending on how much damage you do, so its a race to who can kill the mobs or take all the gold, the food killing mechaninc and stupid and frustrating. Dont get me started on the camera, its so stupid to share 1 camera in a game like this and you cant move on unless everyone is going the same way, this really sucks on the death chase maps when people want to go different ways. Maybe my friends are paticually troll but the concpet online just doesnt work, maybe if i were to play LAN with controllers it would work but the system just isnt workable online. all in all if you can get over those hurdles it isnt that bad of a game and we did have some fun and im going to still play it we only got the first 2 sections done so there is more to come. i would get this game on sale to play with 3 or 4 mates			"

												I am shocked. They were somehow able to keep the quality and nostalgia of the old Gauntlet untouched with this new version. I give it a 10/10 for all retro gaming fans. However, one twist and I doubt you will mind it; Diablo + Gauntlet = whatever the hell this is. Awesome game. 2 of my favs mixed into one with an honorable/respectable title and memorable gameplay.P.S.: Everyone wants to be the Wizard... you will see why.			"

												Completed first run through normal co-op.  I had Valkyrie, friend had Elf.  Great fun and can't wait to get into the higher levels.  Wish there was a bit more enemy variety.I played around with Elf a little bit, and he's really fun.  Nice mechanical and gameplay style change from Valkyrie.  I messed around with Wizard, and he's really Magicka-y, which is great, but I didn't get into him enough to really have an opinion yet.  Then I started a game with Warrior...The Warrior class is weak compared to the others and just isn't fun to play after doing a run with Valkyrie and messing around with Elf for a bit.  Warrior could use a massive buff and/or re-design.  Valkyrie's power attack (Y on 360 controllers) is basically a combination of Warrior's charge and power attack except it's instant whereas the Warrior abilities take forever to charge.  Valkyrie's special move, the shield toss, functions and feels amazing to use.  Warrior's spin attack is cool-looking, but feels weak as it doesn't actually do much damage.  It feels like Warrior is missing an ability because his charge is so stupid and weak and requires a ton of space and time to use, and his power attack is single-target and has a horrible wind-up.  Warrior also has a terrible voice.Aside from the Warrior, my only other beefs are lack of enemy variety, heavy use/reliance on summoning portals, only 3 boss fights, and I feel there could be more variety with character customization.The game really shines in co-op as the classes are designed to synergize.  My friend and I had an amazing time running through the game with Thyra and Questor.  Questor is really funny, and it's fun to hear the characters interract with each other.  We'll be playing through the harder difficulties this weekend and I'm looking forward to any DLC or expansions that come out for this one because it definitely leaves you wanting more when you finish it.

												Just finished this game with some friends,all i gotta say, it was fun. First thing to talk about is gameplay, it's pretty tough, especially doing it on solo. You are able to use relics to do more destruction to enemies. Though it took me and my friends 6 hours to beat it, I'm hoping there would be DLCs, maybe new characters, maybe from Dark Legacy? Maybe more areas? now for some problems, theres some bugs that occur, sometimes the boxes that you have to move, randomly stops moving until you restart the area. Another thing, yes it's short, and could use more areas. This one thing that bothers me the most, is the classic setting in the graphics tab, it was like I was blind or something. Sad thing about this game, is that there can't be a same class in the same team, and plus needs more colors, more like the older games please. One thing to recommend to the developers, is that the Elf is very OP, they might wanna fix the Elf class so it can be balanced a bit. Pros: +Cool gameplay against hordes of monsters +4 player coop, even online +UpgradesCons: -Too short-Classic setting in graphics tab is very dumb-Needs more areas (and Dark Legacy characters please?)-Needs freedom to use same classes in the same team-Semi Buggy-Elf is very OP 6 / 10 It was fun, yet not very satisfied with it, if you like slaughtering a horde of monsters, this is a game for you.

												Just beat the game on normal, and I've got to say, this game is awesome! They really did amazing at bringing back that co-op arcarde feeling that made the first game so much fun, while adding some new elements for an overall fresh experience. I highly recommend any action rpg fan pick up this game. For the best experience, grab some friends and get that four-pack, the game is like impossible alone. The only things im really disappointed in are how short the game is and some lesser balancing issues.			"
