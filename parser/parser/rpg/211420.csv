												It's hard to describe why Dark Souls is so, so good.Yet, it's so incredibly easy.Why? We just need to look at the core attitude of Dark Souls, from a design-to-player perspective.Dark Souls is challenging. Yes, that much is clear. But it's not to laugh at you or to discourage you.It's hard because it knows what you're capable of, and it believes in you. It doesn't want you to give up.Despite killing you all the time, it respects your intelligence and holds you of the highest regard. Dark Souls wants you to succeed, and this gives it the framework to do so many things right.In that regard, Dark Souls does absolutely no hand holding in almost every aspect. The story and lore of the world will completely pass you by if you don't take the time to read item descriptions, examine the world, and talk to every NPC you meet. You will be torn apart if you don't take the time to familiarize yourself with your weapon and shield. Most of all, if you don't take your time, you will be seeing YOU DIED a lot as well. The game grounds itself in patient manner when it comes to enemies and bosses: it wants you to slow down, weigh all of your options, experiment, and most importantly do whatever it takes to survive.Combat is slow, but weighty; everything about the fighting is spot on. Small weapons swing fast like they should. Large weapons swing slow, and when they hit the ground they emit satisfying ""clunk"" sounds. Every swing depletes a certain amount of stamina. It's a simple mechanic but it puts so much choice and consequence on the player. You can try to attack like a madman to burn your enemies down as fast as you can, but you won't be able to hold a block with your shield if you run low on stamina. All of this goes double for the intense boss fights - most of the bosses won't hold anything back and they will be a true test of applying everything you've learned thus far. You will die, a lot, but finally defeating one of these bosses grants you such an immense feeling of accomplishment, because YOU DID IT ALL WITH YOUR OWN SKILL!The world of Dark Souls is completely open. There are very few loading screens, there are no transitional airlocks between areas; everything is seamlessly connected to each other. At times, the geography will seem strange but once you take a look around and realize that you can actually see areas from other places, suddenly everything feels natural. Dark Souls' atmosphere is done with careful and precise attention. At times you'll be exploring dark, moody caverns, other times you'll be wading through a dense, moonlit forest with nothing but the ambience to accompany you. Sometimes you'll even find yourself deep in the middle of a trap filled fortress. Make sure you always have your wits about you and you're actively paying attention. The world is just flat out beautiful and knowing that the game is one big connected overworld makes it feel so real and alive, and it really drives home the sense that this world is huge and it brings back that ""adventure"" experience I've come to miss so bad. The world is yours, and you're free to go wherever you please. At times, you might feel like you're a bit lost, and I do admit the game is sometimes a little obscure with the regard of pointing you towards the right direction, but there are subtle clues and hints. Are the enemies too hard in a certain area? Is there a locked door? There's probably another way you haven't explored yet.The world is also home to many NPCs. I mentioned before that if you don't take the time to talk to the NPCs you meet and try to piece together who they are, what they're doing, and how they got where they are, you're going to miss out of a lot of Dark Souls' story. This is where I feel Dark Souls' thematic focus comes full strength. The entire game is about overcoming, and fighting through your own struggles. In that same sense, all of the characters you meet along the way are also fighting for something. Something they thought was important, or something they hold dear. Really, take the time to get to know these people and pay attention as well. You won't know where they go next if you don't listen! With that said, if you make the effort to witness each of these stories, you'll watch them struggle along with you, fighting their own battles. Yes, Dark Souls is rich with lore and backstory, but I think the real beauty is watching these characters fight for what they believe in, while you yourself are fighting your own battles too.Dark Souls also has a very unusual multiplayer system. At all times, your character will be in either one of two forms: hollowed, or human. You spend a somewhat uncommon item called ""Humanity"" to turn from hollow to human. This enables you to partake in jolly co-operation! If you're in an area where you haven't beaten the boss yet, you can summon fellow players to your world who are also in the same area, as long as they're relatively near your soul level. Sounds good right? Just like the combat, there's another consequence you might have to face when you turn human. Dark Souls allows players to ""invade"" the worlds of other human players. They will appear as red phantoms, and they will hunt you down and kill you on sight, essentially marking this game's version of PvP.Now, this is where I feel Dark Souls' biggest community strength comes from. You see, once a player invades you, all bets are off. They might be insanely twinked out. They might be a fair fight. They might want to honor duel you. You might even have a couple friends already summoned to help you out. Some players have taken it upon themselves to create a sort of ""honor"" code when it comes to PvP. They like to designate certain areas of the game for official dueling, with no help from other players or no healing, stuff like that. Some players agree with doing this. Some players prefer the chaotic nature of invading in random places, not knowing what either party will be up against. Some players are firmly rooted in the idea that PvE and PvP should not intertwine. They'll even go as far as to never turn human. What ""honor"" or ""etiquette"" should be included in Dark Souls' PvP, if any, is still being debated today. I feel like there will never be one solid answer but I think that's okay. It allows for more discussion and I think there's something inherently beautiful about a community being on two complete opposite sides of how an in-game mechanic should work. Bottom line: try, at least a couple times, to play through the game in human form. The invasion mechanic is a part of the game, and even though sometimes you'll get ganked, it's an experience quite like no other.Dark Souls is challenging, but not unfair. To be honest, the difficulty this game is notorious for isn't as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. Don't get me wrong though, there is still a lot of obstacles you'll have to overcome and at times it'll feel like you're stuck. But don't give up. Never give up.In today's world of modern game development, it's very pleasant to play a game that actually holds you with a high regard and respects your ability to think, perceive, and act. Dark Souls is a hallmark of intelligent and masterful gameplay design, and it stands as one of my all time favorite games. Highly recommended. Well, now you know... and I can die with hope in my heart.			"

												I've had a love-hate relationship with this game for years. My first three attempts were miserable failures, and hardly stretched beyond an hour of gameplay. It took a fourth attempt to understand where I went wrong.This game is not a bully or a menace. It is not unfair. Dark Souls is a father that wants to play catch with you in the backyard. Sure, he tosses you a few practice pitches, gets you warmed up, makes you feel like you're in the big leagues. Suddenly, you eat a screwball to the temple. You cry at first, moan, maybe fuss a little, and then get up to catch another. The stinging welt on your face reminds you to keep your glove up. Throughout this process, your father slams a fastball into your gut, sails a slider into your genitals, cracks your skull with a curveball, and he'll throw a second ball just when you're barely figuring out the first. Now you can give up whenever you want. Make a big deal about it, about how Dad is cheating or he's being mean or that it's all just a big waste of time. Your father will patiently wait while you throw your tantrum, slowly turning over the next hidden threat in his worn glove. The truth of the matter is that he wants you to succeed. He's teaching you by showing, not by telling. He's preparing you for something much, much worse that lurks ahead. Don't fight it. He wants you to succeed, but he's going to make you work for it. Take your lumps, say goodbye to your precious souls, and above all else: Prepare to die.			"

												Dark Souls is hard. That's the first thing people probably hear when the title is mentioned. I think that people have become spoiled -- or maybe weak or complacent are better words to use. We've become used to pressing A for awesome or quick time events flashing across the screen. We're used to hand holding and tutorials that overstay their welcome. We're used to winning and not having to work for it because challenges are usually designed to be beaten without the threat of losing or death. If Dark Souls is a difficult game, then it's because it actually respects the player. I know that I find the typical style of hand holding in games to be patronizing, no doubt from being developed for the lowest common denominator. If you die (and you will), then it's because you lack necessary information and must learn it through experience, or it's because you're not paying attention or being too careless. Dark Souls rewards adaptability and experience. If Dark Souls is difficult, then it's not because it is unfair, but because we are weak and need to shape up.Another claim I've seen bandied about is that Dark Souls is light on story, but I do not believe this to be true. The story, like the difficulty, treats the player with respect. We're not going to be fed exposition from an eye dropper. The majority of the lore we gather is embedded within item descriptions or world and enemy design. We approach the game as an explorer, travelling to the cataclysmic land of Lordran to sift through its relics and best its challenges. The way the lore is delivered reflects this. Does this mean that it is light on story? Only if we assume that deep story necessarily means being beaten over the head with it via heavy handed narratives. Dark Souls is/was a bad pc port. It is internally rendered at a fixed, low resolution, can't really be played without a controller and, the worst of all curses, uses Games for Windows Live. DSFix is a third party modification that alleviates the former graphical issues. There'll be a patch released this month to remove GFWL, so that takes care of another issue. Honestly, the game is such a masterpiece that it's worth recommending even with the above porting issues, but it's nice to know that the two main gripes (I don't mind using a controller, personally) are not issues any longer. Subtlety is an art that seems lost in the medium of video games. Games are treated as if they are amusement park rides with all the flash and noise one should expect from such a distraction. Dark Souls is not an amusement park ride, but more like a long forgotten, dusty tomb that we disturb at our own peril; it thusly responds to our disturbance in kind. I played Dark Souls to completion around six times with three characters when it was released on consoles. I didn't hesitate to purchase it again when it was ported to PC. I've since played through seven more times with another three characters. I suppose you could call me a fan of the series. I obviously recommend it.			"

												I'd recommend this game under one condition: Take the advice in the title, and prepare yourself.  Death is not failure, but it is common.First, a bit of background: Coming into this game, and having never touched either it or a controller before, I actively disliked a lot about it.  I hated the Vancian cast limits placed on the magic (still do, in fact; I'd prefer nerfed magic and a bloody mana bar).  I also expected to be able to play it immediately, but instead was advised to get DSFix (no, seriously, get it immediately) to ensure that it worked well the first time around.  I had to buy a  controller just to PLAY the game, since the M&K combo didn't work out.  The only reason I even got the game was that a friend wanted me to try it, and it wasn't all that expensive.  All in all, I was more than ready to hate this game and everything about it.And then I actually PLAYED the game.And it's amazing.Let's ignore the setting for a minute, because it's awesome on its own.  Let's ignore the depth of the lore, and the subtlety behind it, for the same reasons.  Let's look at the combat, and the exploration, and the GAMEPLAY of the game.   I have never seen a game so dedicated to making it YOUR FAULT when you die.  It's not that hard to take about ten extra seconds and think it out before charging in, and if you do that, you instantly double your chances of survival.  Trying out a weapon and learning its quirks BEFORE fighting the enemy is absolutely vital, so that you know how to time your hits.  The attacks the enemies use are, for the most part, very easy to read if you just WAIT a minute and figure it out.  It's not hard to figure out which enemies are tough enough that you should just leave them alone for a while, and if you attacked them, it's on your head.  Once you understand the basic mechanics, the game becomes downright refreshing.I don't know about you, but I hate it when I die in a game and it WASN'T my fault.  I need to be able to see where I screwed up, and fix it.  This is the game that lets you do that, and if you're not willing to do so, of COURSE the game is super hard.  Of COURSE you're getting punished.  If you're not willing to learn and get good, you deserve punishment.In summary, though, this game is not for casuls.  This game is for the player who is willing to accept constructive criticism both from the game and from the player base.  This game is a trial by (bon)fire, and passing through will temper you into a better gamer, and possibly a better person.  Git gud, stay warm, praise the sun, and kill the dogs first.  Good luck out there, and don't you dare go Hollow.			"

												I was always afraid to play dark souls. I've heard the horror stories, I've heard of people spending hours on a boss, I've heard of people raging and almost quiting the game. And I went through all of that. And I'm glad I did, because I experienced one of the best games I've ever played. And dispite looking at guides and getting help, I'm proud that I was able to beat the game.I could go on about what the game is and what it does, but lets be honest, everyone whose played games before has heard of this game. I'm basically writing this for the people who where in my shoes before I played it. If your worried about the difficulty, about getting upset at the game, you will. Its almost a guarentee. You will have to look up guides to figure out what you're supposed to do next, but the games level design and combat more than make up for the frustrations of the game. And after you realize that death in this game isn't a punishment, but more of a learning experience, you stop getting so frustrating and you realize that you have to learn how the world works. There are definitely some frustrating elements that I think are way too unfair, but the game makes up for it with the combat and level design.I think everyone should play this game through at least the first 3 bosses. If you decide it isn't for you after that, that is prefectly fine. But a lot of people play for an hour, die, and say it was too frustrated. And admittedly I did that for a long time. But if you give this game a fair chance, I think you'll realize that it really isn't as frustrating and hard as people think.Dark Souls turned me from thinking it was a frustrating mess of a game to being one of the best games I've ever played, and I'll definitely play it again at some point. You owe it to yourself to give a fair shot to one of the best games of last generation. Buy At Full Price  "

												It's like being married to a woman who is attractive and charming and funny and intelligent and you are soulmates and everything is perfect, right? She is the perfect woman. You could not ask for a more better woman in the world. You love her, and she loves you. Only, she has one flaw. Every 5 minutes, she punches you in the face... For no reason, she just punches you in the face every 5 minutes. Even at night, you wake up, she punches you in the face. You recover, get 3 minutes 38 seconds of sleep, then she punches you in the face again. And you love her.Source: http://www.twitch.tv/theurbanorb/c/1581619

												By far the best game I have ever played. Dark Souls is NOT even close to the hardest games out there, contrary to popular belief. It is just a wake up call from the standard industry games where everything is handed to you. You actually improve at the game as you go, as opposed to just getting equipped with better gear only. This is a perfect 10/10 for me. Also don't use the drake sword.			"

												In this review I'll try to be concise but deepening the major aspects of the game. (°ロ°)☝♦ The difficulty♦ The graphics♦ The gameplay♦ The lore♦ The difficultyFirst of all, and probably the reason why this game is so famous (or infamous), is the difficulty.This game ain't that hard, it punishes every single mistake the player makes, often with death.I often read people complaining that this game is so hard only becase it's artificially made so with bad programming or ultraoverpowered enemies. It's not true. This game forces to learn (sometimes killing you 5 billion times in a row) the mechanics, but once you have learnt them, you can ""easily"" kill almost every single boss (made exception for 3 or 4 in which one you will just need patience or luck).I said that this game punishes mistakes. But not only the player's ones, even the one made by the AI: there is always a easier way to kill stuff than running onto them (because 90% of the time it will end with you respawning at the last bonfire).It's a challenge. No more words needed.♦ The graphicsThe graphic comparment of this game is simply beautiful.Maybe is not that pumped, but it's so cured that literally gives the feeling of running in a world made of chaos and beauty.The textures are a bit gross and at a closer look, ugly.But the way they are implemented in the world, with every collapsed building, grass growing in the wild or every strange liquid in the deepest areas of the world, the textures are just perfect.The light is not that well done but when it's dark, for God's sake, it's really dark. Not dark like ""meh, i can barely see stuff"", dark like ""Where the hell am I going? Where the hell is the road? Am I still alive? Was that a damned arrow?"".♦ The GameplayThis game is definetely not indicated for people who like the classic RPG game with quests, NPCs and maps.It gives only two directed suggestions:-""In Lordran, level up and kindle at bonfires"" -""Ring two bells and GTFO""STOP. No more instructions. no one will tell you where to go or what the hell is happening. You're alone in this dark and shattered world. People will trick you, people will invade you from their world, people will ♥♥♥♥ your game up killing NPCs. The only way to know where you have to lead next, is reading everything. On every item there is a description that tells you everything you need: where to go, where to look and what are the weaknesses of the bosses.Every single weapon has a unique moveset that goes well against certain enemies but against others are better other weapons. And i'm not saying that every weapon class has a moveset. Every. Single. Weapon.Don't ever try to do a 3v1 in an area (unless you're overleved), you will probably get rekt, or finish without estus (potions).This game is divided in areas, at the end whereof there is a boss fight. Until the final boss is killed, people can invade your world trying to kill you for souls and humanities. In the other hand, until the area is freed, you can convoke players.Last but not Least, when you die a blood stain will appear on the floor, cointaing the souls and the humanity you had.You can pick them up restoring everything you had. But if you die again trying, sayonara souls.USE A CONTROLLER.♦ The loreSome people complains that this game has no lore. This happens because just like what you have to do, no one says what the hell is going on. But items, ambientations, enemies, will scream out loud what happened and what is going on.Quoting the director of the game: ""A well designed world could tell its story in silence.""Watch THIS video. NOW.Like a moth, fluttering towards a flame10/10 "

												Dark Souls isn’t an especially hard game, it’s just a lot harder than most mainstream games today. I like to say it’s an early 90’s action RPG with modern 3D graphics and controls, in every aspect.The central thing that sets Dark Souls apart (as well as Demon’s Souls before it) is that it actually tries to respect the player’s intelligence and resilience by avoiding many of the practices today’s mainstream games adopt. It doesn’t hold your hand. It doesn’t constantly prod you in the right direction. It doesn’t spoon-feed you the storyline. It won’t try to make sure you constantly know where to go and what to do. The developers at From Software aren’t even worried about you possibly overlooking content in this game. Dark Souls provides you only with what you need to eventually figure out what to do.In terms of overall difficulty and its approach to the player I personally would say Dark Souls is about in line with most Super NES games. It actually feels like it takes a philosophy similar to that of the classic Mega Man and Mega Man X games. While playing you have to accept the fact that you’re going to die and retry a few times before you work out a strategy for beating a particular boss or getting past a certain situation. Most developers today are too worried players will get frustrated during that process and drop the game, but From Software doesn’t care.Dark Souls is definitely a punitive game. When you die you lose “souls,” a resource representing both your experience points and currency, which you get one chance to retrieve. Checkpoints are specifically placed throughout the game. Though you can save and quit literally anywhere, the game auto-saves after pretty much any action, so every single decision you make, big or small, is final. Many people have called Dark Souls the ultimate example of “tough but fair,” in video games.Even the tutorial manages to be at once smooth, enticing, and a bit challenging. The first time I tried Demon’s Souls it took me literally around 30 seconds to figure out the core combat controls (which are basically the same in Dark Souls). It’s a very intuitive system based on the left and right bumpers each representing a hand, (on an Xbox 360 pad) the B button representing dodge, and the management of a stamina meter. The rest the tutorial conveys with messages on the ground, immediately teaching you to read messages left by other players in the game proper. The tutorial section is basically a miniature version of a normal level of the game that doesn’t ever stop you to talk your ear off.Dark Souls even manages to stand out among action RPGs by nailing a unique balance between RPG stat-building and action game skill. It’s not a twitch game at all -- its action combat is rather slower than most games, requiring good timing, patience, and attention to enemy patterns (a lot like old school game but in 3D). As an RPG Dark Souls is about watching equipment stats (your gear is arguably more important than your level in this game), resistances, and a few other base stats, but attaining a high level does not at all negate the need for the aforementioned action game skills. In fact, with the right gear and enormous attention to enemy behavior, it’s possible to beat Dark Souls with a level 1 character.Another part of Dark Souls that feels tough but fair in a somewhat old school way is its level design. It takes many hours to realize it, but Dark Souls is basically a 3D Metroidvania. Its world is just as vertical as it is horizontal, each area containing shortcuts to other areas that show off real ingenuity in the level design. Oftentimes a “checkpoint” in a level is really just the activation of a shortcut you didn’t even know was there.One of my favorite things about Dark Souls though -- what it manages to do that too many games have forgotten, is carry a dark sense of mystery. Its environments make me feel cautious but simultaneously provoke my curiosity. It’s a feeling very akin to dungeon crawlers like Ultima Underworld. From Software manages to accomplish this with a combination of minimalist atmosphere and storytelling along with a pure yet baroque sense of art direction.Dark Souls pretty much constantly surprises you with what you find in each new environment whether that be unique enemies or the environment itself, never really giving you much of any clues as to what you’ll encounter next -- only just enough warning for ever-vigilant players. At the same time paying attention to environments, item descriptions, and NPCs starts to reveal what’s going on in the story as well as some of the game’s lore. Things like this are pretty much the game’s only storytelling devices.Those environments show Dark Souls is a strong case for art over tech in video game graphics. The game runs on a very modest engine that in many ways resembles PS2-era games, but is saved by superb art design in the environments and enemies. It’s all medieval fantasy, but it manages to nail a medieval look and a fantasy look that are more pure than most fantasy. Dark Souls obviously doesn’t pull its looks from other RPGs, but rather straight from actual medieval architecture, clothing, armor design, and fables.Dark Souls isn’t a terribly difficult game to run but unfortunately does require some modding on account the PC port’s rushed development cycle. Unless Durante’s DSfix is applied, the game is locked to 720p and 30 frames per second, and its keyboard controls are absolutely not recommended. Furthermore, your performance is highly dependent on your CPU’s base clock speed. If it’s under 3.0GHz you’re going to have trouble regardless of how many cores or threads you’re running.Dark Souls and its predecessor have gained an intimidating reputation, but if you’re tired of AAA games treating you like an idiot and you want a game that actually let’s you figure out how to play it on your own for a real sense of accomplishment, Dark Souls is just about the best you can do without going down to indie production values.

												Dark Souls is an incredible experience that challenges you in many ways. It can be difficult, but outside of one mid-game boss fight, it never seems ridiculous. Dungeons are extremely well-designed. I have played a lot of RPGs in my life, and this seriously has some of the most interesting, huge, incredible set of crafted dungeons I've ever seen. In addition to this, the game is beautiful, and the boss battles are intense and memorable.For the uninitiated, Dark Souls is a combat-oriented RPG. The world is beautifully designed and rendered. The aesthetic of the game ranges from gorgeous, breath-taking vistas to eerie, haunted locales. The sparse NPCs are laconic, have their own agendas, and come and go despite your desires. There are no random, unimportant NPCs in this game. The world of Dark Souls is dangerous, mysterious, and lost. The game designers leave a lot of details unspoken and allow your imagination to fill in the gaps.That said, this game can be very frustrating. I die a lot. I have fallen off cliffs. I have lost encounters with monsters much stronger than my character. I have been killed by other players repeatedly. I have been poisoned. I have been ambushed.So is it fun? Yeah, I think so. There is something exciting about exploring your way through a booby-trapped fortress that would give Indiana Jones a run for his money. It is rewarding to fight a near invulnerable opponent until you find his weakness, beat him to a pulp, and walk away with his magic ring. It's exciting to truly be worried about what is around the next corner when you've come way too far to go back, but don't want to dare fate and push ahead. It's exciting to sneak through the dark hoping you hear the monsters before the monsters hear you. This game has lifted my spirits and brutally dashed my hopes.I recommend this game to ANYONE, but especially those who like to become fully immersed in their gaming experience. This isn't just a game where you go from start to finish in a linear fashion; this is a universe of its own, with vast landscapes and beautifully crafted worlds and characters and weapons and spells and dialogue and narrative. You could play through this game a thousand times and never have the same experience. Things are constantly evolving, and with such multi-faceted quest-lines, the number of different character builds and tools available to each player, the replay value is HUGE.I really recommend that you visit the Wiki and follow a walkthrough so that you can get the most out of each level; it'll make things a lot less frustrating also. I mean, you'll still die regardless, walkthrough or no walkthrough, and you'll die a lot, but at least you'll know what to expect (kinda).			"

												I was a bit afraid of trying this game because of its reputation of being difficult. After 200+ hours of playing, I think that yes, it's challenging and it will test your patience (first time in Sen's funhouse Fortress) but it's not as difficult as some people make it seem.What I liked:- Melee combat - I usually prefer playing ranged but the melee combat in this game is so fun.- Gameplay - The pace of the game play is on the slower side, and involves a lot of trial and error.  You'll die quickly if you try to play it hack-and-slash style.  The more you die, the more you learn.- Level design - Interconnected areas, hidden areas, shortcuts.  Sen's funhouse :p- Loading screens - Only a few loading screens (when loading your save, when you die and respawn, and when using fast travel).- Skippable cutscenes - Most cutscenes are skippable.- Visuals - It doesn't have the best graphics but some areas look beautiful.- Weapons - There are a lot of weapons in this game, with different movesets for each kind of weapon.- Armor design - This is usually my pet peeve in RPGs. I was surprised that a Japanese game had practical-looking armors, and none of the chainmail bikini or boobplate nonsense in many RPGs.  There are ridiculous-looking armors too but they look ridiculous regardless of the sex of the character wearing them.- Jolly cooperation :DMeh:- The trek from bonfire (spawn point) to boss area felt tedious after dying from the same boss numerous times.- No pause (probably because of multiplayer). Not really a problem outside boss fights because you can just quit the game then load your save afterwards.  During boss fights, if you have to take care of something for a short while, you can't pause so you'll have to repeat from the start.- Lag during invasions (fixed by Alt+F4 :p )Other stuff:- Using a controller is highly recommended- Use DSfix to fix the resolution, remove 30 fps lock, use texture mods, etc.- If you've seen ""Edge of Tomorrow"", that's basically how Dark Souls plays like.

												Short version :One of the best RPG games EVER made, that's coming from a gamer who's played over a hundred RPG titles in his life. Dark Souls - 9.5/10[I myself put in around 400+ hours on my PS3 version until people stopped playing Dark Souls on the PS3, that's when I bought the PC version and the rest is history.]Long Version :Darks Souls..... so much to say about the title. It's not your average day game, that's for sure.The game throws the player in a very difficult world, not just by gameplay standards, but plotwise as well. The narrative is played in such a way that it's never speaking to the player, but rather to your character, it never breaks the 4th wall by directly telling the player what to do and how to do it, only the basic attack move buttons are given to you at the begining, and from then on, you're completely on your own for the rest of the 50+ hour journey. Unless you get a co-op partner or go through some guides on the internet.Dark Souls boasts a great online system that originates from it's spiritual predecessor Demon Souls, one that was revolutionary when it came out. You can invade other people's world, like literally, their own game world, just like they can invade yours, but invasion can only happen on certain circumstances. You can also allow other people to summon you to their world, so you can help them fight tough bosses, or protect them from other players who invaded their world. Dark Souls has covenants, which are ingame clans. Different covenants has different attributes, you can level up your covenant level to get bonuses, abandoning covenants has penalties and make you regret it. Dark Souls' online system is great, but it's connectivity issues are still poor as of today, but it works usually and can give you jolly good fun!The story of the game won't be told to you directly, you won't get cutscenes where NPC's tell you stuff and action scenes occur.... no, that's now how it is. You'll learn the story through character dialogues, item informations, the appearence of an area and boss battles. Yes, boss battles gives you a great deal of story, you learn why their fighting you, aside from demons, no enemy in the game is actually a villian, they're fighting you for their own reasons.Dark Souls in my opinion is technically one of the best games ever made in terms of gameplay. A lot of people say that the gameplay is broken, but if you play it for some time, you'll understand how beautifully crafted it really is. You can perform so many movesets, no other game that I've played has such a thing. To kick, to jump attack, to jump, to parry, backjump, to roll, to attack with your right or left hand, to heavy attack with your right or left hand, to block, to equip your weapon with both hands which changes your attacks and increases damage, to backstab, to use bows, crossbows, magics, apply magical effect on your weapon and many more. So many elements, it's literally the perfect gameplay for me, it feels so real, and so technical. When you defeat a tough enemy or a boss, you feel like the best dude there ever lived, like you've achieved human perfection. That's how satisfying the gameplay really is.It's simply magnificent, totally worth buying, truly worth playing.			"

												- Personal Rating - ""Must own Instant Classic""- Traditional Rating - ""9.5/10""This game... currently sits at my absolute favourite experience this generation and Video Games in general. Dark Souls, storywise is what's considered a minimalistic game in terms of it being a ""Find it Yourself"" and the experience itself hails back to classic games of old in it's design, it drops you in a huge expansive world, where you, as the ""Chosen Undead"" are tasked to braving the world of Lordran to either save or destroy an age.I personally think this is one of the greatest experiences found in any video game ever, and is one that's mostly all about self satisfaction than rewards. The game starts you out at an Asylum as you escape from it, the game immediately drops in a huge boss enemy that you must run away from (at the time being) as the game teaches you how to be cautious and watch out for traps ahead, enemies and ambushes as well as eventually give you the weapons of the class you chose at the Character Creator. What you do with this information here will carry out through the ENTIRE game. As soon as you defeat the Boss and escape the Asylum, your are thrown at a completely new area with no set path to go, you're given a goal - Ring two bells, and that's it, it's up to you to find out why and what for.The game is based around traps and enemy types that will undoubtedly down you the first time around until you figure out their patterns and weaknesses (this also holds true to bosses). There are a multitude of different enemy types around the game that will test your mettle as every enemy encounter feels more like a duel than actual fodder as you are learning them. After you kill an enemy, you collect their ""Souls"" (that save as the game's style of currency) that is used to not only level up, but to buy items, weapons, etc as well - enemies may also drop weapons or armor depending on who they are and how rare the drop may be. The world is also pretty expansive with areas that are highly varied that each tell their own stories and further re-inforces the ""Figure it yourself"" type of story; pretty much every area and detail is important to the story and what is actually going on, from villages, to rotting bridges, to an area mostly populated by dragons, to a fortress filled with death traps to the brim - there's no shortage of level design to be found here, and everything is fully explorable and is encourageable to do so, as you can find the rarer armour or weapons this way - as you make your way to the nearest bonfires (checkpoint system for the game).The leveling system itself is a bit cryptic if anything. What the game won't tell you is that after a certain number is reached per stat (50 generally) those stats stop scaling in very meaningful ways. These stats are essential to building a certain character, similar to an MMO. By leveling up a stat like, Intelligence for example, you'll be building up a Mage, like building up a stat like Strength or Dexterity will most likely build a melee style character. There's no limit to a character you can build which is what kept the community for the game going to this day.As far as the Online Multiplayer goes - this game has one of the most inventive systems in place. If your character is undead, you cannot summon other people (or NPC Phantoms) to help you out in combat and you cannot be invaded. Invasion is, in my opinion, what makes a game like Dark Souls the game it is. Invasion is when another player (and in some cases an NPC) comes into your world sporting a dark red aura (in certain other cases a Dark Blue aura) and attempt to kill you, as well as you can invade another player's world and attempt to kill them to steal their humanity. Humanity is also a key feature for the online portion of the game and the game in general. Humanity is used to revive your character at a bonfire, while ""Human"" is when you can be invaded or invade others, and summon other players or NPCs.There's a bunch more details to this game I could go on and on about, but if you're reading this, you're most likely either looking to continue supporting Dark Souls or buy it. If you haven't bought this game, and you enjoy tough games that reward perseverance, get this game. It sits as my absolute favourite video game this generation for a multitude of reasons, it's a game that harkens back to days of old and it refuses to hold your hand in any way throughout the whole adventure.A+++			"

												Dark Souls, perhaps more than any other game on the market, is preceded by a reputation. From its ultra-imposing, ultra-intimidating bosses, to the alienating community mantra of ""git gud"", to the game's own subtitle of ""Prepare To Die"", the message seems clear: this game is hard, and you're going to die. A lot. The reality is, thankfully, quite a bit more complex than that. While Dark Souls seems destined to make an appearance on nearly every ""most difficult games"" list ever compiled, to place a disproportionate focus on some sort of perceived insatiable sadism is to sell the game far, far short of what it truly has on offer. Consider the whole picture, and it's little surprise that the Souls series has essentially spawned an entirely new subgenre unto its own.At its core, Dark Souls is a game that demands to be respected. Every step you take, every swing of your sword, every swig of life-giving Estus is subject to an assessment of risk. New players quickly learn that while sharp reflexes don't hurt, it's caution, calculation, and preparation that make the difference between ""VICTORY ACHIEVED"" and the infamous ""YOU DIED"". Button-mashing and face-rolling will only see you sent back to the last bonfire, but with a bit of patience and a cool head you'll realize that towering demons and seven-headed serpents aren't quite so scary after all.For as much respect as this game requires of the player, it returns it in kind. Save for a select portion or two of the game where it seems to momentarily forget that it's not actually part of the Uncharted series, fights are fair and frustration is shockingly minimal. While I won't go so far as to suggest that ""no death is ever the game's fault"", I will say that this game emanates a general ethos of measured punishment. Believe it or not, Dark Souls honestly does want you to succeed. It goes to great lengths to ensure that with enough observation, adaptation, and perseverance you will always have at your disposal every tool necessary to do so, even when your situation initially looks hopeless.In addition to its punishing-yet-rewarding gameplay, there really is a lot to love about Dark Souls. For a game of few conversations and fewer cutscenes, its lore is surprisingly deep. While some exposition does exist as a more direct means of world-building, much of it must be pieced together through a combination of lore-bearing items and reasonable inferences made about the world around you. Much of the game follows a similar philosophy of content delivery, where there is always something new for particularly-astute players to discover. To this point, the game is perfectly content to allow even entire portions of the game world to be passed right by if a player doesn't happen to stumble upon them by chance (or by wiki).Level design (for as much as ""levels"" exist at all in this game) is another area in which Dark Souls stands head-and-shoulders above the competition. Whereas many games seem to be satisfied with horizontal expanses of isolated chunks of content, Dark Souls has crafted an intricately-interconnected and startlingly-vertical world. During the course of my own playthrough, it was not uncommon for me to be suddenly taken aback at the realization that the passage I had just discovered had opened up an alternative route back to a previously-visited location, often in a surprising and pleasantly unexpected way.Enemy design is varied and interesting. Few games have so effectively inspired within me such a mixture of wonder, awe, and intimidation as this game has with its enemies, especially with its area bosses. Combine this with the fact that each boss has its own dedicated (and often hauntingly-beautiful) audio track playing in the background as you take them on, and boss fights tend to be as mesmerizing as they are terrifying.The way that Dark Souls implements its multiplayer is particularly interesting. Rather than a discrete mode of play, multiplayer is integrated directly into the core game. Players broadcast messages to the greater community by placing them into the environment, like graffiti on a wall. Through certain actions, with the aid of specific items, a player may even find themselves directly crossing paths with other players themselves (for better, or for worse), without even leaving their own play session. As far as I'm aware, all of this is (or at least was at one point) completely unique to Dark Souls.Now, because I feel as though I've done nothing but gush about this game since my fingers hit the keyboard, I must note that there are, of course, flaws. As I mentioned, there are a few encounters in this game that feel rushed and cheap, and some that feel as though they would be more at home in a ""high-octane"" action-adventure game. A number of enemies are obvious near-carbon copies of one another with differing coats of paint. Some latter segments of the game suffer from level design that just doesn't stand up to what you've come to expect of it by those points. While the game's systems are generally refreshingly hands-off with regards to mechanical indoctrination, they can at times feel unnecessarily opaque, to the point where you'll be tempted to keep your web browser open to the Dark Souls wiki in the background while you play.Finally, because no Dark Souls PC review would be complete without this mention, some light third-party modding is borderline-necessary here. The ubiquitous DSFix is such for a reason, as the game constitutes a pretty lackluster PC port. Frame rate improvements, a wider array of video resolutions, and a number of other graphical and performance-related options are likely to add immensely to one's enjoyment of this fantastic game.What else can I say about this game? What else has already been said a thousand times over? If this game sounds at all intriguing to you, especially if you're somebody who has shied away due to its menacing persona, I'd urge you to try it anyway. With a bit of ""can do"" attitude, you may surprise yourself at your ability to push through a steep learning curve to uncover an experience that makes you feel rewarded in ways that most other games seem almost afraid to do. Play this game, and you may find that most other games just don't quite do it for you anymore.If you've found yourself on-the-fence about purchasing, give Dark Souls a fair shot - believe it or not, it'll do the same for you.To anybody who enjoyed this review, consider checking out the following commentary video by Matthewmatosis. It's six-and-a-half hours long, but I found it quite informative and insightful, and it inspired my own review pretty heavily. If you're a big Dark Souls fan like myself, you might find it time well-spent.

												Dark Souls is an action role playing game, developed by FromSoftware and published by Namco Bandai Games, releasing in 2011 on the console market, and 2012 on the PC.  This is the second game in the “Souls” series, the original game “Demon’s Souls” was never released on the PC format.  The series is set in a dark fantasy universe. Game play in Dark Souls is something which a lot of people will have seen from online memes and articles depicting it as an extremely hard game to play.  Whilst this is true, the game’s difficulty is also fair at the same time, with the game relying primarily on the player’s skill, rather than how they are geared and what level they are.  At the start of the game you get your character creation segment, you can go as in depth or as basic into this as you like – choosing options such as sex, appearance, name and class.  You play the game in a third person perspective, you have access to tons of different weapons, and each has their own unique style and even their own attack animation to add to the variety.  Weapons require a certain amount of skill points in certain areas, which can be improved by levelling up your character through collecting Souls; this is the game’s currency system as well as experience points.  The combat system in Dark Souls is one of the game’s most positive features, with system that is easy to grasp, but pretty hard to become a master of. With a lot of enemies having different attack routines, you are never quite sure how you should react, should you dodge this attack? Should I parry this attack? Am I just outright dead? Dark Souls has a huge learning curve and as you may probably already know, you will die….a lot. Graphically, Dark Souls upon released looked like your typical PS3 release. By today’s standards it would be considered very dated.  Thankfully with the game being on PC, we have options to a plethora of mods which increase the visual appearance of the game ten-fold. If you aren’t a fan of modding games, then the graphical side of Dark Souls may be something which puts you off a little, with low quality textures, and an even worse resolution cap in place.  With mods not only can you make the game look beautiful, but you can crank the resolution up as high as you want, as well as increasing the frame rate to 60 fps.  Dark Souls has some really good sound tracks too, and whilst the game has voice acting of the majority of characters; something just doesn’t sound right about them. Whether that is the style the developers were going for to make it seem very eerie; I am not sure, but there is something very different about the voice acting in Dark Souls. The game is essentially an open world playground to adventure in. There are no loading screens, or “levels”. If you have the balls, you can actually go where ever you want from the very start of the game, that’s one of the games really difficult parts – making the player work out for themselves on where they need to go in the right order. Throughout the world you will encounter tons of different enemies, equipment vendors, and loot. The game feels very vast in the amount of content there is to see with plenty of paths to take you off your main route. As you can see from my play time on Dark Souls, 73 hours is a lot. In fact that is probably about 1 and a half play throughs of the game. Your first play through Souls will probably take you about 30+ hours, depending on how you are with the combat system. Beating this game is no easy feat, and when you finish it, you will have a real sense of achievement because not many people have done so.  Achievement hunters amongst us will also have a huge task on hand, with an estimated 130 hours needed to complete this game fully. There is also a large amount of replay ability factored into Dark Souls.  You can simply start the game again with a different class and have a whole new experience, as the tactics you used to beat bosses last time will no longer be viable depending on your class. Technically, on PC Dark Souls released in a poor state; thankfully with the help of mods all of these issues were able to be fixed. First of all, don’t even attempt to play this game with keyboard and mouse that will really take the difficulty level to all new heights. The most important mod you will need to make Dark Souls playable on PC is DSFix which can be downloaded here - http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19/? – The mod is very easy to install and configure, and there are plenty of tutorials on YouTube that will help you get the absolute most out of this mod. Dark Souls is a real test of a gamer’s skill and patience. It is difficult, but fair at the same time. If you want to test yourself on one of the most difficult action games out there, Dark Souls will be for you. I had so much fun playing through this game and am thoroughly proud of myself for actually managing to beat it.  If you want the full experience of struggle, try the game without the use of wikis or guides! Dark Souls will not be for everyone, and that is fine, but I strongly urge anyone who even has a passing interest in the action RPG genre to attempt to beat this game.  The game’s regular retail price on Steam is £19, 99 – whilst this is still pretty high for a game that was released in 2012, you are getting a monster of a title.  Sale season has been known to bring Dark Souls down to less than £5 though.

												Dark Souls has a reputation for difficulty. Git gud, they say. But it's not that Dark Souls is necessarily difficult, more that it has a steep learning curve. It can be intimidating for newcomers, as it was for me when I first played it. I got as far as Gaping Dragon and hit what I thought was a brick wall. So I shelved it for nearly two years.With the release of Dark Souls 3, I thought I needed to give the original another chance. Boy, am I glad that I did. This time I had encouragement, and some determination. Again I struggled at the beginning, ""f*ck this game!"" being uttered on more than one occasion. But then it suddenly clicked. I don't know what it was, perhaps I genuinely started to get better at the game, perhaps I upgraded my first weapon, but I know that by the time I encountered Gaping Dragon again, I knew - this time - that I would succeed. First attempt. Fist pump! That feeling when you beat something you'd considered a massive difficulty spike, there's nothing quite like it, and Dark Souls serves them up on a regular basis. It gives you such a sense of achievement, it's like a drug.But it's not all about combat. Dark Souls rewards exploration. Not just with trinkets, but with real, tangible benefits. Those ""holy crap, I can't believe I just found this awesome thing!"" kind of benefits. It's a remarkable game, the level design is inspired (ok, there are a couple of exceptions late in the game which seemed a little ""tacked on""), the enemy and particularly boss design is excellent, and it grabbed me so hard I could think of little else for the few weeks I was playing it.Absolutely grab dsfix, which improves the textures dramatically and improves the feel of the game unquestionably at 60 fps. It's easy to implement. And don't be afraid to ask people for help, it's almost a requirement, that sense of community encouragement in overcoming the challenges you face. Even now (May 2016) there's still plenty of multiplayer activity, people willing to help, messages to guide you, and the occasional invader to challenge you. It just feels right.Gush, gush, gush, yes I know, but I don't care because Dark Souls really is that good... once it grabs you.What? Oh. Yeah, ok. I should, shouldn't I? Ok, just because it's you, Dark Souls...Praise the Sun! \[T]/			"

												For the past year or two, gaming lost it's touch to me. I found myself starting up games, and getting bored within 10 minutes, even new games I just recently purchased, I thought the gaming phase of my life was over at 20 years old. But still, I continued that search for a game that would spark that feeling I had when I was 14. The feeling of deep immersion, losing myself within the game, wanting to find out more, and improve myself. Then, this game happpened.I heard about Dark Souls first about 1 year ago, mid 2015. Nothing about it seemed interesting to me, I heard it was incredibly hard, the story was confusing, and I felt like gaming was past me. So about 6 months pass, and I hear about the hype of Dark Souls 3, something about this series now seems intriguing, I still pass it off as something I'm not going to ever play though. Then it comes out, I see all these youtube videos about it, people going crazy about how amazing it is... alright I've got to at least try one of these games, where do I start?$60 for a game I don't even think I will like? No thanks. Alright lets see number two, $55 for a game I'm not sure about? No thanks, once again. Ah, lets check the first. After a few minutes of pondering, I decide f**k it, I'm buying it, and here starts my journey.I'm new, I don't know what the hell is going on, but this game, something about it, every time I die, I want to go further, figure out how to fix what I did wrong last. It's not Skyrim, it's not some boring repetive game, it's just... different, nothing like I've ever experienced. Then after a while, a few hours past, wait what? I'm actually... getting into a game again, I want to play more. I want to improve my character so I can kill that Black Knight and get whatever is behind him, I want to finally find a new cool piece of armour, I want to figure out what the f**k is actually happening in this world and where the story is going.This, is a f**king game done right. Just buy it, try it out, you wont regret it. Ignore all the ♥♥♥♥ about people saying it's insanely difficult scaring you away, that is exactly what makes this game fun. It's a breath of fresh air to me, I'm only 5 hours in, and can't wait to keep playing the rest of this series.			"

												Dark Souls is the great misunderstood game of this generation. There’s a wildly prevalent belief the game’s extremely hard. People presume the developers, From Software, sat down and looked at the history of videogames, cherry-picking specific titles to place in their drawer of inspiration, only to cause perspiration for others. Ghosts ‘n’ Goblins and Battletoads would likely be in there. In there so the devs can look at them and exceed those levels of difficulty and cruelty and position their game to be harder than, well, than anything you have ever played before. This just isn’t the case. It’s just misunderstood. You see, dieing hundreds and thousands of times as you make your way from the relative comfort of Firelink Shrine through Darkroot Garden and onto Blighttown is part of the game mechanics, part of the game design and the basis of the learning curve. You move a few feet, meet a foe and are vanquished in the fleeting moments between letting loose a flash of your heavy blade and the connection of their harder and faster attack with your torso. You try again, make your way back to the location of your vanquishing and collect the souls you had before that failure, this time with a little more awareness of what is about to befall you. You think to yourself a quick attack might be the better option, or maybe a long-range effort if so endowed. You’ve learned what not to do. Now you teach yourself what to do. It probably still isn’t enough. A third, fourth, thirtieth time and you eventually get past that particular villainous creature. Each time you died you were that little bit wiser, that little bit stronger. Regardless of it all the compulsion to continue was unbearable. There was no stopping, no waiting. Just the desperate need to keep on trying, learning and eventually succeeding. It was incredibly hard work and around the corner there’s more to do, different baddies to beat and extra secrets to uncover. You have no idea if you’re going in the right direction, the wrong direction or even in a direction you have no right going until tens of levels stronger. The compulsion is there though. It’s not a hard game, see, it’s just a game with a deep, long-lasting and incredibly compulsive mechanic with death part of the process, rather than the end as in the majority of titles today. Dark Souls is essentially a third-person Elder Scrolls game for the self-hating. Like Bethesda's masterful series, Dark Souls offers you a fantasy tale with dragons and other mythical creatures to meet, classes to choose from, factions to join, magical spells to learn, a huge world to explore, and a bunch of awesome medieval gear to find. But unlike the Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls doesn't reward your failures with generous helpings of EXP and leveled-up abilities, and its combat is nuanced and unforgiving. Dark Souls kills you over and over, and then punishes you for dying. If you want to make the game a little easier, grind to improve your character. If you don't like it, go play Skyrim with all the other wimps.At its core, Dark Souls is a game about animations. You need to keep a close eye on what your enemies are up to, and you need to remember that every button you press commits your character to a full motion. If you begin an attack animation after an enemy starts swinging at you, you'll probably get hit. If you want to take a swig from your health flask, you need to know that your character will take his sweet time, leaving himself vulnerable. And when you get knocked down, your character won't scramble back to his feet; he'll lie there for a second, just tempting bad guys to move in.You need to take each enemy type, dissect their patterns, and figure out what works through trial and error. It might be as simple as blocking, strafing, and attacking when you get the chance. Or, you might need to deflect their blows to stagger them, or somersault away to avoid a powerful blow your shield can't handle, or use a certain type of magic. You're prevented from button-mashing by your stamina meter, which is not particularly generous unless you pour a lot of effort into leveling it up. The upside: When you finally get a hard part right, you feel… well, not good so much, but relieved.Of course, there's more to an action-RPG than just the action. Killing enemies earns you souls, which you can spend (if you don't lose them first) to improve your many attributes—and RPG progression is the only way to make this game less difficult. You'll want to find and improve the best weapons and armor. You also earn a resource called ""humanity,"" which makes you a little less undead, allows you to return to your human form, and offers a variety of other perks, such as the ability to ""kindle"" a bonfire. (Bonfires are this game's checkpoints, and they refill your health flask; kindling the fire doubles the amount of health the bonfire gives you.)The visuals are well-crafted, for the most part. Dark Souls offers impressive environments, detailed and frightening enemies, and fluid animations. The creepy music and decent voice acting add to the atmosphere, too.As for the controls, they're easy to get used to, but you'll definitely want a controller. There is a default keyboard configuration, but it's incredibly clumsy, and the developers don't even pretend there's a chance you might use it—all the on-screen instructions pertain to the gamepad. (No, you don't ""Press A"" to pick up items when you're using a WASD movement setup.)There's ten hours of new content in the ""Prepare to Die Edition"" as well, making it the definitive version of Dark Souls There's a new chapter of the story, including fresh areas, bosses, enemies, and NPCs. As I said above, most players probably won't finish the game—which was up to 100 hours long to begin with—so it's not that big of a deal that this version has more of it. But if you're a hardcore Dark Souls fan, or if you're confident in your ability to wring every last cent of value out of the game, the Prepare to Die Edition is the way to go.A Must Play "

Dark souls...whew, I just finished, and I'm ready for a review now.I was one of those people who knew that Dark Souls was supposed to be a pretty hard game and that was it, until the DS3 hype came in. I tried a friends' DS3 and I loved it, however I felt that something was missing, I felt I was missing much of the rich ""Dark Souls"" culture. So I said thanks a lot for letting me play DS3, and bought the DS1. Best, idea, ever.GraphicallyFor some reason I did not expect much for all being ""old game"" & stuff of the like, however I was a quite surprised at how beautiful the environments looked, if you like looking around at the panoramas like I do, oh you're in for a treat. I loved the style. But then I wondered if it could get better anyway, well it can! With DSFix (mod) + HD textures mod it will make your retina soothe a lil bit while playing. Game mechanicsIf this game is thought to be pretty hard, it is because you have to actually ""git gud"" as they say. Getting used to the hitboxes, judge where should you roll to, understand how to choose your setup, analize the boss and see what is the best approach, etc. That takes time, in fact, that is pretty much the hard part. As you progress, you will find (or at least I did) that the TRUE empowering comes from all those tricks and tips in your Dark Souls journey, not so much from leveling up your character or your weapons. So what really makes you stronger is not the +15 weapon you'll be holding at some point, but knowledge (but the +15 weapon helps a bit anyway).Curiosity winsI thought this was quite interesting. Sometimes perhaps one is way too linear, making it so that you might be focusing on being able to handle gracefully your inevitable thousands of deaths, and overcome the impression of some scenarios, monsters, bosses, clinging to the last second as to safeguard your hard earned souls. However, this game WILL punish you for being linear, apart from being vigilant for your health, you need to be able to have a keen eye for secrets and items lying around. You have to be curious and say ""Oh, look, a freaking dark hallway! Probably there will be a thousand monsters but perhaps I find something!"" and so you may...The item descriptions, the tricky environment taking advantage of your camera angles, illusion magic, and what not. You need to make Dora the Explorer be freaking proud of you here, else you might lose tons and I mean TONS of items, upgrades, CONTENT! Not all the content is there for you to gobble at plain sight. Also, if you are getting your gluteus maximus handed over to you, you're probably not where you are supposed to be yet (according to your strength) however, you can technically access almost all the main areas from the start, if you discover how...This game comes from a console, is it good for PC?To be honest, the thought of using a mouse and a keyboard for this game was discarded after the first 60 seconds. If you plan on getting this game, I STRONGLY recommend to use a controller. There are some bosses/monsters there that I seriously doubt that you will have a nice time with M&K instead of a controller. So if you don't have one, you might want to have that in mind. Stress factorI believe this is a game far more enjoyable for those able to keep a serene focus on everything that needs attending. If your ragemeter fills up fairly quickly, this is not for you. If you are expecting greenlands and rainbows, this is not for you. If you tend to be rapidly stressed by demanding situations, this is not for you. You should not suffer over a game either for a hype or because your want the achievements, or who knows why, only enjoy. Those with a serene focus will be able to adapt better their responses to the always-changing situations that the game will place you in. LoreAs of today, you are probably used to quest markers everywhere, a minimap, perhaps a little dot trail for you to follow. Well, this game has none of that, you are thrown out of the blue, with a few character control indications and it is expected of you to figure everything else. Everything. This not only includes how the game works, but what the hell is actually going on. The background story is not spoon-fed to you as you go here and there, you have to fusion your archaeology and anthropology skills. Collecting here and there some items, reading descriptions, very very carefully listening to what the few NPCs might have to say about anything, oh yes, that is of outmost importance, if anyone (or anything) opens their mouth to say anything to you (which they won't except for one because they use like telepathy or something) pay special attention to every syllable.MultiplayerIs this game dead? No, to my surprise. I actually bought it with the hopes of having buddies from around the world to come and join me in my treks. Well, actually this was my first and perhaps my biggest negative experience, you will find that some people just simply want to see the world burn and will on purpose try to wreck your experience, so you have to be smart. Not just with a message saying ""Jump here"" where you'll fall to your death, no, that is actually part of the fun of the game, I don't enjoy tricking people, but sometimes it make me chuckle when I saw the blood spots near one of those or saying ""Oh hell no I'm not dumb man!"" after reading it, etc. No what I mean, is people using cheats or the ""namebug"" just to get your game to crash, I was so excited when I saw the first summon sign ever, and when I activated it, my game crashed, and I was terrified it might have corrupted my save or something. Which is why I recommend to setup the watchdogs and the DSCM mods, which will boost up positively your multiplayer experience. Be wary of those invaders *chuckle*! I dislike PvP, so I can't really say I had much success at invading as to provide you with accurate experience on how balanced the matches were, etc. (must git moar gud). However along your way you'll find not a few phantoms ready to help you (humans or NPCs alike).   My experienceThis game was absolutely overwhelming for me. I fell in love. The level design (expect for Blighttown, god I hated that, and you will too, you will too...), the music, the bosses, the armor designs, the not-so-obvious storyline, the not-so-obvious mechanics, everything. This game has taught me what distrust is though, but I sort of liked that, made it fun, I would never open anything before hitting it (you will find out why), randomly hitting walls (you will find out why), watch my back from times to times, etc. And while this world is certainly an unforgiving, blackned, eerie, devastated, hell, there are times when it will make you smile and laugh. When I finally got to the last boss and managed to beat him in my, like, 7th try, I was shaking. It has been long since I deeply enjoyed such a masterpiece.Now I have to wait until DS3 is way more affordable, sometime in the future...Time to hop on to DS2 while that happens.If you plan on buying it, just remember: patience, curiosity, and serenity.Praise the sun! :D			"

Dark Souls changed me, as a player and as a person. But changed me a lot more as a gamer. I want to review this masterpiece but I'm afraid mere words won't do it justice.Dark Souls is an RPG based on a world where humanity lost the right to a final rest, as they become undead when death is upon every and each player to adventure itself out of the Asylum.There are plenty of information about the lore and such around the web, but I still feel the need to say that each story has a side, and between legends and fables, it's up to the player to uncover the truth... But what truth can be found, if not within our selves? This is the perspective that I have, and I'ts remarkable that to each, their own. Each player must accomplish his own journey to his own path and conclusion. Dark Souls is an open game, not only in design, but in the path's of the lore, where there are plenty of clues and perspectives to guess upon.Even with such rich detail and character personality, it's very unique the way you'll enjoy them, therefore I must focus on something that everyone share as common belief; The amazing level design, worthy of genius appraisal.The areas, from Undead Burg - a city collapsed by despair and plague, to Darkroot Garden - a fearful and mysterious woods, to even the glorious Anor Londo - A beautiful large city covered by the incandescent sun. Among many other's where the design remains bound to a rule of commitment: All areas must be connected, and they generally are through a well placed shortcut.All levels look like a new challenge, but they end up making a certain sense where the player can only admire how well done they are. Such a logical and practical path makes advances in the game so much fun and entertaining.Each area is covered with a atmosphere that marks the player, and it marked me in ways I can't entirely describe... It's an overwhelming feeling acquired by the details of light, flora, and even sounds.As everything above wasn't enough, we have another well common appreciation; the gameplay.Dark Souls is in my opinion, the game with the best character movement of all times. I know it's pretty arrogant to claim this, but I never experienced anything so complete, so responsive, so detailed, so so good. Of course, there are issues at times, but this is a game after all, it's not a science. Dark Souls is an abstract game when comes to in-game beliefs and theories, but it's almost pure science when moving and fighting. The controls feel natural and extremely responsive.Attacking, blocking, parrying, casting magic, everything makes me feel so special... even more when enemies are down.Anyone that enjoys defeating Boss's will love Dark Souls, and those who don't will start to!The game being hard isn't a lie, it's tough, but I found it to be more obtuse when come to use specific items. I believe this is no issue, as old games use to be like this, especially a game made for consoles where players use a controller. It's not an issue to me like I stated.Using the correct set up and leveling up on the right attributes can make you extremely strong and break the game, but even so, I found this to be the real challenge.Enemies are vast and committed to making you suffer, but this brings me to another important thing that make Dark Souls one of the best games ever... The community. I never in my life experienced such a strong, loyal and helpful community, like the Dark Souls fans. It's impressive, how steam forums are filled with such kind users and ready to help everyone. This to me is fascinating, because I don't think Dark Souls can be hard anymore, not when there are members dedicated to help and assist others. Marvelous!To end, I must say Dark Souls really changed me, it made me earn resistance, patience and made me respect my foes, but mostly, my own problems and life struggles. I made friends which I still talk to, and overall I feel I earn so much from this game... I can't stress enough how Dark Souls really are one of my favorite games of all times.Thank you From Software,and thank you, everyone that helped me improve in this fantastic game, and teach me the ways of the sun!

												Dark Souls is a relaxing indie puzzle game where you play as the last of the Casuls, on your quest to attend the king's birthday party. On the way you'll make new friends, drink a lot of whiskey, risk liver failure and even celebrate obesity through the lost art of cosplay. Not suitable for children over the age of 18.			"

												It's no secret that Dark Souls has become an emblematic symbol of the whole separate genre — brutal, distressful dungeon crawler with tricky challenges, gloomy setting, and unusual narrative form. The blurred contours of the new gold standard in dark fantasy RPG began to take its shape starting with the King's Field series and its spiritual successor — Demon's Souls. But the final master image was formed precisely after releasing Dark Souls.Beware! All things in this game can kill you. Even cute little mushrooms strive to gather in a flock to tore you apart. All the environments are deadly — danger is everywhere. It arises from the darkness, lurks in the muddy water under the feet, descends from the ceiling behind you, oozes into your consciousness. Despite the grim and dismal ambience, the game gives an unforgettable feeling of the immense triumph after each of your victories. It transfers you to an awesome, mysterious and fearsome wandering you'll never forget. If you do decide to play Dark Souls, prepare to die. And may the Black Knight Halberd be with you!			"

												I have to admit that I avoided Dark Souls for an unhealthy amount of time. Rarely playing games above the normal difficulty, the appeal of it being a really hard and unforgiving game wasn't the most compelling. I'm glad I changed my mind though, because I may have had missed out on a game I now consider one of the best of the decade.The gameplay is fun and engaging. The art, hauntingly beautiful and original. The soundtrack, breathtaking. But what really makes Dark Souls a masterpiece, by perfectly uniting all its elements, is the world of Lordran. Its cohesive design made me question every videogame world I'd experienced up to that point. From the wastes below the very backbone of the land up to the very top of the tallest tower of the tallest castle, the world's vertical and intrinsic design never fails to maintain its authenticity and unimpaired flow. After transversing the map not too many times, I could - and still can, months after actively playing the game - definitely draw a convincing transcription of it, with all its shortcuts and intersections. In a journey through Lordram, rarely does it feel like an area is forgettable or unused.Dark Souls has no narrative. There are no quests, maps, or journals. What it has is the world of Lordran. The story is presented to the player through unusual elements. Item descriptions. NPCs - that have their own agenda. And most importantly, through the other main elements of the game: music, visuals, gameplay. You are never given a codex or anything like what most RPGs have. You have to pay attention and intentionally pursue the story elements to make any sense out of it. Or you can ignore that and go slay a wide array of creatures and superbly designed bosses - it's just as fun. As is taking part in the clever and unique co-op and PvP elements. To top it all off, the atmosphere through most of the game is unmatched. But that comes as no surprise after praising the world and its cohesiveness for so long.A must-play if I've ever seen one, Dark Souls is as a fresh experience as it is a throwback to a kind of fun recent videogames seemed to have forgotten.

												Dark Souls: Prepare To Dye Edition is the latest installment in a series of family games by critically acclaimed developer From Software. In it, you take on the role of a young Italian painter by the name of Adriano Abato, on his quest to restore color to the world and solve the mystery of why it was lost to begin with. Adriano is joined by his talking pet dog, Francesco, who brings some much needed levity to their journey with his many hilarious puns. Francesco has more to offer than just his sense of humor, however, and his tail doubles as a magical paintbrush to help Adriano return color to the world.Gameplay (8/10)The goal of the game is to obtain colors and then use them to return color to a monochrome world with your paintbrush. The more of the world that is restored this way, the closer to solving the mystery Adriano gets. While it is not necessary to repaint 100% of the world, there is a special secret in store for players with the patience and dedication to do so.The gameplay is split into four phases. In the first phase, Adriano and Francesco must travel to an area that has lost its colors. It's up to the player to decide where to go first, but some locations have a higher difficulty level than others. Decide for yourself what you feel capable of, but try to challenge your creative spirit!In the second phase, Adriano must find the Three Prime Colors of the area in question and convince them to aid him in restoring color to their surroundings. The three different Colors are Yellow, Blue and Red. Yellows will usually aid Adriano willingly because of their desire to return color to the sun, but in some cases Adriano will have to solve a riddle or prove himself first. Blues can be troublesome, particularly if Adriano hasn't restored a lot of churches yet. In most cases they will give Adriano a puzzle to solve, the difficulty of which depends on how much of the world's color has already been restored. The most troublesome Color by far is Red. The Reds will often say mean-spirited things to poor Adriano and try to ruin his paintings. They can be difficult to deal with, but with a bit of cunning and a hysterical joke from Francesco, Adriano will eventually be able to prevail.In the third phase, Adriano has to apply these colors to the canvas that is the monochrome world. Here, accuracy, speed and the number of colors collected is important. If Adriano gets careless he might not be able to properly restore color to the world, and if he is too slow the Colors might get impatient and escape again.The fourth phase is only unlocked after Adriano has restored a sufficient amount of the world's color. I won't spoil the details of this phase, but it's quite intense!There is also a competitive multiplayer mode for up to four players where you compete to color a monochrome landscape as fast and as accurately as possible. There are some connectivity issues on the PC version, but with a bit of patience it shouldn't be hard to gather players for some creative painting fun.I give this game an 8/10 for the gameplay, which is both fun and addictive. The competitive multiplayer mode is particularly riveting, and many an evening was swallowed up in endless sessions of painting masterpieces with my fellow art enthusiasts from all over the world.Story (7/10)Prepare to Dye does not have a very complex storyline, but it doesn't need one, either. It's a family game for casual painting fun, and the plot reflects this. It's simple enough that a child can grasp it, but even adults will appreciate the tale of Adriano in the monochrome world. The twist at the end will also likely surprise most players, even if there are some clues to this twist scattered throughout the game. This is only obvious in retrospect, however.I give the story a 7/10, because while the story is not particularly advanced it does get the job done. It suits the game, and does not get too ambitious or take itself too seriously. It's a story anyone can jump into and enjoy.Characters (6/10)The primary characters are Adriano and Francesco. Adriano is a cheerful young artist with a knack for making those around him smile. His optimistic and carefree nature allowed him to avoid the influence of the monochrome world, and he now wants to restore color to the rest of the world. Francesco, his talking dog, is similar to his owner in many ways, but has a knack for clever wordplay that sometimes goes over Adriano's head. Nonetheless, the player won't be able to stop laughing at his wonderful jokes.The personalities of the Colors are not particularly complicated, and are mostly covered in the section about gameplay above. There are certain characters later in the game worth mentioning, but spoiling the nature of these characters would not be fair to would-be players.While the characters are quite endearing, I can't give this section more than 6/10. There is little in the way of character development, and there isn't a lot of character variation.Controls: (4/10)Dark Souls: Prepare To Dye Edition was ported from the Nintendo Wii to PC, and as a port it does have some issues. The original game relied heavily on the Wiimote's motion control for the painting parts of the game, and this was only awkwardly replaced with a system using the mouse and keyboard on PC.It's difficult to play the game as intended on PC, and many blame the rushed release of the PC version for this. There are mods to fix the controls, but, despite this, I can't really give the game more than a 4/10 for the controls as they are by default. While the developers did have a difficult job porting a motion control game to the PC, they should have taken their time to properly implement the controls, rather than rushing the port like they did.Graphics (7/10)As I already mentioned, the game was ported from the Nintendo Wii, and the port is less than ideal. This can also be seen in the graphics, as the game doesn't support resolutions a PC player would consider acceptable. While this too can be fixed with mods, it should still be considered a problem with the port.Resolutions aside, the game itself is absolutely gorgeous. The haunting and simplistic beauty of the monochrome world is only surpassed by the gorgeous and vibrant landscapes that result from restoring color to the world. While the designs of the characters are significantly more simplistic by comparison, they suit the overall atmosphere of the game. In many ways they resemble characters from a children's picture book.Despite the issues with resolutions, I give the graphics a 7/10. The low resolution makes the game seem significantly older than it is, but even with this handicap the game looks gorgeous. With mods it might be one of the most beautiful titles on Steam.Sound (8/10)From Software is well known for its upbeat and catchy tunes, and Prepare to Dye is certainly no exception to this rule. In the monochrome world, the music is somber, but as color is restored to the world, the music grows livelier and more colorful as well. Once color is fully restored, the music gives you a happy sense of accomplishment. It's like an auditory representation of the canvas Adriano restored to life.The voice acting is a bit cheesy, however. The stereotypical Italian accents of Adriano and Francesco get more endearing once you get used to it, but the fact that the Colors and the other NPCs have standard American accents is a bit off-putting.That said, the voice acting can't pull down the overall sound score too much, as dialogue is not very important in Prepare to Dye. The music speaks more for the game than the voices do, and so I give the game an 8/10 for sound.Conclusion (7/10)Overall I give this game a 7/10. While it has many issues, it's a gorgeous classic made by a beloved game developer. I highly recommend giving it a try if you enjoy painting and art in general.			"

												Dark Souls is easily one of the best games I’ve ever played. Although advertised as a game for “masochists only”, I believe anyone can enjoy this game once they gain a good understanding of how the game works. It doesn’t hold your hand, it doesn’t give you many breaks, and it tries to punish you in every way possible. But pushing through the difficulty is well worth it, trust me. Underneath all the pain is a great and engaging game, that relies on good awareness, and patience above all else.The fantasy setting is one of a kind, rich with history and characters that made me feel part of the world. From very early on, I wanted to discover everything and travel everywhere. I always had choices of where I went, and what I wanted to do. Whether it be farming for weapons/souls/crafting materials, or continuing with the normal progression.The multiplayer of Dark Souls is perhaps one of the most interesting parts of the game. Relying on temporarily working with or against other players for short periods of time. Your single player adventure could be interrupted by an invading player, or aided by a friendly player at almost any point. It makes things particularly exciting as you never know what to expect. With comparison to the sequel games in the Dark Souls series, this first game is much less user friendly in terms of fast travelling, inventory management, and general multiplayer features, but it’s still a solid foundation from which the next games were able to grow from.Overall there isn’t much I can complain about Dark Souls. It’s a game I will always come back to because it’s just that good. Don’t be put off by the difficulty because once you know how to overcome it, I promise you’ll fall in love with this game.			"

												Don't let the game's sub-title scare you away. This is a very fun and most importantly fair game with great combat and exploration. Yes, the port sucks, but with mods like PvP Watchdog, Wulf's Dark Souls Connectivity Mod (DSCM), and DSFix, the game looks great and plays even better. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys RPGs with no player handholding.Edit: I would like to refer anyone who wants to get started with those mods I mentioned to this guide:

												Dark Souls is a hard game at first. It's oppresive, it's relentless, it's punishing and it won't hold your hand. You will be confused, and you WILL die. So prepare to die.Yet, as you progress through the game, you'll get the hang of it. After dying time and time again you'll learn how to tell if an enemy is going to attack you and how powerful that attack will be. You'll learn faster routes to get to your objective. And you'll learn to detach yourself from the souls you get. You WILL lose them. The point isn't to constantly grind - the point is to learn. And while a couple hundreds souls will be an awful lot during early game, by the end you can farm tens thousands of them in a couple of minutes.Take your time, be patient. It's mostly about the journey, and the elation you'll feel when overcoming the obstacles - the insurmountable odds against you, the unbreakable barrier. You'll die and then you'll learn and then you will achieve victory.So Praise the Sun!			"

												Let me tell you something you already know. This game ain't no sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. Not you, me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as Dark Souls. But it ain't about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can GET hit and keep moving forward, how much you can TAKE and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done, but you gotta be willing to take the hits and not pointing fingers saying ""I can't beat this game because of Gargoyles, Capra Demon or anybody! Cowards fo that and that ain't you!Now go beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game.			"

												Once I was in Kansas City and stopped in at a restaurant called The Hereford House.  I ordered a steak.  It was 24 ounces and about 3 inches thick.  It was perfectly cooked...somehow not bloody and not over done.  It was perfectly marbled.  It was absolutely delicious.If video games were steaks, then Dark Souls would be the one I described above.Even after all the years and all the newer (not better) souls games, and all the immitators, there's nothing like the original Dark Souls.  It lets you choose different paths of advancement and each path is - maybe not equally powerful - but equally viable.  There are many ways to kill the bosses.  Any of them which result in a dead boss is the correct way.  And it is very satisfying to play one of the hardest games ever made and still find new and different ways to make it look easy.Its not going to be easy your first play through.  Don't care who you are or how many games you've played.  But after the 5th time you've done it all, you'll start to understand what mistakes to avoid.  And you still won't be bored fighting the same bosses you've fought at least 5 (and probably more like 20) times before.Pros:  It's really a unique game which pits you against tough bosses and even random trash mobs that can ruin your day if you aren't on your game.Cons: I can't really think of any except to say that the console port is a console port.  You really must use a controller.  Yeah, you can configure mouse and keyboard... but use a controller if you don't want to hate life and burn your own house down in frustration.Normally I review things in a more clinical way.  But it wouldn't do this game justice.  If you want to see if you've really got what it takes to play a game designed to be hard, play this game.  Other games use the 'look hard, play easy' design paradigm.  That's fine.  Not every game should make you want to cry in frustration as a 250 pound grown man.  But if you  have to know if you're good enough as a gamer - there's no where else you need to look than Dark Souls.One last thing - Prepare to Die has extra content. It's not really as good as the original.  It's good, don't get me wrong.  But the bosses drift more to the 'cheap' side rather than the genuinely hard side.  So if you need to save a few bucks, skip Prepare to Die and you'll still get the experience.			"

												What's there to say? This game is legendary!This is a masterpiece of our gaming age.It's certainly not for everyone. It's a love or hate. More like: you hate it but you grow to like it, even though you still hate it often. And it's bloody hard. At first ;)Let's start at the beginning, even if there's already a new niche made-up game genre called ""souls-like"", essentially this game is a 3D metroidvania fantasy adventure arpg game. It really is just that.What's so unique about it you ask? Well it takes ""not holding your hand"" concept to the extreme, freedom in its true sense, meaning - you don't understand ♥♥♥♥ and you don't know where to go and what to do! A true adventure!It's hard and unpredictable, it's pure exploration in its base meaning, you explore how world works, what's around the corner, what the heck is that giant thing is (followed by ""You're dead""), what happens if this and ""OH SHI.. I shouldn't have done that"". Unfortunately it makes the plot ""hard to get"", it's weird at first to milk NPCs for dialogues and discovering the world through... spells' descriptions?... but it gets addictive after you're hooked, trying to find out why that boss is like that and drops what he drops or noticing the link between some enemies present in different locations etc. Exciting for those who like that kind of thing.And what about the main thing here - Combat?! Well it's AWESOME!The combat system is what makes Souls games so great. At first you hate it so much, you can't survive simple enemies, not mentioning the big bosses (the small ones are even worse).But then you learn it bit by bit and start to enjoy it. And there's lots to discover because: Lots of weapon types, different move sets Unique and Boss weapons with unique perks Weight and Poise system, which seriously affects battle Parry and Riposte system (also backstabbing), hard to master but rewarding Shield or Roll. There's no evasion stat or random chances, you learn to roll or leash out your (tower) shield, IF you can wield it ;) Lots of rings, each greatly affecting various aspects Mix and match left and right arms separately and several slots/sets to switch between Magic, Miracles, Pyromancy: wide array of magic skills to specialize or add to main buildAnd that's only combat, add these Pros to the bunch and you got yourself a prize: Non-linear gameplay, no hand holding if you don't want it Unique co-op and pvp system Various covenants (you can call them guilds or alliances for better understanding) for PvE rewards or PvP action & else Unique style, world and enemies. Environment is freaky but interesting. Somewhat unique levelling system and skills system Skill based. It's a common challenge in Souls games to beat the game without levelling a single time.It still has it's own cons of course, some harsh ones, because it's THE legendary Dark Souls ;D You will die a lot, but it's not the end. Be prepared to fail and get up. Your nerves will most likely be tested and even messed up. A lot of adrenaline too. Story is hard to find and hard to follow at times. Invasion system is a big turn-off for some in an already unforgiving game. It's an interesting system but it ♥♥♥♥s you up often. There's always offline mode though. You don't understand ♥♥♥♥. Trial and error approach. It's a debatable pro-or-con. Hard to get hooked from your first session. Many of us have started this game multiple times before really getting to love it. It's this game quirk and a part that makes it great in fact.So there you have it. Dark Souls. Such a game, it's a love-hate relationship in it's bliss.I call it a BDSM of gaming sometimes. It's a queen dominatrix at that. But it's greatness obliterates any unnerving breakdown you will have while playing. You WILL start it up again even after ragequitting. Believe me :)So if you're not afraid of challanges and tough games, if you are ready to test your gaming skills and not just relax and sit back while playing after a hard day. This is worth it!P.S. the community can be harsh with comments like condescending ""git gud"" and ""this is dark souls"", but be sure there are lots of us who likes and wants to help by word and co-op on the forums/discussions, lots of friendly people.  P.P.S. what's more interesting the online in this game is still very much alive and kicking! "

												You won't like this game. Don't buy it. You will die repeatedly. The game will actively punish you for every misstep, forcing you to swim upstream, suffer, and learn from your failures. It will eat your soul, and spit it back onto your mangled, decaying corpse. Over and over again. And then it will sit back on it's throne, waiting for you to come back for more.It's also the most rewarding, challenging, and hands down the best game I've ever played. This is a masterpiece that only a fortunate, and patient few, will ever get to fully experience.Praise the sun!			"

 Prepare to die This game took me nearly 60 hours to complete it  once ...This game is pretty hard but the award is hella great! I love how the game treats you like garbage and awards you like a King.This is definitely a game for the patient. It is hard, but fair and requires that you LEARN from your mistakes, instead of running in and hoping for the best. The entire area is a potential advantage or disadvantage depending on how you use it, so it requires that you think about what you're going to do before you try to fight. It isn't for everyone, if you like hack and slash, run for the hills, if you want a challenge, dish out the cash and buy Dark Souls.*RECOMMENDED*			"

												After 48 grueling hours of playtime, I had finally beaten Sif, the Four Kings, Seath The Scaleless, and Nito. I climbed down past the bog, in my noble sorcerers cloth, with boots and gauntlets of gold metal salvaged from Ornstien's soul it's self. Lighting the path in front of me with only the glint of my estoc and the afterglow of magic, when the path before me lighted up by it's self, a orange, firey glowIN FRONT OF ME, sat OVER FOURTY kangaroo/dinosaur hybrids, a field of lava that could only be traversed by walking on it, and no bonfire in sight for over 5 minutes of travel time through the ruined city. I had to lose some weight to travel at my fastest, and I took off my gauntlets and replaced my boots with common shoes. I put on my lava ring, and snuck across the side of the monsterous area, constantly having to find a dry rock to heal myself on.And then promptly got sat on, instantly died, and had to restart, having lost all my experience points and money. This finally broke me, and all of my normal senses vanished, and my stubbernness was replaced, not by greater determination, but conceeding to follow the rules of the game instead.I got entirely naked, put on a hat bigger than my already barreled chest, a dinky knight's shield I had picked up 8 levels back, and ♥♥♥♥ING SPRINTED AS FAST AS I COULD. This morphed in to twenty minutes of speedily scouting the area ahead, then using it to formulate a plan to continue going fast enough to dodge every enemy attack. At one point, a friend messaged me with a simple link that lead to a mashup between ""Escape the City"" from Sonic the Hedgehog, and the ghostbusters theme.This proved to be a great theme, and I pushed forward, eventually finding the bed of chaos.This lead to two more hours of sprinting with nothing but a gigantic hat, my naked fat black body slapping across dinosaurs as I body'd them out of the way, and sprinted in to the boss with my magically enchanted shield, and then eventually killing the main boss by doing 6 damage to it by hitting it with my staff. I literally jumped from my desk, raised my hands in the air and screamed ""YES!"", as my headphones ripped out of the jack and my speakers came alive, in the middle of a solo between the ghostbusters theme and sonic the hedgehog yelling in his ever so annoying voice ""FOLLOW ME, SET ME FREE, TRUST ME AND WE CAN ESCAPE FROM THE CITY""Would I recommend this game?I can't imagine how to describe the experience. It was wonderful and yet I truely wish, hope, PRAY, that I never experience it again. My thumb rating would be 4 out of 2 thumbs cut off.Since steam doesn't abide by this, thumbs up for solaire. He's a pretty cool guy.			"

												tl;dr --> game good. game not hard. game punishing. you like punishing? get game.This is a very poor port of a very good game.Luckily there are a couple of fixes around that make it play like an actual pc game; check the pinned threads on the game's discussions to find everything you need.By now you probably heard of Dark Souls only through statements like""omg dis gaem is like so hard i died liek 50 times in teh tutoriel lol xd""and thanks to that the sequels have been advertised with difficulty being the main attraction, but the game never really focuses on being hard for the sake of being hard: it just doesn't hold your hand, at all, and that's why it feels so good to overcome the obstacles the game throws at you, because from start to finish it is entirely your own victory... unless you read a walkthrough, then shame on you, you filthy casul.So what can you expect from this game?Well they don't call it the ""Prepare To Die™ Edition"" for nothing, lolPrepare to die a lot, not because of the game, but because you suck at it; dying punishes you putting you back at the last bonfire you rested at, respawning all enemies, and taking away all your precious souls you have in possession at the time of death (you need those to level up). You have one chance to get them back at the spot you died at, but if you die again before recovering them, they're gone forever. But as long as you don't lose your experience, your patience and you don't give up, dying matters very little: no matter how many souls you lose, each time you go back you're stronger... not your character, but you as a player.Prepare for an excellent combat system with a very good feel to the melee combat in particular, forget Skyrim and its hundreds of weapons that are all reskins of the same one, here weapons have all different movesets, range, properties... and most of all they still hit the enemy even if you don't point the crosshair at them (yes I'm still looking at Skirim smh); all attacks have an animation that you can't cancel (unless you get hit) so you're committed to every strike, you can't treat it like a hack'n'slash and start hacking'n'slashing left and right, that will get you killed fast.Prepare to have no map... so you better remember how to get back to that door you skipped because you had no key to open it. You will almost never feel the need of a map however, thanks to the clever level design and the fact each area looks unique.Prepare to have no story spoonfed to you... as in, little to no cutscenes showcasing big events. Nothing much happens in this ""story"" because the ""story"" already happened: all the epic fights, the shiny castles, the people smiling... they're all gone. You have no idea what happened when you arrive here, but you can piece together information from item descriptions and locations and NPC dialogues to get an idea of what it was like before and how it's come to this. Or, you can also not do it if you don't want, and complete the game without really knowing why... up to you.Prepare for silence... only boss battles and a few very special places have music, and it's 100% Motoi Sakuraba goodness.Prepare to be alone... but not quite... multiplayer works in a very interesting way, blending together singleplayer and multiplayer seamlessly. In short, coop is temporary and limited to an area, you can ""summon"" other players into your gameworld and fight together, until the area boss dies... or one of you dies.Prepare for pvp... yes, in the same way you can summon players, other players can also enter your world without your consent, and really ruin your day. Before you get scared, don't worry, there are areas where multiplayer is restricted, and playing in hollow form will prevent any multiplayer interaction anywhere.Prepare to hate the game at first... but expect to sooner or later fall in love with it... they all do in the end...Prepare to Praise the Sun... you'll know when you meet him.

												This game is pretty frickin' awesome.  I've already spent over 200 hours dying, collecting, building, and crafting.  Imagine what I could have done if I had applied myself to a more constructive pursuit!Also: If you don't have a controller, then you should strongly consider not buying this game.  The keyboard controls are almost unworkable for the game.			"

												Dark Souls is a game I avoided for years based on reputation. I'll admit it, I was afraid of a game this challenging. I started and gave up on Dark Souls a few times, but my most recent attempt had me falling head over heels in love. This is one of the best RPGs I've ever played, and one that offers so much more to it than simply difficulty. In a sea of games that assume you're an idiot, this title wants you to explore, fail, and succeed in ways never spelled out directly. The PC version needs several mods to bring it up to the standards one would expect performance wise, but in spite of the glitches and oddities Dark Souls is one of the premier titles available, and a game that is well and truly timeless.

												If you like casual games like Dora The Explorer and Peggle, you're gonna love Dark Souls. After playing through 4 times without dying, I can say that this is the most casual game I've ever played, I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't play for the challenge, but for the story.Remember to hit every single NPC you see on your way, for extra fun, ofc!

DISCLAIMER: I have never played Demon Souls, and I play Dark Souls 2 (See my review) before I played this.  I was waiting for GFWL to be gone.Onward.FIRST IMPRESSIONS: After playing DS2, my first thought on DS1 was ""Wow this game looks bad"".  I thought it was grainy and ugly and honestly had a hard time.  A friend recommended I get DSFIX and some other tweaks and the game looked and ran much better after that.This game is NOT DS2, I learned that pretty quickly.  I was a cheesy ranged magic user in DS2 and in this one, I hated magic right off the bat, it was so slow.  I was forced to learn melee play more than I had before.  Man did I start to finally learn some mechanics I missed even after an entire play-through of DS2.  I learned how to properly roll and dodge, how to properly parry and back-stab.  Fun stuff.  I mean I had done it before, but then crutched out on ranged combat so never had to master it.Not to say I did not use ranged in this game.  I just used a Bow to pull certain enemies and kill others.  More fun than magic.CONTROL: Again, I am doing this backwards since I played DS2 first.  Once you have it down, the game controls well.  It seems a lot cleaner than DS2, tighter.  I did not seem to get ""cheap"" shotted as much.  If you played DS2 first like me, you'll be fine.COMBAT: Fluid, scary!!  The enemies hit HARD, all of them, and as I said above, the control is key to getting good at the combat.  Ranged piercing hits are kind of overpowered so get a weapon that does that to ease things up a bit if you are having problems.The bosses in this game I had heard were hard.  Some of them to be honest simply kicked the living crap out of me so often it is embarrassing.  I am a slow learner but I don't get frustrated.  Watch the boss mechanics, move around a lot, and be SMART with your blocks and stamina and all bosses become much easier.  I HATED the Stray Demon and all things like him (@&^*%#@&^% those things).STORY: As with DS2, I did not follow the story much.  This game is all about fighting for me.  I thought DS2 had more interesting characters that followed you through the game more though.  Quite possible I missed something though.WORLD: Holy hell did I get confused by this world.  I had no clue where to go first, what to do, etc.  I felt less hand held and directed than I was in DS2.  I frequently went to areas that were WAY too hard for me (hollow Catacombs and Tomb!) way before I should be there.  I found myself repeating areas over and over to just practice combat and build up souls for weapon improving more that anything for a long timeEventually I learned how the entire world links together VERY well, and it is all connected and loops together brilliantly.  The fact that you can't warp around right from the start (You can later... way later for me ;P) is actually a blessing in disguise.OTHER: I put 120+ hrs into this game before I finally beat it.  If this review is anything like my DS2 one.  Someone will tell me how much I suck.  Well, so what if I suck.  I had 120+ hours of fun and have put in 20+ more since.I would love to see a ""Collection"" edition that had Demon Souls so I could play that one.  Bloodborne will make me buy a PS4 simply because it is a ""Dark Souls"" type game.I loved this game, I loved part 2 (I play to play a melee only DS2 run now ;P)Go play it.			"

												PREPARE TO BE ROYALLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ OFF EDITION  Is what is should be called... This is my first time going through this game and must i say the emersiveness and skill base meant for this game is mindblowing. I'm playing with a keyboard and mouse and i truly feel i need a controller with this game. The game has some intense action based attacks and realstic movements. I have to say this is one of the most intuitive and intense games i have ever played. As much as i die in this game shows how much i want to play more and more in this game.    This game will test you, psychologically, cognitively, and embark you in some many challenges you'll finally know what it's like to actually play A GAME! This isn't one of those story driven easy to play games you normally play on playstation or Xbox. This isn't the typical pc game that you play to push competitive play... This is a game that challenges YOU on how fast you can adapt, how fast you can learn and how fast anticipate your oppoent and survive. This game has survival base to it, it has strategy to it and it puts you in the mentality to want to win, want to survive, and want to finish it and kill those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that killed you and stole you 3000 souls.... STUPID DEMON PIECES OF ....... *whew* sorry lost myself there..... Anyways i recommend this game... Expect to be challenged.... Expect to die.... and Expect to come out being a better gamer with this game. Enjoy it... Live it.... and Survive it!			"

												Dark Souls is one of my absolute favorite games of the generation.It features a giant interconnected world with tons of hidden areas to explore. The game is challenging but not overwhelming so. Dying is a necessary aspect of learning the game but once you get the hang of it, progression can offer a very strong sense of accomplishment. The combat is rock solid and skill based with each of the weapons having their very own unique move-set. Dark Souls has RPG elements and an extremely unique multiplayer component. It's set up as a single player game but you can occasionally see the ghosts of other players which can offer hints on where (or where not to go). Players can also leave notes for one another and can be summoned to help with the many bosses. On the other hand, they can also invade your world and attempt to kill you. Dark Souls also offers plenty of replayability. It's not uncommon to spend 50 hours or so on your initial playthrough and once you complete the game, it has a New Game+ where everything becomes increasingly difficult. I've played through the game four times on Xbox and it never gets old.Just make sure you play the game with a controller as it isn't very keyboard and mouse friendly.For a more indepth and thorough review, check out my video:

It did a good job to Manus up, so we didn't blame Quelaag. It's Artoriasly hard, but it's not that bad once you Sif through it. It left Ornstein on my life.

												If I were to name two things I dislike about gaming it would be RPGs and third person perspective. That being said I'm fairly certain that Dark Souls is the best game I have played in my life.... so just try to imagine how good it is, or better yet - play it yourself.I'm writing this review shortly after the fight with Artorias - easily one of the best gaming moments I have experienced. When I started playing Dark Souls one person spoke to me saying ""I envy you - I wish I could experience it for the first time again"". Now I know what they meant.			"

 Difficulty Let's get the obvious out of the way. Is this game challenging? Yes. Is this game hard for new players? Yes. Is this game impossible? Absolutely not. This game has a reputation for being a very hard game, sometimes being dubbed ""The Hardest Game Ever."" I will tell you right now that while the game is hard in the beginning, especially for new players, it can easily be learned. It is just another game in which the level designers introduce escalating challenges for the player to face. The game starts off showing you the basic controls (attacking, dodging, healing etc.) but those who pay attention can notice that the game is slowly introducing the player to how certain challenges must be approached (fighting one target, fighting multiple target, fighting ranged targets etc.). The golden rule is to watch your surroundings, and watch your enemies. You will be able to figure things out for yourself, because though the game may not tell you outright, it does show you the ropes before it throws you into the fire. Of course you may get stuck in some parts and there is no shame in looking at a guide. I did as well in the beginning. But before you do, look around the world and look for places you have not seen before. If the area is new, and the enemies are not too hard to fight, then you are going the right way. Gameplay This game is very satisfying. If you are new to Dark Souls then you will die, very often. But that is the whole point of the game so do not feel discouraged. This game will be hard in some parts, and you will come across an obstacle that seems impossible to defeat. But when you accomplish the task, and you will, you will feel amazing. You are also given a wide variety of weapons and armor to use. Each weapon has a specific move set that fulfills some task. When you find the armor and weapons that fit your play style, upgrade them and have fun. Weapons are another aspect of this game that are very satisfying. The weapons, ranging from practical to ridiculous, all have a weighted feeling to them. You don't just blindly swing a sword around like Skyrim, there is timing involved. When you get a hit in and you watch the enemies health go down, you will feel like a million dollars. Story Along with the difficulty, the story also has a reputation. Much like the gameplay, the story is left up to the player for the most part. You are given an intro cinematic which lays down the history of the world. But once you are in the game proper the story is really only told through NPC dialogue and item descriptions. This makes the story a little bit of a mystery, you being the one who takes in information and clues to piece together the more in depth history of the world. Even when you have finished this game you can spend days watching videos of people explaining what happened in events before the game, and events that are happening in the game. Something as simple as armor next to a bonefire, or a suspicious item in someones treasure chest can open up entire stories. Levels The entire world is seamlessly connected. Except for a few areas that require special passage, the different areas are interconnected and it is possible to walk from each and every one without having a single loading screen. This helps  make the world seem more alive and grand, especially when, in some cases you are able to see one area from another. The visuals are also amazing. Whether it be from the top of a mountain peak or through a lush forest the atmosphere will certainly drag you in. However in some parts of the game, the framerate will go down drastically. Multiplayer I don't believe Multiplayer was the main focus of this game, however it is present. Online play shows in the form of covenants, different groups that fulfill some role. Some covenants like the Warriors of Sunlight are available to help you out, while others like the Darkwraiths will join your game with the main goal of killing you. These days, the Darkwraiths are the only ones around, and connecting with people to COOP is nearly impossible. It has been patched but in my experience, online play is not very common. DS Fix DS Fix is a mod that I highly suggest players to get. One of the biggest problems with Dark Souls for some people is the fact that the game is locked at 30 FPS. This mod unlocks the framerate allowing one to reach 60 fps and solve some of the visual issues that people experience. Cons I highly suggest this game and I find it Overwhelmingly positive, however here are some things that one should keep in mind.-Framerate is locked at 30, and in some places will go even lower making the game hard to play. Use DS Fix and this problem should be remedied-Near the end of the game, some areas seem rushed in their design. One major boss in particular is notable for being rather lazy, and requires more luck than skill in order to fight. This is something the entire community will agree is the lowest point of the game-Online play is not handled well. Though it is unique, you will have a better chance of being invaded by an enemy than you are being able to play with a friend. Though the strongest element of Dark Souls is it's single player so this should not be a problem-This game can really only be played with a controller. If you do not have one I suggest waiting on buying this game until you can get one. There is a keyboard and mouse setting but it is very difficult to play with. Final Word Dark Souls is truly a unique experience for any player. I've seen people put off by the difficulty at first and then eventually return to it hooked (This happened to me). If you are a fan of story and lore, this game is rich in it's atmosphere, world building, and unique presentation. Gameplay fluctuates from a fast panicked pace to slow anxious one. There are a variety of weapons that one can pick up and use to fit their play style. Overall this game is an experiment in determination. Every challenge can be completed and every enemy can be defeated. If you have learned the elements of the game, and have adapted to its rules, you will succeed. I highly recommend this game.Good Luck, and don't you dare go Hollow.			"

												It's insane how much content they could fit in the game. Sure, the texture quality might not be the greatest (but take note that the game itself is from 2011) but the level design is TOP NOTCH. In some areas you just need to take a breather and take a look around. For example in Anor Londo, the view is gorgeous as the hints on the ground suggest.This game has an incredible way to tell a story through the environment. You won't be bugged with long cutscenes of certain incidents, you'll just hear of them through the NPCs, like merchants.The game creates an atmoshpere that you'll find hard to drag yourself out of. I myself found it difficult to stop thinking of the new areas I could find in the future, hours after closing the game. And so, the game kept luring me back in.Sure. The game is difficult to someone jumping into the specific playstyle-genre for the first time. But still, after a lot of trial and error, beating a single boss fight after a half an hour learning its attack patterns, success feels rewarding.In conclusion this game is a gem worth the praise it gets. I myself would rate it a solid 9/10 (would've given 10 if it wasn't for the clumsy pc port, which could've been improved a bit).			"

Yes, it's advertised as brutally difficult and has a reputation as such, but really, if you take your time and play with strategy it's actually incredibly fun. You should know by a couple bosses in, excluding the asylum demon, if this game is for you. 10/10, fully recommend.			"

												As long as you use a controller and the DSFix mod, this is the definitive version of Dark Souls.Dark Souls is one of the richest, most rewardingly deep RPGs of all time to ever grace any system, and now it's available on the trinity of gaming:  PC, PS3, and Xbox 360. You have no excuse not to buy this game. This game is worth purchasing a controller for, and I've logged more than 1000 hours on the game amongst the three systems I play it on. No matter which system you buy it for, you will not regret it.Dark Souls will challenge you. Perpare to die.			"

												Don't get greedy. This is the golden rule of Dark Souls, and the key to your success or failure playing it.Story-wise, the game is deceptively simple. At first appearance there is little information given, you are told almost nothing and given a surprisingly large world to fight in. But this is what a lot of people love about Dark Souls - you get out of it what you put into it. Dig a little bit below the surface and there is actually a vast lore with tons of information, detective work and speculation for you to piece together if you are perceptive and observant. Item descriptions tell an entire world's worth of details, occasional lines of NPC small talk reveal facts that can expand the lore by surprising amounts, details in the landscape give inferences to greater world events. The only times you are directly told something important you can be sure as hell the tellers have an angle they are pushing and it probably isn't the full picture.World design-wise, you have a surprisingly large stage to explore and, most importantly, it *feels* like you are exploring a massive land in a fading world rather than a set of different levels. Just about everywhere in the game is interconnected and criss-crosses with other areas in some way, you can walk from one area to another and then look back and see exactly where you came from and look forwards and know you'll eventually get there (and sometimes even see tiny orange player messages in the distance, which is a nice touch). The shortcuts exemplify this, it genuinely feels like everything is one large castle.Mechanics-wise, see the first sentence. This is a game of patience and cat-and-mouse baiting. Lure enemies into one-on-one combat, don't get flanked, learn when to tank and when to evade, plan your attack movements, use everything and anything to your advantage. Death has little meaning as everything lost on death can be infinitely regained, so it becomes a learning mechanism rather than a punishment. Sometimes the lesson may be 'go elsewhere' or 'try a different method.'Character building can vary greatly. Do you want to be a heavy knight with a massive weapon, or a dexterous archer, or a tactical mage? The beginning class choice is essentially meaningless in the long run, it just determines what gear you start with and gives you some stats you'd have even with a different class (eg you'll probably end up putting some points into faith so for the heal miracle regardless of your build). You can effectively beat the game with almost any playstyle or build, though some are definitely easier than others.Use humanity at a bonfire to un-hollow yourself and you can summon other players to help you fight areas and bosses at the risk of being invaded and killed by someone else. There are also NPCs who can be summoned and even invade you, which is nice if you're offline, though there are sometimes conditions for summoning them such as them having been in the previous boss fight or them invading you and defeating them.There are some spots it suffers from poor design, let's be honest. These are generally not so much in terms of enemies or player options but in terms of terrain and meshes - the Great Hollow is a good example of this, sometimes you will go flying down and to the side to your death because god forbid you touched the wrong angled mesh despite having had an apparently clear angle to your destination. The Bed of Chaos is especially obnoxious with this, but the less said about that the better. The Painted World doesn't mesh with the rest of the game very well, it's more or less where the devs put half-finished ideas that they didn't want to throw out, which is a pity because information on the stage itself and boss are very interesting but rather undeveloped and could have been expanded on much more (I was especially disappointed that I couldn't return the doll to its owner). Most of the game has excellent level design, however, the exceptions to this are only exceptions and not the rule.I am not skilled enough at pvp to really go into it, look elsewhere for an analysis on that. I will say that in my experience pvp has been annoyingly full of longer-range bleed weapons and little else in terms of variety, lag is also very much present and will lead to you missing when you clearly connected and getting hit or backstabbed when you were clear across the area.All in all, brilliant game that you will probably quit the first time you play it then come back to much later and eventually enjoy. Takes time to 'get it' which can be considered both a major weakness of it and a massive strength to it. Just about every bit of progress you've made (both in-game and in understanding/learning the game) is a result of your own effort and accomplishment, very little is given to you so again you get out of it what you put into it.Note that due to the devs self-admittedly being inexperienced at PC porting, there are some native issues. These are mostly fixed by getting DSfix and configuring it for whatever needs to be tweaked for your setup. Edit: since it was updated to run off Steam directly some parts of the DSfix may need to be altered or disabled to get it working properly.			"

												I like Dark Souls, it's not for everyone, but you might like it too. You probably don't need me to tell you that Dark Souls has a reputation for being balls hard, and while it's not an unmerited reputation it has more to do with the game deciding that the player can do without certain conveniences rather than dicking you over. The new XCOM is a game that ♥♥♥♥♥ you over by letting your squadmates perma-die, roguelikes often ♥♥♥♥ you over by starting the game over when you die. Those are features added to make the game harder and while I have nothing wrong with either if they're implemented well, Dark Souls uses subtraction, which is a subtler bouquet. So modern gaming conveniences that are generally thought of as necessary for smooth gameplay have been thrown aside. So while I don't think the bosses in Dark Souls (which are generally regarded as being brutal) are tougher on paper than any other third-person action game of this type  (they don't take a ludicrous amount of damage, attack patterns aren't hard to learn) the game doesn't do you any favors in getting past them. When you die you don't immediately respawn at the start of the battle and have to work your way back, you can't load up on enough health items to forgo learning the boss's patterns.Playing Dark Souls is like giving up your smart phone for a day. ""Oh wow, it is possible to exist without being connected to eleven different social networks while being in perpetual contact with hunderds of people!"" I'm not saying I want every game to wantonly cut the fat like Dark Souls, but it's nice to know that I don't need my hand held, that I can be expected to figure out a crafting system on my own, that I can be expected to discover things without any prompting. It's all very empowering.I also think Dark Souls makes some smart choices to distinguish itself from similar RPGs. First off it doesn't feature an open world. I'm not a huge fan of open worlds. I think it's more challenging to craft a small gameworld where every step is deliberately placed, every nook and cranny there for a reason, than to make a big ♥♥♥ map and then scatter a few waypoints even across it. Every thing you find and every where you go in Dark Souls feels like you figured out and uncovered rather than just being something you stumbled upon. Plus, if you get stuck in one direction and feel like exploring you know you're always going to find something new if you push along that path you were stuck at before. You're never going to waste your time because the developer didn't drop something cool where you decided to explore.Dark Souls also handles weapons and armor brilliantly. There are very few inately bad weapons and none that so completely out-class others that they make other options pointless. You find a weapon with a moveset you like and then, with upgrades through the crafting system you can take that weapon all the way to the final boss. It's a perfect way to defeat the RPG trope of, reach new town, buy new weapon/armor set, fight boss.Of course Dark Souls is a game that requires dedication and patience. Not everyone will have the time and attention to dedicate 80+ hours to get through. If you do though it's a unique and satisfying experience.			"

												Heads up: this is not a review on the actual content of the game, this is a review on how good of a PC port this is in comparison to the original verison of the game.This is a very good game, but unfortunately I can't recommend it because this port is the absolute worst port I've ever seen of any game in my life. The main problems I notice is that the keyboard controls make absolutely no sense at all and that the button tutorials at the beginning are actually for an Xbox controller, which I was not using so they did not help me at all. I can understand that it's highly recommended to use a controller, but since I'm playing this on a PC I should be able to use a keyboard if that's what I prefer or if it's all I have. The keyboard controls could have easily been done better. I pressed every single key and not a single one of them opened up the main game menu. I had to force quit the game just so I could get back to the title screen and the options menu. And again, it just looks extemely lazy to reuse the tutorials from the Xbox version when someone is playing with a keyboard on a PC.The other main thing I have to complain about with this port is the performance issues. I experience constant framerate drops while playing that make this game almost as unplayable as the controls do. However, I have heard that basically everyone who buys this game for PC has the same problems, and as a result there are mods out there that fix these problems and--I have to admit--actually seem to make this version perform better than the console version. But am I the only one who thinks that it's a major flaw when a game needs to be modded just to be playable?All I can end with is: if you own a Playstation 3 or an Xbox 360, you would be saving yourself a tremendous amount of trouble by just getting the console version of this game. I have played this game on 360 and the controls are great and the performance is flawless (with the exception of the notorious Blighttown framerate).TL;DR  This game is unplayable without modding it to improve performance and using a controller. If you don't own a controller and/or don't want to mod the game, then you're better off getting the console version if you own a PS3 or 360.EDIT: Calling this port unplayable may not be entirely accurate and a little harsh. I personally went out and purchased an Xbox controller and spent an entire afternoon modding the game, and now I have to say I find it better than the console version of the game. But I still have to say that this game will be VERY difficult for anyone to enjoy in its default state. I still cannot for the life of me set up the keyboard controls in a way that is comfortable or at least not confusing (also still never found a key for the menu in the default controls). Also, I don't know if I'm in the majority or the minority with the performance problems. Most people I've talked to or heard talk about this port highly recommend the DSfix mod to make the game run more smoothly. So this is a common problem but not a problem that every single person who downloads the game experiences.After tweaking the game myself I think I can say that if you're someone who doesn't mind using a controller and possibly going out of your way to install a mod or two, then I recommend this game to you 110% (assuming of course you know what Dark Souls is and what you're getting yourself into). But I am still going to leave this as a negative review, because what I'm reviewing here is how the game is in its present default state, not how it is with a controller and a bit of modding. And frankly, in its default state this port is just...bad.			"

												Nominated for the ""Just 5 more minutes"" award.What can I say? The whole game is based around just five more minutes. Whether it's just five more minutes until I get back to the boss, just five more minutes until I get to the next bonfire checkpoint, or just five more minutes(hours) until I give up.Dark souls is both a challenging and methodical approach to the modern day dungeon crawler, and plays similar to an action RPG. Areas are intricately crafted with beautiful scenery, and every enemy and item has a purpose and reason for being there. So whether it's because you decided to walk the wrong direction at Firelink Shrine or maybe dealing with the archers of Anor Londo, there's always something there to make you hate yourself a bit more in this game, just because you know that the mistakes are all on you. The 'Open' world is also a nice change of pace from its PS3 predecessor Demon Souls, and feels atmospherically better than its sequel, Dark Souls II, despite a several flaws such as a 30fps lock.There are many who enjoy a challenge, but even more who are turned off by it. However, with some effort and habit breaking, even an unexperienced gamer would be able to enjoy this game. The game has gone on sale as low as 5 USD, but it is well worth the full 20 USD price.

												*Refunded*It's not a bad game... I am just bad at it. So bad in fact that it is not even remotely fun for me. I basically would die, learn the strat a bit more, die again, learn the strat a bit better just to die again. I understand this is a game of pefect timing and masterful skill, I just apparently lack either. I AM NOT SAYING DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. I am just saying I personally did not enjoy the trial and error formula. I actually see the value and complexity to a game like this. It simply isn't for me. I am actually going to still give this a thumbs up, not because I enjoyed it but rather because I respect what the game accomplishes. Tight gameplay, a smart story, a beautiful atmosphere and of course a good challenge. Long story short if you like trial and error games that offer a high ammount of reward/accomplishment then you will likely love this. If you are looking for something you can pick up and play through with no hiccups then try something else.-Casey			"

My experience on Day 1  - This should help you decide if you want to play!Today I played my first my first 5 or so hours of the game and I have to say.. it was a great experience. I purchased the game on the idea of a challenge and a skill cap that I would want to pop but that proves to be harder than I first thought.A friend starts talking to me on steam just as I see the first boss and tells me the joy that can come from Dark Souls. I listen and I quickly see what the game has to offer and I also notice that my friend will be my mentor through this experience. After just under 10 lives I manage to kill the first boss and arive at Lordan. After speaking to a guy who seems to know more about myself than I do, I realise that the goal of the game is to reach a destination of some sort.I then go forward and find that I must defeat pairs of skeletons... who are overpowerd and after 10 or so lives I realise I need to do something different. I go down there and rush.. without even looking at the skeletons and see a shield. I die quickly after and the go back down to look for other items. By now I have realised how the soul system of the game works and that if I die I must retreve my souls from the spot I have died. I level up my dexterity because that seems to be what I need and go for many more runs with each life teaching my more about the combat of the game.I start to give up alittle bit but then my guide (friend) replys after being afk. My question is ""Am I doing something wrong"" and proceed to tell him about the skeletons. He then replys with a quick tip, ""Try seeking a plan B route"". It hits me. I have been going the wrong direction the whole time. I quickly find a stair route that have much weaker enemies in it. My new weakness... grouped up enemies that attack shortly after one another while you are downed and/or recovering. Quickly I begin to realise that they must be seperated and try just that.2 Hours pass and countless lives go along with them. Keeping calm and learning from my mistakes and such. Finally I get to a tower-ish area, do you go up or down? I go up and walk along a bridge area. BOOM, a boss... much to powerful for my equipment and I. So I die... go back and choose to go down and am met with a boss. You know what happened... don't you?!~Day 1 - This game... its hard to believe it was made so long ago for something that wants to challenge you in such a way... and I love it!			"

												1.) There are infinite souls and Humanity so Don't Panic if you lose some.2.) If at first you don't succeed, visit a different area and level up your soul level or upgrade your armor/weapons.3.) Don't get too attached to any one weapon; Many enemies have resistances and weaknesses to exploit.4.) Kalameet is a fatty.5.) Praise the Sun!26.) Sometimes, walking away from one boss fight that's killing you and cleansing your palate by visiting another boss who wants to kill you can make you appreciate the first boss more. Some of the 26 boss fights are optional, but that's just Dark Souls being coy; it knows you want to get the whole set.216.) …I wasn't prepared to die that many times…Edit: Turns out I missed a secret boss. Now I've got to decide whether I want to do NG+ or a whole new character… Hmmm, choices, choices…			"

												At this point you have probably already heard of this game, but i want to write review for this game just because it deserves it.Game relies on your skills ( reflex, timing and good execution of your plan if any), this game doesn't hold your hand at all which is pleasant change.Best boss fights if i dare to say so myself, they are huge, interesting and never same, all bosses are unique, well designed and just freaking amazing.I would highly recommend this game to you if you are bored of games, yes that's a thing and it happens and game like this which is quite different from usual ones might be just the thing you need.Only thing i disliked was online, it did worked at times but now always, i had to use 3rd party programs to improve online, and Dark Souls has amazing community, didn't have any summon signs but found help through forums.Amazing game, amazing community, lore of course and skill.Git Gud and Praise the Sun.

												£20 for Dark Souls: Prepare to Die edition? That's what I thought while shopping in Asda one day, and so I picked up the phsyical edition of the game. After installing Microsft's DRM service, Games for Windows Live, and discovering the game didn't want to link to my Steam account, I started playing. While Dark Souls is an incredibly fun game, I just can't recommend it while it still has Games for Window's Live attached to it. After the service managed to delete my account, meaning I couldn't save my game, I decided to buy it on Steam in the sales so as to be able to actually have a save file. And guess what? The game still makes me use GfWL, and now the service is refusing to let me log in at all - meaning it will be impossible to ever save my game. Unless this is fixed, I'm going to have to wait until June 2014 (when Live is shut down - hurrah) before I can play a game I've bought twice. This is incredibly disappointing.			"

												PRAISE THE SUN!If only I could be so grossly incandescent!Jolly co-operation!^^These quotes will be part of your life forever.The Demon's Souls and Dark Souls games are my favorite series this gen. They changed the way I look at ARPGs with the fantastic combat and the open worlds you can play within. The combat is just amazing with every weapon having different mechanics and animations so you can try tons of different styles of  gameplay from big swords to daggers to dual wielding to being a pokey turtle with a spear and giant shield.  Not just melee, but Pyromancy, Sorcery, and Miracles are available too with their wands and gloves and can all be used by every player if your skills are good enough. Don't forget to use the items too for some fun ways of attackign enemies like poison arrows and darts. This game is an RPG with a story that isn't spoon fed to you. This series tells a story through item descriptions and other obscure places. It is a world of lore that is found through reading items and very few cutscenes. You awaken in this world and everyone is just as crazy as you will feel. You upgrade your levels by collecting souls to increase your attributes, which allow you to wield more weapons and cast different magics. STamina is important. Very important. Don't skimp on it. This series introduced a fascinating online mechanic. While I like the messages and the blood stains more in Demon's Souls, Dark Souls still has them. Messages can be left from other players that can either help, or trick you into a death. These are all pre-written messages and you choose from a list for obvious reasons. Blood stains allow you to view how other explorers have died! Sometimes these are hilarious.The big online aspect , however is the PvP and the co-op it provides. If you have used Humanity to get into human form you can be INVADED by other players on the server at any time as long as you have not killed the area boss. ""XXXXXX Has Invaded ....."" starts the heart pumping immediately as you play cat and mouse while you search each other out. Ultimately one of you finds the other with a sneak attack, or you just make a friendly bow and start to circle each other for a one on one fight to the death! You can even have summoned phantoms help you out if you find their summon signs first to fell these invaders.The Co-op aspect works like the messages where summon signs are placed upon the ground and you can summon Blue Phantoms (other players) to help you through the area and ultimately defeat the boss. Dark Souls also introduced Covenants, which allow you to join mysterious groups within the world. Each group has different benefits for members. They will put you in a bullseye for more invaders, allow you to team up easier for co-op with friendly players, give you extra powers, and many more things. Several of these are available and can be joined when found and leaving another Covenant. While the online aspects are intriguing this game is at its heart a single player game. One that can be played with the threat of invasions by staying in Human form, or completely alone by playing offline, or as a Hollow. This game isn't a PvP game, while many will try to make it one. This edition does offer an Arena, however with the new DLC to play PvP as much as you want without having to search for players to invade in the world itself. The main way to play this is to think of it as a single player game with online elements. These online elements add to the difficulty as there is no AI that can give you the challenge that a human player can. These invasions are to put a kink in your exploration and make the world even more dangerous.The PC port graphically isn't the greatest, however. Most players have downloaded the mod named DSFix (search google) to help with some of the technical aspects of the game. Dark Souls has its own Nexus site and is completely compatible with the Nexus Mod Manager like the Elder Scrolls and Fallout games have, but these are mostly cosmetic as adding anythign that could impact other players would be illegal for an online experience. A bunch of other graphical upgrades are available as well as the ability to replace the gamepad buttons like to PS3 buttons for those of us that use a PS3 controller, and many other controller buttons are there too for peopel that like Logitech.This series is one that you should not miss. If you have a Playstation 3 try getting and playing Demon's Souls first, however as this has changed some of the gameplay a bit. My best surprise in gaming ever was Demon's Souls buying it on a whim the first week it came out. It is an epic adventure. I believe that the servers are actually still Live as well so you should be able to play online last I checked.			"

												Dark Souls is like a love/hate relationship.When I started playing it, I found it rather quite stressful and hopeless. This was not only the beginning of my Dark Souls adventure but also the beginning playing with a xbox controller so of course I had to get used to that too.I died countless of times in the very first area and the very first boss ""The Asylum Demon"" was a really pain in the ♥♥♥ to defeat.I did kill the boss after many attempts and reached the second area ""Firelink Shrine"". This was the part were I completely lost all my hope since small enemies like skeletons and hollows were able to kill me pretty easily. Then I decided to give up, because I felt stuck and lost in this universe. Therefore I quit the game for a few mounths.Then a friend of mine started to suggest that I should go on with Dark Souls. My friend had an interest in Dark Souls because he watched Dark Souls 3 videos and he new that I used to play Dark souls 1.With his help by my side I learned the Dark Souls basics and gave me advice in boss fights or other situations. This boost of hope restored my power of will to continue and as I played the game, my character became stronger and I had an actual clue of what I was doing.I finally managed to beat the game and all the bosses after many ours of victorious happiness and miserable defeats.As long as you ""git gud"" and ""praise the sun"", you can enjoy this game.

												Dark Souls™: Prepare To Spend 3 Hours Modding And Troubleshooting Errors To Make It A Decent Port™ EditionBut after that, this game is delicious. It feels like the developers have been isolated from society for several years while making this game, and never had any idea of the standards that have been set in modern game development.The standards where button mashing is always a legitimate option, where the player's hand is held with constant instruction and navigational aid (even to the point where games play themselves), where there is no consequence for dying.This game is oblivious to all of that. The combat is extremely satisfying; complex and risky, without being overly convoluted. Button mashing WILL get you killed right away. Every weapon has its own moveset, handling, and attributes. You will die a lot. Success comes from learning the mechanics, attack animations, enemy AI, physics, and reasons behind your mistakes. It becomes the most fun thing ever and oh mah gawwwwd the boss designs are wicked intense, and environments are gorgeous and seamlessly intertwined. It's an open world where you can get lost and discover places ""early"", but there is no such thing as being underleveled. Your level means nothing, and you can complete many areas whether you upped your damage or not. It's all about what you can handle.I give this a Yes out of 10 rating. play play play play play play play play			"

												This is the game guys. Along with its predecessor Demon's Souls this game has become my favorite game of all time and even rivals games like The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Metal Gear Solid, Okami and Mass Effect. Games that I hold dearly in my heart because they are special to me. If you have played Demon's Souls you will feel right at home. Like Demon's Souls, Dark Souls is an incredibly rewarding game.The story and lore is fascinating and deep even though the game is not very good at telling you these things.The combat in this game is top notch and the vast amount of unique weapons, armour and spells give you plenty opportunities to experiment with them and pick the one you like the most.I wouldn't say that Dark Souls is a hard game. It just doesn't hold your hand like most games do today and I think it is a nice nod to the unforgiving NES/SNES era. The difficulty of this game lies in the skill of the player. Also to get the best experience out of this game. Play this game with no guide or anything whatsoever.Now you may ask yourself, does this games have flaws? Yes, it does. The PC version has a large amount of framedrops (You will especially notice this if you have played the console version too), online matchmaking could be done better and a controller is almost required to play this game smoothly.But do these flaws stop me from enjoying this game? HELL NO! I say go get this game if you want a deep action RPG/dungeon crawler that will entertain you for hours.Praise The Sun, Sunbros!!  \o/			"

												Before anyone jumps down my throat, let me say this.  The difficulty of the game was NOT the reason for the thumbs down.  yes it is hard and it is really damn annoying at times, but it is extremely rewarding to finally make it through whatever boss or section of a map that you are playing.   The reason that I give it a thumbs down is largely because of how bad of a port the game was.   The graphics could have been enhanced more but they were good enough to get the job done, so that's a very very minor reason.   The issue with the port was the learning curve on what keys from the Xbox controller were corresponded to the keys on the computer.   I tried so hard to figure it out and got most of the things down but it was so frustrating.   But the worse part, was the mouse.  I used mods to fix it but it kept turning at 90deg turns and made it annoying to stay still.   And then finally, the ""focus on enemy"" feature, whatever it was called, was so bad because even when you would focus on one enemy, your mouse would grab another one and thus leave you wide open and in this game, that can cost you dearly. If they only cared enough to have changed the controls (especially the on screen buttons -.- then it would have been better to play, but they didn't.   I think this is better to just play on the console, rather than the PC.TL;DR  The game itself, is great, although tough, but the PC version of is a really bad port  UNLESS you use controller, which makes it much much easier to play.   As for KB&M users, use the mods made by players, or just get a controller.			"

												As the ""chosen undead"" you embark, spurred by a prophecy, on a pilgrimage that'll see you traverse the whole world of Lordran and ultimately decide its fate: it'll be a long, arduous journey that'll test the player character- and you as the player- several times.I agree with the notion that Dark Souls can be considered a flawed gem: it won't be for everyone, there's some questionable design decisions and it feels a bit clunky at times but when everything clicks the game is very fun and extremely rewarding.PROS:-when modded it looks quite nice considering its age-great soundtrack and sound design-a sprawling, interesting world to explore with some truly nice vistas-great combat system rewards skill, strategy and patience-the difficulty might be frustrating at times, but gives a great sense of progression as you slowly become able to tackle stronger foes and is immensely rewarding once you beat a difficult area or boss-bosses and minibosses are, for the most part, tense and engaging affairs: most bosses are also quite menacing due to their size and/ or art style-tons of different weapons, armours and spells to suit basically any playstyle-the multiplayer aspects are interesting, it's fun to see player ghosts going around their business and die: invasions can be a bit annoying at times but there's no denying they're fun and keep you on edge-very long, expect around 40/ 50 hours, plus you get DLC and New Game Plus modesNEUTRAL:-story is a tad muddy overall and its easy to get confused if you don't examine objects or talk to missable NPC (some of which can be missed)-inventory/ stats screens work but feel cumbersomeCONS:-blurry, muddy graphics when unmodded: also lacks most graphical options-problematic camera can really get in the way and lead to unfair deaths-some drawn-out sequences with no bonfires can get aggravating-if you die to a boss having to either clear the whole path to it(or try to run through mobs to quickly reach it again) simply gets dull -the lack of handholding and tutorials, apart from very basic ones, can leave new players stumped on what to do, how to spend their points and what build to aim for

Dark Souls will be intimidating for most when you start, heck it took me a few tries to just get to grips with combat against basic enemies: and the first bosses were messy affairs where I just ran around trying to roll/ parry just to be cut down in two hits. But persevering in the face of hardships yields results soon enough nad going back to a boss the next day only to beat it on the first try gives an huge sense of accomplishment. And that's really the whole game in a nutshell, bashing your face against difficult zones, strong enemies and huge bosses to eventually come out victorious once you get the hang of it.The difficulty that made the series famous sadly stems, in part, from the camera: it works decently most of the time but while fighting huge bosses/ mobs or traversing cramped spaces it can act up badly: and when it does you might not see an hit coming or simply become disoriented and die with little to no way to react. A few encounters are also designed in a purposedly cheap way...have to traverse a thin strip of stone over an huge chasm? We'll add ranged mobs just to ensure you might die a cheap death. These encounters feel outright annoying rather than challenging...same goes for having to walk over invisible platforms or fighting in almost pitch darkness, I did it and eventually made it but I felt relief rather than accomplishment in doing so.But even with all its flaws the game is a memorable experience, for me it was about going against overwhelming odds and persevering even in the face of multiple defeats: to try until you succeed, to know that there's always a way to come out on top, eventually. And it was also a story about sacrifice both in its plot and the actual game mechanics.Is this a game for you? Maybe, maybe not...it's not as difficult as certain people make it out to be (and if you're really frustrated or scared to tackle it, just read a guide to have a slightly easier experience) but it surely demands quite a bit of skill and lots of concentration to go through. And even if you can't beat it I feel even just a few hours with the game could be worth it even just for the cathartic experience it's able to provide.			"

												Unmatched Difficulty!/ Navigate a labyrinth of FAQs and forums as you take on the ultimate test of patience in trying to get your game to launch./ Engage in tireless trial and error as you attempt to smooth out your framerate and improve graphics and performance with 3rd-party mods./ Measure the true extent of your PC elitism upon realizing just how trashy the keyboard & mouse controls are.Hardcore Role-playing/Life Simulation!/ Select a class, meticulously customize your appearance, then play through the game unsatisfied with the final results.

Go ahead and play God, you weak coward./ Stave off those suicidal thoughts by piecing together the lore and making up your own story as you're stuck fighting in the same area, against the same enemies, for entire sessions or even days.

I'm hoping to catch some of the people that are coming from Dark Souls 3If you're thinking about buying this game, I say go for it, but there are a few things you should know. This game is sitting on the edge of unplayable without Durante's DSfix /http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19/? (API MOD) The combat is slower, especially if you start the game with full armor. It's not nearly as pretty as Dark Souls III, even with every mod out there.This game was released in 2011, and it was highly innovative for that time, much like DS3 or Bloodborne is today.Just keep in mind that you're playing a piece of Fromsoftware history, and with that, your expectations should be in the right place.The lore is just as deep, the items are just as confusing, and the bosses are just as daunting. I think I am finally retiring from this game now, and at the end of this week I will be flying to Japan to give Miyazaki the blowie he deserves.			"

												This is what game developers should be shooting for. The atmosphere in this game is amazing. If you are a fan of action RPGs you MUST play this game. Don't skip out just because you think it's too hard. You will rage, but it's the good kind of rage. The kind you used to get playing NES games 25 years ago. You will learn from your mistakes, improve and move on.Do yourself a favor. Play this game, die a lot and enjoy every minute of it!			"

												It's certainly novel for a game's subtitle to boast of your impending slaughter, but Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition is unusual in most respects. Its combat is abnormally precise, its narrative is largely embedded within optional NPC interactions, and its multiplayer features are unconventional and initially largely hidden. While the PC version is a shabby port, there is simply no other action RPG out there like Dark Souls, which is so good that it adversely affected my opinion of how all previous RPGs handled combat. However, I must start out with a warning: the PC port is a disappointing wasted opportunity to technically improve on the console version of Dark Souls, and it lacks many features you probably expect as standard. The resolution is locked at 1280x720 (aka 720p), the framerate is locked at 30fps, and there are no high resolution textures. There's a mouse & keyboard control option, but control is so bad that it's not practical, so you'll definitely want a gamepad to play. Fortunately, there's a must-have unofficial patch available that improves the rendering resolution. With it, everything looks much crisper, although you're stuck with low-resolution textures.That said, Dark Souls is still an amazing game. There's no hand-holding - to succeed, you need to invest time diligently exploring, learning the combat system, and developing your skills to overcome challenges. The open-world design makes it likely that you'll wander into high-level areas that'll mercilessly slap some perspective into your character. It's a tough, but fair experience. Deaths aren't cheap, but success needs to be well earned. Dark Souls – likes it predecessor – is a third-person dungeon crawl at its core. In the almost overbearingly gloomy realm of Lordran, a sizeable open-world that you’ll explore high and low, threats loom just about anywhere you look. From a few established hubs in the world, you’ll expand outward, constantly facing adversity in the endless gnarled faces of ever-dangerous creatures that stand between you and ending the calamotous period called the Age of Fire…or, if the tone of the world sucks you under, to usher in a different calamity entirely. The game’s plot is purposely minimalistic and tells its story through the limitations of its sparsely populated world. Like most everything else in the game, the flavour of the game’s lore and plot is largely left with the player’s curiousity and interpretation, which suits it just fine. Dark Souls is a game focused squarely on combat that demands precision, smarts, and persistence.Most action-oriented games place you in frenetic fights that move swiftly, and although fluidity is very much a key to success in Dark Souls, the combat here feels weighty and deliberate. Your character’s movements, burdened with heavy armour and weaponry, feel appropriately strained. You can’t make a last minute dodge out of harm’s way or just mash on the attack button, either. Every action in the game is methodical yet extremely powerful if used judiciously and properly. Each blow you land and fatal swipe you dodge is the result of skilled observation and timing, of knowing your characters strengths and limits and exploiting each to the fullest. Know your character and pull your punches wisely, and you’ll slay the toughest of foes. Attack wildly and evade flippantly, and you’ll soon find your enemies taking advantage of your every misstep.Death is swift and common in Dark Souls, though it’s never an end. In fact, your character will likely be dead – or “hollowed” – for much of your play time, complete with a decayed and eyeless face. Each time you die, you’ll lose all of the souls you accrued from enemies – which serve as both experience points to upgrade your stats and currency to purchase items – and respawn at the last bonfire you visited, which serve as sigh-relieving points of rest in the game world. Bonfires refill your stock of estus flasks – the game’s healing item – as well as recharge uses of your spells. Yet even these points of safety come with a catch; use a bonfire, and all enemies excepting bosses respawn, ready to make an attempt on your life once more.The game’s death mechanics also introduce yet another unique aspect to Dark Souls – the importance and privelige of being alive. Although your character handles the same way no matter their state, using valuable Humanity items at a bonfire to turn your character back into a living being opens up a ton of online connectivity features. Although you can’t play Dark Souls in a multiplayer setting or set up matchmaking with your friends, each individual player does slightly connect to all others. You may see ghostly images of other players appear around you, real-time feed of where they are and what they’re doing in their own game. When you’re alive, you can find and use items to summon players into your game temporarily, using them to help you clear more difficult sections. Ultimately, you get out what you put in to Dark Souls. There’s a dizzying amount of nuance and detail in the game’s setting, level design and combat, and it only gets more engrossing as you sink your teeth in further. The more you change up your fighting style and take risks, the more you learn about what makes the enemies tick, and brings possible methods for felling them to the surface. There’s no easing you into play mechanics or tips popping up on screen to give you a hand in Dark Souls. You not only need to take chances and be proactive in your approach to its many challenges, you need to remember everything that works and apply it skillfully. Equipment choices can have more than one impact - heavy armor not only blocks more damage than lighter equipment, it also makes your character less likely to be thrown off balance when hit. Large shields have great stability, which allows your blocks to use less stamina, but light shields allow you to better land devastating ripostes. Some weapons inflict damage dependent upon attributes such as Strength. If you've neglected the attributes that modify weapon damage, you can instead use elemental weapons that don't rely upon attribute modifiers, or chaos weapons that scale with consumable Humanity points. If you find it difficult to get parry timing down, ignore it and use heavy shields for blocking or rely more upon rolling. Enemies and items don't scale in strength as you level, so if you become skilled enough at combat you can complete the storyline and grab the most powerful equipment as a very low-level character. The Prepare to Die Edition also adds three new areas that provide some new insight into the setting's history: a crumbling cityscape, a forest, and an area of the Abyss that's haunted by Humanity ghosts. The cityscape is the only one that impresses, as the others feel too redundant next to the original content, but the new enemies make them worth playing, including some misshapen humanoids with headstalks that can be seen in darkness and some tough stone guardians who slam their hammer so viciously into the ground that yanking them out causes an explosion of turf. The new bosses include the fallen Knight Artorias, a key figure in the lore, and a ferocious Dragon which is so tough that he's an optional fight. All of the new bosses are frenetic and extremely aggressive combatants, making them at least as tough as those in the original areas. One of those original bosses also makes a very welcome reappearance, in a manner that both fits well with established lore and gives a different tone to the original encounter.With its high difficulty, punitive checkpoint system, and trial-and-error gameplay, Dark Souls isn't for everyone. But with the Prepare to Die Edition, PC gamers finally have a version of Dark Souls to call their own, and longtime fans of the game have some new content to work with. Graphical hiccups aside, that makes this port a success.			"

												So.. Dark Souls III just came out. And here I was... thinking that I could try Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition again. Although I never really did try it for real before. For some reason it had huge performance issues on my former PC - which was not bad in any regard. Anyway my new high-end PC and the community-patch I've installed made it a smooth ride so far.When Dark Souls II came out I tried it.. and almost immediately ragequitted it. It made me think that I would never ever like a Dark Souls-title. Well.. I was so wrong. It took Dark Souls 1 just a few hours to hook me and really get me into it. I found myself on several occasions during the last few days feeling this urge and thought: ""I want to play more Dark Souls... I want to get into the next area, find another cool weapon, fight the next boss and more..."" It really took me by surprise that a game - I thought I would hate & ragequitt after the first few deaths - could get me so invested and leave me with a desire for more. I want to experience more of this world, it's NPCs and often harsh and unforgiving fights.It's just an awesome feeling to backstab, plunge attack or parry & counterattack an enemy!			"

												Dark Soul is a combat oriented rpg, maybe the best i've ever played.It's a very immersive game, you explore multiple areas in a non-linear order, where you decide helping or killing any npc, it's how an rpg has to be, game is always auto saving, yes you undestood correctly GAME IS ALWAYS AUTOSAVING that means when you run out of arrows, or kill npc's you can't just load previous save game, this itself gives the game lots of replayablility and it's what makes this game so great. Maybe is not a game for everyone but is a game everyone have to play. Is challenging is terms of difficulty, uses and abuses of trial and error, but when you just don't rush, look every corner and go slowly the difficulty decreases, but on bosses... on bosses...

												One of my favourite games of all time.I originally played Dark Souls on the Xbox 360 back in the day and i absolutely hated it. The combat was punishing and i had no idea what most of the items did and i would die over and over again and eventully i said something like ""♥♥♥♥ this!"" and gave up on it.A few weeks later i tried the game again and something just clicked. The combat was still punshing, i still had no idea what most of the items did and i still died over and over again but i learnt that Dark Souls is the kind of game that you have to play by it's rules. Running around trying to be Rambo like you would in any other hack and slash game will do nothing but encourage you to smash your desktop in to little pieces.Pros:- A huge detailed dark fantasy world to explore and die in.- So many different character builds. Do you want to focus on using heavy weapons and pyromancy? You can do that. Want to be a fast moving wizard who can also use a samurai sword? You can do that too. How about a naked man armed only with a broken sword and wooden shield?- Weighty and responsive combat which makes you feel like a badass.- Dozens of cool weapons which all have unique move sets to suit your play style.- Unique online features where you can either choose to help other players or invade their world and ruin their day.- Massive scary, screen filling bosses to get killed by.Cons:- The PC port is hot dog ♥♥♥♥ but there are fan made patches which are very easy to find and install.- Blight Town exists. I won't spoil anything but you probably won't like it much either.			"

												Truly, the Dark Souls™ of Video Games™.+ God-tier level design. Everything loops and interconnects in ways that will blow your f*cking mind.+ Infinite replayability. The level design allows so many different experiences if you know where to go.+ Fair and satisfying combat, but it requires patience and every input has to be intentional.+ Very fun and well designed bosses (except a few, see below).+ Every level is intricately designed and detailed (except a few, see below).+ Expert enemy placement.+ Fantastic atmosphere that ranges from comfy to nerve racking.+ A great variety of weapons and armor combos.+ Stats and levels offer a lot of play variety.+ The deepest of lore, you just have to put effort into appreciating.+ Excellent voice acting for what little there is.+ The greatest DLC I've ever played in my life. - The second half (after Anor Londo) feels a bit rushed and notably weaker than the first half.- The Demon Ruins and Lost Izalith are absoulte sh*t in every way compared to the rest of the game.- The Duke's Archives are lackluster as well.- Capra Demon boss is too claustrophobic and a lazy way of creating difficulty.- Moonlight Butterfly boss is boring for any melee only character.- Pinwheel boss is laughably easy.- Seath the Scaleless boss is annoying and very shallow that makes you fight with the framerate more than the boss itself, even with DSFix.- Ceaseless Discharge boss is lazy and has a stupid cheese way of beating it.- Demon Firesage boss is literally a reskinned Asylum Demon.- Centipede Demon boss is unfun and an eyesore with all the lava.- Four Kings boss is nothing more than a DPS rush where you can't even dodge some attacks.- Bed of Chaos boss is one of the worst designed bosses in any video game ever. It's like they didn't even playtest it.Other than almost half the game feeling rushed and 9 of the 26 boss battles being either lame or stright up horrible bosses, the game's positives greatly outweigh the negatives, but they should not be glossed over. Still one of my favorite games and even at its worst it's still better than most games released today 8/10.			"

												Dark Souls will be one for the ages to me. This is the kind of game that is completely brutal but rewarding at the same time. I raged, and raged hard at some encounters, because this game holds nothing back, but it forces you to also think on your tactics as you progress through the game. It will give you all the tools you need to get through it, you just need to think and plan accordingly. And they are completely right, the feeling of accomplishment you get upon beating a particularly hard section or encounter is unlike any most games out there can give you. I especially enjoy how big monsters actually FEEL like big monsters, as in, they can easily crush you if you're not careful. It was a thrilling and challenging ride, but I loved it and it is now easily one of my favorite games of all time. Highly replayable as well, there are tons of secrets to find here.Elaborating why I liked this game though, hell, even discussing the minimal detail on this game would actually derail and spoil you the experience, in my honest opinion. This is one of those games you're supposed to pick up and play, while going in completely blind. You'll be shafted many times, count on that, and you'll probably seethe with frustration, but you'll adapt, improve as a player, and maybe even overcome the challenges ahead. This is definitely not a game for everyone though, the difficulty is up there.The port wasn't the best, but I did just fine using an Xbox 360 gamepad and DSFix, an unofficial fix that fixes many of the problems it has - http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfix. I was able to go through the game quite well, barring one single crash, and some minor framerate issues here and there. That's better than what any Bethesda RPG can really claim in terms of performance, and I love the hell out of those games too.Bottom line, if you have this game on Steam and didn't play it yet, I URGE you to finish this review, and go install it and play it right now. You may end up loving it or hating it, but either way, you won't come out indifferent to it. Even better, now that Steamworks has finally been implemented, you have no excuse. Go die lots of times, go curse that one boss who keeps kicking your ♥♥♥, it'll all be worth it once you finally manage to beat him down, I promise.Praise the Sun!			"

												If you're considering buying Dark Souls, you should ask yourself how much you really appreciate a good challenge. Dark Souls is a game that embraces difficulty, and not in a monotonous grind-y way like Ninja Gaiden or I Wanna Be The Guy. Dark Souls does not spoonfeed you victory like so many modern games: it expects you to learn from your mistakes and hopefully prevent them in the future. Persevering through From Software's epic may seem daunting, especially at the beginning, but if you open yourself to it, Lordran can be a fascinating and emotional place. Dark Souls is packed full of monstrosities and deities alike, and although its numerous bosses are not easily felled, triumphing over them will be one of the most rewarding victories you'll likely ever experience.

												In a world where games are designed to give you kind of power fantasy feeling for doing jack squat, this action RPG is unafraid to punch you in the face. With an iron gauntlet. Spiked. Repeatedly. Telling you to toughen up, learn to dodge, block and/or parry, and above all, fight back.But it's fair at that - when you do learn how to block, dodge, fight back, then you truly know you do deserve that power fantasy feeling. Or deserved to die for failing to dodge or misstepping that ledge and plunging into ever so eagerly welcoming embrace of gravity.Come here if you want to know what a game designed ground up to be challenging, but fair, means. As opposed to misnaming ♥♥♥♥ easy difficulty as ""normal"" and then making ""hard"" just by halfheartedly upping sponginess and numbers of enemies.Beware though, this game really does not hold your hand in any way and you barely get any pointers what to do or where to go, or what various things mean or do - you may end up needing to do some research on wikis etc.The game has interesting take on multiplayer, creating peer to peer network of game worlds (citing temporal anomalies in game lore) that enables various interactions between players. But that, in terms of PvP, I wouldn't call fair, as the game is min maxer's and twinker's paradise and you *will* get totally funked up by relatively overpowered real human adversaries, which, unlike PvE enemies, will give no room to breathe whatsoever. Unless you become one of them, or play majority of game in ""hollow"" state which doesn't let you summon help but also prevents other players from invading your world to kill you.But yeah that summoning of help, letting willing players help you kill bosses - or trying to help others yourself - is part of multiplayer experience as well, along with getting that feeling of shared struggle, seeing various messages left by others or just their apparitions as they hang out by the bonfire or fight in their own world.. and die.The world design is really great (though I think designers had some fetish towards flying buttresses which suspiciously often feature as the only bridge forward). All in all the world is not too huge, and not too open, but is very interconnected, like a tree becoming a graph, opening up more and more, where completing one segment allows you to open a shortcut to places you already visited. It's always a great feeling, recognizing some place you've already been to, now approaching it from a different side... Or even remembering that this ruin up on the hill you've seen the other day, now you're in it, looking down at the ruins you've been into a few days back. You get this sense of adventure, exploration, cohesive but diverse world, dread, desperation, death, misery, sublime, wonder, having to decide on your own which branch of the world to explore next, until you meet a dead end, temporary or otherwise, or the local boss to defeat (and sense of accomplishment once the deed is done), and then repeat, explore, fight, git gud.Praise the sun!

It's not as hard as people say but playing through the game for the first time can be really frustrating. This game doesn't hold your hand, but it doesn't try to cut off your wrist either. The story is very vague unless you take the time to dig through every description of every item or if you bother talking to the NPCs. You aren't told where to go but what you must do, its up to you to figure out what works best for you, how much you want to engage in the online play (which on this PC port it takes forever to connect to anyone without the use of mods), and how you wish to take on your enemies as you progress. There are quite a few optional places to go, lots of loot to find, and many enemies to kill along the way. Take your time and absorb all of the information the game throws at you, enjoy your first experience through the game. I recommend playing with a controller as the keyboard and mouse controls are just terrible without mods, if you want to play with a very active online community you should aim for one of the console releases of the game, though there is still a bit of a PC community for this game.

												One of the most brilliant RPGs of recent years, a legitimate heir to Severance: Blade of Darkness[en.wikipedia.org], Gothic (by Piranha Bytes) and Rune. Dark Souls makes you re-evaluate your understanding of gaming process, challenges all your skills and nerves, and gives you a rare sense of deep immersion on that very special and rare scale. Not recommended for casual gamers and kids. World of pain, tortures  and death ahead. And strange sun cults, and demons, and big snakes, and spiders, and skeletons. And Mushrooms. And lots of strange and crazy stuff.  Still, get the game and play it already! It's a rare gem you're missing. And remember - it's only possible to learn through death. TLDR: 10/10 brilliant\О/			"

Dark Souls: Prepare to Die EditionI've never thought before that Dark Souls would became one of the best games I've ever played !Thank you Lord that I paid attention on this title even I had not been interested in earlier !It's something more than just great game. It is a real masterpiece, some kind of unique experience which permanently changed my point of view of all dark fantasy games. It will never be the same as it had been before I turned on Dark Souls for the first time.Thank you From Software for this awesome game you created and thank you very much for the PC conversion which allowed me to travel through the Lordran and to spend almost 500 hours there having great fun even that everything around me simply wanted to kill me over and over again !Dark Souls: Prepare to Die EditionUnquestioned 10 / 10 "

												What is the best part about playing a video game? Is it the thrill of watching the visual effects of a plane crash through a building and the amazement of the graphical destruction caused by the building crashing down to pieces? Is it the Hollywood style action sequences which keep the adrenaline rush going till you eventually want to jump out from the window to try and catch that ledge? Is it the thrill of racing or playing in a football game which one might not be able to achieve in real life? All of these can qualify as perfectly valid reasons for playing video games. But for me, they’re a bit too superficial. My reasons for playing games are much more basic. For me, its all about failing and trying again to correct myself. The possibility of death and the chance of life after it really intrigue me. I love a challenge, and i love to be rewarded for playing well and punished for being stupid. And in that regard, i feel Dark Souls is one of the best games i’ve ever played.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: FromSoftwarePublishers: Bandai Namco Entertainment Initial release: Aug 2012Genre: Action, RPG, Dark#Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationI really like this game. It's punishing but boy is it rewarding. I never played Demon Souls so this is my first ""Souls"" experience. (Lets just pretend the GFWL and DSfix stuff never happened, it runs great) Going through this blind the first time, it was literally one of the most nerve racking and scary games I've ever played (scary in the sense of losing everything you've earned thus far in a single instance.) What I really enjoyed about it was that it feels similar to how rogue-likes are played but within a over-arching game. Every death you learn something new. The game never feels like it cheating you. It's always telling you to be more patient, more cautious and punishing you when you fail to heed to the lessons you hopefully learned. The in depth lore that has to be searched for and interpreted has pros and cons. I personally found  the digging to be well worth it. You could say that it could use a minimap but I would argue that having to remember the maps, item locations, and enemy traps are what gives it the essence of ""Souls"".I continue to mess around and play with diffirent character builds. Very satisfying experience.Follow my curation for more "

												I was particularly stressed out because of work, exams at uni and issues in my personal life when I started to play this game, so this was my little island of peace where I could calm my nerves after a long day... I don't understand what's the big fuss with this game, I've only broken 2 keyboards, a table and my arm in outbursts of rage.Ok, jokes aside I've bought this game in 2014, played it for 15 minutes, got killed by the Asylum Demon, uninstalled the it and I didn't touch it for 2 years. I'm not sure why... usually I'm not a whiny little b...ch when it comes to a challange in games but I gave it another shot a few weeks ago and oh boy... I was an idiot back then. I probably still am but that's another thing.This game is an absolute beast! The scenery is diverse and jaw-dropping even by today's standards (at least for me), the gameplay gives a solid challange, and the boss fights are epic. Yes, it's hard, yes, you'll die a 1000 times (I sure did) but as you play more you'll get better and the joy that you feel when you kick a boss' ♥♥♥ after failing so many times will compensate you for the pain/anger/despair etc that you've felt after every failed attempt.The only downside for me was the ""lack of story""... I'm a sucker for a great plot in games (normally for me the story matters the most) but here It seemed like the story is not an organic part of the game, maybe I just didn't pay enough attention but it was pretty hazy and uninteresting to me. The other thing that I missed was a badass soundtrack... especially at bosses. There are a few good scores but for most of the time it's pretty forgettable. I had to put in some rock songs during boss fights to get myself in a pumped-up state in order to beat the s..t out of them.Overall; the game is fun/hard like hell and I'll definitely pick up the sequels as soon as I can!

												This was it, the game that ruined multiplayer for me forever.Playing through Dark Souls with a friend was one of the most rewarding and greatest experiences I've ever had in a video game. And since that time, no game has even come close to delivering such an addictive story and fun time. I've been given suggestions, Borderlands 2, Gears of War, Torchlight II, but none can compare. Unfortunately the same holds true for Dark Souls 2, which did not deliver as enchanting a story as it's precurser.  The truth is, this game was just too good. And I feel robbed of my appreciation of other games because of the standard this game has set for me.Not but really, this games amazing, go buy it and play it. Now.			"

												Dark Souls is easily one of my favorite games ever made. The gameplay is sophisticated, but it isn't too complicated once you understand the stats and what they mean. Controls are tight, and everything works as it should. The world is deep and rich with an interesting lore that isn't shoved in your face. You basically have to read item descriptions and pay close attention if you really want to understand the world From has crafted. Or you can just do what normal people do and kill stuff and move on. The story of the game is very implicit, but the direction is clear if you talk to NPCs. Multiplayer is a big part of the game, with coop existing by summoning friendly phantoms to assist you in your world. There is also Player vs. Player, which is the main draw for me, and it's fantastic aside from the occasional lag and balancing issues. One of the main problems with the game was that it used Games for Windows Live, but that's gone now and the multiplayer is better than ever. The PC Port is just god awful though. It's locked to a low resolution and framerate and the keyboard controls seem to have been designed by a monkey with half a brain. This is all fixed by Durante's mod DSFix, which is very easily installed. Once everything works as it should, the multiplayer of this game is phenomenal. The game has a reputation for being brutally difficult and unfair, but that's not really true. The game's difficulty comes from its punishing nature. If you make a mistake, you're gonna get messed up. Playing carefully is the best way forward (read: get good). Nothing about the game is intrinsically unfair aside from gravity being overpowered.The community in this game is fantastic as well, but it has its fair share of tryhards that will send hatemail at the slightest infraction of their self-imposed moral code. I've gotten death threats for not bowing before a fight before. You learn to move past these people, and you find some seriously funny and dedicated people that make this game's community great. Youtubers like VaatiVidya, Iron Pineapple, and formerly OnlyAfro (Rest in Peace good Afro) make pretty great videos that also add to the community of the game.In summation, this game is a must-play for anyone that doesn't mind fixing a small amount of issues. The game is punishing, but never unfair and the multiplayer is to die for. Get it? Also, Git Gud  "

												For a few seconds, nothing happened. Then - ""FIRE THE BASS CANNON!"" exploded from every speaker in the room. A blaze of fire carpeted the path from the door, and seconds later, the wooden obstacle was blown from its hinges. The Legend had arrived.Without even breaking a sweat, Giantdad grabbed the hacker by the head in mid-swing, twisting him so he looked at the face of No-Mercy right in the eyes.""Wt rings u gt, bicth?"" it asked, without really caring to hear the answer.The hacker squirmed under the intense grip, swinging his Crystal Greatsword madly. ""You only live once, ♥♥♥♥♥,"" it continued, impaling the hacker with its Chaoshander +5. ""Unless you're a Legend.""Then, the Legend falcon-punched the hacker, slicing his head from his shoulders in less than a second. Giantdad surveyed the scene, pleased with his work, and began to walk away.Then, as if forgetting something, it turned back around, and strode up to one of the only still-functional cameras in the room, and held his arms out wide in a gesture that it could pull off successfully. Finally, it whispered something so powerful, one would need an oscilloscope to appreciate it properly.""THE LEGEND NEVER DIES!""			"

												Welcome to dark souls, prepare to die. This will be a review of the full experience including DLCs. You play by freely walking around in third person with full jumping abilitys, even over low railings and with them often..well death. Enemies will have a certain aggro range and once you reach this they approach you, you hit the enemy by having them be where your attack lands, akin to Skyrim for comparison, only third person.Dark souls adds a lock-on mechanic on top of this, meaning you then permanently aim at the enemy when using it, allowing you to control where you attacks are directed to, as well as making dodging a lot easyer by being able to focus where ""away"" is.In its essence dark souls is like other action RPGs but it doesn't hold your hand or mess around. There is no map, dying makes you lose a decent chunk of progress, ""savepoints"" are few in between (but you can quit and come back anywhere) and saving brings back all enemies and most importantly all enemies are OP and kill you in barely any time. This is mostly fair though once you get used to the fact that you dont slay mass amounts of enemies and level up but rather fight for dear life constantly. And pretty much all enemies are just a matter of skill, if you master the controls and learn their moveset you will barely take any hits anymore and thus the fact that you die so easyly will matter less. Speaking of controls, for the love of god do this with a controller, even on pc, it makes things a lot more managable. Also they are a bit clunky, which gets improved upon with later parts, for example you can only dodge in 4 directions, even though often you would have needed a couple more.Mastering is easyer said than done though, especially when you choose to fight the enemy close up, you will have to dodge every attack perfectly and in the right direction, know when to attack what to block etc. etc. and the game will punish mistakes by allowing the enemies powerful strikes to get you. This is where all the difficulty comes from, dodged too early twice? Often this means you are dead. This is actually even part of the charm, so a giant monstrosity successfully smacks you with a club, well you should be dead. And look at that you are. It makes you get to learn how enemies behave and to respect them. Once you are done with this you will probably never forget any of the bosses and most of the enemies will remain with you forever, their moveset, how to fight them. And that's not something most slightly more greyish orcs in other games can claim.And o boy the enemy design together with the places you find them in is probably the games strongest point, it makes monstrosities look truly twisted and evil, dragons and giants fearsome and the enemies always fit the locations, knights in castles, killershrooms in forrests, and have a reason for being where they are what they are as well as for trying to kill you. Allthough speaking of looks the game looks even older than it is, obviously no modern standard but I'd say still good enough to be very enjoyable.And once you succeed, once you get into the flow, it feels incredibly rewarding, because all together this means said giant looks like it will just rolfstomp you, and it WILL stomp you so you take all of your skill and roll away right as his giant weapon approaches and attack in the moment of breath his opening leaves for you until you have finally worn him down to death. It just feels like a ""realistic"" boss fight would and should play out.Also the game usually hints at danger, even though it is subtle, for example with burnt corpses, animating you to run for your life.Now a couple of difficulties are unneccesary though. For example as I said there is no map and of course that would break the immersion to a certain degree but you get so damn lost so easyly and until very late in the game you always will have to find your way by foot no fast travel and often not even obvious paths. I believe having a largely reduced map to at least help you out a little would help so much.The cameraangle can also sometimes be your downfall, luckily though this isnt common.And the worst part about the game in my opinion is a lack of guidance about what to do. Again obviously there is reasons not to hold hands and give door by door directions, however, let me just give you an example:right after the tutorial you are at a crossroads. there is many paths to choose and all look like a neat adventure. WRONG all but one of them kill you and there is no real way for you to know except for kind of not being able to beat the enemies and constantly dying. But it is dark souls, perhaps you just need to improve! No, just no, you are running against an impossible wall and dont even know it yet. This goes further with how ridicoulous the things you need to do to advance get. It is basically talk to NPC A then go back get item B at location C and then and ONLY then you can advance in a place that is nowhere near any of this and seems to have absolutely nothing to do with any of it. This is some hold the red orb and jump in a tornado type of how are you supposed to know that.Also some of the bosses are just absolutely hard even for Darksouls standards, requiring pitch perfect reactions even more than other enemies and coming at you with incredible ferocity, basically forcing you into a 3 minute cycle of perfection or death. Most of these are optional though. There is actually a lot of extra content, new enemies places bosses etc. both via DLC and just in the game in general for that extra touch of everything that makes Dark souls what it is.FInally the story: it's complicated. Aside from an absolutely amazing introduction there is no cutscenes to establish anything and while you know your general world and goal kinda, there is such an incredible hidden amount of lore. Like you kill a boss and its eh whatever, though it looked neat, but in reality this was person X responsible for event Y and major player in the history of the world, but you will never know that, because tidbits are hidden in item descriptions of all places, NPC dialogs and most importantly piecing together piece by piece and theorizing. Oh and the music is pretty neat, subtle, underlining the emotion rather than setting it and just great tracks.A final key note: multiplayer. At this very moment a revival event is happening and you can actually find people again but thats like once a year and only a few days. At all others times there is a chance you are literally the only person in the game and this kills a lot of gameplay, though not key experiences they are a defining part of what makes this game. For example in certain areas of the game another player could choose to jump into your world to fight you, because things arent already hard enough. Or the fact that there is a certain selection of texts applyable anywhere in the world for all to see. (and this is usually used to write ""treasure"" at the edge of a cliff) there is ""covenants"" basically factions in the game with their own items places rewards concepts etc and there is a LOT of them. All pretty much useless without multiplayer. So if you check this game out see when the next revival event is and then see how the entire experience changes.Tl:DR:amazing setting and design, brutally complicated, buy if you love piecing together a great story fantasy action RPGs, fast reaction based challenges.Got eaten alive by a lootbox 10/10			"

My Personal Score: 4.5/5PCGamingWiki Page[pcgamingwiki.com]Issues: This is a very unoptimized port. Visit the PCGW page before you click the purchase button.DLC: None. Prepare To Die Edition comes packaged with the Artorias of the Abyss DLC from the consoles.Microtransactions: None.Dark Souls is a very difficult game, yet my experience with it can only be described as gratifying. It consistently challenged me and appropriately rewarded my efforts for taking risks, never treating me like a child that requires constant hand-holding, but as an adult who can assess and adapt to the situation at hand. The game forced me to be patient and calculating, testing my limits, and mocking everything that I knew about games, but all of the challenges that I came across were worth it in the end because it gave me that satisfying sigh that one gets after overcoming an obstacle which kept you in place for minutes - even hours - on end. It will be jarring at first, but if you're prepared to die (a lot) and willing to take challenges which the modern gamer would quickly deem intolerable, I'm sure you'll be rewarded with the same satisfaction that Dark Souls gave its players.And there you have it.

												I love Dark Souls old school style when it comes to difficulty. They don't hold your hand by giving you tutorials, practice runs, etc. 10/10 and 1 of my top 10 favorite games. Yes, it's a really hard game but that's what makes it so awesome! It gives you that sense of accomplishment when you do manage to beat that boss, clear that area or whatever the game throws at you.Edit: This game is a ""bad"" console port so I highly recommend that you get DSFix to get the best PC experience. You can find it on Nexus. Edit 2: The 60 FPS unlocker in the .ini file for DSFix is a little wonky. It can lead to issues with the games engine like falling through the world or getting stuck while sitting at a bonfire.Don't forget to read the desription!!! DSFix Download[www.nexusmods.com] "

												An excellent and highly deadly way to waste your life. But seriously, if you're the sort of person who gets frustrated by dying a lot, or likes game mechanics explained to you this game is -not- for you. Also, the storyline appears quite late in the game and is somewhat hard decipher, so heads up if you can't deal with vague plotlines.			"

												Bought it after hearing it was challenging and well designed. Within 5 hours I could definately see the two shine. After 110 hours I realized I was either overpowered or just better at the game. (Bosses started dying on try 1 or 2)After 138 hours I realized this game was just simply really bumping good. (I've never played anything that does half of what this game does) The developers weren't afraid of trying very different fights later on (which I appreciate)The sparce soundtrack that is almost purely contained in boss fights is thoroughly stellar. The game really knows how to make a guy feel as bad as possible for killing things/people that didn't need to die.Before even finishing I was thinking about the build I would try for my next playthroughAfter beating this with mouse, keyboard, and scythe, I wonder if difficulty is different with a controller :/And Don't Get Me Started On The Lore			"

												Dark souls, My favorite game, my favorite series. I own 5 copies of this game. Why you ask? well Ill tell you. Demon souls started this new genre. Its an action rpg yes. But its more than that. It is something so new to the gaming world that was desprately needed. A game that you actually playSo many games now hold your hand so much that you are not even really playing the game, you are just clicking a series of actions to keep the game progressing. There are not many games that actually require you to learn the world, the system, the enemies and Much, Much more. Dark souls just does that. it throws you into this unknown world with nothing more that a few scribbled notes on the ground to get you started. Has you killed over and over within 2 minutes of the game, just to give you a hint on what is coming. Yes dark souls is a challenge, But you know what has kept me coming back after nearly 1200 hours over multiple consoles? The reward. The insanely gratifying feeling when you kill that boss after so many tries, Get through that area to that fog door, Finally kill that Hacker who has invaded you 30 times. Nothing, and I MEAN NOTHING   compares to that feeling, Especially no other series. Dark souls holds a special place in my heart, It has been there in the hard times in my life to take my mind somewhere new. Get my head strait. It may have an incredible reputation for being super difficult and you will probably hear someone say it is unfair. It may be difficult, but it is not unfair. Any time you die, it is your fault it is something you didn't do, maybe you did not understand it yet. But that in its essence is what dark souls is. A game to help you understand. A game to help you overcome its challenges and make you better prepared for life. Cause thats really in an essence how we deal with life, LIke a moth Flittering towards a flame.			"

												""This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t."" This was my first thought when Asylum Demon wrecked me for the 6th time... Then I saw that door there. And it took me 1 hour! Yeah I wasn't good in this game, so as other newbies, but instead of giving up I countinued because I was curious what challenges await for me. Then I spent another hour finding out that the skeletons don't want be my friends in the graveyard. *Travel in time* Ornstein and Smough (or Pikachu and Snorlax as I call them) was the first boss fight where I felt that now I need help I won't get through here without help. Then I saw a magnificently glowing sing and with that sign I saw promises for the future. Yeah Solaire got wrecked after we took down Pikachu. But then the reward was beauty and *cough* big ""melons"" >.> what I later found out it was a lie. Okay my review is getting longer so must short it.In short this game was painfully, hard, and sometimes I felt it unfair. Yeah we all know that feel, but it never was unfair, everytime when I died I was about to ragequit but no because then I was thinking ""I'm so stupid bc I did this instead of that"" the game is rewarding, the reward is that you can survive more, get better, and if you take a time you can figure out the story too. I had this dark feeling every locations in this game like in the Painted World, it was so terrifying seeing those corpses as crows biting them (and the surprise crow people was gave me shiver).And now let me talk about the community and PvP. When I first encountered a fight with another player in my second playthrough I was so scared, I ran to Queelag with my phantom and guess what? I got killed because I didn't watched my back and took a chaos stormin full. But then again community is still helpful and after that the ""enemy"" helped with the boss. There are a lot of player still doing PvP, there are honourable players, and there are Darkwaiths and Darkmoonblades. If you don't study your enemies they will kill you PvE experience which needs to PvP.I'm not too good  to short things but finally I can say what's wrong with the game. The only thing what it bothers me, that's the summoning faileds and failed to invade nothing else.I would praise this game untill my death and after that too, If only I could be so grossly incadescent.

												Dark Souls, the game everyone recommended me to play, the game I tried to play a few years back, the game I couldn't play because I went in the wrong direction when I started...A year or two later I decided to give it a shot one more time. This time, I took some time to explore every bit of Firelink Shrine (starting location) and found the ACTUAL easier/do-able sarting path, with ennemies that won't one-shot my character.It's hard, very hard. Especially during the first couple of hours. The learning curve is steep but is also super entertaining. Getting your build right, upgrading your weapons and gears, fighting difficult ennemies and epic bosses, progressing through a fantastic storyline, all of these are the reasons I came to love Dark Souls. I died a lot, I sill do, but learning how the game works and how to defeat every ennemy by learning their patterns and their weak spots really helps a lot.PvP in 2016 isn't like it was back then but it still works. I recommend this game to anyone who likes RPGs for their storyline and games with a difficult learning curve.--------------------------------------------------------------Single Player: 10/10 Amazing lore, goergous ennemy design and patterns, stunning landscapeMultiplayer: 7/10 Co-op and PvP both included in the game. Could be betterGraphics: 9/10 Amazing dark theme with beautiful landscapes and interesting locations. Not the most polished graphics but still amazingCommunity: 9/10 Streamers, nice wiki and many videos--------------------------------------------------------------0 Comments	 Subscribe to thread  (?)

cons:-Areas left unfinished like Lost Izalith.-Heavy framerate issues even with dsfix, really really bad port in general.-Areas with even more framerate issues.-In a game that encourages different builds, too much value is given to the endurance stat. Also resistance is futile.-DEX makes casting spells faster, which makes no sense-Reusing a really bad boss multiple times.-Durability is a joke.-Gravelord covenant is a messy mess that could have been very entertaining.-White Way covenant is virtually useless.-Good luck invading as a Blade of the Darkmoon (even when this game was at peak population).-Badly designed platforms in Crystal Cave, your character slides like its buttered-covered teflon in some parts.-The Bed of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t-Some rings are unbalanced, allowing to stack multiple benefits to one statistic, flippy ring is still silly.-Most spells are unoriginal, boring stuff (like the multiple soul arrow spells and fireballs).-Camera lock-on clunky at times.-Camera auto-adjust can make you fall from a platform if you're not careful.-Clunky, bad designed interface for the inventory, very limited in options.-Misleading marketing from bamco in the difficulty of the game when that never was the intention of the director.pros:-its a really good game			"

												As far as the fun goes, it's the best game in Dark Souls series and one of the best games I played in general.Things I liked the most:- Amazing if not the best world design out there- Breathtaking boss fights that can leave you both amazed and frustrated at times- The whole combat mechanic is very well designed & developed- Very deep lore. You can spend hours just reading what this game is all about- One of the rare games with good Co-op- High learning curve. Even after beating the whole game you will still find yourself learning/trying new stuffThings you should look after:- The graphics are bad, but this didn't affect the overall experience for me- PC optimization is bad. During some boss fights FPS can get as low as 10.- Literally unplayable without a controller (unless you are willing to try out some mods)There is no reason to skip this game if you liked any other from Dark Souls series. The newcomers will have a hard time (that's how it goes with any other Souls game) but at the end it is definitely worth the struggle. You will hear someone saying Git Gud :)If I had to rate this game, it would be 9/10 with optimization issues being the only downside. "

													I really wanted to like this game, I really wanted a hard game, What I got was a confusing mess. Dark Souls sets of to be an “Old School” game, where the term old school means confusing, unclear, vague, and downright purposefully clunky. 	I knew what I was getting into, a game that is suppose to be tough at first, but over time has solid mechanics that keep you coming back in the same way Ninja Gaiden (Xbox) was. What this game is, is a complete miss an all cylinders.	The game starts off dumping you into a jail/keep where you have to escape from. During that about 20 minutes are very very basic tutorials. Right bumper = swing, right trigger = heavy swing. Which is good, but right after if gives you the button assignments, nothing. Oh and the stats system and leveling up good luck on that, nothing helpful is said about it. It's worth noting that any time your user has to look up a walk through to understand something as central as what stats do what to an RPG game, the developer should really take a step back and ask “How and what information am I communicating to the user?” If what is needed to be conveyed is central to the understanding of the game system, and is purposefully or negligently concealed you have already made a huge mistake. Dark Souls takes this mistake and makes it a central game mechanic.  	I get the sense that at some point the developers wanted to make a fighting/hack and slash system that was consistent, in that there was no slicing through enemies (because you missed the hit box) which is a good idea. Again though the game comes to a crashing to a halt when you consistently die without any understanding of what you could have done differently to result in a better outcome. Again Dark Souls hides information from the user, you'll get combat pop-up bars that are conveying information but what that information is you are never told. Is that meter something positive or a negative? You won't know because at no point does the game ever clue in the player to what their avatar is dealing with. 	I could go on but I have a feeling I'll be drowned out by people telling me I should have played longer then I did. I'm not a teenager, I have a full time job and I get precious few hours of free time. I do not want to use them dealing with a game that seeks to make itself more challenging by keeping information from me.			"

												This game has an incredibly cohesive and immersive world, with great level design and enemy placement. It also features a very responsive combat system, and a wide range of possibilities in character design to add replayability. Unfortuntately, its pvp system features bad netcode and no cheat prevention, but it's still fun at times. The game gets called hard because it refuses to hold your hand and no one knows how to deal with that, but it's not really that difficult--it just has an incredibly steep learning curve. It does require the extensive use of a wiki to fully understand, which is very unfortunate, as there are some mechanics that the game only gives you hints for when in reality you need a textbook, for example, weapon upgrade systems. Luckily, such wikis exist, though at times they get things wrong. Overall, a highly engaging and enjoyable game with a very deep background lore. 8/10.Bad PC port, though.			"

												This game changed my life.The combat system is FAR superior to other action RPGs.This is a modern classic.It is, however, a broken PC port. You MUST install DSFIX in order to play the game with a decent experience.It's locked to 30 FPS.If you're frustrated with the poor quality of this pc port, try Dark Souls II. It's a native PC game, not a port, and it runs great.However, you should still play the first Dark Souls. It's an unique experience. Even with all the bugs and glitches and locked FPS.WARNING: You will never be able to play games with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat system EVER AGAIN.Also, big fathers.			"

												Dark Souls™: Prepare to Die™ Edition (With two ™'s, it's probably trademarked) is the port everyone asked for, but no one really wanted.Prepare to die is a major tagline for the game, and is the last thing your computer will ever hear, because Dark Souls is so hard, it has the ability to manifest bosses in our world inside your machine, to destroy it from the inside.You start off by making your hero with a powerful character creator, rented straight from Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion team, allowing you to create any type of potato you wish.After you finish your vegetable appearing character, you can finally start the game. Owning a game controller will allow you to skip 3 of the bosses: Lord ♥♥♥♥-Camera, and the mentally handicapped siamese twins, Keybohd n' Mawz.The gameplay is ripped from Super Mario 64, with platforming and hopping into paintings to fight bosses, with Metroid and Zelda thrown in for good measure. The soundtrack is actually composed completely by Finnish metal band Apocalyptica, who also designed the whole game, Keeping the frames at a crisp 30 frames per second. It also takes advantage of Microsoft's revolutionary service: Games for Windows LIVE, which brings the power of Xbox LIVE right to your PC! I hope you hate playing video games, because Games for Windows LIVE sure does.Trademarked Souls™: Prepare to Trademark™ Edition is a fine edition to steam, and will compete directly with Valve's first person shooter action sidescrolling point n click adventure game DOTA 2.Awful/5			"

												Dark Souls: Prepare To Die.Oooohhh, Dark Souls. You know, I actually avoided playing this game at first (but still nabbing it in a pretty good sale, but let it sit for a year or two in my library...) because of the famed difficulty of the game. I just passed it off as something that it didn't really follow it's tagline.Why did I pass this game up?I completely missed it's prime. What do I mean?This is a single player game that combines multiplayer in it's world. But how? Well, you're given phantoms of what other players are doing at random times, being able to make pre-written messages and warn others (or trick others) about the future obstacles. Some are even more friendly, extending their hand to help escort you through a zone, and even fight bosses with you! Some...will invade your world, in a attempt to take your experience points.Everyone's moved onto DS3, so this game is quieter than it should be. Invasions are rare, co-oping with random players is a complete pain in the ♥♥♥♥...most of the PVP groups you can join in the game is rendered useless by the quiet of the game. Thankfully, there almost always seems to be at least a handful of people on, playing the game, at any time of the day.I'm counting this against the game, as, in it's current state, the community playing it has mostly moved on to DS3. Onnnn the other hand, those who prefer to avoid the multiplayer aspect will have a alright time knowing that invasions will be far and few. But it's still something that deters from the experience.Let me adress the tagline, ""Prepare To Die."" Yes, this is a game where you cannot take combat as a joke. If you're unprepared, you will die. Nearly every single time I've died, I've had to blame myself for the mistakes I made. However! There are areas in the game that made me scratch my head in utter confusion and anger when I died. For example, deep within the catacombs, there's a hole you can drop down. However, before you even reach the hole, a creature under it already has locked onto you and is aggro'd against you. So, when I dropped down, there was a high chance I'd be immediately killed IN MID-AIR. While you're in mid-air, you cannot perform any actions. So, you can very well be screwed while falling down. However! There's only a handful of hiccups this game has in it's level design. Such as the example I've personally dealt with. Perhaps I'm just bad at those segments, but there are times when my deaths are constant.A fair warning to you. If you find dragons sittin' around on a bridge, multiple small dragons, do not take them as a joke. No matter what level you are, they will still pose a very serious threat.The combat in this game is satisfying. Oh my. Out of all the games in my library, Dark Souls has the absolute best. Performing Backstabs and Counters for the first time is just badass on every level. And even now, 120 hours into the game, I still find them satisfying and dropping little one-liners to myself with certain weapons. Pure magic players will find a little harsher experience than those who fit magic into their repritoire, but Pyromancers will be fine. Miracles and Sorceries will have to work harder to stay on top.The less you know about Dark Souls, however, the better. Contrary to popular opinion, I actually kinda liked having to figure out the systems and Humanity on my own. So, try to be careful and avoid spoilers if you somehow already have. I say, get this game, and praise the sun! Even despite the fact that one of the biggest aspects of the game is a quiet one now, with DS3 having came out recently...it's still worth your time and money!			"

												With the fan made patches to fix resolution issues as well as other tweaks the PC version of this game is hands down the best.  I've played both Demon Souls and Dark Souls on the PS3 and enjoyed each of them.  Replaying this title on the PC was just as fun as the first time I went through it.  While some people have encountered issues with people implementing hacks to clone items and inflate skills I've yet to run into anyone who was doing this myself (Your mileage may vary).The game is hard, the game is unforgiving, and it's fun as all hell.

												This game is not for people with thin walls. This game is not for people with quiet neighbors. This is not for people who can cause significant damage to their surroundings when 'lightly' tossing their controller. This IS for people who dont care who hears them scream. This IS for people who love to slowly exhale while muttering every curse word there is known to man after losing 1.3m souls because of narrow walkways. 10/10 and I don't even meet minimum requirements. Note: Use a controller. Use DSfix. and git gud.			"

												+Cool art design and lore that goes together.+Good combat.Slow and steady gameplay. Helps you focus to the fights and think before acting.+Good level design.+Nice enemy&boss variety.+Challenging but not unfair. It's not trial&error but rather being careful and patient enough to avoid mistakes. And trying to learn from your mistakes if you failed.o PVP and Co-op are features but they're not polished at all.o The lore is there but it is too subtle. I wouldn't mind at least some dialogues from all those characters you talk to.o The shields are too good. If you can't use them you're bad and if you have a better shield you're better.o Backstabs are too powerful. But it is not like the game is easy. You don't have to abuse it if you don't want to but this will not stop the game from killing you. A perfectly balanced game would make a dull game anyway so why not.- The port is beyond bad. It is dreadful. The resolution is low, fps drops, keyboard&mouse support is bad, you can't play with your friends. You gotta find some mods to fix those issues and they don't fix them completely. (There are mods for resolution and connectivity with your friends. FPS is still an issue and don't know about a keyboard mod.)- Netcode sucks for PVP, get backstabbed from front.- Some builds are not viable at all. You can choose to be a sorcerer but it is really easier to just go strength.- There are times where you will be frustrated because of bad AI, a weird platform that you can't stand on. But the game is about observing before acting and learning from your mistakes so it is not that bad.This game is hardly perfect, but it is a game. It let's you do your thing, find your way through challenges, it does not hold your hand. Like a game should do. This game is all about the game and nothing more. It knows what it is, it does not pretend to be a good PVP experience or a Co-op game. You have to go out of your way to use those features anyway. The good part is: This is a difficult game right? So You don't feel guilty when you can abuse the game, use your items, upgrade them, try magic, try ranged battle min/max. It is fun when you try to find your way around the game. The game is your enemy, you beat it as it beats you, but you still love it.This game is perfect in its imperfections. There are good builds, bad builds, good items, bad items, good bosses, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies, and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. But the joy you get from prevailing after all, that is a treasure.			"

												I'll divide this review into two sections: Game Review & PC Port Review then you can decide for yourself whether you would want to buy the PC version or look for a console copy.Game ReviewIntro:FROM Software's Soul Series first started by Demon's Souls on PS3. At the time of release, that game revolutionized the concept of difficulty. It was truly a challenging game that needed mastering. Dark Souls is no different, it is indeed very difficult and offers little to no help along the way. Tutorial is nothing more than explanation of controls and a few gameplay basics, nothing more. Dark Souls is not for the faint of heart, it takes a dedicated gamer to finish the game.Pros (+12):- Achievement through struggle, unforgiving difficulty which is very rewarding- Minimalistic plot that's open to player interpretation and fan theories- In-depth character customization and lots of equipment to choose from- Multi-player is uniquely integrated into single-player- Beautiful art design and breath-taking sceneries, visuals are great- High replay value which stems from the NG+ system- Inter-connected world and amazing level-design barring a few rushed locations- Each single step you take has permanent consequences, the game is auto-saved every moment- Epic boss and enemy designs- Even the weakest enemy can kill a careless end-game character, there is no true safety- Teaches real life lessons and is full of metaphors- No quests, no mini-map, no guidance, you are truly alone in a hostile worldCons(-4):- Audio and sound effects are boring and dull, soundtrack is uninteresting- Persistent network issues which will never be fixed- Intentional ""easy mode"" provided by some items or play-styles- Lousy English translation and occasional incomprehensible textGameplay = 10/10 ; Audio = 7/10 ; Visuals = 10/10 ; Story = 10/10Verdict: 9.75/10 - Almost PerfectDark Souls is truly a gem and one of the finest RPG titles of this generation, it is a game with a point to prove, lessons to teach and controllers to break. This is a must-play title for any true gamer in this generation.PC Port ReviewThis horrible monstrosity called a PC port is truly one of the worst ports in all history if not the absolute worst. This game is literally unplayable without a controller, if you're looking to play with Keyboard+Mouse you're going to be deeply disappointed. The game always displays X360 Buttons on the screen. Apart from that, the game itself is locked to 30 FPS and unlocking the framerate with mods causes several issues such as broken ladder animations and extremely short jumping distance.The port itself is borderline broken without the help of various fixes and modifications such as DSFix & PVPWatchdog. This is an utterly terrible PC Port with countless issues and problems that will never be officially fixed. If you have access to a last-generation console, I would highly recommend buying a console version instead because the PC port is plain broken.However, if you insist on playing the game on PC, use of modifications and fixes is mandatory.

												TL;DRI've been playing games since the DOS era, I really lost count of how many games I had played. If my lifespan permits, I would like to experience all the great games ever created, new or old. Dark Souls, is one of the brightest diamonds in history, easily in my top5 of all-time. But 10 years from now, what will happen to the online aspect of Dark Souls? Nothing lasts forever, even all things good will eventually come to an end. Before that happens, if you are a true gamer, do yourself a favour, overcome your own Dark Souls, and you will never be the same again. Put simply, to emerge victorious in this Trial of Mentality, you have to become a stronger person than you are today.9.7/10IF YOU HAVE MORE TIME TO READFor those of you sitting on the fence due to reviews of a bad PC port, worry not. I am playing this on Windows 7, without any controller, without any 3rd party fix, and it works just fine. My guess is they had released a recent patch to fix most of the complaints. You can always change the key bindings to something you like. My only issue is that sometimes the camera is too near, but that is more of a small annoyance since you can't really zoom out.THINGS I LIKE:+ Level up mechanic, reminds me of Diablo 2 but more extensive and better+ Choose the level of online interaction you want at any time, you can play it like Single-player, Co-op or PVP! It's like half an MMO. At minimum there are still some subtle ""interference"" between you and other online players (players can leave messages on ground to warn other players; bloodstains show a ghostly playback of how a previous player died; occasionally see ""ghosts"" moving around which is another real player)+ Variety of weapons & their associated combat moves+ Upgrading system of equipment+ Checkpoint system wil restart you at latest ""touched"" checkpoint when you die+ Epic Boss Fights+ Looting is easy because there is a shiny bright light over anything that is lootable+ No lengthy towning explorations or NPC conversations, just pure adventuring & combat+ 1-slot save system of no regrets+ Unlimited inventory space, take everything you want !+ Most importantly, this game makes you want to play it, you wake up everyday looking forward to your Dark Souls, and honestly, I haven't experience this kind of enthusiasm in any game for a long time			"

												The game humbles you.I know of no other game series that puts you in your place better than the Dark Souls series. The only thing responsible for your deaths is your own stupidity because there is no element of randomness. It's not the AI's fault you died. You failed to predict the actions of an easily readable computer. It's entirely up to you to understand your mistakes and correct them.It's not only difficult; the game reveals itself to be a truly immersive and expansive universe. The way the maps interconnect and the atmospheric lighting and sounds make you feel as if you really are the chosen undead with the world stacked against you. The characters have interesting storylines and perspectives, and the items you pick up come with a description explaining some of the lore that would otherwise go unsaid.Well, what is it? Muster up some patience and begin a fantastic adventure.			"

												This game will make you feel either like a powerless ant or a mighty god. It's just fantastic. Do you like that feeling of being so very close to victory and failing or making by a mere 10 hitpoints? Do you like esoteric game mechanics? Every step is a new discovery and it brings back memories of games from yore that didn't really feel the need to hand hold you all the way to victory.

												Once the annoying GFWL piece was removed, I purchased this game on sale.  I enjoy challenging games so I wasn't afraid of the rumors I heard about Dark Souls' difficulty.  Having never played Demon Souls, the spiritual predecessor, I was completely new to this series.  What I quickly learned is that the game is very overwhelming to new people and seriously lacks adequate in-game tutorials.  Many questions people start off with is ""What character should I be?"", ""Which weapons should I use?"", and ""Which skills should I spend souls on?""  The makers of the Dark Souls seemingly want you to experiment in the game to figure this out and some say this is part of the charm.Since the game can easily take at least 40 hours to complete, I simply didn't feel in the mood to play a difficult game AND not know what the heck is going on.  So what I did instead was to read a few beginner guides to Dark Souls (spoiler-free versions), and I really feel this helped the game be much more enjoyable.  Even several hours into the game I would have to go look up what a certain item is used for on a Dark Souls wiki page as well, for example.As for game play, there isn't much more for me to say that hasn't already been said 100x over.  I definitely recommend the game for those who enjoy challenging RPGs with emphasis on action fighting.  The large amount of big boss battles will give plenty of satisfaction.  The story and sense of adventure will also make you incredibly curious with each new area you enter.  When you are new to this game, it will engross you to the point that when you aren't playing, you'll be thinking about what is next and/or how to defeat a boss who has already killed you 10+ times.  This is one of those games you'll never forget.			"

												This is a HORRIBLE port. You have to use mods to even get it to be even slightly enjoyable. You are pretty much screwed if you do not have a gamepad of some sort because it is pretty much impossible to play without one. Don't get me wrong, this game is amazing on console and if you actually get it working correctly on PC, but I just can't recommend it.			"

												One of the best Co-op Games out there and the best Dark Souls Titles.Since Dark Souls Prepare to die Edition has been ported completly to Steam, it now has Steam Achievements which could off been ported over from the GFWL Version but you didn't have to. This Game is probably a the only Masterpiece in the Series. Why is that? Poise. Poise funktions and the game was not made to be difficult, it was made the way it should off been to be a game. Whilst other Dark Souls Games will Cheese you with the same copy + paste enemy, this games enemys are actually different from each other and have different attacks. This Game turned out to be difficult but fair. Unlike other Dark Souls titles that were made to be difficult and not fair at all. This Game is by far the best one they ever made and I think everybody should try it out and give it a little bit time. I took me 65 hours to like the game and 80 hours to find myself not dying around every corner, but all the struggle was worth it, since this now one of my favourite games that I play to this day.Since this Game is a bit older then the other Dark Souls Titles, the community actually made a connectivity Mod and a PVP Watchdog mod, where you can simply kick cheaters out. You also can install costum textures without getting banned.I can recommend this Game to anybody that loves challenges and Metroidvania Games for its full price, as you might spent more then 100 hours on it, however if you unsure whether you like it or not just grab it on sale or buy a cheap key.

The Pilgrims We are the Pilgrims, MasterWe shall go always a little further,It may be beyond the last blue mountain barred with snow,Across that angry or glimmering sea Go as a pilgrim and seek out danger Far from comfort and the well lit-avenues of life.Pit your very soul against the unknownAnd seek stimulation in the company of the brave.Experience cold and hunger, heat and thirstAnd survive to see another challenge and another dawn.Only then will you be at peace with yourself And able to know and to say:“I looked down on the farthest side of the mountainAnd, fulfilled and understanding all, I am cold and hunger, heat and thirstAnd survive to see another challenge and another dawn.Only then will you be at peace with yourself And able to know and to say:""I looked down on the farthest side of the mountainAnd, fulfilled and understanding all, I am truly contentThat I lived a full lifeAnd one that was of my own choice.""Enjoy your epic adventure, and have a nice day.中文：渣渣移植、没有优化、键鼠反人类、剧情靠脑补、战斗在裆下、Boss会自杀、欢乐二人转、举盾回合制...如此抖M神作不买能忍？买了不玩能忍？时间说明一切~其实我只是懒得浪费脑洞大开的时间码字而已，所以直接丢首好湿来凑篇幅了~~~			"

												First off let me tell you that this isnt a ♥♥♥♥ing game, its a MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING NIGHTMARE BRO! 5 Minutes out of the Firelink shrine i find myself greeted by what i call ""The Welcoming Comitee"". Composed of rotted flesh and stanky ♥♥♥ bones, this rag tag group of miscreants may seem like nothing more than trash mobs before the big boss, but dont be fooled. These conniving, conspiring, crestaceous mongoloids will utterly skull ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥ to no end with their insane knowledge of gokus ability to falcon punch you a thousand times within the window of a few seconds with their daggers forged in the fires of mount go♥♥♥♥yourself. It took me 30 hrs to master the ways of the welcoming comitee, and since then i feel ive accomplished little to no tasks in my life that have been more gratifying. Although i did come across a foe i fear has been created just to spite me. In the cave of the giants there lies a string of beasts that no man should dare to seek. They thrive in the darkness and live only to bring you to the brink of shoving your controller up your ♥♥♥. I call them RA-RA-RA's. Beware the giant skeletal canine-like beasts that will endlessly tear your character several new asses. As i reached the end of this game and entered the final room to the final boss. I felt as if my journey had been one of a kind. I had spent days, weeks, traversing this land, uncovering its secrets, and now it all ended here. I entered the room and suddenly i was blown away by the saddening music and atmosphere before me. It was almost too late to notice my foe mid air flying towards me. I set the controller down. Took a deep breathe. It was over. I won... i felt relief, then happiness. Then sadness. BUT WHY SADNESS THIS GAME TORCHERED ME TO THE BRINK?! Thats when i realized that this is more than a game, its a nightmare and nightmares become part of us, part of our souls. They define aspects of our lives, this game was the embodiment of my DARK SOUL. 100/10 would dark soul again.			"

TLDR VERDICTDark Souls is an innovative experience that provides challenging, yet extremely satisfying gameplay and a unique twist on multiplayer. Backed up with an intriguing narrative; absolutely stellar world design; all-round fantastic gameplay driven and atmosphere. An absolute must buy or at least try, as I believe everyone should experience this game, even if it doesn’t sound like your thing.FULL REVIEW BELOW”What is bravery, without a dash of recklessness” - Hawkeye Gough You are cursed. You are destined to die, again and again. You will keep dying, until you have lost your purpose and you become nothing but a hollow mindless husk. However, just maybe, there might be something different about you.This review is written from the perspective of a fan of story driven RPG games and games with well-designed open worlds, with an emphasis on player discovery and experimentation.GAMEPLAY AND DESIGNDark Souls has fairly straightforward gameplay mechanics that are simple to understand but are supposed to be adapted to your playstyle. Contrary to popular belief, Dark Souls isn’t what I would call an especially hard game. Sure it has difficult moments, but it’s just completely different from what you might expect from an open world RPG, which throws a lot of people off. The game essentially punishes you for relying on what might be the norm in other games of its genre. You need to rely on a more practical way of thinking to get a grip of how the game plays. For example: heavy armour is hard to move around in and big swords are hard to swing.The game introduces its fundamental mechanics very concisely and they aren’t anything you haven’t seen before. You have a health bar, a stamina bar, basic attack mechanics and so on. So if the game has such a simple and unoriginal sounding framework, why does it have such a massive following and a notorious reputation for difficulty? There’s a few reasons. The first is the enemies. Every new enemy in the game is different from the last. You need to observe their movements, their weapon and their body type to find an opening. The enemies are very firm, but fair (for the most part). They all have attack patterns and every pattern is avoidable, with a weakness you can exploit. Gauging what you attacks you can dodge and block and knowing when you can get hits in is all a part of the learning curve. Mastering bosses feels extremely satisfying. There are a few bosses that are arguably pretty “cheap” that might have you fighting the camera controls or jumping mechanics, but these are blemishes in otherwise fantastic array of enemies.Weapon and item variety is also fantastic. Whilst the stats and levelling system may seem overwhelming at first, you get your head around it very quickly and start experimenting. Almost every weapon has different move sets and they all feel unique. Just like studying your enemy’s vulnerabilities, you’ll need to look out for your own and they come from the type of weapon you use. There’s a massive selection of pretty much every fantasy melee and ranged weapon you can think of, with varying designs. If you replay other RPGs for alternate morality choices, you’ll replay Dark Souls for alternate weapon builds. Different weapon types require you to employ different tactics and can make entire playthroughs seem completely fresh even though you only changed your weapons. There is also a very intricate weapon upgrade system, which adds even more depth to the game.Dark Souls also has one of the best implementations of multiplayer I’ve ever seen in a game. The multiplayer is essentially built around the idea that we’re all screwed, but we’re all in this together. You can leave notes for other players that provide hints and sometimes good laughs. You can summon in other players to help you out with tricky areas. You can also invade other players and kill them in PvP combat if you feel really mean.The world design in Dark Souls is seriously genius. A lot of the areas interlock like a maze with shortcuts in logical places that actually make sense within the space of the world. No two areas occupy the same space within the world, everything fits together perfectly and you can see areas in the skybox of other areas. The amount of detail that actually went into the world design is jaw dropping. You navigate the world by walking around and looking for bonfires, which equate to checkpoints. These allow you heal up and bank your hard earned souls, which is basically currency. You lose all of your souls when you die and need to go back to where you died to pick them up. If you die again before getting them, you have lost them forever. This naturally can lead to a lot of stressful moments, especially when there is an invading player standing between you and hours of progress. The stakes just makes triumph all the more rewarding.STORY AND NARRATIVEDark Souls adopts some very subtle story telling techniques. You get a big grand cut scene at the start, that sets the scene for the world, but all the lore after that is pretty much hidden. You can interact with quite a few NPCs, but they only offer small snips of information at most and say more about themselves than the world around them. The other main source of information is item descriptions which can reveal information about specific events or people. This is quite good for people who like to piece together the story based on hints and clues. If you prefer storytelling to be more overt and involved then you might not be a fan.Personally, I am a fan of involved and cutscene/conversation heavy storytelling, but I didn’t mind the Dark Souls approach. It essentially makes the story optional for everyone who wants to ignore it. The main downside is that those hungry for more story may not necessarily want to dig for it and will come away feeling unfulfilled. I initially felt that, as I was constantly discovering awesome looking areas and enemies and kept thinking “what happened here?” and there wouldn’t really be a proper explanation. Of course, the game has a great community and the story explanations are all on YouTube (lookup VaatiVidya after playing the game) but the fact you have to go to YouTube can be a detracting factor.GRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCEDark Souls is a really rough PC port. It is essentially a complete copy and paste of the console version. It runs at 720p capped at 30fps and used to have GFWL. GFWL has now been patched out and the game now uses Steamworks which is a huge improvement. The bulk of the issues are fixed by an absolutely essential mod called dsfix, which uncaps the framerate and offers better graphics options amongst other fixes. The multiplayer elements also had some serious connectivity issues whilst on GFWL. In my experience, the Steamworks patch works well when playing the game normally. You get a good amount of multiplayer play, but may have issues trying to play with a specific friend.Dark Souls has absolutely stunning art direction. All the environments, equipment and enemies are really uniquely designed and definitely emphasise the variety of locations you’re exploring throughout the game. It also does an excellent job of conveying all these completely diverse environments, which are still seamlessly interconnected. The boss enemy designs are especially well done. Almost every boss evokes some kind of emotional reaction, whether its terror, pity or respect. The actual graphical fidelity in the vanilla game looks passable for the time (2011), but the aforementioned dsfix mod really makes the game a lot prettier, despite a pretty hefty performance cost.

Pros+ One of the most original and unique games I've ever played.+ Tough, yet rewarding gameplay. Never know what to expect. Always feels fresh. + Amazing atmosphere and a great soundtrack to compliment it.+ Addicting and immersive. + Level design is incredible. I love how everything is interconnected.+ Game is packed with content, lore, secrets, and places to explore. High replayability.+ Wide variety of settingsCons- Some elements of the game are just plain Tedious (Curse, some platforming sections, running back to certain bosses after dying, ect.)This is a game I think everyone should experience. The constant feeling of mystery when walking into a new area and not knowing what to expect at all, the feeling when stumbling across a bosses lair for the first time and wondering how to deal with it while under an immense amount of pressure, the feeling of coming across an NPC and wondering what they're doing there or what their story is, I could go on and on and on. It may take a bit for some to get pulled in by this game, but once you do good luck getting away, as you will constantly be starving for more. This game does of course have minor flaws, but even with them it managed to completely shattered my expectations.Final Score - ★★★★★ "

A beutifully designed, unfathomably deep, and truly rewarding odyssey that feels intensely and brilliantly alive in nearly every conceivable respect.*Please be aware that Durante's 'DSfix' is an essential mod for this lacklustre PC port, so be sure to install it before even attempting to play*When industry pundits make reference to a ""hardcore"" game, this is exactly the kind they're talking about. Dark Souls is the game that brings roguelikes bang up-to-date, and with what style it does so.Touting a brutal learning curve and an equally chilly approach to player tutoring, Dark Souls is a ruthless RPG of peerless satisfaction once you master it's deceptively graceful combat and giddy sense of exploration.As 2010 rolled around I found myself lamenting the current state of RPGs; searching in vain for a setting and approach that would get me excited again. It turns out that this game was just the cure I needed as the failings that spoiled my experience of Skyrim were nowhere to be found in the cursed world of Lordran.Every choice in Dark Souls is a meaningful one; the game is constantly updating your save file so there's no reloading and trying again if something goes wrong. If you lose all of your hard earned souls (the game's currency) then you're out of luck. If you kill an NPC by accident or fail to save another from assassination then that's just too bad. In this game you must live with those mistakes and what a refreshing change it makes for you as a player.I instantly appreciated Dark Souls for its gritty feel, hard as nails gameplay and the simple fact that it made you actually want to go delving into the usually derivative crypts, dungeons and even sewers!The magazine reviews that extolled a huge, connected world with foreboding areas, minimal loading times and a new 'ambient' style of multiplayer seemed too good to be true. To my surprise however; they were dead right on all counts.To me Dark Souls is the game that has finally done difficulty (for established gamers at least) in the right way. Yes it's hard as it can possibly be in the beginning; the game makes no concessions for your initial ignorance or pleas for clarity, but a lot of persistence and a little experimentation goes a long way in this cut-throat realm. All the tools you need to be great in this game are there- the transparent combat is intuitive, simple and easy to get to grips with if you have patience and the tenacity to stick with it and learn the little nuances that soon become second nature.This is one of those rare titles where other games are now being compared to it. ""This is Dark Souls"" or ""it's like Dark Souls"" are things that I catch myself saying regularly, even about games much older than this one. Although it's firmly engrained in the roguelike sub-genre, Dark Souls has such a unique and identifiable feel to it that the new term ""Soulslike"" is starting to gain serious traction for describing any game that bears intense similarities to it.If there was ever a torch-passing moment in modern video game history then this has to be it; from Rogue to Dark Souls, the dream of an uncompromising RPG with depth, complexity and intense satisfaction has been realised all over again. And for a game to accomplish that whilst maintaining such a broad appeal across the industry is a feat that is impressive beyond measure.

												I've always enjoyed this game, let it be the exhilerating moments of being in CQC, or the deep lore this game is based upon.It's frustrating, but most of the time it's your fault. MOST of the time, anyway. An area by the name of Lost Izalyth was rushed, so the boss you find there (Bed of Chaos) has a lot of artificial difficulty. There was one time, when I jumped a gap to get to the boss, the GIGANTIC arm the boss slaps you around with knocked me across the arena to my death (the developers didn't do this on purpose, they just rushed the boss). The floor also crumbles beneath your feet when you reach a certain point in the boss fight. Any unsuspecting noob can fall through, since the game doesn't warn you ahead of time.Then there's the Capra Demon, though to a lesser extent. When you walk into the arena, the space you fight in isn't that big, and most noobs die before they can react in time to the dogs and the boss. After that, the boss fight isn't that bad.This is the most artificial difficulty I remember, though some bugs are out there that can spoil the fun at times.                            TIME FOR THE GOOD STUFFThe game is open world, but in a semi-linear way. It's not the GTA V open world you're thinking of, but instead it's an open world because you can go into areas if you have the skill or equipment. It's not a level requirement, but instead a skill requirement. That's probably one of the best things about the game.The combat is done quite well. You have a light attack, a strong attack, a block, a parry (if you're not two-handing your weapon), you can two-hand your weapon, and you can roll. This means you're able to endure a fight without getting hit. When you roll, you have a part of the roll that makes you invulnrable. Don't expect to land the roll perfectly every time. It takes practice and patience to learn when to roll, and when NOT to. When you parry, there is a part of the parry that can slap aside the enemy's weapon. After doing a successful parry, you can repost the enemy for a large amount of damage. This also takes practice to land, so don't quit the game after not being able to parry successfully. When you two-hand a weapon, your strength increases by 1.5x the amount it was previously. This also adds some extra damage, so it's worth it.Most of the bosses in Dark Souls are okay. Some of them are annoying, some are just too easy. I'm not going to spoil any more bosses, since they're better when you don't know them very well.The lore in this game is extremely deep, and you can piece it together by reading item descriptions. If you need help figuring out the lore, check out https://www.youtube.com/user/VaatiVidya . He has a few videos on Dark Souls 1.That's it, I don't want to spoil the areas, so play the game yourself.			"

												One of the best and most challenging games i have played so far. Not only is the game setting pretty dark and scary, Dark Souls is also pretty hard so you will most likely always fear whats behind that door or fogwall, creating a similar atmosphere to horror games.Concerning the difficulty of this game: You can beat the game pretty much naked, and without getting hit a single time for the most parts, but at the same time even with the best gear you can die in a few seconds to some easy monsters if you're not paying attention or do something stupid.Learning from your mistakes is what this game is all about. You will die because you didnt know there was someone lying in an ambush. You will die even knowing there is someone behind that door, but you havent figured out what to to. You will die even knowing a good strategy to defeat a certain boss or clear an area. The game is fair, so dont blame anyone but yourself, just try it again and try harder, you will succeed eventually.If you're searching for a nice action RPG, a dark fantasy game or just a challenge, Dark Souls is the perfect match!

												Dark Souls: Prepare to Die edition is a fantastic game. I have never thought that I will enjoy this game that much so that's why I am going to share my experience and information about this game with you.The main element of this game, as you can imagine by reading the name of the game, is DYING! You will die very often and if you are not prepared to die, do not play this game, because otherwise you are going to rage-quit or delete this game.If you are ready to die, let's continue with reading this and let's say something important about this game.DS:PTD is, in my words, single-player game mixed with multi-player. The thing is, that you feel like you play single-player, however, in a moment you realize that your world is connected to other worlds and you are kind of linked with other people. If you use your humanity (in-game item) to become a human as you were before you've died, you will ""enter"" the multi-player. It sounds hard or maybe I can't explain it that well, but once you are human, you can invade other worlds - it means going PVP with another Online Player, you can be invaded - somebody will come to your world to kill you OR, you can summon a player who would like to co-op with you. That's why I like this game so much. Are you bored of killing NPCs, monsters, bosses? Just invade other world and feel the power of real Player-versus-Player. Is it hard to kill the boss in your world? Try to find summoning symbols on the ground and summon player to help you and kill that big as*hole together!! If I wanted to sum up everything this game offers, this ""review"" would be super long. This game is in open/closed world (it means that nobody tells you directly where to go. Everything is up to you. Where to go, where have you been,(there is no map, ok? you must use your brain!) where would you like to go, which area you choose first to go to or what to use/level up. However, those areas are connected together that perfectly that you can't get lost unless you are completely brain-dead. ), containing lvling-up, modifying your weapons, learning spells and having super great time with your character. PS. Very important to say! This game IS VERY CHALLENGING and DOES GIVE YOU great REWARDS!I would hardly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play challenging/rewarding game and likes this genre of game. (I would compare it with Skyrim or games like that, but don't blame me if you feel that you can't compare Skyrim with Dark Souls, because it is completely different. Maybe..it is :D, haven't played Skyrim long enough yet )Also, I would not recommend this game to players who are used to do ONLY what they are being told, to players, who likes playing games on ""easy-difficulty"" (in this game, there is NO difficulty to choose. It is ""Hard""-difficulty, so get used to it) and to players, who are not ready to DIE! :)If you liked my ""little-review"", please, rate it up or comment below to let me know if I can improve something for next time!Thanks for reading it.Kubusta			"

												I had heard quite a lot about Dark Souls: Prepare to Fun Edition before I went ahead and decided it was time I picked it up. I had actually heard about enough to give me the impression  that buying it would end up being a mistake because I would find myself quitting before I managed to get so much as a quarter of the way into the game because of the 2hard4me. Ironically enough I couldn't put it down because of the ♥♥♥ kicking I was getting initially being a lot different from the lackluster wins it seems every other game throws out.  Albeit that Dark Souls is just about as far as one can get from a walk in the park with a title made in recent times (save for the most irritating of indie games) it's nowhere near as bad as most will set it out to be. There are almost no situations where I felt that what was happening was just plain unfair and the deaths were anyone's fault but my own. Every challenge presented could be easily overcome by taking things slowly and getting the timing right. If you're used to the hand-holding of modern day pewpewbangbangbang games like I am then maybe you'll have a little (or a lot) more trouble than you should be having with whomever (Carpa, stop plis; it hurts). The animation quality is to die for, I have never once played a game where I sat in an area toying with weapons just to see what the attacks looked like before but I've spent hours doing so here. Regardless of if I planned on using it or not when I got a new weapon different from what I had seen before I was excited to see what it was like. I've now gone as far as making builds just to try weapons I didn't get to use in combat before due to stats. Voice acting is another point of interest, most characters were unique enough to actually want to talk to. On the down side the story could have been portrayed a lot better in game, I myself had to watch a countless amount of Youtube videos to get in on what was happening beyond the basic outline. If you decide to go ahead and do so then chances are you'll realize you missed quite a lot of the plot while playing through. The dreaded four letters also take a part in Dark Souls, GFWL (best system 10/10); on top of that connection is P2P so without DSCfix good luck summoning anyone, really. Although I've met a decent enough amount of people who have adapted to playing with mouse and keyboard I would still have to put down that playing without a gamepad is rather difficult. Dark Souls easily places in my top five favorite games and I cannot wait to get my hands on the next one. Praise the Sun, praise the sun, praise the sun praise the sun, praise the sun. TL;DR Gaem is gud, buy.			"

												Before you read any further let me make one thing clear- this game is very, very good. Exceptional even, so many elements of it are masterfully designed to give a totally different and amazing gaming experience. So, lets get the elephant in the room out of the way- Difficulty.Yes this game is hard- especially the start. In fact you will probably doubt that you'll get to the end of it after the first hour or so, however, it is vitally important to stick with it. You will improve your skills massively in time, things that seemed nearly impossible will become almost trivially easy, this is part of the charm. You feel yourself grow in ability so much, relying only on your sharpened skills to take on truly overwhelming challenge and succeeding. The way difficulty works in this game is masterful. The gameplay is great, what feels clunky and unusable at first becomes very smooth and responsive in experienced hands, this game above any other I've played has one of the strongest connections of your wits to your performance, which is invigorating for tough fights.  The world in which it all takes place is despiringly bleak and desperate, the story is not told to you. Instead you are placed in a world and have to make your own conclusions about it's denizens and their motivations, the events that transpire and what it all means. This again is quite different to most games and triggers the curiousity in you much more than the standard formula, it has a feel almost like the old 'Myst' on PC (although it is not puzzle based).Having the hindsight of multiple completions and nearly 300 hours play, I would rank this game as a modern classic. So much of it is a fundamentally different and richer experience than most games around these days. The more you play the more you realise the genius and originality of the design.***As an aside- one word of warning. I would research online as to how to build your character and how to make strong weapons, it is not at all obvious and the game could be made much to difficult if you don't do it correctly.***As a second and vitally important aside- Get an xbox controller for your PC if you are buying this. Mouse and keyboard was unplayable. They are fairly cheap and can be used for other games that work best with controller too. I already had one for use with a gamecube emulator.			"

												I used to have a favourite game. I can't remember it anymore. This brutal son of a game took my heart the moment I killed Taurus Demon. Is the game hard? Yes. Is it cheesy, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ instant death-hard? No. Every single time you die, you die because you did something wrong. What a wonderful challenge to play. Even after five years it's the pinnacle of gaming for me.All the areas in the game are so distinct and well-crafted. Almost everything in this game just clicks. And then there's the ♥♥♥♥ing amazing score. Every boss has their own theme and I remember every single one of them. The story is told by pieces. Item info, the rare npc talk etc. But there is a pretty interesting story behind all the dying.So yes, Dark Souls started out as a hard game and quickly became my favourite game of all time. Now I'm trying to make my nephews kill Capra on their own...			"

												A soothing adventure game set in the peaceful Kingdom of Lordran, from Firelink Shrine to the Depths you'll have an interesting world to explore as you come across its kind inhabitants who will help you learn of how this once great land came to fall. Experience places like; Sen's Fortress where you will feel safe and comforted by its many guards and defenses, the shining city of Anor Londo and the vibrant and cheerful Painted World of Ariamis. Meet the ever-helpful characters; the Bell Gargoyles (be careful one lies and one tells the truth), the Capra Demon (he's more friendly than he sounds), the Dragon Slayer Ornstein and his best friend Smough. Then, before you leave don't forget to gaze upon the wonderous creatures; the Moonlight Butterfly, the Gaping Dragon and the Great Grey Wolf Sif.☼ Praise the Sun! ☼			"

												Despite its marketing, Dark Souls is designed to make you feel something. Rather than likening it to other games – most of which are purely about sensory stimulation – I prefer to compare Dark Souls to an album. More particularly, an extreme metal album. Like an extreme metal album, Dark Souls is incredibly inaccessible. It has no desire for mass appeal. In fact, it thrives on alienation. It wants only the dedicated, the people who will strive to understand what it is trying to convey.Also, like an extreme metal album, Dark Souls has an emotional agenda. It has one united vision. It wants you to feel isolated. It wants you to feel empty. It wants you to feel like you are nothing, and that everything around you has more right to exist than you. It succeeds. The monster design, the level design, the sound assets, the silence – all these things combine to unnerve and depress you. More than anything though, Dark Souls wants you to prove it wrong. It wants you to prove that you have a right to exist in its world, despite everything it throws at you. It pummels you to the ground, yet it gives you hope. It gives you a reason to press on, even when everything seems lost. It wants you to go in as one person, and leave as another.			"

												Any person who thinks they are gamer needs this game it will show you who is a hardcore gamer and who isn't.  I myself am not one of these people over 20 hours of playtime into the game I gave up this game is for people looking for a serious challenge.  Just like the name says prepare to die cause you will die a lot.  I plan on going back to this game eventually and sitting down beating it but every time I look it I get so mad because other players can invade your realm and kill you on top of the challenge this game presents.   Its not for the casual weekend gamer at all its for the “hardcore dedicated have to beat it gamers”.  Two of my friends have beat I have not :(  Anyone who beats this game deserves your praise even if you have never played it or never intend on playing it.  That’s how much of challenge this game is.  But don't believe me try for yourself.			"

												Pfft, you really think you're ready for this? You think you're pro-MLG enough to handle this one? Maybe you should turn around and go back to Skyrim or Terraria or whatever other CASUL ""game"" you waddle around in. If you really think you're ready to step up your game and try your hand at Dank Souls, lemme give you an accurate depiction of your fate:- You will die.- You will die a lot.- You will die for basically most of your time playing.- Death will befall you.- Your life will be ended.- Your shirts will be colored red in your blood, which will ironically make you die even more.- Imagine one of those games where you estimate the number of candies or rat testes or some other small things that've been put in a jar. Now imagine all of it has been replaced with instances of your death. Okay? That's a pretty accurate description, I think. Yeah. It'll do.Basically the game is hard, or at least it is to CASULS like you. Don't even pick this game up unless you already know every enemy attack animation as well as every parry frame and weapon moveset in the game with some side knowledge of every misc item in the game and all the secret passages.Or you could learn as you go. I mean, that'd be okay I guess. I mean, that's probably what makes Dank Souls so great is that you learn as you go, no matter how many times you die. UNLESS YOU'RE PRO-MLG LIKE ME, IN WHICH CASE YOU NEVER DIE BECAUSE I NEVER DIE EVER.In PvE you will face off against BALANCED and 100% QUALITY enemies such as the ""bed of chaos"" and ""torch hollows."" The combat in Dark Souls is directly tied into user and enemy animations, so the player will have to be forced to learn patterns AS WELL AS the patterns the player will utilize and change via weapon choices, since all weapons basically have their own unique moveset and sets of strengths/weaksauce weaknesses...except for the CHAOSHANDER, which only has strengths.In PvP you will be butt-devastated by a gigantic flurry of backstabs the like of which you will never have thought could exist. Take every game in the Assassin's Creed series and then add up all the backstabs players could possibly execute at any point (possibly an infinite value due to respawning NPCs?) and then multiply it by five.Okay.Good.You're still not even close.The combat is still tied into animations, except now it's entirely based on PLAYER movesets. This means PvP is primarily dominated by those who learned the strengths and weaknesses of (at least most of) the gear in the game.AKA THEY LEARNED HOW TO ABUSE THE SYSTEM AND GET FREE BUTTSTABS.FREE BUTTSTABS!!!IT'S A TRAVESTY.Basically the backstab system in Dar- I mean Dank Souls isn't all that quality-laden. Dark Souls II (notice how I didn't say DANK SOULS II) attempted to fix this, and it did a fair job of doing so. Except for how Dark Souls II isn't as good as Dank Souls, and should be avoided.Just saying.I'm not going to go into the lore because you can just do a google search (""DANK SOULS LORE FUNNY CAT IMAGES"") and see 999,999,998 ""people"" go ""OH YES IT'S SOOOOO DEEP AND MEANINGFUL BUT SUBTLE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE OMGGGG YOU HAVE TO DISCOVER IT FOR YOURSELF.""They're right, of course. It still doesn't need another reiteration though. You get the point after a while.In conclusion, Dank Souls is an amazing triumph of the game market and is more akin to an interactive work of art THAT HATES YOU.If you have any disagreements then I'll have to ask you to 1v1 me. Watch out though 'cause my zweihander don't play no games son.10/10			"

												Dark Souls is a game, even if it doesn't always feel like it. By now, we all know what this game is. There's no need for me to tell you that this game will kill you, but this game will kill you. Before you start it even! Some people will be at work for an hour just trying to get it to launch! I know I did. The game doesn't like DLL files in system32.This game is terrible to you. First, its keyboard controls are abysmally mapped by default, but because of the way the mouse controls work, you can never completely fix the abysmal controls without plugging in a controller, which may sting for the more hardcore PC users, such as myself. Second, the graphics settings are also seriously lacking, and beyond that, the graphics themselves are seriously lacking. The game isn't actually rendered in your resolution of choice and the framerate is locked to 30 fps. All that is putting aside the horrific instability and temperamental nature of this historically terrible port.However, once you get used to the alien ""Controller"" device and install a thing called DSFix[lmgtfy.com], the game opens up a little. Only a little though. It is now that you are thrown into your new favorite circle of Hell. The entire tutorial is presented by way of glowing messages on the ground, some of which are hidden behind a particularly tough enemy. Personally, I'd prefer the game without those messages, but... you know, modern intelligence standards and whatnot. In any case, the full weight of the game remains on your shoulders from beginning to end, and you'll be hard pressed to find any partners for jolly cooperation these days. The NPCs will be there for you though, but you have to find some of them first, which requires not missing things, which requires fully exploring the world. Don't make the same mistake I did when I played for the first time... I missed about 33% of the entire game.The appeal of this game lies within the gameplay rather than anything else. The soundtrack is mostly nonexistant, the graphics are lackluster, the dialogue is also mostly nonexistant, the story ISN'T mostly nonexistant, but IS left mainly to interpretation... you have to draw pleasure from combat to really enjoy the game, unless you'd be fine with a slow-paced slog through boredom to get some tidbits here and there. All of that said, not even the combat is the greatest! You can breeze through most of the game once you master the art of rolling into attacks, circle strafing, backstabbing, and to a lesser degree, parrying. No movesets required! Just use R1 for maximum effect!And I love it all to bits.The amount of triumph and pride that I felt upon beating each boss is unmatched by any other game. The accomplishment of successfully defeating everyone's favorite duo without summoning anyone to help is one of the highest points of, dare I say, gaming as a whole. Dark Souls is an exercise in trial and error, hands on learning, and overcoming the seemingly impossible.If you want a power trip, buy Skyrim.If you want a powerful experience, buy Dark Souls.Praise the Sun, you magniflorious dickbutts.

												You're basically a detective picking up the pieces of what has happened in this world. It presents you a world that has gone to ruin. Whether you play this game actively or passively is up to your intellect as a human. Engage with the world and with your mind. Look at the world, observe the clues presented to your subtly. You have to think about what you're seeing as well as reading and listening dialogue and text. You could simply just play the game and ignore everything that's being shown to you. Killing bosses, enemies, and people mindlessly--like other RPGs. The problem with modern RPGs is that you're just doing what they tell you and va-la: exp, loot, and more quests. Some people would play DS once, but like someone stated, ""It's not a game, it's a experience."" People have overcome real life issues through this game. The world of Dark Souls is filled with tragedy. Love is corrupted and turned rotten, cities fall into ruin and war, kings embrace madness and fear, the Gods--forsaken, great heroes overcome by true darkness, even Solaire: forgotten and only vestiges of his exsistance remain. Dark Souls reflects our world. The greatest people are forgotten, no matter how much joy they bring to an indivisual's life, overtime, such happiness has evaporated. Nations rise and fall. The people swept away--then brought back. ""Humans assuming a fleeting form."" People that give up are left on the side of the road and pillaged for what they were worth. ""But, what is a king?""Dark Souls' world, is a world of tragedy, sadness, betrayal, love, decay, and rebirth.			"

												Dark Souls is not a game for everyone. It will torture you, punish you and laugh at you, all at the same. But it will never be unfair. It will always play by the rules. Any mistakes you make are entirely your own. This game is hard. Maybe not all the time, depending on your build, but you will die. Not once, not twice. Hundreds of time. And you'll probably keep playing. Because the world of Dark Souls is something that needs to be experienced. I've rarely seen a world this detailed and this well executed. It reminded me a bit of a Metroidvania game, where instead of searching for upgrades you decide what to upgrade, thanks to the souls you'll collect from killed enemies. Before moving on to that part let me say that the textures in this game are simply amazing.As I said, souls allow you to upgrade your character. But only at a bonfire. If you get killed before reaching a bonfire, you lose your souls. You'll resurrect as an undead (again) and get another chance at collecting your lost souls. But the enemies will have respawned and if you die again before reaching them, you'll never be able to recover them. It's tough and frustrating.Enemies will attack you from all sides, there's danger everywhere. You have to remember when and how your enemy attacks, detect their patterns.With humanity you can become human again. This allows you to summon NPC's or friends. These allies are extremely helpful in tough situations. The only consequence of being human is the fact that other players can invade your world. This is frustrating if you haven't saved at a bonfire or/and the other player is simply too strong. Defeat them and you'll gain plenty of souls, though.It's a choice you have to make, but just remember that humanity is hard to come by, especially in the beginning, so summoning someone isn't always the proper solution.As of today I still haven't finished the game. It should take you at least 60-80 hours to beat, and that's a first playthrough. You'll never be able to see, do and collect all the stuff you want in your first playthrough. It's simply impossible. There's so much to take into account.Dark Souls is a brilliant game that only the strong will be able to finish. It's one of my personal goals, although I doubt I'll ever be able to finish it. It requires a lot of dedication. If you're one of those persons I strongly suggest you play this game. You'll not be disappointed.(Use the Dsfix to improve the graphics and performance of the game. Don't start your first game without it.)EDIT: I managed to finish this just a few days after posting the review. I'm not going to rewrite the entire thing as I still agree with most of what I've written. Dark Souls has entered my personal top 3 of favorite games ever so it doesn't need any further explanation.[Rating: 96/100]			"

												Playing Dark Souls for the first time harkens back to how we played games as children. I often found myself lost - not knowing where to go, or what to expect from enemies past the bonfire. The beautifully designed enviorments, the punishing nature of the combat, as well as the little tidbits of lore scattered throughout the game all do a phenomenal job at immersing the player into the gameworld. Dark Souls is far from perfect, but it's the quintessential action roleplaying game. If you still haven't played it for whatever reason, now is as good a time as any.			"

												If you wanted to give this game a try because you heard it was challenging, I would advise you to look elsewhere. That's not to say it's ""easy"" even if you know exactly what to do, just that it's the extremely cheap sort of ""challenge"", like playing rock-paper-scissors with three fingers sawn off while the other guy plays with both hands. The short version is that most of the enemies have access to powers/abilities/outright hacks that you most certainly don't and you pretty  much have to look up guides and wikis to get through areas, moreso bosses, in a timely fashion. There is a bit of fun to be had here, but I feel like the game should have a South Park-esque warning label: ""All combat is made to look more difficult than it rightly should be... Poorly. Due to shamelessly fake difficulty the following game should not be played by anyone.""You can enjoy the game, but less so as you notice the many, many ways it plain cheats.Starting with the obvious and thus possibly taken for granted; enemies have infinite ammo and spells to throw at you. You have no such thing. Those arrows, bolts, spears, magefire, and the rest can hit you from distances the player can't even target from. Even if you could lock onto things from the distances they apparently can, your magic dissipates into nothing at what can be insultingly short ranges and projectiles lose impact before too long. Enemy fire always seems to do full damage. Finally, enemy projectiles of all sorts will arc mid-air to hit you. I can understand magic doing this, as it's magic, and the player's Soul Arrows can curve a little bit as well, but ordinary arrows fired by you do not.Speaking of curving in mid-air, most humanoid enemies seem to have some kind of leaping lunge attack that can track your position and hit you by changing the direction of the attack as they're flying, weapon raised. Once more, the player cannot do this.Quite a few foes have unblockable one-hit kill attacks, usually in the form of a grapple that can kill you from full health if you aren't pouring points into Health from the start. Some enemies (Silver Knights in Anor Londo especially, in my experience) can block damage with their shields when not blocking at all, but your weapon touches the shield before touching their bodies. The player has no such ability, even with the most powerful tower shield in the game.Fair's fair if we could do everything they could, I could understand calling that a challenge to use the AI's own tricks against them. However, they're all advantages that monsters will hold over you forever, which is pretty close to the definition of unfair. Certainly, you can strike back on some of the bosses with unfair tactics, but is that the sort of gameplay you were hoping for here?A general limitation on the combat is the inability to move while firing a bow or crossbow, because if you could there would be no reason not to kite pretty much every boss to death. Challenge lies in overcoming an obstacle, be it in the form of the environment or an enemy. It is not being told you just can't walk around it because that would be too easy and the powers that be were too lazy to place different obstacles for those that pick a different path instead of great big walls. That is to say, ranged combat is not a viable means of getting through the game for most people because there wouldn't even be an illusion of challenge if it were.Now, there's an obvious reason for these things, ""It wouldn't be challenging otherwise!"" That there, I think, should say everything that needs to be said about the game, without these cheap tricks, it's not challenging at all, and as challenge is not defined by cheap tricks, it follows that Dark Souls is not a challenging game as much as it is a cheap, frustrating one. I've played for over 300 hours, (cutting out what might mostly have been grinding for items or standing around waiting to be summoned as a phantom while doing something else outside the game) and in that time I found ignoring the broken difficulty more of a challenge than any of the bosses, the only remote enjoyment I derive anymore comes from helping other people kill bosses in the now-legendary feat of Jolly Cooperation. Even that wears thin when you're only getting called maybe three times an hour in the highest-traffic summoning spots.None of this is even taking into account the Invasion mechanic, in which players likely more experienced than you can jump into your world under certain circumstances and kill you for a laugh, or completely subjective things that might have just been me, like randomly slipping off cliffs when standing a good few feet away from them.I have two ideas of challenge in a game, God of War and Saint's Row. The former features some difficult combat that can be overcome through skill and determination. The latter features a bunch of rat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with rocket launchers that you're more likely to overcome through dumb luck or even cheat codes. Dark Souls falls on the Saint's Row end of the spectrum, fake difficulty taken to an artform. If all you'd like is a big, dark world to explore, peppered with bosses to kill in a romp of medieval fantasy violence... Then I'd recommend a Castlevania game instead.			"

												I sadly cannot recommend this game. It's an Xbox port and it’s a horrible port! In game you get hints like ""Press (A) to read document"" but you have no idea what the A button should be on the keyboard. (by defaults it's Q instead of E) In the options there is no comparison to a controller, so you have to know what button does what on the Xbox version. I tried to play it with an Xbox controller but that thing's not working and there is no option to enable or disable or at least change key mapping of a controller. Oh and did I mention, that the default key to open the game menu is END not ESC?Graphics are pretty bad depending on the standard 1024x726 resolution that is just stretched to 1920x1080 but there is a patch that increases internal resolution and adds some fine shader-effects like more realistic lightning and so. I really recommend that patch if you want to play that game on a PC.I really wanted to give this game a chance but there is sadly no way to play it. Mouse sensitive is way too high and you cannot change it without a patch. I mostly have no idea what to press because the game tells me only the button I should press on a Xbox controller and like I said already: My Logitech Xbox controller which works in EVERY other game, does not work in Dark Souls.

												TL;DR: A game infamous for its difficulty, but for those with the time and patience to overcome the steep learning curve, they will find themselves in a deeply detailed beautiful game with one of the most competent combat systems in gaming. Though poorly ported it is still well worth playing with a controller at the ready.Dark Souls is a game that I spent a large amount of my time with on console. Moving over to PC and experiencing it all over again, is time I don't regret spending. The fun from dark souls can be found in many different forms, though difficult as you progress through the game you can see yourself getting better and more powerful. The satisfaction of winning a boss fight, after they have crushed you countless time before is a feeling I have not found elsewhere. Though suffering from some issues such as the framerate cap and poor options this is a part of gaming history you can't miss.Positive features:-In depth combat and weapons variety that can be changed at any time-Beautifully rich and detailed world with varying areas and enemies-Difficulty harsh but fair-Unforgettable boss fights-Clever online system with active PVP community-DLC comes includedNegative features:-30 fps cap-Requires a controller for best experience-Lack of graphical options and settings-Confusing navigation at timesTo conclude Dark Souls is not a game easy to summarise. On console it was amazing and although considered poor for PC, it is still the same game only better and one that is well worth your time, a lot of your time.			"

You fight some little guys, and it's alright. Then you reach a big guy. He'll be less alright. So he pulverises you once or twice (I lied it was at least 25), but you are starting to figure it out. On your way to finally beat him, and something new pops up on your screen: Phantom NastyWasty69420 has invaded. A haunting voice, deep and coming from everywhere and nowhere at once booms ""HELLO"". You freeze and look around. There, a glowing, naked, red man is running towards you, holding a club the same size as you. He stops in front of you and gives a wave. So you wave back. Then he runs in circles a few times. You're concerned, but he hasn't done anything hostile yet, so you don't attack. What comes next in such an interaction? You don't know, so you wait. A glowing patch appears beneath him, an item! You pick it up, and find a set of armour that looks comedically fat. You equip it to humor him, only to find when you exit the menu, he is also wearing it. He then throws down some glowing things on the ground in a circle. The two of you stand for a moment in the circle, then he drops something and the booming voice returns, ""I'M SORRY"". This can't be good. You lock on and raise your shield, backing up. Can you beat him? You doubt it; that's one biiiig club. He waves once more, and runs in a little circle. You've backed perhaps 5 meters away, yet instantaniously he is behind you, his preposterously large club winding up, clipping through the preposterously fat armour. You try desperately to move, to escape, to attack, pressing every button on your controller. To no avail, his club crushes you, killing you instantly. That's not so bad, you've died plenty of times before. What really hurts is the betrayal. His fully upgraded, monstrous club could never do the damage that he has inflicted upon your heart. You spiral fast. Fueled by revenge, you destroy every enemy and boss in your path, beating the game. Then New Game +. Finally you've mastered it. Every dirty trick and cheese in the book. You start a new character, and play through the entire game at a low level. One day, you're invading pathetic newbs in the undead burg, parrying and backstabbing to your hearts content. You start lowering their defenses by giving them humanity and tossing prism stones down. One day, the terrible memory of what NastyWasty69420 did to you resurfaces. You've become that which you hate most. It becomes clear that the humanity that you give to these poor lost undead is because you no longer have use for yours. This is the downward spiral of the chosen undead. This is how dark souls will break you down. Embrace the Dark. Embrace the chaos.10/10, an emotional journey like no other.(My playtime is messed up, it's actually at least 3 times this)			"

												There is no game I played in the last few years - probably since N64 times - that fascinated me as much as Dark Souls did (and still does). If you are capable of being patient, like to observe your enemies before attacking, like to suck in the atmosphere the world offers you, like NPCs who laugh a lot ( ;) ) and don't bother about using a controller or get yourself a couple of fixes for the mouse controls, then you're free to go to play one of the best games I've ever played.Stuff you want to download before playing:- DSfix- DSmfix (in case you wanna play with keyboard & mouse; let's be honest, you're probably better off with a controller)- Wulf's Dark Souls Connectivity Mod (in case you wanna play with friends)- PVP Watchdog (in case you wanna be able to kick cheating invaders)			"

												After playing this game longer than Brian, I can basically say he's a scrub now.This game is so fantastic in the contrasts it gives throughout the game. You start the game thinking you'll be the hero that Gotham (Lordran) deserves. As you progress, you save many a Npc's and bring them back to homebase. But, as you progress further, you slowly realize the reality that is for this land. As the credits start to roll and the moving music starts to play, it starts to sink in that you've been playing the villain the whole time.Also, ♥♥♥♥'s hard bro. 11/10 would be better than Brian again.

												dark souls , i can't properly make a good review for the game even after playing it for +170 hours .in every ""top 10 hard video games "" ,you'll find it on the list  , most of the time at the top of it . it's a game that punishes you for every bad decision or move that you made , and it doesn't limit you to play at one style of gameplay , you are open to beat it in anyway , which is funny actually because if you post a random post like ""tips on how to beat [x] boss or something "" ... you'll get plenty of users and each on of them offers his own solution which is different that the other guys's ways to deal with the problem that you're facing . the game becomes more enjoyable once you learn how to actually correctly play it , which it took me +40 hours of learning to be honest , it may take  less for you . to make the game less boring , and as you progress through the game , at the end , you get to repeat everything but in a state where everyone is even more stronger  .still , the game has some negatif points regarding the performance and the online gameplay  , luckily the community made some tools to counter it , but as some said : the perfect game doesn't need mods at all .as a final note ? i guess even tho i gave you a negatif comment on it i'll still say that it's a 10/10 game , 100% worth the money and the time .

												Dark Souls™: Prepare To Die™ Edition is quite an easy game, perfect for kids, people with ptsd and people suffering from some sort of rage problem.The gameplay is quite simple, you have to find the hidden cookies in the bushes, but WHATS THAT? Its Grandma, You have to hurry to find all the cookies fast before grandma catches you. Once you finish finding the hidden cookies the real battle begins.So then you visit a war torn city and help out the nice but sad people who live there, maybe help an old man cross the street, donate some money to the homeless and talk to the head honcho of the neighbourhood.After a nice conversation with him you keep moving towards the religious area of this war torn city and meet many nice people, a nice little piggy and even a trusty smith, you then move towards the chapel and talk to the nice priest there, he explains that the bell has not been rung in ages because the priest's back is not that well and he cannot climb the ladder anymore, so he sends you on a quest to ring the bell, and thats about as much as i want to spoil about this lovely and simple game.Perfect port, Recommend playing with a keyboard or Racing Wheel + Pedals.Score: 6 - Perfect Score.

												The problem is not to defeat the boss, the problem is to rush the zone and get to the boss with enough Estus Flasks!This game is wonderful, and i've played it for only 16-17h. I was a noob like you when i first bought it, i was worried like you are that it was going to be extremely brutal and frustrating, but it isn't for me. Well, it has been for the first 5-6 hours, when i actually thought: ""why have i installed this game, why? It's terrible, it sucks; why should i use a controller, it's not fair; why the ♥♥♥♥ should i download mods for it to play at the ♥♥♥♥ing 60 fps and 1080p?"".In those first hours i kept dying also to the worst skeletons of the tutorial, but going ahead with it it became understandable what the game wanted me to do: learn from my silly mistakes and make up a strategy on my own. The combat system is the best i've tried in my life, and it became understandable the difficoulty from the developers to create good keyboard keys to reproduce it. You'll have to block at a right timing, attack at the right timing, fall back at the right timing and dodge the hit AT THE RIGHT TIMING. You fail at one of these? You're dead, simple as that. The IA is very very clever, but it's not OP at all, you just need to ask yourself ""what does this boss want me to do?"" and you'll get it, after 20-40 times you try it. I actually found myself dying at the same boss for more than 20 times, but each time was better, untill i finally understood WHAT i was doing wrong. The good thing is that after these 20 times i wasn't bored at all, because the possibilities you have during a fight are infinite, and you'll never get tired of trying them all out! The comparison between DS and Skyrim is stupid imho: they are both epic for what they have to offer. Skyrim for its great graphics, open world, storyline, quests, MODS and a lot more; while DS for its difficoulty, replayability, combats and strategy. What is really missing on DS are strange mods like skyrims (that couldn't even be isntalled without DSfix!).I have to admit that having to install DSfix and other graphic mods to make it AT LEAST enjoyable at 1080p and 60fps is baaahd, but come on, you'll have to work on it 20 minutes to enjoy your gameplay for ever!Come on, little newbie, buy it, enjoy it and remember to NEVER EVER look on the internet cheap ways to defeat bosses, you'll feel soooo bad after having done that, trust me! :)			"

												Dark Souls is the new action role-playing game from the developers who brought you Demon’s Souls, FromSoftware. You exist in a land where the bad guys have already won – society is in terminal decline and everyone is turning into undead ‘hollows’. That’s how you start the game, but some trick of fate allows you to keep your human mind. You can even transform back into a person by obtaining ‘humanity’ from dead enemies – although it’s a rare commodity and, as you may have heard, dying is a very frequent occurrence in Dark Souls.I've played the game for around 250+ hours in order to complete all the achievements and characters' side quests. It is truly a masterpiece with an incredible story, stunning atmosphere and many gorgeous views. The world is masterfully designed, the soundtrack is amazing and the boss battles are outstanding and memorable. On top of that, one of the best features in the game is the online play - I found defeating the hardest bosses while cooperating with a friend very fun. The PvP system is really well done and I was usually able to find active players who were ready to fight - despite the game coming out 4 years go, the community is still very active and friendly. The first thing you may hear about Dark Souls is how hard it is, and while it is a very challenging game indeed, the reward for completing it or for even beating a boss is the best and biggest sense of achievement you will get out of a video game. The only reason why I wouldn't give it a perfect 100/100 is the PC port which is frustrating at first, but with a couple of downloads and mods you can fix it.In conclusion, this is one of the best and most replayable games I've ever played. If you like challenging games and are prepared to die, this is the game for you. I would recommend you play it with a controller and look through the community forums for guides if you find the game too hard for you.			"

												Dark Souls is a beautifully crafted experience in a dark fantasy setting that will challenge the player to adapt and learn from their experiences rather than be spoon fed like many modern games.The level design often creates a game of risk versus reward with the careful playcement of bonfires which serve as checkpoints where you can rest and level up your character. The question many new players will be asking themselves is weither to play it safe and go back to the bonfire and lose their progress, or to push on and risk losing their souls in hopes of finding another bonfire. Being the open world that Dark Souls is, each area connects with another logically and physically often through shortcuts opened up by the player. You can stop and look around at your distant surroundings and think to yourself, "" Ah yes, I've been to that bridge before."" and realise that each area of the game was perfectly placed with each other area in mind. This also serves the idea of experienced players being able to quickly build whatever character they want without being railroaded into a single path storyline creating replay value.Speaking of storyline, there practically isnt any. Dark Souls is a lore rich game which often will be missed by first time players creating an atmosphere of hopelessness as you go around and around not knowing where to go. This aids in the player exploring the world on their own with little direction, but can be frustrating at times for the new player. The NPCs you find are primarily venders and story tellers, but will come and go with their own agendas further showing that the world doesnt revolve around you. Dark Souls offers multiplayer in a few forms. Players can frequently see messages written by other players wishing to aid or hinder others as well as seeing ghosts and blood stains giving the impression of how others have died giving you a warning. Dark Souls also has optional co-op and pvp by recovering your humanity. Players needing help can summon phantoms to their world to help them progress and take down bosses, but this also invites enemy phantoms to try and stop you. The co-op and pvp however is totally voluntary and is not forced apon you at any time, however you cannot have one without the other excluding playing the game offline and summoning NPC phantoms.Dark Souls is an absolute must play for anyone looking for a challenge.

												The thing about this game is that it has ruined other games for me. You know why? Because other games don't feel as engaging or...fun. The challenging bosses and sometimes brutal ordeals isn't what defines this game-- its the cryptic storytelling, the atmosphere, the music that truly is the gem that is Dark Souls. For me this game is a testament to life itself, as it describes the countless failures (like dying in Dark Souls) one has to endure to finally hone one's skills to achieve success (like experiencing the euphoric feeling of seeing ""Victory Achieved"" after defeating a boss). So, don't be afraid to die my...son.			"

I want to recommend it to people now, before having finished, for them to still be able to enjoy the multiplayer features before GfWL goes t1ts up in June 2014.Hopefully, this truly astonishing masterpiece of a game will make use of Steamworks in the future, so players will still be able to help each other, and duel it out, in some of the most atmospheric and great digital environments I've ever seen.It's been a wild ride, with lots of frustration and hard work, but at the same time that's exactly what makes the satisfaction so great, when finally defeating that especially hard boss or those notoriously difficult areas that you've been struggling with.You deserve to try this out if you haven't yet.

												Dark Souls is a beautifully crafted experience in a dark fantasy setting that will challenge the player to adapt and learn from their experiences rather than be spoon fed like many modern games.The level design often creates a game of risk versus reward with the careful playcement of bonfires which serve as checkpoints where you can rest and level up your character. The question many new players will be asking themselves is weither to play it safe and go back to the bonfire and lose their progress, or to push on and risk losing their souls in hopes of finding another bonfire. Being the open world that Dark Souls is, each area connects with another logically and physically often through shortcuts opened up by the player. You can stop and look around at your distant surroundings and think to yourself, "" Ah yes, I've been to that bridge before."" and realise that each area of the game was perfectly placed with each other area in mind. This also serves the idea of experienced players being able to quickly build whatever character they want without being railroaded into a single path storyline creating replay value.Speaking of storyline, there practically isnt any. Dark Souls is a lore rich game which often will be missed by first time players creating an atmosphere of hopelessness as you go around and around not knowing where to go. This aids in the player exploring the world on their own with little direction, but can be frustrating at times for the new player. The NPCs you find are primarily venders and story tellers, but will come and go with their own agendas further showing that the world doesnt revolve around you. Dark Souls offers multiplayer in a few forms. Players can frequently see messages written by other players wishing to aid or hinder others as well as seeing ghosts and blood stains giving the impression of how others have died giving you a warning. Dark Souls also has optional co-op and pvp by recovering your humanity. Players needing help can summon phantoms to their world to help them progress and take down bosses, but this also invites enemy phantoms to try and stop you. The co-op and pvp however is totally voluntary and is not forced apon you at any time, however you cannot have one without the other excluding playing the game offline and summoning NPC phantoms.Dark Souls is an absolute must play for anyone looking for a challenge.

												One of the best games on my opinion. It's not that difficult as someone may think. It's just a good oldschool RPG, unlike most modern '1-button' games.I really like gameplay and the way they brought multiplayer into singleplayer experience is GENIOUS.PC-port is crap, graphics are so-so but who cares.

												We all know that this game is famed for being 'difficult' or frustrating so instead of justifying this or telling you to suck it up, I'll write about my experience of the game so far.'You Died'But in all seriousness, Dark Souls: Prepare to Die is a game I think everyone should play at least once. It is reminiscent of old style RPG top-down dungeon crawlers in it's atmosphere with the level design allowing you to cautiously make decisions in which way you want to explore. 'Left or right? What if I miss a shiny by going this way?' you know the feel. It's really refreshing to see a more modern game handle this so well.The combat however is what makes it really shine. You can't charge in and hope to obliterate everything by mashing a few buttons. Combat in this game, even against the 'trash' mobs, needs to be carefully planned. It's not forced like an RTS or turn based combat but if you don't think carefully about where and when to move, dodge and strike you will meet a bloodstainy end very quickly. While this probably sounds like less of a selling point, as you play the reward of overcoming a foe is that 'Awwyes' moment. Again, something a lot of modern games lack. It's also worth noting the class system is classic RPG style, with attributes that you level up so you can play the way you feel suits you. The threat of dying is always there and the game does a good job of keeping you on your toes. Death is more of a learning curve in Dark Souls and half the fun is running into unexpected situations or biting off more than you can chew, each encounter (and subsequent death) asks you to take a moment to think how you could have handled that better. A boss may take more than a few attempts to overcome but when you do, you are equipped for future areas of the game. At first you'll probably be resistant to this, as many games treat defeat as the final stop, not a fully integral part of the mechanics. Once you accept this though, death is pretty fun. The world, lore and atmosphere of Dark Souls is also some thing to mention. Without spoilers, the world is a dark medieval fantasy, which sounds cliche but it keeps a pretty unique feel and adds to the doomy storyline and mechanics. The creature and character design are also refreshing.Now for some not so good things. Firstly, this is a port to PC. A lazy one. It's so lazy even the tutorial messages reference Xbox controller buttons *searches keyboard for RT button* While I've been playing with keyboard for the time being I'd suggest you buy an Xbox controller. Keyboard is okay, but I spent a fair while in the starting area mentally mapping what key did what. They aren't intuitive. You'll have a better time with controller.The resolution can also be horrific on larger screens, which is a pity because the graphics are interesting. To remedy this there is an easy to install mod on Nexus, DSMfix. Almost a must have in my opinion. Overall Dark Souls is a brilliant game worthy of time and attention. It has that old style feel that many games lack and is almost worth it just for that. However, if you are the sort of gamer who gets easily frustrated or doesn't like to be challenged in a game you should probably look into it more before buying. "

												I kwnow it could a bit pretentious, or even arrogant, but i have to say: ""EVERYONE SHOULD TRY THIS GAME"" Why? Because this is what every game should be:The whole PVE gameplay is perfectly balanced (except for a single boss battle) even without a ""difficulty selector"", so no, there is no ""easy difficult""; and yes, you'll die a lot, but only when you actually deserve it,(if you find it much too hard probably you are just missing something: try to explore or try another route; or you are playing with mouse and keyboard: buy a joypad).Arts, graphic and engine good enough to make this game really good-looking, but ""light"" enough to work smoothly in older machine: a mid tier notebook is more than enough to make this game run(even though it WILL fall to 15 fps in particular circumstance, whatever configuration you adopt)In addition to the two previous consideration, you will have HUGE selection of weapon and magic, every single one of them has unique appearance, moveset and effect, making almost any playstyle peculiar AND potentially successfull in the game (except for some, obvious, joke and trap: SPOILER: don't use the dragonsword at your first playthrough)Multiplayer is very well done, except sometimes for latency in PVP (especially when players come from far different region).Except when you play offline mode and/or disconnected from the internet, you are actually playing in multiplayer, *always*, this mean: communication from and for other player (in form of orange message written on the floor), ""ghost"" appearance of other player in the same area at the same time, blood of dead players (and if you interact, you will see HOW that player is actually dead).But, before you can actually do PVP and COOP, you need to perform another operation, this secures you against unespected grief AND, at the same time, if you need external help you'll have a counterpart (BUT, if you want to HELP another players you can do coop even without ""activating"" the PVP, you only have to be patient)The only real downfall of this game is its PC-port: it is not so good (""awful"" is the right term, to be honest),BUT the community did a set for excellent workarounds for this, the only thing you need to do is: go to ""discussion"" panel read the 4 pinned discussions (especially   this one ) profitPraise the sun!

												Simply put: One of the best games I have ever played, alongside the Elder Scrolls series. The art direction, lore and player interaction are masterfully done. The amazing artstyle alone should come as no surprise from the individuals that have been creating numerous-but-unique mech designs for over a decade.The game mechanics are simple, but satisfying. Allowing you to block, parry, dodge, light attack and heavy attack your enemies. What I like about the way the game handles itself with the combat system is how methodical it forces the player to be in unevenly matched fights. A lot of the enemies can be ran past once you understand the layout of the areas, but it can still be a rather tricky endeavor because of various environmental hazards that you'll find along the way.The only true complaint I can lodge against the game mechanics are the absurdly generous input buffering for actions that usually do more harm than help. Also, be warned that since this game uses a peer-to-peer system for its multiplayer component, establishing sessions with friends or other people can turn into a frustrating ordeal.The game itself is not nearly as diverse in terms of character creation/input as something like an Elder Scrolls game, but this is more than made up for with the gripping and unique world that From have managed to create. Obscurity is a major game mechanic theme of Dark Souls, and is what makes it so much fun to play. The joy of exploring areas that you previously had believed to be thoroughly searched, only to discover a new secret hidden within its crevices. It is this sense of exploration coupled with the very macabre atmosphere that make Dark Souls a truly wonderous experience.			"

												I'm not sure I've ever spent so much time on a game I've enjoyed so little. There are some silver linings, but they all come with big black clouds attached.There's something compelling here - it's vaguely Metroid-like in how you really do feel like you're venturing into the unknown. And Dark Souls passes on the common flaws of modern cutscene-laden action games, which is nice to see. But in doing so it draws on the worst parts of old-school D&D, then adds in a few terrible design decisions on top. So at the end of the day it's just a disappointing dungeon crawler, albeit one with an sometimes-rabid fanbase.			"

												Without a doubt the most dreadful PC port I've ever seen, this should have stayed console exclusive. If you don't have a controller, there is no reason to ever buy this game, and I'm not buying an XBOX controller just to play this game. Without a controller, menus are horribly irresponsive, mouse acceleration is all over the place, and the game never looks more than 1280x720p, regardless of effects, only options are motion blur and antialiasing. Gameplay is, again, dreadful without a proper controller, developers don't bother with mouse sensitivity, so any turn will turn you 90 degrees regardless without mods and even then the game is a chore to play, you can't rebind mouse keys, game doesn't even show the computer keys, just controller keys.Even ignoring the necessity for controller (which is, frankly, inexcusable considering the game could have been much more well implemented for mouse and keyboard), the PC port is still awful, since no changes were made to accomodate PC, a painful lack of graphical options, an extremely obtuse control scheme that makes no effort to change for a PC title and instead rebinds every button in a jumble across the letter keys, badly optimized graphics, no quality change, etc. Now, the elephant in the room: Windows Live. Since June 1st, it has been impossible to go online play or save your game at all, which is, again, an inexcusable oversight for a PC port where save files can be saved on the computer. Don't trust any review before June 1st in regards to functionality, it's no longer relevant.There is no way such a slapdash port should be seen as excusable compared to a console exclusive, regardless of developer of quality, period.

												Dark Souls is a fantastic and unforgettable experience with an immersive world and innovative multiplayer components. Brilliant level design and combat mechanics are what make this game great.The difficulty in this game is often exaggerated. The game is challenging, but always fair. Whenever you die, its always your fault, not because of some cheap game mechanic. The game is not so much hard as it is punishing. Choosing to give an extra greedy hit against a boss can mean the difference between life and death. Unlike most RPGs, power in this game is more than just a numerical value, actual player skill plays a bigger part. The immersive atmosphere and the feeling of overcoming challenges are great.This game is the most incredible gaming experience I have ever had. I can remember every moment of my first playthrough, from my naive first steps, to what I felt while the credits rolled. I have never before seen a game with such thought put into it.HoweverAfter spending over 200 hours on the console version of the game, I decided to buy the game on steam. I was disappointed, the PC port is a joke. The graphical settings are extremely lacking, the vanilla game won’t run in full resolution and is capped at 30fps. The store page isn’t kidding when it says that a controller is recommended, the keyboard and mouse controls are horrible.  On top of all that, the game uses Games for Windows Live, which doesn’t let you access your save file if you are not connected to the internet.   Edit: The game has been ported to steamworks, not sure how this affects the online just yet, but at least you don't have to go through all of the GFWL account nonsense Fortunately, some of these things can be fixed with mods, DSfix does a great job of fixing most of the problems the PC port has, and DSMfix fixes the problems with the controls (I still recommend a controller though).I could go on and on about what makes Dark Souls so amazing, but this review is long enough already. If you are willing to install some mods to make it work, I would recommend this game to anyone, even to those who don’t like difficult games.			"

												Dark Souls is that one must play for any hardcore gamer (or even average gamers) for several reasons, one of them being challenging yourself to go as far as you can into this game before quitting in rage or frustration, except the game still has fine design like to make you come back.This is surely one of the hardest games out there, and simply playing it without focusing on cheesing the heck out of the game would be brag worthy.Both the PvE and PvP for this game are really good, it has always had an active community even after further installments (3 other installments, 2 if you don't count Bloodborne). You'll always find people to do co-op with or PvP against. Of course, keep in mind there's the malicious players at very early game that abuse the Soul Level system for matchmaking, and would stay at a low enough level to where they would be able to invade newbies, while they have mid-game gear, solely for the sake of picking on the newbies.More onto the PvE, this game's bosses aren't the only difficult thing, even the weaker enemies are dangerous if you think you can just rush through everything without proper gear or knowing what you're doing. The atmosphere gives you a feeling of being alone and maybe even helpless in this dark setting. Overcoming the dangers Dark Souls throws at you gives an extremely satisfying feel, for good reason, as you have managed to become good enough to just push away what used to destroy you, even if you may not have the gear to do so yet and you manage either way.Skill and patience is everything in Dark Souls. Taking the strongest weapon you have available early game through some gimmicks will not help you win. Finding a good weapon with a comfortable moveset (and is atleast the strongest or second strongest of it's weapon type) is what you need instead, so that you can kill enemies without worrying about messing up, specially since you've gotten attatched to your weapon.Replayability is also something big in Dark Souls: you'll always end up coming back at some point, and have between dozens of builds possible for your character, all dependant on what you'd prefer your playstyle to be like. All character ''classes'' can be anything in this game, the classes only determine your starting gear and stats to give you a headstart for your build. There's just a few things bad about this game and it's the networking. The game used Games For Windows Live up until some point, and has been updated to use Steam instead for the connectivity, roughly a year ago. Even then, there are clear issues with the online play like suddenly losing connection with all other players, making you unable to see other players' blood stains (death points), or not even be matched for PvP at all. There's fortunately a mod out there to fix this, and I'll provide a link for it and a few other things to improve the game's rough spots.Recommended Mods:DSFix:http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19/?You *need* to get this mod if you wish to improve your framerate (even unlock from 30 FPS to 60), resolution, and overall graphics level for Dark Souls. You should get it even if you do not wish to upscale the graphics, the built-in FPS lock for Dark Souls is actually unoptimized, and simply unlocking it but then using this mod's own FPS Lock on 30, grants a major performance boost. Be aware that unlocking to 60 FPS will cause animation and hitbox issues.DSCM: Wulf's DS Connectivity Modhttp://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1047/?Will improve, as the title says, the connectivity in dark souls allowing you to not simply lose connection with other players and give you the ability to connect to someone in specific like a friend of yours for co-op.Dark Souls PVP Watchdog:http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/849/?This mod will improve the matchmaking in a way that it will make sure you do not get matched with people that cheated their way up into the game, like being at Soul Level 5 but having 99 in every single stat, making them insanely overpowered. Those players will be blocked out from your connection with this mod.Another thing you could look for is SweetFX, but be warned that most presets for this kind of graphics mod mess up brightness in a way that places that are already dark will end up *pitch black* and give you a lot of trouble just to try to see what's there. And there are a lot of already pitch black areas in Dark Souls before this mod, so keep that in mind.Overall Rating: 9/10:Gameplay Rating: 9/10Music Rating: 9/10Graphics Rating: 8/10Replayability: 10/10- Nominated for ''The Test of Time'' Award. -			"

Verdict:Buy now!Buy on saleSave your money Overall Score:8.5/10Summary:I feel like Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition has been taunting me for 4 years - waiting for me to play it. I'd heard a lot about it and the hype so thought I'd experience it first hand.To critique this game is not so straightforward. There are major issues. It's a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port and you will spend your initial time downloading the DSFix 'mod' just so you can get it into a reasonably playable state. Forget about playing it on Keyboard and Mouse, unless you like extra punishment, a controller is a MUST (Steam controller worked well for me as an aside). The graphics are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (even for 2012, but remember at its core this is a last-gen console game). The absence of a tutorial or tooltips will have you alt tabbing and searching YouTube just to try and find out even the most basic of info that will be crucial to your game.Yet despite all that the game rises to be head and shoulders over the sum of its parts. Once you accept the basic premise that you are there to die and learn from your mistakes (the game even has a mechanic where you can watch other people’s death, via a ghost, by clicking on their bloodstain to help learn from their mistakes). Then you will practice and practice and finally get it right - rewarding you with extremely satisfying moments, a feeling not often found in today’s games. There is something to be said for taking on a boss 6 or 7 times then finally defeating him. It's not just a matter of doing the boss fight, it's clearing the trash every single time, occasionally losing your XP in the process, which will serve to both destroy your soul and have you punching the air in triumph when you are finally successful.Overall the game is akin to flawed genius, you know something is not quite right, the game will brutally punish your mistakes and yet it is almost because of it that you will find yourself coming back for more. I'm pretty sure this is the only game I have actually Rage Quit in the last 5 or so years.I've recommended picking up On Sale because the game has been around long enough and on sale enough times that you can save your money, add it to your wish list and then grab it at the next sale (unless of course you have a burning desire to play straight away).The Good:Brutal and satisfying gameplayCommunity support Good old fashion boss fightsSound is greatThe Bad:Can feel lost as a new player, with very little information to go onThe graphicsYou need to fix the off the shelf game (DSFix) before playing it to avoid a suboptimal experienceThe Ugly:A terrible console port, NOT supported after releaseCamera can be frustratingPro TipAlthough you may need to go to the Wiki / YouTube to get some of the basics of the game, I highly recommend you stay away from watching boss fights and reading guides - the most satisfying experience will be making your own way through the game.

												I don't know what to say about this game, so let's start from the beginning.I bought this game on a humble bundle just for fun and I kinda wanted to play the game for a long time.Bought a cheap controller and started playing. When I got stuck at the Gargoyle Boss, I just stopped playing for a while.Then, when I beat the bosses I had this overwhelming feeling of power and I wanted to play it more and kill more bosses.Then the game got harder and harder, but I had a system of killing bosses, but I wasn't really smart when it comes to NPCs, Blacksmiths etc... because I killed most of them without even realising the consequences.When I realised that I was ♥♥♥♥ed and I couldn't upgrade the weapons more then 5+ I thought to my self: ""Meh, ♥♥♥♥ it, I'm gonna keep playing.""But when you get further in the game, bosses really seem just like a pain in the ♥♥♥ and they're not really that hard anymore.I just wanna say that this game is really addictive and one of my favourite games of all time ( My personal Top 10) even though I don't really play RPG games (I'm more of a FPS Guy), but I'm glad that I made an exception for this game and I'm glad that I finished it.Overall great gameplay,graphics are solid (but I don't care about that), good and challenging boss fights and well made combat gameplay.10/10			"

												Dark Souls is clearly the pinnacle of storytelling in all forms of media out there. With deep, varied characters who openly express their interests and backgrounds to you without having to prod them for any information whatsoever. You play as a strong independent creatue known as Cho-Zen Ahn-Dehd, and youjust kiddingit's pretty good, doesn't hold your hand, has a vague story that you'll only gather glimpses of if you read item descriptions and talk to everyone with dialogue, and has a whacky multiplayer with horrible net codedon't read guidesdump everything into resistanceamazing chest ahead7/10 "

												This is without a doubt one of the laziest and most poorly made PC ports I've ever seen. I have a little over two hours of playtime on this port and the entirety of that time was spent trying to get it to run above 15 FPS. And that's indoors - once it gets into an open area, the framerate drops even lower. I don't have the greatest machine, true, but neither do many people - and this game isn't pretty enough to justify the demands it makes on your computer.That being said, Dark Souls remains an excellent game. Having played through the first two games I can without a doubt recommend it - just not the PC version. If you have a high-end PC with a strong CPU and don't have another system that can run this game, then maybe this is for you. Even so, you'll definitely want to get DSFix just to make the game's resolution worth it.9/10 game, 1/10 port.			"

Genre: Hardcore Action RPGGame Time: 60~70+ hoursThe PC port is passable. The game itself however boasts a solid combat mechanic ahead of it's time, which even in 2015 is one of the best on the market. The dialogue is minimal and the story itself isn't presented like traditional RPGs but the atmosphere just reeks of heart-crushing despair and helplessness. You can genuinely feel the fall of a civilization as you progress through the levels and see the destruction of monuments and countless fallen soldiers turned hollow.The level design is a brilliant display of craftsmanship although in the later levels you acquire the ability to warp through specific checkpoints.The colorful bosses will repeatedly destroy you until you get good to the point of not needing to rely on cheesy exploits. Fitting music too. You will scream in terror at your first encounter with the Taurus Demon while the orchestra and chorus enhances the fear of being crushed to death.Dark Souls has a crazy amount of content and great ideas executed perfectly, if not for the age of the game the full-price of $20 is a massive steal. It's multiplayer and co-op despite being released on the PC in Q3 2012, is still well alive. Of course not as lively as what it used to be but not dead to say the least.Sometimes the player count can exceed what Evolve got on average during it's free-weekend, and that game came out this year.There are so few criticisms for the game I would be nitpicking if I were to make one up. Besides it's obvious that the game had a limited budget and time constraints, but the fact that FromSoftware managed to create a game of this magnitude, is just inhuman. Seriously amazing job guys.Oh, and don't forget to install DSfix![www.nexusmods.com] "

												This game is good in the same way in the same way that aloe is good after a sunburn: you enjoy brief periods of respite between the annoyance that is most of the actual game.I will agree that the game is well designed and the controls are actually pretty crisp, but that doesn't make up for the rest of it. Or maybe a better analogy would be that it seems like the game designers don't like the people that play their games and they are metaphorically spitting in their faces by making this game.Start the game walk in any direction...dieFigure out where you're supposed to go...dieMake it super far into a new area, meet boss. Die immediately. Spend 7 minutes and 20 seconds (actually timed) getting back to the same place that you were at. Die. Repeat. Die. Repeat. Win. Move on to next area.Find new type of enemy. They cursed you. Die slowly.Before you get back to new enemy. Get restless and sloppy with easy enemies. DIE (even the average enemy of your level can 3 or 4 shot kill you within the space of maybe 2 seconds). Lose all you souls.I wouldn't be so bothered by this game, but I was expecting it to at least be fair. If you mess up you pay, but the majority of your death is just guess and check. OH this enemy has some move that I couldn't have predicted without dying that can one shot me. That happens over and over and over.All of that stuff being said, the game is relatively fun, but I usually can't stand to play it for more than maybe half an hour before it bothers me too much to continue.

												""It's not hard, but hard to get into"" - VaatiVidyaIs Dark Souls a hard game? Yes. Is it unfair? Mostly not. Is it impossible? Not at all. The main difficulty is how it is unfriendly to new players. You may have troubles understanding where to go, what to do, how to defeat some tough enemies, how to upgrade equipment, etc. Not gonna lie, I consulted some guides once in a while. But if you actually listen to NPCs, look at your environment, and use other players' help, everything gets much easier. The reward is astonishing. Dark Souls features unforgettable action-RPG experience, a grim but beautiful world, violent combat, unique designs, original online features (both coop and PvP), an excellent soundtrack by Motoi Sakuraba and high replayability. There are still enough players online, so you won't feel alone. The story is not a main point in the game, but it still has some great characters and side stories, however you need to look carefully not to miss them. Framerate issues at some locations and bad mouse/keyboard controls may spoil your gameplay, so a mod called DSFix and a gamepad are indispensable.Overall, I liked the game very much. To tell the truth, it took me several attempts to get used to it, but it was worth it.9/10			"

												So, recently I bought this casual game called ""Dark Souls: Prepare to Lag"" edition. But when I tried to play it, I suddenly heard the low voice behind me, it whispered something like: ""oh hey buddy, you wanted to play? No, first you should install the ""Windows Live"" or you won't be able to save the game"". ""Yes, my lord,"" - I answered, and did what the voice asked. ""Good! But I see LIVE doesn't work on your Windows 8, try to get some updates."" So I did. Then I launched the game again, but the resolution was quite low and only on the half of my monitor. ""AHAHAH! poor PC-baby! - the voice was laughing on me, - Well, don't worry, you'll just have to find another fix, it's nothing so hard, isn't it?"". I googled some stuff and started Dark Souls with it, but it crashed. I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, while the voice continued, this time in my head: ""Oh boy, you just forgot to turn off the AA. Also, if you don't wanna play with 30 fps, you should get another patch. And don't forget to install a few more fixes for mouse and keyboard. Plus, you should..."". THAT'S IT, - I screamed, - ENOUGH! THAT'S THE HARDEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED, I CAN'T EVEN LAUNCH IT. SHUT UP ALREADY, YOU HEAR ME? LEAVE ME ALONE, I DON'T WANT TO  PLAY YOUR STUPID GAME ANYMORE, PLE.... The door in my room opened. My mom found me screaming on the floor without pants, crying and fapping at the same time. ""You're just like your father,"" - she said. A strong cold wind was gently touchung my butt, I smilled and fell asleep. I was finally happy.			"

												Making list of reasons why ds was so ♥♥♥♥ed up this big is too hard so instead you get this.SPOILER ALERTSolaire of Astora can't find his ""sun"", his only reason to not go hollow so he puts on a fancy shining maggot hat and laughs like a madman.Siegmeyer of Catarina loses his only reason to keep his humanity, slowly loses it and finally gets killed by his own daughter.Sieglinde of Catarina travels half of earth only to kill her father second time.Sad warrior is sad. (loses all his hope and does not like big snake so much that he goes hollow)Rhea of Thorolund gets betrayed by Petrus of Thorolund, loses her escort, maybe even then get killed by Petrus and finally gets abducted by Seath and goes hollow, while struggling to find her place in the world. Queelag of Izalith tries to save her sister by killing and getting humanity off every intruder of her domain and gets killed by main hero.Fair Lady sucks poison of her servants so they don't die, suffers in agony and slowly dies herself after that.Dark Sun Gwyndolin have both breasts AND mans bazooka.Anastacia of Astora gets killed by Embraced Lautrec than gets revived by chosen undead, hopes that curse will break if chosen undead uses himself as a firewood, but that is not the case.Shiva of the East is pretty much like Solaire, but he finds what he seeks (chaos blade) and than goes mad.Witch of Izalith tries to replicate the First Flame but instead gets consumed by the fire, thus creates demons and becomes Bed of Chaos (these shining balls is her daughters and one of the demon bosses in Izalith is her son).Pinwheel is a creature made of family, literally.Artorias tries to stop Abyss spreadingin Oolacile but fails to do so because he protects his friend, puppy Sif and gets devoured by the Abyss.Great Grey Wolf Sif - saved by the main hero he then protects the ring of Artorias so no one will die like him only to get killed by main hero.AND MANY MORE. I will add reasons to the list when i will come up with any anything new (i probably won't)			"

												I'm going to write a serious review because I'm sick of seeing the ""11/10 there was a butt"" nonsense.It's a good game but it has it's flaws. I'd recommend it and I rate it 8/10. If you are looking for a challenging RPG that doesn't require grinding or deep deep levels of thought towards stats. If you enjoy hard boss fights that act as an exam on the game mechanics and enemies that will put up a fight, then this game is for you.Good:+The difficulty is not only offers a sense of challenge but also a sense of fear that any enemy can kill you if you dismiss it. It is mostly fair with one or two instances where it just gets silly, but that rarely happens. The feeling inside when you see a new type of enemy is a strangly good sense of fear and dread, wondering if they'll just up and one shot you, or explode or eat you is a weirdly great feeling.+The atmosphere is pretty depressing and dark which fits perfectly for the game.+World design is very good, the world not only is well connected but it aesthetically seems well connected. There is a vast array of areas that are extremely different, yet feel perfectly connected to each other.+Majority of the boss fights are fair, but only some are extremely hard (IMO). If you don't mess around and be serious you can smash most bosses. When you defeat a boss that you are having trouble on it is one of the best feelings leaving you wanting to play more.+Combat is very well designed. It's simple and easy to understand and once you get into the zone you will love just going from A-B because of the fantastic combat.+The multitude of ways to play makes the game replayable and diverse. You are also not locked into one class, you can level up into any stats you want leaving it open for unique play.+Story is interesting but quite shallow, it just left me wanting more of a story and I guess that's a sign of a good story that wasn't fleshed out enough.+PVP can be fun but it's too heavily affected by lag making it unfun and obtrusive, but this could just be a personal problem with lag so I'm adding it as a plus.+The RPG elements are easy to follow and understand, making it easy for you to get the most out of your character.Bad:-Controls can be a bit clunky, making the roll and jump the same button is terrible design, especially when there is no move    assigned to L3/Left thumbstick.-The port and GFWL make it pretty annoying to use, but this can easily be ignored-As for story, it's interesting but it's pretty shallow. Dark souls fans will always make note of how the story must be found and searched for, this is true. If you look for story and lore you will find it, but, when you do look into it you hit a brick wall quickly. There is a very small amount of background information in the game. Through the game I was super interested in the story, wondering who is this guy and what's his story, and I'd be met with 2 sentences about him. Also, too much of this lore is speculation and it's extremely vague. It's good to leave some things up to interpretation, but god. Not this much.-Bad possibly even the worst fanbase. This fanbase enjoys talking down to every other RPG over the casual pastime they enjoy, they refute any claims of bad game design (major or minor), claiming that it would literally ruin the game and they are just generally mean spirited towards anyone who doesn't like the game or has a genuine criticism. It's best to just avoid them and their elitism. "

												On your hero's journey to become a better gamer, nay, an objectively superior person, Dark Souls is your personal '80s training montage. It needs no tacked-on Achievements system, because every bit of meaningful progress you make is an achievement in itself. It needs no difficulty levels, because, like any rewarding video game, it starts on Very Hard, progresses to Insane (or, in Touhou parlance, ""For Weird People"",) and then smooths out to Hard mode once you've gotten the hang of it, which comes with the satisfying moment in which you realize you're ready for whatever comes ahead.You either outsmart the game, or you take a break and come back swinging after you have one of the many eureka moments you'll experience. You'll initially have a hard time figuring out how to be a smart-♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and beat the baddies of Lordran at their own game, but in doing so, you will unleash the inner fighting spirit you had all along. Dark Souls is not just an inventive and engrossing game that makes a strong case for the evolution of games into an art form. It's not just a brilliant marriage of East and West game design values. It's also a teaching tool. Dark Souls will teach you to be cautious and aware of your environment, and the consequences of failure (namely through the Humanity system and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ basilisk curses.) Dark Souls encourages cooperation and compassion for your fellow players. You can be a ♥♥♥♥ and leave false post-its for other players, and/or gank them mercilessly to rob them of Humanity, but you really get a ""we're all in this together"" kind of feeling with the way the game rewards cooperation, assistance, and hunting down merciless invaders. It plays great, makes you feel like a badass, contains Berserk references, and is a brilliant example of environmental storytelling. And damn, those environments. What a gorgeous view.If you don't give Dark Souls a fighting chance (at least 10 hours of tryhard playtime,) you're an overgrown, stinky, pouting, grimacing, liliputian, whiny, poopy, little velcro-sneaker-wearing tyke. If you've given it a fair shot and don't like it yet, don't worry. You've proven you have the Guts to rise to the challenge. When you're ready. But harden your heart. You will get there, but it won't be easy. Prepare to die.A+			"

												One of the greatest games of this generation (one of my favorites). Despite playing almost 1000 hours and doing more than 20 playthroughs, i still keep coming back to it. Most of the fun is trying new builds, using diferent weapons and armor, which makes the replay value very high. The RPG elements are very good and combat is great (buy a ps3 or 360 controller). With the mods that can be installed for pc it's even better (especially graphics mods). This game is a must buy and it's still time to pick it up.

												Renowned for being difficult and for good reason.  This game will test your patience as it throws you into a dark, dying world with little explanation and almost no equipment.  You will die.  You will die a lot.  But out of all the death comes understanding of the game.  And with understanding comes satisfaction.  Eventually the bosses will start to drop.  And someday you may understand what all the numbers in the menu mean.  Don't feel bad looking up guides to help you if you're super confused.  Better than quitting I say.  But don't let it do the work for you.  And don't spoil anything!  Discovery is the name of the game!This game has an excellent setting and even better enemy design.Praise the sun!P.S.

												Preaching to the choir a bit, but man, this game is pretty great.I'm going to save time and just give the cliff notes since I think everything has pretty much already been said otherwise.+ Lots of content. So many puzzles, weapons, spells, monster types, upgrade paths, shortcuts and secrets, everything! The game is ♥♥♥♥ing /packed/.+ Lots of variety. So many interesting locales. I'm almost wondering what they'll do for the sequel to spice it up since so many ideas have already been used. Maybe a blizzard area or a desert.+ It feels like a fantasy come to life. Interesting lore, fitting dialogue and voice acting. It's all so well realized.+ A very small number of reskins. Game feels fresh from start to finish.+ Rewarding. The boss fights are each like a puzzle which often trouble you the first go around but even simply give 1 retry and you can feel how you've improved. - Some things are a bit obtuse. Like, it's not clear why one would want to stock humanity points without looking it up. It feels safer to just keep the humanity items pocketed.- Wish there was better item management. You get a lot of items. For instance, I think identical weapons and armors should stack if you have multiples. Looking forward to Dark Souls 2!			"

												Dark Souls.Spiritual successor to the Playstation 3 exclusive Demon Souls, with a well deserved reputation for being a brutal game. Dark souls is often touted as being ""NES hard"" compared to the hand-holding games of the modern generation, by the way the game implements hard but fair gameplay. The 3rd person fantasy RPG features a plethora of weapons to cater to a varity of different playstyles and a large world to explore.The game opens with a cinematic that gives the player a history of the first flame and souls, but the rest is left to the player to interpret and discover.Throughout the inter-connected world of Lordran you will find bonfires that restore your healing items (Estus Flasks) whenever you rest at them. The implementation of limited heals creates this 'risk vs reward' aspect to adventuring, where if you run out of your charges, you can either press on towards a new bonfire, or return to the old one to give it another go. The Bosses in Dark Souls are brilliantly crafted and offer both test of the players combat knowledge, figuring out the attack patterns, timing your attacks and healing, as well as the crawl back to the boss from bonfires testing your knowledge of the level.One minor gripe with Dark souls, is that lag can heavily effect gameplay in certain areas causing annoying deaths and damage. This happens rather rarely, as to not majorly affect the games otherwise good controls.All in all, Dark souls is an amazing game that is tough but fair giving a rich fantasy RPG experience to anyone who picks it up.Praise the sun!

												For those whom haven't ever played a souls game before, then please read this. For those that have, and haven't played Dark Souls PTDE, then it's imperative you read this.Firstly, for those that don't know, Dark Souls is the first in a trilogy of games that boasts ever growing popularity as they are released, and is the best introduction into Souls games you will receive - gritty, bitter, soul crushing disappointment... followed by frustration, determination, perseverance and eventually insatiable lust. Yes, this is not a nice game, but it has the potential to be the best.Now, whilst you may have heard of the spiritual predecessor, Demon's Souls, and spiritual successor, Bloodborne; know that while they share similar mechanics, these game are not part of the Dark Souls trilogy, and shouldn't wholly determine whether you'll think you'll like this game - which they haven't otherwise you wouldn't be reading a review to make up your mind...START HERE IF YOU ONLY CARE FOR THE WORTHWHILE STUFF ::I'll start out by saying, this game isn't for the feint of heart. If you don't like difficulty, or you're not patient, or you think Skyrim can be hard... this isn't for you. I can tell you, I've played that crap with survival mods on legendary difficulty and all it does is bore me. Dark Souls brings difficulty and mixes it with ingenuity to create a whole new kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tearing experience for the new player. But, it is a game that can be mastered, and within no time it shall be the player tearing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s... of newbs... using twink builds - because we're all sadists at heart.Since we're on that topic, let's talk about combat. Dark Souls has one of the best, and most advanced combat systems of any RPG out there - easily combating that of Dragon's Dogma and other such games. FromSoftware has placed heavy focus on a mixture of tactical and reactive combat. One can win a fight using reflexes alone, but the game punishes you for not planning ahead. The player whom prepares properly, and learns their enemy, will find themselves breezing through most areas and bosses in no time.Stamina management is a key feature in Dark Souls. Stamina, shown as a green bar on the top left corner of one's HUD, determines the players ability to dodge, attack, block, parry, sprint, jump and at times can even affect the speed and damage of one's attacks. It is infinite, in that it recharges over time, but poor management can lead to a temporary loss of stamina, leaving the player wide open, and 90% of the time will result in death, or something close to it. Always be wary of your stamina.That aside, the combat system in Dark Souls is very complex. From 'sweet spot' attacks, which alter damage dealt depending on which part of your weapon strikes the enemy; to differing types of critical attacks, and the various damage types the game has on offer. One of the 'unseen' but easily recognised features of the game are enemies' weaknesses and resistances. While certain enemies will be weak to thrusting or slashing damage, they may be resistant to striking attacks... and vice versa.

Set in a dark, fantastical, medieval setting - Dark Souls sets the player in one of the most flawlessly designed worlds to be seen in an RPG. The interconnected world, which intertwines on itself, with twists and turns at every corner leading to new and exciting areas as often as the well needed relief of realising it was a shortcut back to your last bonfire (effective checkpoint), will leave most in awe of just how flawlessly created this masterpiece is.The world itself is fully connected, with each area having a realistic and very visible geographical relation to one another. Most often, that place you see in the distance is somewhere you will travel later; and there's a peculiar sense of satisfaction in seeing the place you earlier surpassed off in the distance, and realising how far you've come since.Disregarding that, the area design (each area is interconnected, but have their own names and environments) is absolutely top-notch. With various paths in each area, and an abundance of verticality almost everywhere you travel, the player will often find themselves stumbling upon surprises of both the good and bad variety... good usually comes after defeating the bad surprise though. Sorry. No reward without sacrifice. Alongside this, Dark Souls puts heavy focus on both the sense of relief and sense of accomplishment, and it's area design is something that does this very successful. Bonfires, a place where one may rest and replenish Estus, level up, and later use to fast travel (plus more), are scattered about the world - though scarcely. Areas focus on these bonfires, using shortcuts to provide the much needed relief to the player after their gruelling trek through an area. Some, however, are well hidden, so ensure you always fully explore every nook and cranny... but don't let your guard down. Dark Souls rewards exploration, but it also has its fair share of methods to stop you getting all its loot for free - watch your back, and shield up when rounding corners.Now, with both combat and design vaguely covered, the next subject is narrative. Often the biggest complaint about Dark Souls is its lack of a compelling story, and lore. Well, to those that believe such lies, I slap you with a dirty dishcloth and tell you to roll up hill donning the Catarina Armour until you are dizzy enough to warrant thinking such things, at which point I will still say you are a fool. Dark Souls has an immensely complex, emotional and amazing storyline. I freaking ran out of space, so you'll just have to believe me. \[+]/			"

												For those whom haven't ever played a souls game before, then please read this. For those that have, and haven't played Dark Souls PTDE, then it's imperative you read this.Firstly, for those that don't know, Dark Souls is the first in a trilogy of games that boasts ever growing popularity as they are released, and is the best introduction into Souls games you will receive - gritty, bitter, soul crushing disappointment... followed by frustration, determination, perseverance and eventually insatiable lust. Yes, this is not a nice game, but it has the potential to be the best.Now, whilst you may have heard of the spiritual predecessor, Demon's Souls, and spiritual successor, Bloodborne; know that while they share similar mechanics, these game are not part of the Dark Souls trilogy, and shouldn't wholly determine whether you'll think you'll like this game - which they haven't otherwise you wouldn't be reading a review to make up your mind...START HERE IF YOU ONLY CARE FOR THE WORTHWHILE STUFF ::I'll start out by saying, this game isn't for the feint of heart. If you don't like difficulty, or you're not patient, or you think Skyrim can be hard... this isn't for you. I can tell you, I've played that crap with survival mods on legendary difficulty and all it does is bore me. Dark Souls brings difficulty and mixes it with ingenuity to create a whole new kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tearing experience for the new player. But, it is a game that can be mastered, and within no time it shall be the player tearing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s... of newbs... using twink builds - because we're all sadists at heart.Since we're on that topic, let's talk about combat. Dark Souls has one of the best, and most advanced combat systems of any RPG out there - easily combating that of Dragon's Dogma and other such games. FromSoftware has placed heavy focus on a mixture of tactical and reactive combat. One can win a fight using reflexes alone, but the game punishes you for not planning ahead. The player whom prepares properly, and learns their enemy, will find themselves breezing through most areas and bosses in no time.Stamina management is a key feature in Dark Souls. Stamina, shown as a green bar on the top left corner of one's HUD, determines the players ability to dodge, attack, block, parry, sprint, jump and at times can even affect the speed and damage of one's attacks. It is infinite, in that it recharges over time, but poor management can lead to a temporary loss of stamina, leaving the player wide open, and 90% of the time will result in death, or something close to it. Always be wary of your stamina.That aside, the combat system in Dark Souls is very complex. From 'sweet spot' attacks, which alter damage dealt depending on which part of your weapon strikes the enemy; to differing types of critical attacks, and the various damage types the game has on offer. One of the 'unseen' but easily recognised features of the game are enemies' weaknesses and resistances. While certain enemies will be weak to thrusting or slashing damage, they may be resistant to striking attacks... and vice versa. This same rule applies to the elemental types available in the game :- Magic- Fire- Lightning- Physical (which splits into Strike, Slash and Thrust)And on top of that are status effects :- Bleed - Poison- ToxinThis complex and diverse combat system allows almost infinite variety to every combat situation.

												Reminiscent of old-school gaming, Dark Souls is brutally unforgiving. It's fair though and 99% of your, frustratingly frequent, deaths will be due to your mistakes. When you clear one of the diverse and sometimes breath-takingly beautiful sections, another of the crazy and imaginative boss fights or find a secret area or piece of lore (of which the game hints at and can be delved into quite deeply if you so wish) you feel an immense sense of satisfaction and achievement. Interesting and exciting multiplayer opportunities (shame about Windows Live though), done in quite a unique way is thrown in too.Most modern gaming has automatic transition. Dark Souls is fully manual and you'll stall many times. But once you can smoothly drive you will feel like you're king of gaming.BUY THIS GAME.			"

												You're going to hate it for about an hour, then you will realize the following:The game is punishing, but rewarding.  You die a lot, but you lose nothing.  Every death is meant to be a learning experience.  After you get over this you can see that the combat is beautifully in depth.  The game world is amazing and seemlessly connected.  The atomsphere is amazing.  Everything about the game after getting your ♥♥♥ handed to you a few times is amazing and created beautifully.  Yes its hard, but the difficulty is rewarding, and everything you do in game feels satisfying.  Some tips:1.  Use a controller.  Sorry KB+M purists its just better.2.  Until you get good at abusing invuln frames on rolling use your shield liberally.  A good shield can block all but magic damage.3.  Weapon Upgrade >  Character levels.  A halbred + 5 will get so much done whereas 5 more levels are marginal at best.			"

												I can assure you that this is one of the best Action/RPG's of all time, however, if you not like challenge, if you not like a game that has no autosaves or a game that not hold your hand all the time, this game its not for you. This games requires that you have ability and persistence, and if you have those, you will be rewarded with a pure and perfect gameplay and exploration.Dark Souls is a MASTERPIECE, a game that has challenge, atmosphere, gameplay, exploration, all this, on the perfect dosage.

												\ |T| /Metroidvania-like exploration. Easy-to-learn, hard-to-master, not-too-bad-to-get-fairly-okay-at combat. A world with a complex history and obfuscated fate, and characters with more depth than they let on.First, the good.Dark Souls is known to be ""hard"" or sometimes even ""unfair"". I strongly disagree with the use of those terms. Challenging, yes, certainly.A lot of modern games featurea hell of a lot of hand-holding. Lengthy tutorials, excessive hints, storytelling like you're listening to teacher read from a book.Dark Souls has none of these things.Dark Souls respects its players enough to let them figure out how the world works on their own.People who are used to the handholding may find themselves utterly lost in the world of Lordran - this is a perfect opportunity to get back into the old-school 'explore places and try things' mindset.The key to getting through Dark Souls alone is a matter of keeping to a mindful approach. Keep an eye out for items. Always be prepared for combat. Listen carefully to what the NPCs have to say; they drop subtle hints about where you can or need to go, what the backstory is about, and it is important to note that they do NOT repeat the more important things they say.Don't worry though - missing dialogue won't stop you from advancing. Not at all. The dialogue is merely there to aid your understanding of your purpose and the world you are in. None of the lore is forced upon you, save for the single opening cutscene which explains little but hints at a lot. In fact, the lore is carefully hidden away, waiting to be discovered and puzzled out by anyone who would seek it.Gameplay-wise, it feels clunky to start with, as all the unfamiliar options and weapons are open to you to be found, and/or left strewn across the world without ceremony. Soon enough, though, the controls will feel nothing short of intuitive, and this *includes* the option of playing with keyboard only (look up the keyboard controls in a guide and give them a go. Dark Souls does not *require* a controller, as such).Dark Souls respects your ability to learn how to deal with the obstacles it presents, and that applies to every detail. The greater part of advancing in Dark Souls is less about leveling up and more about your own personal skill, which you'll find will naturally develop as you play the game. When you beat a boss, or even any minor foe, you'll feel the satisfaction of knowing it was your own skill that overcame it. The fact that you happen to be level 258 or so is merely a small aid, and adds a side dish of a sense of personal progress.It is in fact entirely possible to beat the game whilst being level 1.Don't try that for your first run.On the whole, the positive aspects of Dark Souls outshine what I have previously called the pinnacle of my gaming experience by a long shot. If you adore adventure, exploration, skill-based combat, atmospheric environments, deep story, and RPG elements, or any combination of at least two of those, this game is for you.Next, the bad.Uh.Well, the tutorial's just a little bit cruel to less experienced gamers. Not too much so, though. Again, learn from things and you'll be fine.Sometimes it is possible to get lost or stuck somewhere, if you missed a door or a key for example, and you may be forced to bring in either the help of spoiler-riddled guides, or a trusted friend. Though Jolly Cooperation is in no way a bad thing; you might even find it enhances the atmosphere in some cases.The voice acting is merely passable. Barely even that, really. Dark Souls features a good lot of talented voice actors, but what may have been poor direction has left a lot of their lines sounding a bit.. theatrical. Not that it matters so much; there's all too many things to make up for that in the feel of the game itself.Also, some storylines pertaining to some of the characters nearly brought me to tears. That was unexpected. But a good sign of immersion!On the whole, Dark Souls definitely has some rough edges. But then I've never found a true work of art that didn't.Come for the challenge, stay for the delightful immersion into the strange, unusual world, and in thine exodus from the Undead Asylum, thou better damn well Praise the Sun.

												Well, the title says a lot. You will die: a lot. However, you will savor every death as you struggle to improve your own abilities and survive in the oppressive world that From Software has created. The greatest achievement of Dark Souls, to me, is that it treats you like an adult. It does not hold you hand, it does not force endless tutorials or make you follow some generic NPCs as you mow down waves of unnamed brown dudes. No, Dark Souls let you jump into the action rather quickly and teaches you everything you need to know from the getgo in a very unobtrusive manner. Combat is a struggle as you try to read the enemies' attack patterns and react accordingly with your own moves. If you play it like a traditional hack and slash, you will die and go nowhere. Therefore, everything becomes a game of balancing aggression and defense as you learn when to engage, how to engage, when to evade, and when to block. If this sounds complex, that's because it is. Dark Souls will suck up numerous hours of your time with all of its nuances and secrets. But the one glaring blemish on an otherwise fantastic experience is the PC port. To be blunt, it's just not very good. It's a very barebones port that utilizes very little of the aspects that we love about PC gaming. However, DSFix largely ameliorates many of these issues, allowing you to play the game at a higher resolution and higher framerate, making it the definitive version of the game. Games For Windows Live, unfortunately, exists in this game and is a huge pain in the ♥♥♥. You'll be disconnected from LIVE in the middle of an epic boss fight (it happened to me on the Bell Gargoyles the first time around) and kicked back to the title screen or have save data deleted because GFWL uses a primitive patching system that serves as a massive inconvenience. The keyboard controls, while functional (especially with community fixes) are far from optimal. You'll definitely want a controller for this game. Finally, the game can chug at times even on a high end rig, so don't expect a perfectly smooth experience.However, despite all of that, Dark Souls is a fantastic game. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best games I've played in a very long while. The sense of accomplishment you feel as you claw your way through its brutal world or fend off hostile monsters that can easily kill you is practically uncontested. Most importantly, Dark Souls respects YOU as a player and does not baby you or insult your intelligence. It's a truly refreshing experience and one that most gamers should pick up, provided they're willing to overlook a lackluster port.			"

												This game is REALY REALY HARD. You wont be able to keep your sanity without a walkthrough so here it is:First off, when you launch the game, nothing happens, so you have to download a fix for it. Then when you try to install the fix you fail because you have 3 instances of the game running in the background due to your previous tries of launching it. Close the game running in the background and install the fix.Ok So, you now have the game running, well, ♥♥♥♥you because this game requires Games for Windows live and if you dont have it the game will not save for some reason. Now go on and download the gfwl setup from the microsoft website and install it, go far enough until you find an error saying that you have no connection to the internet. Now go to properties and run the setup in compatibility mode and also as an administrator even though you are already the only user on your personal computer. You are now able to go a bit further in the instalation but then a wild error apears... To use gfwl you need the live sign-in assistant, so there you go again to the microsoft website to download the assistant. After you run it, go back to the gfwl instalation. Since you are dealing with microsoft software, you will get the same error. You are now trapped  in a labyrinth of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ software and bad pc ports so you will have to find another way arround. After some google searches you realize you wasted too much time with this ♥♥♥♥ and you give up. In the final cutscene you see microsoft and namco bandai collecting all the souls of gamers (along with their wallets).I wanted a hard game to play, and thats what i got.9 steve ballmers out of 14 skyrims			"

The game itself doesn't mention it, but it absolutely requires an XBOX controller, otherwise it's simply unplayable (unless you use some of the fan made patches, it helps a little bit but not enough to save this poor excuse for a port) Later I bought this game on PS3 and it was one of the greatest games ever! Do yourself a favor and don't ever get this game on PC.One of the first issues I encountered was during the tutorial. I couldn't do something as simple as looting a body that was lying on the floor. I tried every button but nothing worked...			"

												That's right, I only played for 19 minutes. The port is so bad it's nigh unplayable. It may have some good content, but if I can't move around easily, interact with objects, navigate the menus etc., it doesn't matter.  I like difficult games, but not crappy console ports. This is lazy and I am disappointed. Not worth the space on my hard drive.  If you want to play this, get it on a console.			"

												I honestly wanted to like this game. At first it seems like a refreshingly tough action-RPG. However, the elements that make this game so hard aren't great enemy AI and challenging gameplay, but repetative and frustraiting mechanics that seem like they're creating just to make this game so difficult. There's a reason modern games have adopted frequent checkpoints - restarting areas again and again is more  annyoing than fun. Losing what you'd spent the last fourty minutes farming because one enemy managed to pull off a suprise combo just makes me wondering why I'm devoting free time towards something that feels like work. Watch some of the boss battle guides on youtube - most of them direct you to use some kind of exploit to win instead of describing a strategy to use to actually beat the boss fairlly. That's because most of the fights consist of blocking/countering again and again...that's it.			"

												This game is one of the best, most frustrating, enjoyable, irritating, and downright unique action RPG.The game is difficult to start with, but there is always a way. Once you learn the mechanics and the quirks of different NPC's and different levels, most sections are very straightforward. Although if you become too cavalier you will die.You really need the following mods to play the game:DSfix - essential. DMfix - you may have to search around to find the version that works, I think there is a steam forum that links to this. The original version of this doesn't work. Without it you can't really play wth mouse and keyboard as the controls are appalling.DSCfix - this makes the online part of the game actualy work properly. Without those mods the frustration becomes far greater than any possible enjoyment. With them it can still, but the game itself is so great you can forgive poor camera controls that cause you to die, poor targeting that causes you to die sometimes, and the many other odd quirks and poor design choices in an otherwise superb game.

												Dark Souls; the game with an infamous reputation.When it first released, I was skeptical as to whether I wanted to buy a game that had a reputation for being harder than trying to break into Fort Knox. So, as a result, I avoided buying it. However, in the summer of this year (2015), I decided, why the hell not?  During the Summer Sale I bought it for roughly £7. (I forgot the specific price.) I can safely say now, after clocking up almost 300 hours on Dark Souls, and counting, that the purchase was absolutely worth it. So, let's get some context shall we? (There's a lot of context, so be warned!)[Also! Dark Souls likes to follow the story-telling method of not telling you the story; if you want to know the lore, you've got to go research it!]~Set in a pseudo-medieval fantasy world, the game explains that long before the present time, the world was grey, ultimately rocky and dusty and covered by huge 'Arch Trees'. This world was ruled over by the 'Everlasting Dragons' ; aptly named because they were immortal. At this time, there was no light or dark; no life or death in the world, only the Everlasting Dragons.~At some point in this world, Fire was born (The game doesn't really explain how, so run with it) and from this flame was born four 'Lord Souls' (Souls in the game, act as a sort of power source for magic and the like, as opposed to being a representation of one's personality.) Three of these souls were found by the 'Lords', a race of humanoid creatures that would later become the 'Gods' of the world, while the fourth was found by the 'Furtive Pygmy', who is widely believed to have been the ancestor of Mankind/The first Human. (I'm not going to explain this story arc; go look it up if you wish to know more.) ~The Lords rebelled against the Everlasting Dragons, and using their one weakness (lightning-based magic), peeled apart the stone scales that gave the Dragons their immortality. (Without their scales, the Everlasting Dragons are not immortal) The Lord's succeeded, The Dragons were wiped out (supposedly) and this ushers in an 'Age of Fire'; where light and dark, life and death are brought into the world.~Now, in between then, and the game start, there's a lot of lore that I won't go into (Again, go research the lore; It's really worth it), but it's safe to say that the Age of Fire began to dwindle and the power of the 'Gods' began to crumble.~Fast forward to the present, the world is but a shadow of its former self; with both Kingdoms of the Lords and Human Kingdoms lying in complete desolation. This is because of the 'Curse of Undeath', a condition that replaces death with a form of immortality. However, the reason why it's called a curse is because those who are Undead with no purpose and no motivation/will to live will 'go Hollow', wherein they lose their minds and become reduced to mere husks. These husks are then plagued to wander the world forever; as nothing but shadows of humanity. They are hostile: attacking whoever gets close to them.~This, is where you come in. You are a cursed undead waiting to go hollow in an asylum. However, you are freed from your cell to fulfill an ancient prophecy to 'Re-kindle the Age of Fire' (Again, go look it up). And from there on, your quest begins.(Big nutshell I know, but this game has metric shed-tonnes of lore!) So! With that explained, what's the actual game like?~Well, the game does have a reputation for being very difficult, and whereas I didn't really have too much trouble with the game myself, I understand that it can be quite hard to get used to. The game could be said to be a hack 'n' slasher, but also an action-adventure game with RPG elements. At the start of the game, you pick a class to play, (classes include pyromancers, knights, sorcerers etc) and you then play through the game, levelling up and gaining new items to fit that class. The classes can be blended, so don't think that if you pick knight, you're stuck to using melee for the rest of the game; you could do a knight-sorcerer blend, or a knight-pyromancer etc etc etc. ~The combat (which is basically the core gameplay mechanic of Dark Souls), is very well polished and rounded. It's dangerous enough to maintain a high level of challenge, but balanced enough to be (relatively!) fair; if you die, there's a 90% chance that is was YOU that screwed up, not the game. This balance means that whenever you die, you don't become exasperated, you simply grit your teeth and go at it again. (Not always, but you rarely get to the instance where you might ragequit from the game) In addition, the game carefully avoids being artificially difficult (enemies with ridiculous health bars or stupid amounts of DPS etc), and is instead naturally difficult; with the difficult relying on how well you play the game, not how high-level you are. (It is entirely possible to complete the game without levelling up at all!) ~The game also includes a unique game-mechanic called the 'Humanity system'. I shan't go into the lore, but basically, humanity can be picked up from monster drops as an item, and absorbed from fallen enemies as 'liquid humanity' (Humanity picked up as items can be used to increase the amount of liquid humanity you possess). This 'liquid humanity' is used to kindle bonfires (basically more health kits at checkpoints), and also to reverse the hollowing process. When you die in Dark Souls, you lose your liquid humanity, and also your 'Souls' (ingame currency for BOTH purchases and levelling). You can go to recover them from the last safe place you stood before you died, but if you die on the way there, they are gone forever. ~This is due to the constantly moving world of Dark Souls, and that you can't simply revert a save in Dark Souls; a choice made is a choice made, it cannot be reversed or altered for the rest of the playthrough. (Again, another way the game is naturally challenging.) ~You can also transition from two separate player states within the game; Human and Hollow. When hollow, you cannot interact with other players of the game, and you cannot summon NPCs to help you with certain boss fights. When Human, you can summon both NPCs and other players into your world for co-op play, but you also run the risk of being invaded by hostile players who seek a duel to the death. Therefore, it is recommended that you traverse most of the world as a hollow, only converting back to human when you need help with a boss or an area.All of these factors combine to make the challenging, yet highly entertaining, odyssey that is Dark Souls.ALL IN ALL, DARK SOULS IS A FANTASTIC GAME.I sincerely enjoyed the time I spent playing this game, and I intend to play it for many, many more hours to come. It's tough, engaging, and ultimately, barrels filled with puppies and kittens of fun. This game is definitely worth you buying it! "

												Prepare To Die is a good addition to this game's name. You will die. Lots of times. There is no getting around it. However, the first death is also the first step.Dark Souls is a 3rd Person RPG, set in a fantasy world with very dark themes. You've probably heard about this game from a friend or some person on the internet, and one of the things you've probably heard is the challenge involved. Yes, this game is incredibly hard. No, it is not unfair in any way, and yes, you can do it.There's a fairly high barrier to entry for the game, and even then the difficulty is higher than your normal game. However, Dark Souls is not unfair or just a bunch of cheap tactics. The kind of difficulty it presents is respectful. It isn't something like CoD's Veteran difficulty, where they just make the AI react as soon as you enter the room and one shot kills, making many certain spots impassable. Instead, they use creative enemy placement and tight controls to give you the feeling that even though you died this time, you can overcome it the next time. It has a great feelnig of trial and learning by error.This is why the death mechanics are what they are, because when you die you lose all of your accumulated souls (kind of like EXP) and ""humanity"", but if you can go to where you died you have a shot at getting them back. But, die again and they all disappear forever. It gives a feeling that you learn from death, because when you enter that room where you died to get your souls back, you know the surprise that killed you, and can prevent it from happening again. It's a lot like the mantra ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me"".But good and difficult gameplay is not the only thing Dark Souls has to present. The game presents a world deeply rooted in lore, and you decide your level of involvement with the plot. Maybe you wonder how this person got here or how the situation got as dire as it is, and search through item descriptions and NPC chat to find the answer. Or just pass off the backstory of the horrible monstrosity in front of you and say ""Who cares, the game has presented me with another trophy for my wall!"". This method of story telling is so that the story does not intrude upon the game, as there are few cutscenes, and the few that there are are very short, and it helps give the game an interconnected, continuous feeling, and contributes to the dark themes of the game.In addition to these themes, the game radiates a fantastic atmosphere. The HUD is very non intrusive, only conveying what it needs, and the game continues even if you are in the pause menu changing your gear. Its a sense of continuous action, and that you cannot let your guard down. Graphics are very good, and the game only puts in what it needs. See a giant castle or cave in the distance? You're probably gonna go there at some point. It all gives a sense that you have a purpose and a mission, and that you have to keep moving, even with all the depression included in this world. The soundtrack is also very good, being there at the critical points of the game, such as boss fights. At a lot of points there are silence, but this contributes to the feeling that the game is very tense. In general, everything the game includes is only what is necessary, no extra bits for the sake of content.Even the multiplayer is there for the sake of the game. There are 3 main types of ways players can interact with each other. First, players can scrawl messages on the ground for others to see, perhaps warning them of an upcoming ambush or trap, or misguiding them due to malicious intent. You have to choose which messages to trust carefully if you want to live. The 2nd way is by summoning white phantoms. Players may leave summon signs on the ground and get help from other players, or even NPC's. They help the player throughout the level, and disappear once the area boss is defeated, but not without reward. It fosters good intent among people. Then, the 3rd way is by invasion of a world for PvP. Players may use specific items in the game to ""invade"" another player, coming into their world as a dark spirit to kill them and steal their ""humanity"" and souls. The multiplayer is not a simple deathmatch added for the sake of multiplayer, its there to enhance and enrich the game experience.Overall, Dark Souls can be summed up as challenge through tight gameplay, creative enemies and terrain and unique multiplayer, with a great atmosphere provided by good graphics, soundtrack and a plot that you can uncover at your own leisure (though the low FPS cap for this doesn't help). All in all, an outstanding game that respects the capabilities of the player by providing difficulty not for difficulty's sake, but for the player's benefit. Prepare to die. But prepare for great emotional reward as well.			"

												This is one of the best games of this generation. What makes it so? A formula very close to the one present in games called ""Metroidvanias"". In short, the idea is that we have a game world almost freely explorable. Almost, because some elements require certain things of the player, be it an item, skill or practical knowledge. The design tries to not implore the one right way, leaving an aspect of creativity for the players. This, in case of a Metroidvania game, Super Metroid, allowed to form a strong community focused on sequence breaking and optimizing playthroughs in the means of tool assisted speedruns. Dark Souls seem to acknowledge such efforts and provide players with tools to unite in cracking the game open. Bloodstains, messages, summoning and on the other hand, PvP, makes you feel being a part of an interesting and mysterious endeavour.While Dark Souls does not have as flexible game world as Super Metroid, it adds its own fresh element in form of eeriness. There is no holding hand so present in 99% of modern video games. Hints are obscure and subcutaneous, in form of item descriptions and vague stories told by NPCs. In fact, most of the plot-meat hides there. One would think this equals to weak lore or story, yet quite the opposite happens. Remember 8-bit games and how you wondered what this sprite really portaits, or imagined details beyond what was shown to you? Remember the feeling of reading your first books? This is what Dark Souls brings: the canvas for you to draw on with your imagination while the game provides brushes and inks.Dark Souls has one important gameplay aspect: you can be killed as easily by the boss as the weakest enemy. This effectively works as a kind of intimidation - you want to be cautios and situations can get tense. At the same time, your mistakes are almost always costly and the landscape also works against you. All of these create a tremendous immersion effect and often make you reconsider your approach, all the while instilling humility into you.What really makes the game fun at the core is the fighting system. The animations are detailed, attacks have the feel and power to them, different weapons have vastly different animation styles. Parry and backstab mechanics are plenty rewarding and never get old.RPG fans can find huge amounts of customization and variety of playthroughs, but what's important is that the game is fairly balanced in terms of equipment. A weaker gear can be just as much viable, because movement and attack style are equally important with damage dealt.Lastly, you have huge amounts of satisfaction coming from won boss fights and clearing areas, but that's only the resultant of coherent design which allows you to learn, improve and fight with your weaknesses.If you want to play a modern video game which does not insult your intelligence and does not constantly put a carrot on a stick in front of you, by any means, check it.

												Dark Souls is a marvel of its time, a game that reminds us that we shouldn’t be satisfied with well-produced mediocrity and “good-for-what-it-is” games. It’s challenging, mature, deep, polished, and above all, a game that respects its players. There’s no hand-holding here, you’ll learn the ropes by playing, and the game will test you at every step, frequently killing you. The challenges are finely tuned, appearing almost impossible at first, but are in fact perfectly fair and doable, and a source of great satisfaction once beaten. The fantastic combat takes the center piece here, being easily the best you’ll find in any Action-RPG. It requires tactic, demands attention and rewards patience like no other; all while providing you a vast array of weapons and armors to equip, and diverse enemies to test them, through expertly designed levels. Another high point, the melancholic story is masterfully told through subtle details in the scenery, hints in the items descriptions and concise, well-written lines from a cast of memorable NPCs, never relying in long expositions or lazy “Lore Books” by wannabe-writers.From Software raised the bar with Dark Souls; it’s not the best game ever, but it’s one that excels in absolutely everything that it does.

												This challenging fantasy action RPG throws you into a world where little can be taken at face value. The story is told in small conversations with NPCs and in item descriptions & placement. Incredible detail has been put into everything about this game which has a large community that regularly put out additional content (lore videos) that help expand a player's perception of characters. The combat is responsive and hinges of a huge variety of weapons, armour, and spells which really shines when you start playing online (and seeing all the crazy builds other people have come up with).There are some technical hiccups however, with the biggest being the GfWL DRM causing some issues with the innovative co-op/PVP aspect of the game. GfWL is also set to go down at some time in 2014, so hopefully the game will be patched to use Steam to handle the multiplayer in the future.In summary: this is a brilliant game, but a terrible port. If you can see past the technical issues, install the DSFix, and have a controlpad to hand, you may just fall deeply in love with this game.			"

												Great game. It's not really the kind of game where you join up with a bunch of people and fight waves of monsters, it's more like you're one of the last people on the planet, everyone else is either undead or becoming undead, and every once in a while you can have the opportunity to join up with another player like you.The game is locked at 30fps, but you can unlock it with a mod. Supposedly it's a bit buggy at 60fps, but I've never bothered to try it. Dark souls is an RPG, you level up as you collect souls, you choose what stats to level etc. The contols are simple and within an hour or so you should have them down. This game shines in the customization department. There are tons of weapons and pieces of gear that can allow you to play whatever you feel like, even if you feel like playing some sort of green-skinned monster, you can do it. The game world is lots of fun to go through, because it's all interconnected. There are no loading screens as you walk from one place to another, the entire world is essentially a labyrinth, and it is quite satisfying to discover all the connecting points and shortcuts throughout.Personally I think what sets dark souls apart is the feeling of intimidation you get when you see a monster 10 times your size, and realize that you have to find a way to kill it before moving on. It's a challenge, based largely on trial and error combined with skill, it is not for those who want to be spoon fed an interactive story. As frustrating as dark souls can be, it matches it and sometimes exceeds it with the feeling of accomplishment.			"

												This game is the most satisfying game I have ever played to date. I highly recommend it to people who like games that will immerse you in the games world 100% and make you feel like your characters success is your success. When anything and everything can turn out to be an enemy or trap you will be kept on the edge of your seat for your entire play through. Throughout the course of that play through you will encounter next to imposable boss battles and relentless environments that will test your wits and sanity. However every time you conquer one of those ‘impossible’ boss battles the sensation is next to imposable to describe but the sound you’ll make may be something like this “gaaAAAFFFF-aahhhh-YES!!” as you either jump out of your chair throwing your hands and flailing your feet or slump back in your seat and let out a sigh of relief. Either way you will have felt like you’ve leaped over Mount Everest 300 thousand times over and high-fived the heavens. The environments in this game may seem like an impossible feat at times, and maybe a little unfair if you don’t watch what you’re doing or where you step, because that thought will always be in the back of your mind like it was mine when you only have 25% health and but a single estus flask left. “I have to fight a boss after this!?” But worry not future warrior for once you embark on this journey the one thing that will raise your spirits possibly more than conquering the bosses, avoiding booby-traps, exploring enormous landscapes and finding rare loot. “What could be better than all those things?” you may ask. I have but two words for you. The Bonfire. The bonfire is the light at the end of your monster filled tunnel, it is what keeps you going and what keeps you sane, it is your savior and your home, it brings relief and peace of mind in a chaotic world. This is a journey that in my book ranks above all others because it is a real ‘do it yourself’ kind of game that does not walk you through the game like a diaper baby, oh no. In this world you may enter as a naïve wanderer but you will leave a seasoned veteran who feels like they have the world in the palm of their well armored hands, that “this game wasn’t so hard, I bet I can do it again no problem” as you chuckle to yourself. Well Dark Souls will take you up on that, several times over in fact. Conquering this adventure once was by no means and easy feat but should you have the resolve and will for it, have another go at it, only this time lets amp it up and make every single thing two times stronger and seemingly a thousand times more deadly. Every time it gets harder but simultaneously more and more satisfying. Dark Souls will take you to the brink of death and then shotgun you to success if you have what it takes. If you think you do, than dive into the madness and delight. Just, press, start.			"

Oh, Dark Souls...This is one of those games that I have trouble expressing my opinion on it.I've played Demon's Souls previous to playing Dark Souls, so when I got this one I kind of knew what to expect from it... How wrong was I!I expected a great game, not an excellent one! This game is by far one of the best games I've ever played, hands down.Right, the review.Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition is a masterpiece.Everything about this game is beautiful, the levels, the enemies, the weapons, the combat, the magnificent multiplayer, the lore (if you care about it), and much more!So many secrets lie within the huge world of Dark Souls, you'll spend dozens of hours just to complete your first playthrough, not to mention that there is a new difficulty level each time you complete the game, to a cap of 7!You'll also, uhm... DIE A LOT! But that's only if you deserved it - if you're not good enough or are not approaching your enemies carefully, you will get punished for sure!You can create your own character, name it and change the looks of it. Then you get to choose a class and some starting gear.In this game you'll also meet NPC's, some of which have their own paths and objectives, and you can deal with those how you see fit. Did you just meet with some guy and he seemed friendly? Why not joining forces? Or maybe you met with the son of the devil, you'll probably want to keep your distance. Or, just kill them all. No boundaries, right?I won't go into much more of a detail, because the very first time I played this game I walked in completely blind and climbed my way up through some difficult situations, had to explore and learn how things worked by myself, and I loved every bit of it! So I won't spoil you the surprises.Basically, if you're into RPG's with real time combat, where the story revolves around you (not some character made up by the developers), then this game is a must! It's a very unique game (not counting the other Souls games) within its genre. But it has a VERY BIG PROBLEM called Games For Windows Live*. But if you have no issue with that, go ahead!*The game isn't supported by GFWL anymore, and it is working decently so far (23/12/2014), so I'd still recommend you to buy this game.Also, this game was meant to be played with a controller (since it's a PC port from consoles), so if you're having trouble using a PS3 controller, check out my tutorial about it on my profile.

												The ultimate action RPG. This is for people who can enjoy trial and error and have the patience to learn from their mistakes. The game isn't ""hard"" like the hype says, but rather gives the player a fair challenge and punishes them for making mistakes. There is also an exploration element since the world is semi open world, by which I mean the map is a cobweb of pathways. The plot is very vague as well which adds to the mystery of the world. The gameplay is heavily based on learning attack animations of enemies and the weapons you use. There's also thematic online multiplayer. This is where you can have jolly co-operation or invasion where either you or someone else are going to be killed.Also here are my tips to newbies:* Use DSfix* Use a PS3 or Xbox360 controller to play* Only look up a guide if you get stuck, because looking at a guide from the start hinders your ability to learn the game* If you're going the melee route, keep in mind that the stat Endurance is very helpful* With armor, mobility is important but Poise is helpful as well* Go human once and awhile, you're missing out on the unique multiplayer experience if you don't!And for when you inevitably get stuck, remember this: Explore everything; if something doesn't work try something new! Experiment!			"

												Dark Souls. The name alone sent shivers up my spine when a friend recommended it a month ago, notorious for it's sheer brutatlity and such little attempts to hold your hand or guide you along the way,I went in expecting to get my ♥♥♥ handed to me...i was correct xD Luckily i emerged victourious and haven't felt so majestic about a game in my life BAHAHA! I don't know what kept me going, but just that feeling of evolving from a scrawny, half naked, low level wanderer, desperately attempting to defend off simple hollows while wielding a striaght sword hilt...to an almighty force to be reckoned with wielding a Black Knight Greatsword battling Taurus Demons in the lava plauged wastes of Lost Izalith...was immense! This game also brings along a sense of strong entitlement upon completion, having beaten one of the most difficult games out in todays world, you can deffinitely call yourself a true gamer <3Please have a go at this game and don't give up, The start is a challenge then the rest of the journey is amazing fun and rewarding, with a few major highlights that left me sitting in pool of tears and banging my head agains the wall! E.g Blight Town those pesky little s**ts with the toxic darts! at first i was like wtf hit me and how did i get toxic...OMG IM LOSING SO MUCH HEALTH SO FAST!!!!!....then i saw the tiny specks they call ""toxic darts""...Anor Londo, Silver Knight Archers and those f**king walk ways..haha, ORNSTEIN AND SMOUGH! oh my god never have i enjoyed such a hardship of a fight the best (and most straining) boss battle in the game in my opinion! (Basically just anor londo in general LOL!) Dukes archives sucked a bit with those damn channelers and archers :P Crystal Cave with those invisble walk ways and damn clams!!! Still think they are the hardest regular enemies xD Then the final fight of Gwyn Lord of Cinder! I went in not knowing wtf parrying even was LOL once i trained for hours how to parry and could make my way all the way to his fog door past 5 Black Knights without taking any damage and parrying the whole way, i could finnaly stand a chance!This game is like the Mona Lisa of art, everyone should play it. Bring on NG+- 10/10 GG Praise the Sun!			"

												It's pretty much the greatest game in existence, top to bottom.  I've spent 200+ hours on this game on both PC and PS3 and I still never get tired of making new characters and trying out different builds.  The difficulty is tough but fair, and once you get used to the controls (and learn to roll dodge instead of use a shield), it becomes much more manageable.  And you WANT the challenge.  You want the bosses to be able to kick your ♥♥♥ fairly if you make mistakes.  You want to learn new tactics to defeat new enemies.  You want to dress your character up in the most badass Fashion Souls armor you can get. That's the entire point of the game.Do you even praise the sun, bro?			"

Really confusing and annoying.Edit:I have added a short gameplay video...P.S. The mouse arrow is visible in the game...

This ember burns down low... you hear the song ringing in your head. You grip your broken sword as you plunge it into the head of the Asylum Demon barring your way to the Firelink Shrine, the tutorial of this game a vicious boss fight.I would give it all... you realize you aresinging to yourself to maintain yoursanity.DARK SOULS PREPARE TO DIE EDITIONThe giant raven airdrops you into theruins of the game's first area, and thesense of senselessness, dread and pureatmosphere of the game beckons youwith the sight of the Bonfire, the way inwhich you respawn after death andenemies reset, your currency of soulsredrawing to zero.It was not always like this. And a game,a world the likes of DARK SOULS is notone for the faint of heart, the man withsomething to live for, the casul. Onceyou had a promising future, bright andlit after Ms. Novocaine left you and theGoddess of the Sun, Summer-Rain cameinto your life. But it has been six months since that May,since she was gone. The sickness hadravaged her, and videogames were heronly refuge from the pain eating away ather body. She sought refuge in the loveof the controller, the keyboard and mouse,and in you.You were in denial at her loss for six months,and at long last, in November, the month offate, is when you were shaken out of yourstupor and idleness. You having withdrawnfrom the world and your friends moved onor given up, graduated. In the end, it wasnot your friends who saved you then, butyour enemies.""Coldheart."" The terse voice states, like acommand from the Keepers, serpents ofDARK SOULS who have guided and chidedmankind.Killer's Conscience, leader of the Trinity ofHollywood, your enemies, leans against thedoor, looking at you while you explore thegame's worst and infamous area, the talland poisonous ramshackle swamp ofBlighttown. ""Starboy. It has been months.""""Yeah."" You manage, entering a mountainmade of pure cobwebs, which itself morphsinto a church bordering on magma. Thedesign of DARK SOULS is varied, entwinedto a meticulous degree and populated bycreatures sparsely, giving you a viciouschallenge with their relentless A.I.""I'm sorry."" Killer's Conscience manages,as you fight the strangely attractivehalf-spider witch Queelag. You ring thesecond bell to gain access to the game'sprimary draw, the area of Anor Londo,a beautiful gothic expanse which is emptysave for the enemies which bay for yourblood.Killer's Conscience is livid, but impressedat your progress, marvelling at how farand how efficient you have become atkilling, at blazing through the horde ofmonstrosities keeping you from yourobjective, reigniting the heart of anepoch, the First Flame, to prevent theage of Darkness from consuming all.""You're pretty good."" Killer's Consciencesays after awhile, seemingly meditatingon your progress as a silent, almostnonexistent observer. ""Thanks."" yourreply comes without thought, as younow enter the antechamber with thetwo posterboys of pain, DragonslayerOrnstein and Executioner Smough!You grunt a response, as you finish offOrnstein. Smough absorbs his power,but then Killer's Conscience steps nextto you as you finish off Smough, andyou collect his loot and souls. You lookat him expectant, guessing he will tryto fight you as some next boss fromDARK SOULS itself like you both usedto, when Summer-Rain was alive.""You haven't touched the DLC? Theone with the lost land of Oolacile andKnight Artorias?"" You shake your headwithout a word, walking towards thedouble doors of Queen Gwynevere,whose chest is the stuff of legend.""Haven't even fought Black DragonKalameet...

Youblink in disbelief at what one ofyour enemies has presented you.""The Lordvessel."" You gasp.""Yes."" Killer's Conscience replies.You look back at him, your owncharacter static in DARK SOULSitself. Your eyes flash, and Killer'sConscience knows the look youhave... after all, he had it once as well.""Is it true? Can it..."" You begin, your voice cracking, images ofSummer-Rain inexplicably glazeover you and overlay with yourvision of Killer's Conscience andthe present. ""Yes."" He begins inresponse to you, gesturing as theempty Lordvessel, a teleportingartifact of power beckons beforeyour eyes. ""It cannot bring ourSummer-Rain back... but not yet.""You blink once more in utter disbelief.""What...?!""

												F#cking Dark Souls, God damn it. When the game came out years ago, I was tasked to make a review of it, and I bashed the game so God damn hard. However, over the time, some of it's issues got fixed, while others seem more or less forgetable. Is the game good? Well... It's more or less a ""flawed master-piece"". As usual though, I'll start with the bad stuff of the game.The biggest issue on the game, something that has stayed over the years, is the fact that the PC port is a piece of crap. Now follow me on this, it wasn't a piece of crap before, but rather an ENTIRE crap. After a few years of the Games  For Windows Live release, the devs FINALLY NOTICED how bad it was, and since GFWL sort of died, they ported it fully into Steam, and fixed SOME of it's issues. However, the game still performs badly in some PC's, while playing with a keyboard is a sadistic experience. You NEED a controller. And it also doesn't help that all text and tips ingame show Xbox360 controller buttons. EDIT: I also forgot to mention Blight-Town, an area of the game. F#ck my #sshole sideways, that place still has insane frame-rate drops and plays like crap today. Avoid it at all costs. You can infact avoid most of it by getting the Master Key at the start AND I SERIOUSLY SUGGEST YOU DO THE SAME. IT EVEN HAS SOME FPS DROPS ON CONSOLE FOR F#CK SAKE!The second issue on it, is the multiplayer. Now, if you have played this game, I will ask you to read this to the end before bashing this review. It's fun and inmersive, but it's also broken as hell. To begin with, there's quite the amount of hackers roaming arround the game, some of them are nice and only modified their character in a cosmetic point. Others though, have unlimited HP, unlimited stamina, and even broken items that are not supposed to be used, like the infamous Instant-Curse sword. Of course it's fun when you manage to kill them, like I did already a ton of times (will put one of my videos about it under this text), but most of the time you'll die because of the hacks.

The other part of the broken multiplayer is something that I've also decided to exploit, and study how broken it was. There is some sort of level system when you invade, meaning that if you're level 100 it's not possible to invade someone of level 10 in normal ways. However, you can play the entire game at low levels, get insane gear and then come back to low level areas to EXTERMINATE other players in literally one hit, even through their shields because of their low stats. I literally started as Pyromancer, leveled up to lvl13, went through the game like that, farmed Giantdad set (except double Black-Flame, haven't yet gone NG+), and went through the Undead Parish killing people (and a ton of hackers) for days. And I was not the only guy doing it. For what I know, it's sort of fixed in Dark Souls 2, but the devs did nothing to avoid that in DK1, so you should AVOID multiplayer at low levels, or get ready to get completely annihilated. EDIT: I also did a video on that as well, forgot to put it here:

Another issue I have is more or less with the community. Guys, let's sit down for a minute here and talk about this: Dark Souls IS NOT DIFFICULT. It's not. It's a fair game with fair difficulty. The issue is that most OTHER GAMES are TOO EASY, hold your hand too much. If you trully want difficult games, there's way better ones than this one. Dark Souls is a game where you are supposed to think before you act, not another of those casul games where you just run straight ahead, eat lead and then hide for 8 seconds until the blood of your screen cleans up. If you die, it's 90% of the times YOUR fault, the other 10% being unpatched bugs, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC controls, broken multiplayer or bad network.The last issue is something that a lot of people will sadly experience, and it's the fact that while it's cool that the game does not hold your hand at all, once outside the tutorial area you will NOT know where the f#ck you're supposed to go. The game doesn't trully give you any direction (except for the Firelink crestfallen NPC, but his hints ain't really that helpful and he will move from there midway the game anyway). That means you'll have to explore, and most likely you will go the wrong way, and face enemies WAY tougher than the enemies you're supposed to be facing at the moment, which will utterly f#ck the living sh#t out of you. A map could've been cool, and it wouldn't kill the inmersion of the PLAYER ITSELF (or the character) was the one drawing it.That being said, the game is quite fun, once you go over those problems. It's really inmersive, and it's one of those kind of games were you can find a ton of different ways to get over a problem. The amount of variety in weapons, armor, spells and items is quite great, and seriously beats other games such as Skyrim, where most items are the same  but with slightly higher stats and different graphics. Here, most weapons feel unique, although some of them like the Pickaxe really suck in all kinds of ways. You can also upgrade weapons into different kinds of stats and even upgrade them into new, special weapons, most of them from fallen bosses.The gameplay, ignoring bugs and such is solid. You trully feel like it's a dangerous place, and trully feel in control. You can build your own character, your own playstyle, and even go through the bosses in whatever dumb order you feel like.The lore is there. It's explained through item descriptions (something I find dumb, but it kind of works out) and NPC's, which are GREAT.The multiplayer, ignoring the fact that it was some huge flaws, is also quite fun. Is the game being too difficult on your casul butt? You can summon random players from other parts of the world into your game, to aid you through the area and beat the boss. However to do so, you need to be human, and being human also allows other random players to INVADE your game, and hunt you down. There are different covenants based upon the multiplayer aspect, although if you're playing alone and leaving the multiplayer aside, you won't give a crap about them.The character creation system is also hilariously broken, allowing the player to, if you so desire, create some seriously disgusting abominations as your character.In the end, it's a good game, and I do recommend it. However, you should only play it if you enjoy a fair challenge, like RPG-Action games, AND HAVE A WORKING CONTROLLER. Without a controller, the game is literally unplayable. I ended up picking it up for 5€ on a sale, and for that price it's a solid purchase.Just remember though, THE LEGEND WILL NEVER DIE.I also made a video time ago about my first serious playthrough (the first one was in PC at release and I couldn't even bring myself to finish it, a year later I played it on Xbox360, where I had fun), showing that the game ain't really that difficult and it's actually a ton of fun, highlighting the best moments. It's filled with spoilers though, be aware of that.

												Originally, many years ago in a distant land. I had purchased this game for PS3, as its cover (and back of it) had reminded me of 'Monster Hunter FU' for a whopping 70 AUD. Turns out it barely resembled 'Monster Hunter', unless you can call it a dark and medieval variant of it. Aaaanyway, I got the game and got p*ssed off by the first boss (patience wasn't my strong point) and didn't play it for months. Then I came back to it after awhile and passed the first boss quite easily as I had decided to roll between its feet instead of in its attacking range. From then on I was hooked by it. Did a couple play throughs and cursed my way happily through the game.Then one day I decided I'd buy it for my computer too, I couldn't be bothered loading up the PS3 anymore, so here we are. Since DS1: Prepare To Die Edition on the PS3 I moved onto Dark Souls 2 which was fun, but it was great to play the this one again after a fair while.This game is fun and addictive, however you can get easily frustrated and p*ssed off by it too. Dark Souls can be a bit vague at times and you'll feel like you have done the same thing for the past eternity if you get stuck...but this game is very much worth buying and playing!			"

												One of the best games of all time, hands down. Like a mature Legend of Zelda/Castlevania mashup. One of the most immersive games in existence, and one of the most straightforward, fair yet challenging ones too. The areas don't feel like levels in the second and third games, either, which is nice. ♥♥♥♥ it if it's a ♥♥♥♥ port with ♥♥♥♥ KB/M controls- get a controller and plug that ♥♥♥♥ in! And a little extra side note: Demon's Souls and Bloodborne are also excellent, arguably just as good/arguably better than Dark Souls, give them a try! Demon's Souls is a much different flavor, weak at some points and stronger in others; a prototype. Bloodborne is a fast-paced Lovecraftian that is more immersive than Dark Souls, and looks nicer, too... if only it were longer!			"

												ORIGINAL REVIEW: Well, this game might be god. It could be the greatest game of all time. But you see that ""Strongly recommended to have a gamepad"" message? Yeah, I bought a controller specifically for this game, and it doesn't work. The controller works with every single other game, but this POS PC port is god awful. I've tried every bug fix, re-installed, and contacted support. Still doesn't work. I'm not going to play it without a controller, and the game's unplayable without it. Yeah, I could mod it to make it more bearable, but if you port a game to PC without making the game at least half decent, you don't deserve the money. If I could refund the game, I would.CURRENT REVIEW: The games alright, finally found a mod to make the game think that my XBOX 360 CONTROLLER is an XBOX 360 CONTROLLER. Called x360ce, works well.

												THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE is the funniest movie that I have seen in years. I initially had passed on watching it in the theater because I thought it looked childish, but was convinced to give it a try now that it was out on video. Boy, was my initial impression wrong.The story revolves around a selfish prince who is turned into a llama by one of his subjects. With the help of a kindly peasant he attempts to regain his throne, and in the process finds there's more to him than he previously thought or wanted there to be. While the moral is a good one, it really plays a secondary role to the comedy, which is literally non-stop. GROOVE takes the rapid-fire humor that Disney perfected in Aladdin and combines it with cartoon-style hijinx, the wit of David Spade, and a hilarious lack of reverence for the traditional Disney animated genre. Spade plays his role to perfection, and luckily never crosses the line into being obnoxious. Seinfeld fans are in for a treat, as Puddy plays a very special side-kick role. You really can't take your eyes off the screen for a minute, because you're guaranteed to miss a gag of some sort. The humor works mainly on an adult level, even though kids will be rolling from the funny visuals and some of the more obvious jokes.The DVD itself is a good one. The digital transfer was excellent and the sound quality is top notch. The commentary track is one of the better that I've heard, with interesting and funny insight from all contributors. Animated menus. There's a deleted scene that was probably best left out, but is interesting to watch anyway, plus a few other fun features.In the end, this is one of the best Disney flicks to come along in years. Hardcore Disney fans will eat it up. But even if you're not a fan of Disney's usual animated features you should give GROOVE a shot. Cast aside your pre-concieved notions and you just might be in for a very pleasant surprise. I was. FIVE STARS.			"

												If you are prepare to die this game is for you. You will die alot but each death will teach you something, If you like the challanging gameplay this game is one of the best. This game is hard when you first play it because lack of instructions for beginers but as you go on game will become easy.Pros:- Lots of unique enemies. Each area has its own type of enemies. I should say these normal enemies will kill you more than area boss. Great Level Design. All the areas in the game are interconnected.  Some of the best boss fights I ever seen. It feels very satifying to kill some bosses.  Great sound design. Ambient music when you fight with boss feels great. Sound when boss hit their weapon and you block it with your shield feels real. Lots of weapons to choose from. Every weapon has its own unique move set. You can build your character anyway you like. Great DLC content. Coop and PVP battles.Cons:- Pyromancy feels over powered. Most of the bosses in dark souls are weak to fire, Even some of them are good against fire they still die easily with fully upgraded pyromancies. Very bad PC port. One of the worst port I ever seen. Frame rate some times drops at certain areas not much but you can feel it. Although game's art style is great graphics doesn't feel that great.This game is not perfect. It has its flows. I give this game 8/10.			"

												Seriously, this is one of the best games I ever played. Maybe /the/ best, so far. Why? I have no idea, I started playing, but I gave up, rather quickly, it was just too damn hard.  But then, I tried again and I made progress, where I failed the last time. What a satisfying feeling. And there the fever got me, I wanted to keep playing, to level up, to get the best equipment, or to just see how the next level looks like.But on my way to the End, I cried, I danced in joy, or I was just happy I survive, with my heart racing like I've been running for miles. No game, I ever played, got me so tied up and made me want to play again, no matter how often I died.Some people say, this game has no story, well. On the first glance, there is none. But one of the strengths of Dark Souls, is also it's Story Line, it's hidden. You need to find piece of a puzzle, that you never will truly complete, it gives you hints and you have to make your own story from it. You are in a hostile world, you against everybody else, this just get's underlined by it. Seriously, who can take to die some times and is willing to play a game, where you aren't the Literal God of War, slaying everybody after a while without any problems. You should give Dark Souls a try. This game is really a jewel in the RPG scene and a title, you shouldn't miss.			"

												This is obviously a very late review of Dark Souls so why review it now? Well to start things off simple, the big sales are coming around so if you feel the urge to buy it from Steam but not sure about it? Well here's a review you may or may not find helpful. The other reason is...Dark Souls II is just less than four months away and what better way to prepare than to review its predecessor for newcommers! Combat:The combat in Dark Souls is very basic, you have your left hand equipment for blocking and right hand equipment for attacking of two types, standard and strong attacks. Keeping this in mind that it can and might apply to all classes you may use, there are different classes you can make so you might be a sorcerer, cleric, strenght, dexterity, or mix. Also keeping this in mind, each weapon has a certain stat that scales and is required to use. This adds to the combat of what you can and can't use. Now onto the actual combat sequences: the actual combat is well designed and very fluid. Any time you die it is always your mistake of how you approached an enemy. It's no hack and slash game that's for sure, that is how you get yourself killed. Combat in this game is all about timing and approachment and it's glorious.Story:Now I will not get much into this, not that there is much surface story for you to absorb from just plowing through but, the story starts you off in a place called the Undead Asylum. After you escape you learn of these two bells and from there on out your journy continues There is a bit more of the surface story that can be hand fed to you but like I said, not going to spoil much. The lore or backstory of this is what links everything that may seem confusing together. Through From Software's brilliant design they have made it like a broken puzzle to find it all out. You learn everything through item descriptions, dialgogue, and even some times just by the looks of the area if your observant enough. It's hard work but the results will not dissapoint. Bosses & Common Enemies: To start this seciton off, we're going to start with common enemies, yeah those guys. The enemies in Dark Souls are of interesting nature, unlike in games like the First Person Shooters where they stand around like lost children, these enemies are aggressive and persistent. They are stupid enough to beat but smart enough to punish. Now when I say stupid I do not mean fit the shapes stupid, I mean they are trimmed down just enough to where they are not some diety sent form the gods to punish you, they are very much beatable. Some enemies may be smarter or tougher than others but all are beatable. The trick is they all know how to punish you for screwing up. Mistakes in Dark Souls are not forgiven. This paragraph will all be for the details of the most epic fights you will face, even if the boss seems...eh. Okay, skipping the obvious known fact of Dark Souls being known for its intense boss fights, lets discuss WHY they're intense.  Music only plays on very few occasions outside of boss fights but when these boss fights do ensue, music starts that captivates the feel of your character's challange ahead of them, the terror that they are fighting. With that included you can even tell by the way the boss fights. If it's sad or depressing music, it is a story of tragedy or sorrow. Vice versa if it's loud and fast, you get the feeling the boss is  full of rage or beast-like properties that knows no mercy. These boss fights are something that are more than just a challange, they have a story behind them and are masterpieces, each and every one of them...except Bed of Chaos.Graphics & performance:Now this is a subject I usually leave alone but in Dark Souls's case, it must be adressed. Not because it truely matters if you played it on PS3 or Xbox 360 but because of how atrocious of a port this game was. Locked in at 30 frames per second with a very poor graphic quality locked in that wasn't even 720p made it look terrible on the stretched screen of the PC. It was an exact copy paste of the Xbox 360 version, no modifications to optimize this baby. Now before you start getting freaked out and shy away, there is a mod to fix this. It is called the DSFix mod and it unlocks the frame rate and graphics settings. If you don't got the mod the game will look muddy and not play smooth, with it installed you got a pretty, dark atmospheric game and have a smooth frame rate that doesn't murder your frames in the cruel area of Blighttown.Final Verdict: I know this review seems a bit short and very rushed and it is, 2:36 in the morning is not the ideal time to do these things. I am going to give it 2 scores, one w/o the mod and one with it. This is being done so you can get an idea of what  experience you will get. WIthout the mod:  6/10. This game is nearly unplayable without the mod. The keyboard bindings are not so hot, the frame rate is locked in at 30 which for a PC game is not the ideal setting to be playing at, and very muddy, stretched graphics from the locked in graphics setting of something less than 720p stretched out onto a monitor. With the mod: 9/10If you got the mod installed you will not regret it at all and you are in for a masterpiece only obtainable by the skills of From Software and the publishing efforts of Namco Bandai. After notes:-It is highly recommended to use a gamepad for this game. Keyboard bindings like I said are not that good and this is a straight up console port. -Installation of the mod is easy, follow the files in the order below in whichever program x you haveSteamSteamAppsCommonDark Souls Prepare to Die EditionDATANow drop the files you have extracted from the DSFix compressed into here and follow any remaining instructions.Find DSFix and edit the game settings there.

												We had pizza for dinner tonight. I tried to eat it straight out of the oven and I burned the ♥♥♥♥ out of the roof of my mouth and now I can't stop using my tongue to rub at the raw spot where I used to have skin. Dark Souls is sort of like that—it hurts, but it's a good kind of hurt that makes you wonder if maybe you aren't a little bit of a masochist after all.The story of Dark Souls centers around a customizable player character, know as the Chosen Undead. In a world where the undead are cursed to become vicious ""hollow"" beings, the Chosen Undead embarks on a quest to gather the four Lord Souls of the realm and defeat Lord Gwyn so that he can rekindle the First Flame to put an end to the curse of the undead. The plot of Dark Souls is vague and unguided, with players receiving very little direction on which task they should be pursuing next or which area they should approach. The attractively lacking narration leaves much open to interpretation and requires players to explore Dark Soul's open world in depth—a perilous task in a world inhabited by enemies that are often much stronger than the player's initially weak character.But it doesn't matter what Dark Souls is about. Dark Souls's unemphasized storyline allows for the main focus of the game to be given the limelight because, without a doubt, Dark Souls is a game whose shining element is its gameplay. Players are given a wide array of equipment options, allowing for an unending variation in playstyles. Where I played as a heavily armored knight with a spear and a greatshield that remained constantly on guard while poking out from behind my shield and slowly whittling my opponents down, others prefer the lighter, more perilous style of a dual-handed dodger armed with daggers and wearing nothing but rags. All styles of play are valid in Dark Souls, with the well-balanced gameplay and stats providing each one with its own strengths and weaknesses.The enemies of Dark Souls are often aggressive and powerful, with many of them being able to destroy the player in only a couple of hits. Players earn souls for defeating enemies, which are used both as a currency and as an experience system in Dark Souls. When a player is defeated, their souls are dropped down onto the ground—often several levels worth of experience, all waiting for you to come back and claim it. Should you die before reaching those souls, they're lost and you must start over again in order to build those levels back up. Hours upon hours of gameplay, lost.However, Dark Souls balances its risk and reward experience mechanism just as well as it balances its combat. Dark Souls is challenging, but it never approaches unfair. Each death is well earned: maybe you didn't roll quite quick enough, or maybe you tried to heal even though you knew you should have blocked. Every mistake is your mistake. Every death is your death. There are never moments where you believe the enemies, despite their massive strength and formidable countenances, are overpowered or undefeatable. It's not a question of whether or not the bosses can be killed; it's a question of whether or not you have the skills and the knowledge to make the final blow. And when you die (and you will die, many, many times), you learn and you progress. And next time maybe you won't be quite so slow or so careless.For years my best friend and I would check the used games shelf at GameStop (back when we were both console peasants, before the GTX series graced our lives) and we would see it: Dark Souls, the game that we always wanted but never picked up because everyone lauded it as ""too hard to play—like really hard, man"". And don't get me wrong, Dark Souls is hard. It is crushingly unforgiving, with a combat system that rewards cunning and tactics while testing both your physical and mental reflexes. The price for failure is high, but the satisfaction of victory? Well, that's the ultimate reward.As a friendly heads up, many people say that the PC port of Dark Souls is particularly low quality (and it is). Nonetheless, the console version of this game runs at an abysmally low framerate, making a bad port better than no port. Be sure to slap a little bit of DSfix on it and read up on how to get the optimal performance out of the PC version of Dark Souls. Once it's set up, it blows the console version out of the water.

												Though it seems a poor framework game at the start, with a little tweaking, you are thrown into one of the most challenging and satisfying games you will ever play. Not for the faint hearted or those who give up easily, but those who like to smack giant demons around with weapons larger than your character and triumph over seemingly impossible odds. No other game cries out manmode like this one. This game cries out versatility in almost every aspect be it customizing your character, fighting style, appearance and even how you wish to play the game and progress. There are nearly no boundaries to stop you, only your skill and knowledge. Not to mention a fun pvp system that could be highly improved. 9.5/10 for offline play, a little less speculation of the story would be nice and a bit more concrete lore. 8/10 for pvp play. The online needs much more regulation to stop all the cheating. Otherwise, I would probably give it a 10. I haven't had this much fun duelling other players in a long time.			"

												Dark Souls is a dating sim where you play as pretty boy Choy Sen Unded trying to decide who to take to prom.  There are many suitors to choose from, ranging all the way from the quiet and reserved Petrus of Thorolund (who is constantly torn between you and his ex, Rhea) and the notorious playboy Solaire of Astora (who is still coming to terms with his sexuality).  Many of the players I talked with chose to date Kingseeker Frampt, and I can understand why.  There's a certain bit of old world charm to him and he acts like a proper gentleman (not to mention I hear he's marvelously well endowed), however, he simply wasn't for me.  His brother Kaathe is another popular choice as they share the same good looks but with Kaathe having more of a ""badboy"" appeal to him.  Before I met either of them though I had already fallen in love with the well-intentioned but down-on-his-luck Siegmeyer of Catarina.  Siegmeyer is your quintessential nice guy, who has hit a bit of a slump after his wife left him.  Left alone with the pressure of taking care of his daughter, Sieglinde, he develops a bit of an eating problem, but don't worry he's still quite a looker! ;)  In his storyline, you help him regain his confidence and open his heart back up so he can learn to love again.  Just don't help him out too much, he's very proud and will get upset if you do everything for him.  You also get to know his daughter very well and she is simply an adorable and precocious little scamp!  My biggest complaint is that some of the biggest hunks are already taken at the start of the game.  For example, Ornstein and Smough stay in a commited relationship for the entire game and while they DO make a really cute couple I feel like the game is just tempting me into something I can't have.  I won't reveal too much, but there is an obscure sidequest in which you can get either Ornstein or Smough ""out of the picture"", freeing the other one up to date (or so I thought), but the other one will always find out and just be angry at you until you leave and then when you come back they're together again! Ugh!  Another great feature is that you get to dress up your character however you want.  Getting different outfits can be a real pain though as you have to got out and find them yourself and many times they're hidden away in tough spots.  Most of the time you're gonna be spending searching for a new dress or a nice hat that goes with your top, and I would rather just be hanging out and talking with the guys!  However, despite all the work you have to go through to get the damn clothes, they really are worth the effort as many of them are simply gorgeous and you can mix and match to your heart's content!  There are classic formal dresses (the antiquated dress, Crimson set); some nice and simple pieces (the dingy or maiden set); a couple goth outfits (the gold-hemmed black set); and some more unusual fashions (the Xanthous set).  Much to my surprise you can even dress up as a knight in shining armor, although I found it to be rather tacky.As with many dating sims there is some ""mature content"", although I thought it was all fairly tasteful.  The bed of chaos and the gaping dragon scenes were a bit gratuitous but didn't go too far.  Ceaseless Discharge was pretty gross, but some people are into that sort of thing and you can basically just skip it if it really bothers you.  I do wish there was an option for turning off all mature content, but hopefully that'll be in the sequel.  Speaking of the sequel, I really think they should streamline getting outfits to make it a lot easier.  I don't think anyone actually enjoyed the difficulty and the game would really benefit from being more casual.All-in-all a fun game!  It can really pull at you emotionally and even make you really angry sometimes but just stick with it and it'll pay off in the end.			"

												Totalling more than 1200 coupled hours between PC and PS3, this definitely is my favourite game.While, in my opinion, the settings and the athmosphere are slightly inferior to its predecessor Demon's Souls, Dark Souls fills the gap with efficient mechanics, deep lore and a feeling of loneliness and despair that accompanies you throughout the entire story. As for the PVP aspect of the game, the community is still very alive and populated by skilled players roaming Oolacile Township. GFWL is a big detriment, but with the Steam patch coming soon all will be forgotten.Remember kids: if you're getting front-stabbed it's only your fault for not anticipating your opponent's network latency.

В кои то веки сюжет не разжевывается и засовывается игроку в рот. Сюжет рассказывают сами локации, боссы и вещи.Мультиплеер так же уникален и что саме главное - тонко вплетен в сюжет. Пока второсортные разработчики просто пихают несколько сетевых режимов, оторванных от одиночной кампании from software разработали систему где кооперативный и соревновательный мультиплеер органично вливаются друг в друга и создают ощущение монолитного и продуманного геймплея.Конечно игра немного потеряла актуальность на фоне выхода второй части, но все равно обязательна для прохождения, ведь сиквелам никогда не удается затмить оригинал.

 DARK SOULS: Prepare To Die Edition  More like ""Prepare to Cry"". But Seriously this is a great production with an amazing atmosphere and history. The game is set in different locations after which you can move around freely, because the game does not hold us by the hand. Locations that we will explore is large and visit such places as the catacombs, dungeons, castles, dark forests without any loading but also painted world or sent back to a past of world of Lordran. The currency is the souls of fallen enemies. Thanks to them, we can improve our character and weapons and buy armor from merchants, however, with every death we lose souls but still you can retrieve it if you get back there and notif you won't die a second time. The game also has a great sound design. Optimization instead is broken so much that in some locations the game is just not playable and the finish it was torture for me. This game has a great climate but it also offer a very high level of difficulty. The fight is an arcade, we have light and strong attacks, blocks and dodges and magic items. Each location has a boss that you will be forced to continuous attempts to change tactics. With this production I had a lot of fun, the game has its flaws but it have something in itself that attracts us. "

												Качественный и интересный проект, который не боится идти в разрез с трендами.Враги бескомпромиссны, дизайн локаций великолепен и даже затмевает средненькую по современным меркам графику. В кои то веки сюжет не разжевывается и засовывается игроку в рот. Сюжет рассказывают сами локации, боссы и вещи.Мультиплеер так же уникален и что саме главное - тонко вплетен в сюжет. Пока второсортные разработчики просто пихают несколько сетевых режимов, оторванных от одиночной кампании from software разработали систему где кооперативный и соревновательный мультиплеер органично вливаются друг в друга и создают ощущение монолитного и продуманного геймплея.Конечно игра немного потеряла актуальность на фоне выхода второй части, но все равно обязательна для прохождения, ведь сиквелам никогда не удается затмить оригинал.

												Worst console port in a while, unplayable on PC without an XBOX controller.One of the laziest ports in a long time with no effort of even trying to be a PC game. There are some USER CREATED mods that fix some graphical and mouse issues, but still the developers deserve not a single cent for this.Even though the game has been hyped from the very beginning to the point of pitfullness, it still has some great gameplay and a unique feeling to it. Just sad the PC version will never fully deliver this feeling and fun.Please do NOT SUPPORT a company for something like this. If you keep on supporting such lazy ""work"" with no effort put into we will only receive more broken stuff.			"

												As a fan of Demons's Souls on the PS3 and as someone who enjoyed its difficulty and setting, Dark Souls doesn't disappoint.

												This if one of my favorite games of all time with Demon's Souls as a close second and one of the best RPG games out there it can be difficult but rewarding, i especially love the freedom in character progression, how they did the lore, and the art, graphics, and character design behind the game, If you haven't beaten this game or given it at least a try your missing out on a lot. I also love the fact that when i try a new character class/build it feels like an entirely new game (there are areas i still haven't explored and classes i haven't tried) I give it a 9.5/10			"

												This is definitely one of the best games I've ever played.Combat system works well and there are plenty of options.Well, do not expect any fancy story, but just something in the style hack and slash.For me, definitely I can say that I recommend. If you do not mind learning style as a step to death then take the game. Is definitely worth every penny.Cons?  - Missing chat  - It's hard to summon a specific player to cooperation  - Weaker graphics  - Control of the mouse and keyboard sucks  - You need gaming controller (xbox360 is best)Praise the Sun!

												It baffles me that people find this game difficult.Anyways, as someone who's neither into RPGs, the medieval setting, or even difficult games, I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing this game is. The lore based story is amazing (at least if you have the observational skills to discover it.) The combat is simple yet deep with intuitive controls, timing, and telegraphs. Additionally, this is possibly the only game I've ever played where the PvP can live up to the expectations set up by the PvE (but wow do I wish there was less lag.)There are a few common complaints I hear about this game, and here are my opinions on them.""The game is too hard."" : No, the game is not too hard, it is in fact rather easy. If you find the game difficult, then it is possible that you haven't figured out what the game expects of you yet. More likely though, you need to drop the keyboard and mouse controls and get a controller.""The game is all trial and error."" : It is entirely possible to beat this game exclusively through trial and error, but wow you'd have to be pretty dull to play through this game like that. The game gives plenty of hints to warn you about what's coming up, you just need to be observant enough to notice them.""The game is clunky."" : Well, that one's just an outright lie. Unless you don't understand the concept of management (i.e. stamina management is one of the most common things players seem to struggle with even though it's one of the most important skills for this game) or are playing with a keyboard and mouse, you'll find that this game plays beautifully.

Genre: RPG/Open World If you're the person who loves challenge, and who don't mind dying a lot and also want to try new things, then you're gonna love this game. Otherwise if you're the person who plays games at easy/normal just so you can experience the game and move on avoid this. This game takes time, and to get better you need to die a lot.Gameplay(+)Gameplay is different than in other games and it doesn't feel that smooth in the beginning. Some people find it slow at first, but that's cause Dark Souls is one of the games that tries to be more realistic as far as the gameplay is concerned. Weapons/Armors: You have two slots in each hand, for weapons or shields(you can put weapon or shield in whatever hand you want). You also have armor. You can combine parts of armor sets however you want. Game offers a big variety of weapons, armors, shields etc. There are many classes of weapons: Straight swords, Greatswords, Ultra Greatswords, Axes, Katanas, Hammers, Whips, Bows and many others. When choosing armors and weapons you need to worry about their weight and your equip load. Other than weight weapons and shields also have stats requirements. Usually you need certain amount of points invested into Strength or Dexterity, or both, and sometimes you need to invest into magic, miracles etc. Some weapons scale of strength, some of dexterity, and some of both, which means that increasing those stats increases weapons damage, and also weapons have different types of scaling. You can also upgrade weapons, shields and armors with some materials and souls(souls=Dark Souls money and exp points). Magic/Miracles: Game also offers a big variety of magic spells and miracles. They have their stats requirements too. You need to invest points into intelligence/faith to increase magic/miracles attack and defense, and to be able to use those spells/miracles. There are  additional items that improve magic or miracles attack or defense. Enemies: Enemies are very creative, there are many type of enemies and a lot of them are hard to kill at first. Boss fights are absolutely amazing, and killing a boss in Dark Souls feels like great accomplishment. Game has plenty of bosses, and many of them are optional. After killing the boss you'll get souls. Some bosses also drop boss souls which you can either eat to accuire more souls or save them for later, so you can craft boss weapons at blacksmiths. Every time you die enemies will respawn at same places, but bosses won't. Once you kill them, they're dead till the next new game + cycle.New Game +: After you finish the game, you'll automatically progress into new game +, with everything that you've collected in ng. You can play ng+ endlessly, and the game's difficulty increases every time untill you reach ng+7, where it stops increasing.Some other things about gameplay: Bonfires are checkpoints in this game. Every time you rest at bonfire, all enemies will go back to their place, and all enemies will respawn, except from killed bosses. Every time you die you lose all souls you have and you need to find that same location to pick them up before you die again, unless you want to lose them forever. After dying you'll respawn at last checkpoint you had been rested. Multiplayer(+)This is one of the things that makes Dark Souls games pretty unique. You can invade worlds of other players with special items and fight them there, or get invaded in your own world. You can also call other players from their worlds by activating signs on the floor with purpose to either fight them or play co-op with them, and you can post your own signs too. This game would be a perfect game for me(10/10) if not for instant backstab. This technique ruined pvp of this game, and it's very broken, since people are constantly fishing for backstabs. Also backstab escape bug.Atmosphere(+) One of the things that makes Dark Souls so great is dark and gloomy atmosphere, that makes you feel lonely in that cruel world. Not knowing what's behind the next corner, it forces you to have your eyes wide open all the time.Story/Lore(+) Story in Dark Souls is not told in the classical way. To find explanation of the story you must listen to what NPCs have to say, and read descriptions of items, and still after that you're not gonna be able to understand a lot of things, so you must create your own theories about what happened. There are good theories on internet from youtubers like VaatiVydia, Silver Mont, Dave Control Live, TerraMantis,etc. Bad port(+-)This is really a bad port, and it's almost unplayable without DSfix which can be found here: http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=684 .You can't get banned for using this, and almost every Dark Souls player uses this. Port by default is locked at 30 fps, but DSfix lets you unlock fps, and it also makes game pretty stable with improved graphic. Still some people complain that they have dips with unlocked fps and set on 60, but I really can't help you with that since I am playing on 30 fps since beginning without any problems.Note: Controller is not necessary, use what you want. Never used it in DkS series and I am pretty good in both pvp and pve.Verdict: This is an an amazing, very challenging game, and that combined with an amazing gameplay, atmosphere and lore makes it a masterpiece. Sadly it is an awful port, but there is a mod that fixes most of the issues.Personal rating: 9.5/10 "

												--DISCLAIMER--first of all, in my review the thumb doesn't matter. I could also pick a thumbs down rating, Only the text review represents my oppinion about this game, nothing else.The other thing is: I'm not someone who purely says that the game isn't possible. I'm just pointing out, what was enjoyable for me in an objective way. If you don't agree with my critics to this game, then it's fine by me. I'm not telling you what to enjoy and what not and if you actualy enjoy the things I don't enjoy, then have it your way. But then I ask you to respect my oppinion aswell as I respect yours.--DISCLAIMER END--Dark Souls is an interesting experience indeed. It always keeps you on your toes but it also gives you a break if needed.It is a challenging game without being unfair to the player, at least overall to a certain point. It is an action RPG game to my liking but, unfortunatly, it has also alot of downsides.First of all, and I'm sure everyone agrees with me is, that this is a very poor port of a game. It is a shame that there was no effort put into porting this game or even optimizing it in general, since a constant and high framerate in this kind of game is the most important aspect (timing in general). Now luckily, I have an Xbox controller for my PC and I highly recommend a controller in general for this game, since the controls on the keyboard are messed up. Now there are mods out there which help making this game playable, but I am talking about a product the developers delivered to us, not the fix that the community came up with without the developers giving a crap about there game and doing it themselves.Now the most thing I enjoyed in this game was the first playthrough. I created 2 characters and managed to play through the game with both of them with 2 different playstyles. The first character was a more tanky character with a greatsword. My 2nd character was a high lightweigth build for pure dodge and counter with a katana. The game provided me with a decent challange and, although the game has it's frustrating moments, it never made me quit the playthrough.NG+ (New Game +) on the otherhand is something I don't recommend to anyone searching for an enjoyable playthrough, simply because the difficulty scaling is to dull. Giving them more Healh and higher damageoutput doesn't mean difficulty, it just tests your patience with the game. I'd rather have smarter enemies with different attackpatterns instead of just heavylie based ""trial and error"" enemies. This counts especialy for dodge builds. In most cases, if you happen to stagger from an attack, you will die because you'll get stunlocked untill you die. While this alone is not a problem, some enemies will be more of an annoyence because of their high hitbox detection (4 Kings for example) where it doesn't matter if you dodge their swing or not you'll get hit anyway.Another positive thing about this game is that it doesn't hold you on your hand, like most games do nowadays. The game doesn't point out, where you should go now or what you should do. You have to figure that out yourself. Now the game does have a somewhat linear pattern you have to follow, but that's only at the beginning of the game and to a certain point. If you are 1/3 through the game, the whole game is open for you to explore. You can get the idea of what to do in order to progress by talking to certain NPCs, but you have to actually listen to what they say and you still have to think for yourself where you should go to do your task. The game my have cutscenes, but all of them are skipable and are not regular at all (mostly an introduction to a certain boss or if you did something significant for the story).The combat system is great overall. It is easy to learn, but hard to master. Dark Souls doesn't make you rely on the abilities of the characters (like certain MMO's or even RPGs where you just have to spam their individuel abilities and wait for their cooldown) all actions depend on the player himself and you'll get more then enough variety to that. You can for instance do a light attack, a heavy attack, a guard break kick, a jumping heavy attack, parry, block, backstab, dive attack. Most weapons also have their own move sets, giving you a large variety to pick from for you to use to your liking.But the obvious thing is that the combat system is almost purely made for 1v1 encounters. That means, if you have to deal with alot of enemies at once without having a weapon which can hit multiple targets, then you'll notice the downsides of the combat system or rather to certain enemy/ boss encounters (Ornstein and Smough are only considered to be one of the hardest bosses purely because, if you don't have any help, then you'll have to deal with 2 heavy hitting bosses at once. if you atleast get help from Solair, an NPC character, then the boss is manageable without big problems)The good thing is, that these kind of encounters are not that often and you are most likely able to lure them out 1 by 1.But areas like New Londo with ghosts, atleast on new game+, they will be a hard time if you are not able to 1hit them because they will swarm you and they have a decent range with their attack and the fact, that they can attack you through the wall makes it unnececary hard and you'll most likely be forced just to sprint your way through this area.The bosses are both the things you will enjoy the most but they will also be the most frustrating thing in the game. The statisfaction after killing a boss is very pleasing and you will feel rewarded for that aswell combined with the combat system. Most bosses are also unique in their own way, although that doesn't always mean that it's something positive. Some bosses are very easy and don't provide a challenge at all while other bosses have a huge difficulty spike and require certain strategies to work with. And some bosses are just downright tedious. The best example for that is Gwindolin. It may be an optional boss, but if you seek to play all of the game's content, then you'll be forced to one of the most tedious bosses of the game. I'm not saying that the boss is hard the boss is in fact one of the easiest bosses the game has to offer. This boss fight in particular just stretches in it's lenght in a very artificial way (you will always have to run up to the boss while avoiding it's projectile attacks and if you are in close range, you'll be able to land 1-3 strikes before the boss teleports away where you just repeat the process). I think the most enjoyable boss fight for me was Sif, the Wolf. It wasn't to difficult for me even on NG+ and it wasn't to hard either. Overall, I say that bosses are one of the best things the game can possibly offer. It is in fact one of the only reasons to why you should play the game, atleast when you are not into pvp, that's a different story.While I like the idea of being connected to different ""nodes"" and being able to see different phantoms of players who play the game aswell, this system stands in it's own way if you consider to play this game in coop. The problem is just that if you try to play with a friend, you have to hope for you and your friend being connected to the same node. If you are not, you cannot play together. Now for that there also exists a mod to help you out with and certain configurations but, that's not an excuse for such a design for online playing. I'd rather have a traditional, more working way to play the game online rather then what it has to offer now. For me, it's not a big downside for the game but for those considering buying this game to play coop, be prepared to either do alot of things to be able to play effectivly or be prepared to be patient.OVERALL: I recommend this game to those who want an action RPG with a decent and overall enjoyable experience and for those, who dare to play the game's NG+ mode for extra frustration.

												Praise the Sun!Fantastically hard experience that offers little to no hand-holding both in and out of game.  The PC port is full of issues resolved in round-about ways by community mods.  If you don't go mad trying to get a resolution above 1024x720 (Tip: google DSFix), you'll wish you would have just bought a console instead when you try to get your mouse and keyboard to work (Tip: google DSMFix).  After you wade through a SEA of options hidden away in .txt files, and troubleshoot a dozen additional problems you may encounter, you're finally off to the races!Of course, the races are probably going to punch you right in the mouth because this game can be so hard the metaphors don't even make sense.  The game doesn't tell you much, other players tell you even less, and you can throw yourself at an impossible cemetary of skeletons for hours without the game even suggesting there's an easier path.  You need to learn from your deaths quickly.  If you don't seem to be doing much damage, you're NOT going to survive so turn back and try another path!  Once you finally get on the slow, purposeful drudge to success, you'll meet all sorts of FANTASTICALLY designed monsters, see AMAZING set peices, and discover a deeply burried treasure-trove of lore.  Just keep in mind that if you want to experience the full effect of multiplayer, you have to stay human.  You can always see the fleeting ghosts of other players, and you'll find their cryptic orange messages scrawled all over the world, but if you want to meet them in the flesh you have to be living yourself.  Summon your white and golden allies whenever they offer to help.  Be wary though, others may come as an agent of chaos, as your righteous executioner, a collector of souls, or even as a guardian of nature.At least it's not using Games for Windows Live anymore!Above all, PRAISE THE SUN.

												I originally played Dark Souls on the PS3 back in 2011 at launch, coming from Demon's Souls after about 100 hours or so, I was quite excited and avoided a lot of pre-release material, and all I could say was wow, and I still feel that way, if I were to add up the amount of time I've spent playing Dark Souls on PS3 and PC, I would estimate that I've put 1,000+ hours into the game, I also obtained the Platinum Trophy on PS3 for the game.Nowadays, it seems a lot of developers are getting more scared to take risks, particularly the bigger guys making AAA titles, this is understandable as these companies will either stick to a winning formula, or follow the trend of what people are buying and liking, From Software on the other hand, has strived to make games that they find fun, rewarding, complex, varied and memorable, in this regard, Dark Souls 1 is a gem, and one of my all time favourite games.There is absolutely a learning curve if you've never played the game(s) before, but once you get past this, you'll be surprised at really just how easy it is, knowledge is power when it comes to the Souls games, and as you obtain knowledge about the world, the weapons, the crafting system, the magic, general equipment, enemies, bosses and environments, you will be asking yourself ""why is this game considered so hard again?"", just as I ask myself at this point when I play through it.There is fantastic level of variety in all aspects of the game, when it comes to the enemies and bosses you encounter, the weapons you can use, the different armour sets, the spells and miracles you can obtain, the locations and environments you come across and travel to, it all adds up to make you want to push on and master the game, and once you do obtain that level of skill, you'll understand why this game has such a hardcore, passionate fanbase, and one of the most dedicated in gaming as a whole.In terms of character variety, Dark Souls has a system we calls ""builds"", basically there's different starting classes to choose from, each of which starts off with different stats and equipment, frankly, this only matters for the beginning of the game, typically I will personally start off with a Knight, and then level my stats in other areas to make a highly proficient Spellsword character, I have made other builds as well, but stat investment is VERY important, weapons in the game also have what is called ""scaling"", and as well as leveling up weapons with the brilliant crafting system, this scaling aspect will affect the damage you can do with a particular weapons based on your stats, so for example, a ""Dexterity"" or ""Dex"" weapon, like a Scimitar, will have a high ""Scaling rank"" (Like ""A"") when it comes to the Dexterity stat, meaning that the more you level Dexterity, the more damage you will do with that Scimitar, scaling ranges from S (the best) all the way to E (the worst).As far as the story goes, mainstream reviewers criticized this part of the game for being non-existent, and this is not the case, the basis of the story is explained in the opening cutscene, but the story and lore in general present themselves in a more mysterious way than most games out there do, they present themselves through item descriptions, NPC dialogues, and through emotion and general feeling, by simply paying attention to what is going on while playing the game, it's a superb way of telling a story and uncovering the rich lore of the game, you'll find yourself making connections from one item description to another, and coming up with your own theories for what may have happened, if you look at VaatiVidya or Epicnamebro on YouTube, you'll see that the story and lore are extremely deep and interesting, and we all certainly had a lot of fun putting the pieces together back in 2011 and beyond, even today, we continue to come up with new theories and we continue to discover new things about the game, which is incredible.The Multiplayer of the game is incredible and super unique, it hosts a realtime MP system which can be accessed without the need to go to another menu, the MP relies on the use of in-game items including a ""White Sign Soapstone"" (in order to place your personal ""sign"" down and be summoned to help another player in their own world), and a ""Red Eye Orb"" which will allow you to invade and attempt to kill another player in their world, there are other items in the game that allow for MP interaction, and co-op of up to 3 players can take place, the MP system can make for some extremely fun scenarios and some epic and fun battles.The general sound in the game is amazing and perfectly fitting, everything sounds just as it should, the music that plays during boss battles is incredible, emotional and very varied, I have nothing to complaint about in regards to the soundtrack, it is amazing.As far as the PC version goes, it was disappointing at launch in a lot of regards, for technical reasons mind you, it lacked a lot of the basic features a PC version of a game should have, such as high resolution and framerate support, however, a brilliant modder named Durante has since implemented a modification called ""DSfix"" which allows the game to run at higher resolutions and 60fps (albeit with a few issues when it comes to the higher fps), and also support for texture mods, some of which I use, anyone has access to this tool and it's simple to download and install.Overall, I cannot recommend Dark Souls enough, if you are a fan of Fantasy Action RPG's with a dark tone, mysterious story, incredible enemy, boss, level design, beautiful visuals, amazing art design and style and insane variety in weapons, armours and just about everything else, you owe it to yourself to play this game, continue to get better at it and master it, and just have a whole load of fun while doing so, experiencing a new world that doesn't herald YOU as its omnipotent master from the get go, but forces you to earn that spot, should you want it.If you are quite intimidated and would like a pretty understandable rundown and tips regarding the game, I suggest looking at Rurikhan's video ""Dark Souls for Dummies, 10 Tips"" on YouTube, which you can find right here -

												The famously difficult Dark Souls has the ability to burn images into my head and conjure up powerful emotions with its carefully-presented story. It is both bleak and beautiful, and is one of the most impressive games made in recent years. Thematically, Dark Souls is about death and perseverance in an unforgiving world. This is echoed in the gameplay by a near-complete lack of guidance; for example, techniques critical for success go completely unexplained, like how to kindle bonfires (and what that even means). Thus, community involvement such as reading guides or walkthroughs is a must. The online elements within the game are also helpful, but the game is just as much fun to play offline.If the inaccessibile presentation wasn't bad enough, it turns out that Dark Souls really is too hard. I'd probably enjoy playing it more often if it weren't so repetitive (dying and repeating the same segment over and over again). Frankly, I have the most fun late in the game, when I've powered up enough to explore new territory and take on bosses with relatively few deaths – you know, like a normal game. On the whole, I still can't deny how absorbing and satisfying the whole experience is. There are so many fascinating details hidden away that are exciting to uncover. I love the powerful images, tense moments, and sense of accomplishment that comes when my perseverance pays off. Dark Souls is not for everyone – not by a long shot – but for those who can get past its steep learning curve and cruel difficulty, it can be a wholly unique and inspiring experience. (Rating: 9/10 “Great”)Notes: I played this PC version with an Xbox 360 Controller for Windows. It is nearly identical to the PS3 version of the game I played before, and comes packaged with the Artorias of the Abyss DLC.			"

												Great game, buy it and give it a try.There are so many things to love here. Let's get into it.The Story/Lore:Very open-ended, you have to piece it together bit by bit from item descriptions and bits of dialogue from NPCs. But the world that Miyazaki created is really cool. Each area in the world has its own story and every character has his/her own adventures. It is quite beautiful.The Looks:Each seperate area in the game has its own unique feel. Different areas are populated with different enemies and scenery, and every area does feel quite unique. The graphics are quite good, nothing groundbreaking, but will make you stop and stare sometimes. The character models and enemy design are fantastic and really help you immerse yourself in the world.The Sound:The music is very fitting and certain tracks really do stand out. But for the most part I find myself more or less ignoring the music in the game. The sound effects are fitting and immersive, and are really useful for being aware of your surroundings. Nothing really to rant or rave about here. The Gameplay:This is where this game really shines. The gameplay is very polished. The combat feels very plausible. There is a give and take, a flow to the combat. For the most part, you can't just go in flailing your sword around or spamming spells out the wazoo. You have to be careful, take calculated risks, and know when to fall back. The leveling system is fantastic. 1 or 2 levels won't really make a difference, so grinding is unnecessary. Besides hitting weapon or spell requirements, level is not a huge indicator of power. This makes pvp interesting and low-level runs possible. The wide variety of different character builds has kept me playing this game for so long. From a pure caster to a tankish wall to a dexterous fighter with the support of miracles, you can have fun with a wide variety of playstyles.			"

												I like this game. Good lvling system, story is simple but same time epic. Lore is shrouded to mysteries. Many weapons, armors and spells. Also different kind of covenants are fine. But there are shadows in this games shining glory: Hackers, Lagstabbers and Disconnecters, not to mention IP pool system. Which will make your life very much hell. Also those player made ""dueling rules"" are not what this game was supposed to be. This is supposed to be Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition not Gentle Souls: Prepare to Bow edition.I would rate 10/10 but with ""shadows"" i will give 8/10I recommed this game to those with patience and are really prepared to die.

												Oh my god, I think I'm gona die..... Dark Souls is undoubtedly the hardest game (and in my opinion, harder than Demon's Souls) of this generation. The gameplay is great, the game involves strategy and thinking to beat the powerful enemies, taking one hit can cause lots of damage and sometimes instant deaths if your not careful. You WILL die alot, and you will have to restart on parts you have gone so far... but completing the area will reward you greatly and you will become stronger. Bosses are a highlight of the game, they are like no other in other games, they are very challenging. This game is amazing in every aspect, challenging and rewarding. I have problems with the PC version thought...First, it is a port, this game runs terrible and laggy without using a mod called DSFix. With DSFix, you can do many game adjustments with it.Second, without DSMouse fix, you can't play with mouse and keyboard.Third, since it uses GFWL, it has ENORMOUS amount of hackers, making its multiplayer features extremly risky to use.I still recommend it thought as most problems are fixed using mods and its obviously still controller compatible.Get this game if you want to start a challenge :D			"

												Pretty much one of the best games I've ever played, has an amazing story, full of riddles, its like a puzzle, you need to put pieces together to understand but once you do that and you start understanding what is happening is pretty mind blowing.Not a game for everyone I have to say, has a unique game style that you either like it or not and like the name says ""Prepare To Die"" means that you will die alot until you figur out what you should do and even then you will die so just try not to rage quite much =) therefore the only down side for me in this game is the port, its horribly ported to pc, so still has all the xbox buttons showing and stuff but besides that its simply perfect!9/10 for me, not 10 'cuz of the port.Totally worth the money they ask for the game.*Edit: 24/11/2016 - Still one the best games ever made.

												I bought this game out of curiosity during the last Steam Winter sales for less than 6€, after having read many reviews over the years, and I must say that it is well worth the money. Let’s get straight to business: DS – PTDE is a 3rd Person Fantasy Action-RPG, directly ported from the Xbox360 and PS3 version. The setting is a standard high-fantasy medieval world with lots of undeads, demons, lizardmen, dragons, knights in black or shiny armors of all sorts, but the lore and plot is rarely mentioned at all throughout the playthrough, as you mostly play alone (or with friends/other players in online co-op) with very rare encounters with sentient NPCs which can offer a little bit of insight on your mission and objectives. Game progression is almost non-linear: after having beaten the first obligatory “tutorial dungeon” you character reaches the first (and only) main quest hub and is given the generic mission to “fulfil the prophecy and ring the two Bells of Awakening”, with absolutely no clue on how to proceed: it is the player’s duty to start exploring the world and find a way to progress and clear a path, and this is where the real fun begins. Even if you have been living under a rock for the past 2 years and have read no other review of DS – PTDE, you will understand one basic concept during the first 10 minutes of gameplay: as the name itself implies this game is INSANELY HARD. The developers have intentionally designed it to challenge the player at every turn, with absolutely no mercy even for beginner’s mistakes (even in the tutorial dungeon you will die A LOT during your first playthrough). Some examples, just to give an idea:-          No save-load mechanic is implemented: the game autosaves your position and progress basically after every action you perform, causing every gameplay choice to become instantly PERMANENT. Did you just killed a NPC with a fireball by accident due to him being too close to a menacing skeleton? That NPC will be permanently DEAD, even if this means losing access to his wares (in case he was a merchant) or to a side quest. You will have to find another way around the locked door or find someone else to sell you those precious arrows you were looking for… The good news is that the developers have literally thought of everything, so an “unwinnable” scenario is virtually impossible to achieve (without cheats), even if you mindlessly slaughter every living and undead being in sight (including merchants and questgivers)-          Even if your character is cursed with the undeath and technically cannot die, every single hostile monster or NPC can single handedly ♥♥♥♥ you and send you back to the spawn point with little effort. Even the least menacing zombie, armed only with a broken sword, can AND WILL kill you a dozen time if you do not remember to dodge his attacks or keep your shield up the whole time. Underestimating any encounter, even when overgeared, will lead to the usual YOU DIED screen in few seconds-          If you are so lucky and brave to reach one of the various checkpoints placed at various strategic locations, and use it to rest and replenish your forces before proceeding EVERY SINGLE MONSTER YOU HAVE KILLED UP TO THAT MOMENT WILL RESPAWN (with the exception of bosses and minibosses), leaving you stranded in the middle of a dungeon with no way to get out without fighting your way back to the beginning. There is no turning back in DS – PTDE, sorry-          Is it also worth mentioning that being killed will result in the same effect: respawn at the checkpoint and a horde of fresh monsters to fight all around you. Oh, did I mention that spawn points are usually very far from bosses, punishing the player even more for deaths during boss fights?Although the above points could be interpreted as lazy or poor design, the reality is that DS – PTDE is one of the best balanced games I’ve played in many years of PC gaming: every encounter and situation can be easily won by using the correct strategy and taking advantage of the weakness of the enemy; if you are rushing through an area while swinging your sword or throwing fireballs without any care for the surrounding environment you will soon be overwhelmed and the familiar YOU DIED screen will be shown. A tactical approach, with perfect knowledge of the surroundings (to avoid the frequent ambushes) and the correct gear combination will increase your survival chances immensely, and some boss fights will even become trivial with the correct strategy.Of course this implies a trial-and-error process, but there is a reason why this game is called “Prepare to Die Edition”.Unfortunately this game has also blatant flaws, and the most important lies in the graphic engine: being a direct console port (made by a SW house which was specialized only in console titles with no PC experience) you can forget about HD resolution, smooth framerates and all the eye-candies of a typical PC AAA title. But it is even worse: the PC version of DS – PTDE is locked to 720p resolution and 30fps, IN 2014! You know that 3500€ gaming rig that you just bought and that runs BF4 at ultra in Surround on 3 27” monitors? It is completely wasted since you will experience the same resolution and detail of a 2005 console anyway.And what about mouse and keyboard controls? Forget about them, as all the menus and in game text refer to Xbox360 control layout and using a M+K combo will be a frustrating experience (Steam even has a warning on the store page claiming that a 360 controller is strongly recommended for this game).Luckily for you, my friends, the modding community has solved this issue since a long time with two brilliant an small pieces of software: DSFix and DSMfix (http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfix and http://steamcommunity.com/app/211420/discussions/0/864979455329386779/). After a very simple setup process you will be able to enjoy the game on your PC as it should have been since release, with full HD graphics, 60+ constant fps (with the possibility of downsampling to push the detail even further, if your rig can take it), SSAO, MSAA, FXAA, smooth mouse controls and customizable keybindings. Last but not least, there is also a co-op fix called DSCfix which improves the experience of online co-op play over the standard GFWL junk (http://sdrv.ms/128mNwY).TL;DR version:PROs-          Very challenging gameplay, but never too difficult to become unbeatable. If you die too much, it is generally your fault-          Longevity (50+ hours of gameplay for a single playthrough, with the possibility of New Game+ with increased difficulty!)-          Endless combinations of character growth and gear allows for very different approaches, all equally rewarding, to the game-          A sequel is in the works!CONs-          Direct Xbox360 port: use of unofficial mods is mandatory to make the game playable-          Awkward game controls with M+K (also fixed by a mod)-          Absurdly steep learning curve-          Some gameplay mechanics are obscure unless google is used (e.g. crafting)-          Even with mods the graphic engine does not take advantage of all the possible features of a modern gaming PC			"

game(s) before, but once you get past this, you'll be surprised at really just how easy it is, knowledge is power when it comes to the Souls games, and as you obtain knowledge about the world, the weapons, the crafting system, the magic, general equipment, enemies, bosses and environments, you will be asking yourself ""why is this game considered so hard again?"", just as I ask myself at this point when I play through it.There is fantastic level of variety in all aspects of the game, when it comes to the enemies and bosses you encounter, the weapons you can use, the different armour sets, the spells and miracles you can obtain, the locations and environments you come across and travel to, it all adds up to make you want to push on and master the game, and once you do obtain that level of skill, you'll understand why this game has such a hardcore, passionate fanbase, and one of the most dedicated in gaming as a whole.In terms of character variety, Dark Souls has a system we calls ""builds"", basically there's different starting classes to choose from, each of which starts off with different stats and equipment, frankly, this only matters for the beginning of the game, typically I will personally start off with a Knight, and then level my stats in other areas to make a highly proficient Spellsword character, I have made other builds as well, but stat investment is VERY important, weapons in the game also have what is called ""scaling"", and as well as leveling up weapons with the brilliant crafting system, this scaling aspect will affect the damage you can do with a particular weapons based on your stats, so for example, a ""Dexterity"" or ""Dex"" weapon, like a Scimitar, will have a high ""Scaling rank"" (Like ""A"") when it comes to the Dexterity stat, meaning that the more you level Dexterity, the more damage you will do with that Scimitar, scaling ranges from S (the best) all the way to E (the worst).As far as the story goes, mainstream reviewers criticized this part of the game for being non-existent, and this is not the case, the basis of the story is explained in the opening cutscene, but the story and lore in general present themselves in a more mysterious way than most games out there do, they present themselves through item descriptions, NPC dialogues, and through emotion and general feeling, by simply paying attention to what is going on while playing the game, it's a superb way of telling a story and uncovering the rich lore of the game, you'll find yourself making connections from one item description to another, and coming up with your own theories for what may have happened, if you look at VaatiVidya or Epicnamebro on YouTube, you'll see that the story and lore are extremely deep and interesting, and we all certainly had a lot of fun putting the pieces together back in 2011 and beyond, even today, we continue to come up with new theories and we continue to discover new things about the game, which is incredible.The Multiplayer of the game is incredible and super unique, it hosts a realtime MP system which can be accessed without the need to go to another menu, the MP relies on the use of in-game items including a ""White Sign Soapstone"" (in order to place your personal ""sign"" down and be summoned to help another player in their own world), and a ""Red Eye Orb"" which will allow you to invade and attempt to kill another player in their world, there are other items in the game that allow for MP interaction, and co-op of up to 3 players can take place, the MP system can make for some extremely fun scenarios and some epic and fun battles.The general sound in the game is amazing and perfectly fitting, everything sounds just as it should, the music that plays during boss battles is incredible, emotional and very varied, I have nothing to complaint about in regards to the soundtrack, it is amazing.As far as the PC version goes, it was disappointing at launch in a lot of regards, for technical reasons mind you, it lacked a lot of the basic features a PC version of a game should have, such as high resolution and framerate support, however, a brilliant modder named Durante has since implemented a modification called ""DSfix"" which allows the game to run at higher resolutions and 60fps (albeit with a few issues when it comes to the higher fps), and also support for texture mods, some of which I use, anyone has access to this tool and it's simple to download and install.Overall, I cannot recommend Dark Souls enough, if you are a fan of Fantasy Action RPG's with a dark tone, mysterious story, incredible enemy, boss, level design, beautiful visuals, amazing art design and style and insane variety in weapons, armours and just about everything else, you owe it to yourself to play this game, continue to get better at it and master it, and just have a whole load of fun while doing so, experiencing a new world that doesn't herald YOU as its omnipotent master from the get go, but forces you to earn that spot, should you want it.If you are quite intimidated and would like a pretty understandable rundown and tips regarding the game, I suggest looking at Rurikhan's video ""Dark Souls for Dummies, 10 Tips"" on YouTube, which you can find right here -

												PC port quality aside, this is a VERY well made game no matter which platform you play it on.  With that in mind, let's get down to the dirty details :)For starters, one thing I love about this game is that it is relatively noob-friendly (at least it was for me having never played Demon's Souls).  Its initial linearity helps new players learn the mechanics against increasingly difficult obstacles without necessarily having to worry about navigation *most* of the time.  While the enemies are by no means easy, for Dark Souls they are very primitive and therefore, make a good introduction for the kinds of attacks you will face throughout the game.  Enemies that are initially big bosses become plentiful regular enemies later on in the game, giving a massive feeling of personal growth and achievement to the player when the enemies that used to kick ♥♥♥ are getting cut down one by one.The art direction in this game is extraordinarily well done.  By this, I mean how its sound design, visual style, and character design work with the underlying themes of the game to completely immerse the player.  Much of the world is filled with hulking structures worn down or destroyed, giving the player the sense that they are scavenging a once great civilization come to ruin.  There is almost never any music in the game, save for the boss fights and one area that is so awe-inspiring that it requires fitting music.  In many of the boss fights, the music is hectic and rushed, simulating the players' emotions when they just walked into a room with a giant behemoth eyeing your supple body for tenderizing.  Everything in this game looks and sounds like it wants to tear out your intestines with all manner of sharp or blunt object and wear them as various pieces of clothing.  Many of the NPCs in the game have very subdued voices and seem to be only sometimes be aware of your presence.  As the game title states, you will die and you will die a lot.  Caution is the word of the day and not paying to the environment later on in the game will prove very deadly indeed when many of the game's traps are introduced.  The story is told almost entirely through the environment, with some details being vaguely provided by NPCs.  As the story picks up with the player's journey beginning, the world has already fallen to ruin, with many of the once great heroes and gods of the time either dead or driven insane by the coming darkness.  Many (ignorant) people claim the game has no story whatsoever but paying attention to the environment is key to discovering the backstory and motives for many of the other characters ever coming to Lordan.  Some youtubers like VaatiVidya have very strong explanations for many of the characters in the game and they are incredible.The combat in the game has a very weighted feel to it.  This game doesn't have a combat system like Call of Duty where everything happens at breakneck speed.  When the player swings their sword, the character has to quickly wind up for the swing.  It isn't slow by any means depending on your weapon of choice but it definitely requires deliberate action.  The combat is very much about decision making: when to block, when to counterattack, when to dodge, even when to run away to regroup.  Don't run into the game flailing around expecting to fight like Bruce Lee, it's just going to end with your death.A topic on everyone's mind when talking about this game is obviously the difficulty.  While the game is very hard, it isn't for the reasons many people state.  As hard as it may be to understand at first, YOU are what makes dark souls as hard or as easy as it is.  Your ability to observe your environments and predict the actions of your enemies will determine how successful you are in Lordran.  Overcoming difficult boss fights is a result of your very own hard work and determination to succeed.  The game never hands you a victory, it puts your prize on the opposite end of a room filled with traps and deadly foes and tells you to take what is rightfully yours.Don't go into Dark Souls thinking you will know how everything in the game works, even after playing for a while, without consulting online information.  While the game takes a hands off approach to educating the player about the mechanics of the game and how everything works, it isn't equipped to give *any* information on some things like how invasions and coop works, as well as some stats like poise.  This is my biggest problem with the game especially when it comes to new players.  There isn't any explanation for what being human does or what benefits you gain from consuming humanity without spending it.  Without consulting online information, your experience will be much more difficult especially later on when the level design becomes less intuitive.This review is written while Games For Windows Live is still functioning and as such, I have no idea if the online will still work after the shutdown (probably not).  The game's online component is a mess, barely functioning for PvP and almost nonexistent for Cooperative play.  Thankfully, there is a brilliant mod that branches off the DSFix mod that makes coop way better than originally and that is very much appreciated especially if playing with friends.  PvP works but the amount of lag is unforgiveable in a game where losing to an invader can mean losing all your souls (currency) and a lot of progress.  98% of the time, I don't feel like anyone bested me in combat out of sheer skill, but because the latency with the servers condemned me from the start.In short, the game is incredibly well put together and while a few things need improvement and the PC port DEFINITELY could have been made better, that doesn't make the game itself bad.  Especially with the community fixes for resolution, framerate, coop, mouse and keyboard, etc. the game is downright beautiful to play.  For sure, the game is VERY difficult, but it is by no means as hard as people make it out to be.  If you want a game that can bring you immense satisfaction as a player, you absolutely must buy this game.  One of my favorite game series of all time and I would recommend it to anyone who has the balls to overcome real challenge.  Incredibly deep and immersive, this game is a MUST BUY			"

												The famously difficult Dark Souls has the ability to burn images into my head and conjure up powerful emotions with its carefully-presented story. It is both bleak and beautiful, and is one of the most impressive games made in recent years. Thematically, Dark Souls is about death and perseverance in an unforgiving world. This is echoed in the gameplay by a near-complete lack of guidance; for example, techniques critical for success go completely unexplained, like how to kindle bonfires (and what that even means). Thus, community involvement such as reading guides or walkthroughs is a must. The online elements within the game are also helpful, but the game is just as much fun to play offline.If the inaccessibile presentation wasn't bad enough, it turns out that Dark Souls really is too hard. I'd probably enjoy playing it more often if it weren't so repetitive (dying and repeating the same segment over and over again). Frankly, I have the most fun late in the game, when I've powered up enough to explore new territory and take on bosses with relatively few deaths – you know, like a normal game. On the whole, I still can't deny how absorbing and satisfying the whole experience is. There are so many fascinating details hidden away that are exciting to uncover. I love the powerful images, tense moments, and sense of accomplishment that comes when my perseverance pays off. Dark Souls is not for everyone – not by a long shot – but for those who can get past its steep learning curve and cruel difficulty, it can be a wholly unique and inspiring experience. (Rating: 9/10 “Great”)Notes: I played this PC version with an Xbox 360 Controller for Windows. It is nearly identical to the PS3 version of the game I played before, and comes packaged with the Artorias of the Abyss DLC.			"

												The Good: Unique difficulty, unique setting, and unique gameplay.Difficulty relies on skill in combat and evironment awareness, unlike modern games that rely only on damage modifications, and, or enemies with infalable aim. The setting doesn't rely on set pieces or glorified hollywood cutscenes to sell itself. The Bad: Lackluster PC port, and Games For Windows Client requirement.Low resolution textures riddle the game, mouse and keyboard support is nonexistent, or at the very least horrid, resolution render is capped at 720p, and framerate is capped at 30fps. Conclusion: Install DSFix mod, DSCFix mod, and High-res textures from Nexus website, and I'll guarantee you'll have a damn good time with this game!			"

												Pretty much one of the best games I've ever played, has an amazing story, full of riddles, its like a puzzle, you need to put pieces together to understand but once you do that and you start understanding what is happening is pretty mind blowing.Not a game for everyone I have to say, has a unique game style that you either like it or not and like the name says ""Prepare To Die"" means that you will die alot until you figur out what you should do and even then you will die so just try not to rage quite much =) therefore the only down side for me in this game is the port, its horribly ported to pc, so still has all the xbox buttons showing and stuff but besides that its simply perfect!9/10 for me, not 10 'cuz of the port.Totally worth the money they ask for the game.*Edit: 24/11/2016 - Still one the best games ever made.

												I beat it and immediately went into New Game + for another two hours before going to sleep way too late. I bought this game two weeks ago and I've almost played it seventy hours. I barely play most games for 30 hours, let alone twice that much.Ok, I normally like games that have cinematic storylines and all that, but this game is all mechanics and I loved it. Yeah, there's story if you look for it, which I did, but you could also just go and kill things (or die a bunch).I died a bunch. I was raised with NES games, so I've already tamed my frustration at fail states, but this game poked me in places I didn't think existed in my brain. Challenge is good, I think, and this game taught me to be patient in a modern gaming landscape that otherwise encourages instant gratification. I had to plan ahead, prepare accordingly, and most importantly, slow down. Every action matters. Every upgraded stat slowly helps you reach a certain kind of strength that helps you wield better weapons or survive attacks from your enemies'. Every hidden wall or new location brings both fear of new enemies and joy of exploration.Yes, literally both at the same time. It's called eustress. It's good for you. The anxiety becomes tempered and soon you become more brave. Just like in real like, bravery is not the absence of fear, but the willingness to move forward despite it.There are issues with the game, of course. I had to mod it, and even then there are issues with the geometry occasionally. Games like this shouldn't have platforming sections, but lo and behold, they are there and they will kill you when you least expect it. You will get stuck inbetween trees that should obviously accomodate whatever size of body you choose and some rogue will backstab you before you can respond to the game's mistake. Also, it seems like I should be able to roll through certain enemies. Even those that are smaller than you somehow have the constitution to keep you from moving past them.I don't get that at all.These issues become smaller, though, the more that you gain power and are soon capable of just killing the enemies instead of trying to run through them. Once you know where the issues are, it's incredibly easy to avoid them, but as a newcomer you might find it frustrating. The game gives ample shortcuts between sections, so running from the bonfire checkpoints soon becomes less of a chore and more of a reason to take a small break.Take breaks.The fighting mechanics are visceral and satisfying. When you get a weapon that suits your fighting style, you'll really get into the game. There are a variety of weapons and relevant movesets that can suit the close combat fans, fast or slow, and the ranged combat, with projectiles like fireballs and arrows or a large variety of spells.The combat is really what kept me in the game. As much as I enjoy exploration; as much as I enjoy finding the little pieces of the storyline that make me feel like an archaeologist grasping at paper scraps from the Library of Alexandria; as much as I enjoy tailoring my character to my needs like I would in a long term DnD campaign; I can't imagine doing all that without the really challenging fights that a few of the standard enemies and bosses present. Gaining souls from bosses is so satisfying, especially once you discover that little piece of the storyline hidden on them.The thing that surprises me the most about this game is that I have so much to talk about after playing it. I introduced a few friends to it and now they're seeing what I saw last week after ringing the bells. The first two days I played this game I got mad at it. Frustrated at the geometry and what I perceived as glitches. ""People that like Dark Souls hate themselves,"" I said to my friend. Then I rang the bells and never looked back.I'm glad I stuck to it. There is so much content to enjoy, so many things to try and discover. I highly recommend it.			"

												Atrocious port, one of the best games ever made. 'Prepare to Die' is pretty accurate: the first half of the game is brutal.GameplayPretty much requires an Xbox360 controller. Mouse & keyboard controls are incredibly bad, and feel terrible even with a mouse fix mod.DkS has the best melee combat outside Mount&Blade. Every swing has weight, every hit counts. Attacks are always telegraphed well in advance: everything can be dodged with proper timing. This works both ways, and it might take some time to get used to the player's attacks not being instant, but requiring a similar wind-up that the AI has. Excellent weapon variety, with nearly every weapon having at the very least some minor unique quirk, and most weapons having full, unique movesets. The player's equipment choices are mostly personal preference: the weapons feel different and they're all perfectly viable when upgraded. Armour variety is also great, but what you wear doesn't make a huge difference. Resistances from armour are good, but dodging and blocking are far better tactics than eating hits.The magic system is a bit intimidating at first. Highly limited amount of casts, and very long casting times. Three different schools of ""magic"", all of which feel powerful and interesting. Playing a sorcerer does make the game significantly easier, especially later on when items that increase magic damage are easily available.The player character levels up by spending souls ( currency, essentially ) to level up individual stats ( strength, dexterity, etc. ). A single character can, in theory, be a master of everything. Leveling up gets more expensive every time, so most of the time it's more advantageous to plan a build in advance and stick to it. At character creation, the classes only really determine the starting equipment: the classes don't lock a character into a single path. Incredible freedom in the character development system; encourages replayability by having a massive amount of perfectly viable builds to come up with. Enemy design is, overall, excellent. They range from undead knights to giant mushrooms and clams. They all have unique movesets, and despite the AI being very basic (run at player, try to kill), the combat feels fresh when you move through the levels and encounter new enemies.The levels are (for the most part) designed masterfully. A maze, with shortcuts available everywhere. The world feels real: all the areas are connected perfectly, and highly encourage exploration. Huge variety in the design of the levels: Duke's Archive is a huge library, Tomb of the Giants, a pitch black cave full of skeletons. Some areas, like Lost Izalith, were clearly rushed and lack the complex geometry and intelligent enemy placement of levels such as Undead Burg.StoryHighly unconventional storytelling in this one. Most of it is delivered through item descriptions accessed in the inventory. If you never read them, all you'll really know is that there's a prophecy, and you killed a bunch of dudes. The story hidden in the descriptions, environment and NPC ""quests"" is absolutely brilliant, however. Having to dig for it makes figuring things out so much more rewarding than being told everything in cutscenes. There are 'holes' in the story, and those are filled by the player, and his actions. Everything in the game exists for a reason:  nothing is randomly just 'there'. I found the main storyline and the NPC stories extremely interesting, but it definitely takes some effort to be able to really enjoy.Graphics & AudioThe graphics are terrible. Looks like a console game, because this is literally a 1:1 port from the xbox360. Locked to 30fps, 720p, relatively with low res textures. All of these can be fixed on PC, though: I run the game at a 4k resolution, 60fps and with fan-made HD textures. DSFix by Durante has a bunch of variables that vastly improve the way the game looks. Well worth installing. Weapons and armour  look pretty good, but that's mostly due to their brilliant design, not graphical fidelity. The environments range from beautiful (Painted World, Ash Lake) to hideous (Lost Izalith).Sound design is ♥♥♥♥ing incredible. Very little music: only plays at a central hub area and boss fights. The rest of the time, all you'll hear is footsteps, monsters and other environmental sounds. The lack of music gives the rare times it does play so much more impact. Hearing the Firelink music after a raid on the Catacombs is very comforting, and hearing boss music gets the adrenaline pumping as you face Smough & Ornstein.In conclusion,  Dark Souls is one of the greatest games ever made. It is a terrible PC version, but most of the issues can be fixed, and the result is an experience no gamer should miss.			"

												After playing this game whole, dying alot, enjoy it on some parts and raging unendlessly i have come to a point where everytime i meet someone new i'll ask them if they played Dark Souls, and if they haven't i'll just recommend it to them.It's one of these games that everyone is talking about, you take a look, hate a first but give it a second try and you'll treat it like a cup of coffe, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ afficionado.The first thing that you'll be noticing are the awkward controls that function awkwardly well, if you aren't playing this on the PC of course.Press R1 for light attack, R2 for a heavier strike, Y to dual-wield that may look useless at first but heck this is necessary as f*ck. Press B to roll and hold B to run.I have left Dark Souls for quite a long time, bought it in 2012 and only came to finish it in 2014 and dude, i have not forgotten what any of the buttons do.People say Dark Souls's story is crap, that it has no story, well tell that to Hidetaka Miyazaki you little piece of ♥♥♥, you wouldn't trust yourself.Infact, the Dark Souls story is so well designed it gives me cancer, and look, a story has never given me cancer before.The characters itself tell the story, the bosses, heck, even the monsters do! Everything make sense if you explore further in the game, NPCs will tell stories and some monsters will be different, many secrets to be found, not something that was written on a book and making it easy to read, i'd even say Dark Souls is a interactive book where you write your own path, with circumstances if you kill an NPC or on the choices you make, they will come hit really hard later like electricity bills.The combat is realistic in its kind, it's not realistic in real-life realism level.Let's say, how do you attack with a spear in this game? you just f*cking rush with it at an enemy, i have seen a video on youtube that judges Dark Souls' combat and he tells only the truth.With many different weapons to wield, each weapon with a different skillset, different moves and abilities, it feels like every single weapon is different, let's put it like that, you are in a pet shop and can't decide which kitten to take home!The graphics are artistically beautiful, not photorealistic beautiful, with some photobumping that got my eyes stuck in amaze and how the armour is really shiny too, shields reflect light and your armour just feels like gold. The scenary is quite the thing too, but not that beautiful too, though since the PC-port was so poorly optimized, the community makes everything better, goddamit From Software i hope dark souls 2 will come out decent as journalists say.Dark souls is a one-in-a-kind game with unforgiving difficulty, if you do a mistake on combat ur dead m8. Ratings would give it a 10/10, i'm giving it my own personal score you swine, i'm giving it the 'Dark-Souls level score', that means it's good, yes.			"

												A game well worth the frustration. Sure, the PC port may not be that good, but with a bit of searching and some mods it'll work fine. You'll probably still want a controller though, as the STORE PAGE warns in big friendly letters.A game worthy of the time put into it to learn it, dying each time will imbue your victories with that little bit of extra sweetness.

												For me Dark Souls is one of my all time Favorite RPG´s. Yes you will Die you will Die a lot but the rewarding feeling when you kill the Boss after numerous atempts is something you don´t get alot of todays Games. Anyone who is up for a fair challenge and is into RPG´s should try it.Review after my first Playtrough on PC (done multiple runs on Console before).Pros:- Unique Level and Boss Design.- Great Art Style.- Highly Rewarding Combat.- The World is very rich of Lore but not forced unto the Player. I would recommend VaatiVidya´s Lore Videos on YouTube for anyone Interested. Cons:- Graphics are a little dated.- The qualtity of PvP highly depends on both Players Internet Connection.Warning: The Port from From Software is really bad. I played it with the DSfix mod wich bumps up the Framerate up to 60fps and adds useful Keybindings. Done my Playtrough with an Xbox One Controller.Sorry for the bad Language im not a native English Speaker :)			"

												The game is a flawed masterpiece, held back by a bad port. Getting the running takes a bit of work, and be sure to get the DSfix mod. I also reccomend a controller, the keyboard controls are mapped in a very odd way. Despite all this, it is a unique experience that is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.			"

												Not for the weak or faint of heart, ""casuls"" beware, this game will eat you alive!!No really though, Dark Souls is an amazing game that has so much to offer but in the same time, you get what you put into this game. it will challenge you in every way a game can possibly challenge you, it will challenge your patience, it will challenge your determination, it will challenge your attention to detail, it will punish you for every stupid decision you make, and will reward you for the smart decisions you make. It will make you feel small and defeated at times, but when you keep coming back for more and finally succeed, there's such a strong sense of accomplishment with your victories. Dark Souls isn't your traditional ""Quest Line"" kind of RPG. The game gives you little to no direction, the game wants you to use your brain and figure it out YOURSELF. Dark Souls has a very ""indirect"" way of telling its story, through NPC conversations, world design changes, and item descriptions. It's very heavy in lore and its actually really interesting and well thought out. The game also draws very heavy influence in its design from the Manga/Anime ""Berserk"". Dark Souls is a game I would recommend to only the most hardcore of gamers, it can and will run circles around you, I know it may sound like ""Why the F*** would I play a game like that?"", but trust me, through the challenge, there is a very rewarding and memorable experience to be had. I love the souls series to death, truly special and inspiring game series, probably the most revolutionary game series in modern gaming. Seriously, I can't stress enough how much this game is amazing on all levels. Very creative and mysterious story and lore, interesting and unique interconnected world, extremely in-depth and well balanced statistical combat mechanics that are literally broken down to a science, loads of content, loads of mysterious secret items and game mechanics, loads of really cool viable weapons, loads of different kinds of armor/sets with differentiating perks, rewarding but difficult challenges, Truly unique signature online mechanics, dedicated cultish online community, like literally Dark Souls seriously--HAS IT ALL. In 20+ years of gaming, It is one of the greatest and most complete video game experiences I've ever had. It is the existing proof that the challenging old-school game influence can still thrive in modern day video games.10/10   ""A truly amazing masterpiece, a once in a life time game that any true gamer should definitely experience""Fun Fact: I bought this game on a Steam sale, the best $6.79 I've ever spent lolWell if you decide to give Dark Souls a try, don't cry like a B****, man up (or woman up?) and ""Git Gud"" you filthy casul!!!******** I HIGHLY recommend a controller for Dark Souls, this isn't the best of ports and has a very BAD KB+M setup but in all honesty, Dark Souls was truly meant to be played with a controller anyway, which is why i'm sure From Software didn't make KB+M a priority because they know, if you know anything about Dark Souls, you're not gonna use it, you're gonna use a controller. If you try to use KB+M with Dark Souls, You're an idiot and you're gonna get rekt lol			"

												It reminds me of games from my childhood. Enemies are tough, resources are limited, and you need to be able to get from point A to point B without dying. I spent 4hrs at Capra Demon, defeating him only with the help of a kind soul (that soul later invaded me and tried to kill me, but I shut that sucker down). If you die, you have to restart at the last checkpoint and kill everything all over again. If you use a resource and you die, you don't get that resource back. Enemies are tough enough and fight well enough that you actually have to know how to fight and how to defend yourself in order to survive. As frustrating as this game is, it's extremely satisfying and fulfilling to overcome a challenging enemy. Remember that game from your childhood where you spent so much time trying to get through one area? Remember how you felt when you finally beat it? You'll get that same feeling in Dark Souls.			"

												As the game title says, prepare to die. And when the developer says, you should really do that, because you're going to die, big time. Death in this game is like one of the main characters: you're going to encounter it as much as you possibly can imagine. The game is as straight as an arrow, but the level-design left me speechless. Bosses are hard, enemies are smart, riddles are tricky, death is around every corner almost every time. The game overall could be too hardcore for your average casual gamer, but it's certainly worthwhile. One of the best action-RPGs of the 2012. I'd give it 9 out of 10.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played. When this came out on the 360, I had no media knowledge of it (I recommend this for most hyped games) and came in completely blind. I got my ♥♥♥ kicked up and down because I thought it was a hack and slasher, obviously there is that but its much more controlled and precise. Pros:Level design - There are hardly any loading screens during the entire playthrough of this game, maybe a handful. The first 75% of the game is chock full of beautiful interconnected environments, and you will not get tired of running through them when you inevitably die :)Combat - Very visceral and precise. You will be punished harshly for using the last of your stamina and missing that risky shot. There is dodging and rolling which give you the tools to dance around your enemies if you are skilled, but even a skilled player can easily be overwhelmed by an over aggressive group of enemies. One of the best parts of the game.Enemies - Great variety of enemies and bosses, both challenging enough to not get tired out quickly.Online play - Theres nothing besides boss fights that gets my heart pumping like my world getting invaded. These invasions keep you on your toes and give you such a rush when you kill your invader as well. The messages and summoning are also great aspects of the online play, with overused and sometimes witty messages popping up to describe the levels around you. If you find an area to hard, summon a friend! Unfortunately summoning in some places is hard because there simply aren't enough players to find (especially within certain level ranges) to summon for a boss. Each boss is definitely killable via solo, but O&S boss will be tough if you cant find a co-op partner.Dying actually matters in this game as well, so the sense of riskiness is always present when holding a large amount of souls and youre trying to decide whether or not to cash them in or save up more.Cons:Framerate - The framerate can get a little bogged down sometimes, especially in Blighttown. It was way worse on the 360 though.The last sections of the game feel rushed and are not nearly as good as the rest (75%) of the game. This is not a huge con though because for the most part its great.Lack of summoning in some places due to lower player counts is somewhat of a negative, especially if youre having a hard time with the boss.All in all this game is a must buy for RPG fans, if you dont own it and youi call yourself one then please revoke your badge until its in your library :)			"

												Dark SoulsThe game Brings me nostolgia back from Playing Megaman and or Castlevania, its a taste of Mastering mechanics and levels to Progress. The world is full of lore,Misery and Despair. Every NPC you meet is either fooling you or on your side, and their stories unfold as you progress, for better or for worse.Though Dark souls is hard, you may only need to  learn mechanics to play, pay close attention to the armours you pick up, the Weapons you find and build a character that Suits you. The game does not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you, if you die you know why you have died.The Integration of Invading/summoning mechanics with Story or lore is a awesome part of the game! either summon a friend via Online to help or Invade players to duel them or Stop thier Progression...PvP is really really Fun and is a great End game.THough Sadly the Game is a bad port and DSFix is needed to fully enjoy the game along with the Online Fix and a 360 controller, But honestly it is worth it. IT IS A CRIME that the game was a bad port for the art work and imagination of the game is Wonderfull.I can see my self putting in another 300-500 hours into this game if i was not 1 year late to the party and if Dark souls 2 was not around the corner, though i will be PvP'ing to pass the time ;D 9/10 would Praise the SUN!

												At first i was like...♥♥♥♥ this game, i was stuck at the infamous Taur Demon for a little while and just quit. I picked it up again months later for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles...and after i got better i just progressed further and further. You just need to give this game a bit of time, this is not your ordinary noob action game...but it isn't impossible either. It's reputation being a super hard game is over exaggerated, once you get the hang of it it's very doable and a loooot of fun :D I never knew this game was so big and had so many options and paths to choose from! The poor graphics due to the lazy port are fixable with DSFix and with games for windows live removed and steam play introduced co-op and pvp are lots better. This game is lots of fun, has beautiful design, lots of big bewbs and great gameplay and will keep you occupied for many hours. Praise the sun!			"

												wt r u, a casul?...On a more related note, with Games for Windows Live dead and this being on sale for 5 bucks, it's worth the pick up... as long as you don't count the half-dozen controllers you are liable to destroy in the process... The graphics are rather poor for 2011, but don't let that get you down. Dark Souls is a carefully crafted experience that you can only really fully grasp the first playthrough. Many players wish they could go back and re-experience their first time playing.  The replayability of the game comes in the diverse weapon choices and character builds, as poking enemies to death with a dagger is way, way different than swinging around a gigantic two-handed blade and, well, crushing them, I suppose. If you want the intended experience, I suggest starting your first playthough as the Warrior, as its a well-rounded character with a decent starting equipment set, and choosing nothing (or the Pendant... don't talk about the pendant! Please!) as your starting gift, as the items, which you can acquire in the game itself, are really powerful at the start of the game. So, what are you waiting for? We only want your precious Humanity...			"

												So I bought this game for $6 a few months ago just to see what all the fuss was about.  70+ hours later I can say this is one of the most challenging and rewarding gaming experiences I've had in a very, very long time.  The game's not for the weak-willed and can be very frustrating at times, but that's a part of the experience.  If you're looking for a game that doesn't hold your hand, that beats you down with no mercy but makes you feel like you've truely accomplished something great give this game a try.I can also say a couple of months ago Dark Souls 2 wasn't even on my radar.  Now it's one of my must-own games this year!			"

Dark Souls: Prepare To Die EditionThis is by far the best game I have ever played in a long time, everything about it is perfect and keeps me playing for hours.  But it didn't start like that.  When I first got this game, I was bad and it was frustrating.  Death after death to the first boss made me want to stop playing, but I didn't, I kept trying and trying until I found out what I was doing wrong.  And when you finally beat a boss after 20+ failures, you get an overwhelming feeling of accomplishment, it drives you to keep playing to find out what's next.  You will spend the whole game dying, learning from your mistakes, and feeling proud of yourself once you've mastered a fight and beat a boss.  All I can say is don't get discouraged, the game will get easier the more you play, trust me.  I used to suck and now im on NG+8 and I don't suck as much anymore. :D10/10 Dark Souls Best Game "

												A great game that brings back a nostalgia of retro games where your not hand held or pampered with helpful tips, equipment or directions in the beginning. All you understand is to move forward and expect the unexpected. On a side note, the freaking tutorial is a boss fight that I did not understand how to beat until I saw the opening to an exit to get a sword and shield. An appreciation on not just on what it delivers, but for the players who traverse through the undead burg or  through the sewers of the depths and onwards to blighttown or Anor Londo, the experience is like no other. Each environment is a unique set piece with its own enemies and pathways to take. I remember reaching the firelink shrine the very first time and unknowingly heading down towards the New Londo Ruins only to be demolished by ghosts. This gives you a fair warning that your not equipped to travel through the area yet, but a bit sight seeing of what to expect later in the game can always help your conscience.Finally, the boss battles are some of the most exciting and frustrating thing about playing this game. Patience is key and learning the patterns and weakness of the enemy can go a long way. I've found sometimes even the mini bosses can be a handful because they can surprise you when entering a room and rush you unknowingly. Although I may have started playing this game at the latter end of its release (not even a quarter of the way through), I will definitely be looking forward to preordering Dark Souls 2 for the PC.

												With GFWL removed, I think that this game is now at its best on PC. Chances are that you've heard of Dark Souls, and that someone you know may play it/have played it, so what's all the hype about?Dark Souls is an atmospheric action RPG which brings back the dungeon crawling of oldschool games like Ultima Underworld. Dark Souls, I think, though, does a much better job at making these tried and true mechanics interesting due to great design work and ideas, an amazing, engrossing atmosphere, interesting lore, the best world/level design that I have EVER SEEN in a video game, and solid gameplay.Dark Souls' gameplay is quite simple to grasp, but there are plenty of intricacies which you can explore. It's a third-person action game, with a slow, calculated speed. Combat in Dark Souls is, no matter what people say, usually more about what you decide to do and when you decide to do it, and less about the twitch reaction times and such seen in faster action games. Combat is fleshed out through a bevy of customisation and character development options, and I'd like to summarise these. When it comes to dealing with damage, you have three options. Tank up with a ridiculous amount of armour, but hinder your rolling (not viable for most of the game), use a good shield to block damage, or roll past or through attacks, either using your positioning or the invincibility frames in the roll to avoid the attacks. There are countless weapons with varying movesets, statistical attributes, lore, origins and appearances, and you'll honestly be spoiled for choice. Not to mention, you can even use boss souls to create boss weapons, and use the same move set that a boss used. In fact, most enemy movesets are analagous to yours, and this is something lovely about Dark Souls' combat. It is fair. You and your average humanoid enemy die similarly quickly, have a similar or even equal moveset, and the same tools, they can even heal. The difference is that you are smart and skilled. The melee combat in general is incredibly fleshed out, and it feels realistic and satisfying. An example of said realism is that, if you have only 66% of the required strength for a weapon, you can use it two-handed, but not one-handed.Most enemies, though, don't have magic, and there are three schools of magic in Dark Souls; Miracles, Sorceries, and Pyromancies, each of these schools have a lore-based origin and associated areas and NPCs, and they each differ greatly in function and associated playstyle. Miracles are governed by faith, and provide healing, utility, and with a few spells, huge lightning damage. The caveat of said damage spells, though, is the low amount of uses. Basically in Dark Souls, there is no Mana/MP bar, and each spell simply has a limited amount of uses. Sorceries are governed by intelligence, and are the most versatile school of magic, and you can easily build a character to use sorceries exclusively, and nearly ignore melee weapons, sorceries are simple and have a high amount of uses. Sorceries also, however have a few utility spells related to stealth and subterfuge. Pyromancy is different to Sorceries and Miracles in that the spells aren't governed by any attributes, and don't have intelligence or faith requirements for the spells. Pyromancy is a wild, fluid school of magic, with close range blasts, strange modifications to oneself and one's environment, gravity-affected fireballs and deadly firestorms. Pyromancy's strength is governed solely by the strength of one's Pyromancy Flame, which can be upgraded through spending currency with certain NPCs, and it is by far the easiest to get into. Pyromancy, however, does require one to get much closer and personal than other schools, and unlike sorceries and miracles, Pyromancy does not have any weapon or armour buffs.To summarise the gameplay, it starts off as the humble set of tools which you use to journey through the harsh, incredibly unforgiving world of Lordran, but in New Game + and subsequent playthroughs, it turns into a lovely set of mechanics with immense customisation, just waiting for you to experiment and try new builds.The game has multiplayer, too, mainly accessed through faction-like covenants, and there are two 'fields' of multiplayer interaction; 'Malicious Interaction' ,and 'Helpful Interaction'.'Helpful Interaction' consists of co-op in strangers' worlds, and leaving helpful messages. 'Malicious Interaction' consists of tricking players, or invading their game and killing them. The line is blurred with some interactions, though.Of course, done with the intricacies of the gameplay, it's time to address the elephant in the room. The difficulty. Dark Souls is infamous for its difficulty, but it is NOT the school of difficulty which wants to laugh in your face with an elitist attitude. Dark Souls' difficulty is there because you and your character must face immense hardship in this world, trying again and again to get through a hard boss battle, or an absurdly difficult area, or past one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemy, and when you do succeed, and when you do get through, you will feel great. The difficulty will no doubt make you die countless times, but Dark Souls is NOT a trial and error game. The design is for the most part, incredibly fair, with any ambushes, enemies or traps being forewarned or visible before they can possibly put the player in danger. Now, a certain platform before two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ archers is a bit unfair, as is one alley beatdown in a certain another area, but in general, the game follows every 'good game design principle' in the book.I said that the level and world design of Dark Souls were the best I've ever seen in a video game, and I can't stress that enough. Nearly every noticeable area you see in Dark Souls WILL be visited later, even the small tower in the distance, or the insignificant forest below you, or the broken down slums beneath you, you go everywhere you could possibly want to go in Lordran and more. This isn't even mentioning how well the world fits together. A significant area in the game is placed between another significant area, which you look down on, and another, secret area, which you also look down on. While in the depths of one area, you can look all the way up and see the previous area. The sense of internal consistency and continuity is incredibly strong, and the attention to detail put into this world is great. When it comes to the actual level design, the game is still solid. Each level fits its respective setting/theme, with levels looping around on themselves, opening up shortcuts, being spatially navigated however the player sees fit, with the bosses being fought in the most interesting arenas every time, the actual level design is bliss.The story and plot of Dark Souls is grand and depressing, which adds to the oppressive atmosphere of hardship which the game gives off in all other aspects. I'm not going to spoil any of it here, but your goal is quite clear. In terms of lore, there are so many interesting stories in the lore and environment, about the characters and history and locations. The game a;sp manages to appeal to emotion so well, with nearly no melodrama, in a way that few other games do.The game is nearly perfect, but there are a few flaws, mainly brought about because the game was rushed out the door. A few great ideas for NPC interactions were scrapped, the online connectivity is imperfect due to a system with multiple servers managing multiple varying P2P connections, and a select few areas were clearly rushed to meet a deadline. Also, I'd say that some areas in the latter half of the game fail to keep the perfect pace maintained in the first half. But in the end, Dark Souls doesn't disappoint.Dark Souls is a modern classic. You absolutely MUST experience what this game offers, and play it until the very end of the storyline. It's an entirely unique RPG which is fully fleshed out in nearly every way.			"

												Excellent game!Note: This is an actual game, not a movie posing as a game. People get confused since this isn't your typical interactive movie. It will challenge you, which, is what games do.If you really want to, there are two built-in easy buttons.1) You can simply out level everything and power your way through bosses.2) Summon help. The AI was not designed for multiple players.Cons: The leveing system. FromSoftware should stop using a leveling system. The leveling idea is an anachromism left over from pencil & paper roleplaying games. It existed to make up for a lack of game play mechanics to differentiate inexperienced from experienced. Dark Souls has loads of game mechanics where you develop real skill and experience. Leveling also creates this limiting summoning experience. There's a level window for summoning and invading in each area. If your not within that level window, no Jolly Co-op for you!			"

And when you finally beat a boss after 20+ failures, you get an overwhelming feeling of accomplishment, it drives you to keep playing to find out what's next.  You will spend the whole game dying, learning from your mistakes, and feeling proud of yourself once you've mastered a fight and beat a boss.  All I can say is don't get discouraged, the game will get easier the more you play, trust me.  I used to suck and now im on NG+8 and I don't suck as much anymore. :D10/10 Dark Souls Best Game "

												Excellent game!Note: This is an actual game, not a movie posing as a game. People get confused since this isn't your typical interactive movie. It will challenge you, which, is what games do.If you really want to, there are two built-in easy buttons.1) You can simply out level everything and power your way through bosses.2) Summon help. The AI was not designed for multiple players.Cons: The leveing system. FromSoftware should stop using a leveling system. The leveling idea is an anachromism left over from pencil & paper roleplaying games. It existed to make up for a lack of game play mechanics to differentiate inexperienced from experienced. Dark Souls has loads of game mechanics where you develop real skill and experience. Leveling also creates this limiting summoning experience. There's a level window for summoning and invading in each area. If your not within that level window, no Jolly Co-op for you!			"

												First things first: This PC Edition is a horrible port. If you want it to be acceptable to play, you're gonna have to install some mods to fix it. Once you're past the issues with the port, though, oh is it marvelous.I have nothing but good things to say about the content of this game. I'll parrot what countless others have said before me: This game is really reward in the sense that you'll feel an immense satisfaction once you figure out how to overcome the various obstacles you'll meet. You will be challenged, but the feeling of completing those challenges is exactly what this game thrives on.			"

												This game is dated, slow, and can't run properly without installing a mod. That being said, this game great. It's a fun ARPG that puts your skills to the ultimate test. Yes, this game is hard. Yes, you will die. Yes, it's kinda the point. Every death you learn about the game. That boss that dunked you with his buttslam attack you didn't know he had? Now you know he has it. That well-hidden boulder trap that rolled down the stairs to crush you? Now you know where to find it, and when to run. The challenge is there, but so is the knowledge and learning to overcome it with your own power.Any RPG character you want to make, you can probably make it here. Poison Fist Monk? Spell slinging Magic Knight? Zweihander Champion of the Giants? Fire breathing, ninja flipping Dragon-Ninja hybrid? Check, check, check, and after grinding to get Dragon Scales, check!The visuals in the game are awesome. The enemy, level, and boss design feels unique and original in each area you visit. Blighttown is a toxic swamp of gloom and despair, Anor Londo is as prestigious and clean as it is controller breaking. The lighting bolt spitting snake people in Sen's Fortress. The greataxe wielding Taurus Demons of Lost Izalith. Gravelord Nito is terrifying, Ornstein and Smough are badass and powerful, and Artorias of the Abyss is one of the best bosses I've ever fought in a video game. They're all there to kill you and look cool doing so.The game rewards exploration as well. There are tons of side paths and secret areas that lead to weapon upgrades, new spells, and extra souls to level yourself with. If a boss is too hard, try another path in the area. Grind up some souls, maybe you'll find a new weapon to bash their brains in with!If the game really is too hard, try some Jolly Co-operation with a friend! I actually find the game more fun (and less brutal to my blood-pressure) when I tear down a naked-demon-spider-queen together with a friend.I've finished three playthroughs of the game (two co-op, one solo). My two major complaints are the lack of dual wielding and the game not running at 60fps (Dark Souls HD Remaster Fromsoft please please please). You CAN dual-wield weapons, but it's not very good in this game. Thankfully the sequel fixes that.TL;DR: Game is hard. Game is fun.			"

“I just wanted to see the plot” - kasuparuBRIGHT SOULS: Prepare to Smile Edition1. I am a casualI don’t play games because they are challenging. I want games to have the plot, thoughts or feelings for me. After 100 hours of play I discovered that Dark Souls is about overcoming own inability and impatience. Player character power depends on player’s ability and skill. You learn to be calm and try again. This reminded me of the race mission in Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven before the patch came out. I learned how to drive in 2 weeks. The patch lowered the difficulty, and added the Skip button. Casuls.2. “Do it with a RockBand controller, then we’ll talk”I played using mouse and keyboard. Developers of DSFix and DSMFix made it possible, huge thanks! It is much more comfortable for me, and allows to control the camera at the speed and precision I want to. I almost never used camera lock-on on an enemy. Lock-on makes you move slower, and the camera messes up if the target dashes or jumps. If there is anyone telling you to use the controller, disregard, and play the way you want.3. Check or FoldI did not like how the game increases stakes by promoting to be human. I was hollow most of the times, soloed all bosses. On the bright part, I was never invaded. I used guides a lot. Did not spoil anything for me, the game is still challenging.Top-3 hardest bosses (NG): Capra & Dogs, Ornstein & Smough, Artorias & RNG.Top-3 locations I hate: Tomb of the Giants, Blighttown, Duke’s Archives.I blazed through New Game+, enjoying New Game++ or another run.

												So I was walking around the burg when a van drove up next to me.  The driver stopped the vehicle and spoke to me, asked if I would like to earn some souls through what he called 'jolly co-operation'.  Being new, and in desperate need of the SL, I graciously accepted the offer.  He gave me some white key and told me to go around to the back of the van and unlock it.  Upon doing so, he suddenly burst out and attacked me.  I jumped away, trying to strike back, but the man easily parried my blow, riposting back with a hard fist to my gut.  Crumpling to my knees, he then kicked me down and rolled me onto my stomach, then proceeding to backstab me over and over again with his estus flask, arms outstretched above his head, shouting out PRAISE THE SUN! between ragged breaths.  It was the worst experience of my life.10/10			"

												Much have been said about this game's difficulty, and while it is hard, it's not impossible and is rarely unfair. It has a deep combat system that's precise, easy to pick up, but takes time to master. It's set in one of the best designed worlds in video games; Lordran. A mysterious and often beautiful world that at the same time can overwhelm you with fear. How the areas in this world interconnects is just mind-bending genius. There are so many ways to play this game that it never gets old no matter how many times you play through it. A masterwork.			"

												I played this game all the way through the first non-tutorial boss. this includes a big detour fighting some skeletons in a graveyard for about an hour before my friend told me that those things should have been killing me and I was supposed to go the other way. Basically the whole thing is a giant patience test, where the only way you ever die is by being greedy and wanting to end an encounter sooner by getting more hits in. When the only way you can lose is if you're anxious for the central gameplay to be over with sooner, there's something seriously wrong in the game's design.If this game is challenging, it's after the first boss, who I beat on the first try because he telegraphed everything like mad.If this game is atmospheric, it's after the first boss, because I just had generic medieval castle to go through.If this game is rich or deep in story, it's after the first boss (and an NPC who talks to you a while afterward), because I still have no idea what the series is about or how anything is supposed to work (including a lot of gameplay elements, for which there is no written information anywhere - wiki walks are fine for sandbox games but just annoying in a beat 'em up).If a game doesn't give me a reason to play it by the end of the first real area, then either it has nothing to offer, or it's stringing me along instead of respecting me as a customer. Either way DS1 was a huge letdown and I really don't get all the hype.In a word, the game is ""tedious"", and I'm amazed at how many people seem to confuse that with ""difficult"". It's difficult to force yourself to play in a way that will win, because you'd rather play in a way that seems fun but gets you killed. This is not the kind of difficult that a video game is supposed to be.Pick it up on sale as a casual time-killer but look elsewhere if you want a game that actually wants you to have fun. If you're looking for a challenge in the same general genre, I recommend Rogue Legacy.			"

												Before I begin, I would like to point out that I bought this game originally a couple years ago on Xbox 360, before I decided to get into PC gaming. I easily have over a thousand hours in this game on Xbox, and although I come back to this game often on PC now days, I have played it SO much that there is nothing new left for me. This game is, in my opinion, probably the BEST aRPG ever made.......EVER!There are many amazing things about this game, that I will list here:* The amount of character customization is staggering.* The fighting mechanics are arguably unmatched by ANY other game.* The story is very deep and full of lore. It is in NO WAY thrown in your face, in fact it's quite the opposite, in that you will need to literally search through every item description and NPC conversation, in order to figure out what is happening in this decrepit land known as Lordran.* Monster Design is arguably unmatched by any other game* After you have played through the game multiple times, Dark Souls' PvP adds a whole new layer of replayability to the game, easily adding many more hours of enjoyment to the game. * PvP is actually mixed in with PvE, in that other players can 'Invade' your world if certain conditions are met, and this greatly adds to the feeling of hopelessness and despair that the Developers have masterfully crafted into this game. There's so much more about this game that is literally too hard to put into words. I just ask that if you give this game a chance, (you better!) that you ACTUALLY give this game a chance. It will seem awkward, or hard at first. You will die, but if you can push through the first couple areas in this game, you will become addicted, I guarantee it. The only Cons that I see PC gamers taking issue with would be:* KB/M controls are broken, making a controller strongly recommended. However, there are mods that help fix this. * If you buy and install this game, it will NOT run correctly on any PC unless you also download and install DSFIX. [www.nexusmods.com] You MUST download and install this, and the 5 minutes it takes to do so fixes the game. * There are not many options for graphics in the game itself, however, exploring the .ini files included in DSFIX will provide any PC gamer with many of the graphics options that we are used to. Please do not take these cons as a reason not to buy and play this game, you would literally be missing out on the BEST aRPG ever made. Seriously, just buy it already! :D "

												One of the most intimidating games that i played so far. Dark Souls is an interesting game that its praised for its difficulty, but thats what makes it a great game, since overcoming those obstacles that the game puts you constantly makes you feel overwhelmingly satisfied. The most interesting thing about this game is its meaning since its very similar to real life and it has very interesting philosophical concepts. Its hard to pinpoint what truly is since every player experience it differently and its open for interpretation, and the story is hidden. Though the most common philosophy i can find is existentialism. By that i mean that not everything has meaning in Dark Souls. The player starts as a hollow, which is a state that a being is cursed and will not die and the Undead slowly lose their mind and consciousness. In order to become human they need humanity or else they delve deep into madness and pain. Humanity makes you into a human form but every time you reverse the hollowing you lose some part of your self (existence). For me the hollow-human state resembles a lot with Albert Camus ""The Myth of Sisyphus"", since how much you try to escape or in this case to die peacefully you can't, and then comes the realization of the absurd. Just like Sisyphus you are destined to progress through the world (Lordran) and discover some kind of meaning if there is any. Another thing about hollow state or rather Dark Souls itself is an allegory for depression. Dark Souls in general is a very depressive and sad game but the hollow state is a resemblance to it since the more you go hollow (feel pain, sadness, sorrow, misery and not doing anything about it) the more you lose your self in depression. The game makes a good example on how you should progress and fight this state of mind just like in real life to overcome all the difficulties and hard times that we are faced.The NPC's in this game have all really sad stories(and most of them die and you are unable to save them) which makes you feel very compassionate, and understand their suffering. To dwell more on my interpretation a good example is a NPC called Solaire which has a quest to find the Sun(The Sun as a metaphor for hope and meaning), but the more you progress in the game you will see that Solaire is losing his hope and will to fulfill his quest to find his Sun and slowly becomes hollow(you can save him but he is still affected). The story is hidden in Dark Souls and you have to read item descriptions to learn something about the lore of this game. The design is one of the best aspect in this game since everything is interconnected and that makes it to be a more immersive experience. Also the game has a PvE and PvP aspect hence becoming a human will activate the PvP and you might get invaded more often in your game world, but another interesting thing is that by playing the game your character feels lonely and everything is against you, helping someone in PvP for a boss or from an invader is very satisfactory and the game encourages cooperation more. Though the most interesting aspect i find for this game is that it doesn't make you important(rarely for a video game to do that), rather you are there like many others who ventured in that unwelcome world to find their meaning or to simply don't go hollow.This game was a present surprise and i really enjoyed it, i recommend it to everyone who wants to play a meaningful game. In short:Pros:+Gameplay +Design+Immersion+Difficulty+SoundCons:-Capped 30 fps (Needs DSFix)-For those using mouse (Needs dsmfix)			"

												Dark Souls will be remembered as a masterpiece that dared to go back to gaming’s roots and doing so perfectly. Away with regenerating health, minimaps and other forms of handholding. Lordran is an unforgiving world that wants you to take risk and learn from its brutal nature. The game will kill you… a lot. But as you die you will learn and eventually die a little less and overcome its obstacles giving you a fulfilling feeling of accomplishment. In other words Dark Souls is a hard game. But that’s due to its unforgiving nature that punishes every mistake if you don’t play by its rules. I played it on PS3 and even though the port has some obvious issues, I have enjoyed it just as much. This game is still a gem, and I can only encourage anyone to give it a fair try.  "

Review in one sentenceA very fun and challenging game, a one of its kind and a must-try.Gaming BackgroundI'm a PC gamer who predominantly plays FPS games, but has played a bit of MOBA and RTS too. Before I picked up Dark Souls, the only games I had ever played with a controller date back to the 6th generation consoles. I decided to give Dark Souls a go seeing as I finally got myself a controller and my friends were insisting I did.Index of this review Difficulty is Fun  Lore & Level Design A port of a console game Unnecessarily secretive Final wordsDifficulty is FunThough this game is notorious for its difficulty, it's challenging in a fair way; there isn't any RNG that determines whether you live or die. This game is hard because it's skill based.In a lot of RPGs, your character becomes stronger through leveling. Often this means you can both dish out and sustain orders of magnitude more damage than before. In Dark Souls, while you can definitely level your character to some extent, the real difference between you at level 1 and you at level 80 is raw skill. That's what makes this game so uniquely fun. You overcome the opponents not because your stats say you do; you overcome them because you've died to them a couple times and you now understand what you've been doing wrong all this time. This is where the phrase ""git gud"" comes from. Proof of this is that some players have been able to beat the game with a lvl 1 character, or without healing a single time.The always-on autosave feature in this game means that mistakes are permanent. Although this sounds hardcore, it's important to understand that dying is an important part of the game, and you lose less on death than in most games. Your ""souls"", which is both the in-game currency and the unit of XP you can use to level up and upgrade weapons, are dropped on the spot where you died.Lore & Level DesignDark Souls is made by FROM software, a Korean game developer, and it shows. The lore is akin to Asian folklore rather than the Greek, Norse, or Biblical stuff we're used too. This makes the lore unique and refreshing. Personally, the lore hasn't been able to rub off on me that much. It's hard to understand and hasn't really succeeded in giving me a sense of purpose, or part of something huge.That said, there's something uniquely captivating about Dark Souls. Its level design deserves an honorable mention, because it has somehow succeeded making 90% of the game contingent on each other. This means you can walk from the starting area to the rest of the world without loading screens or cutscenes. But it doesn't stop there; they have managed to meticulously interconnected their world in a brilliant way. Time and time again you will find yourself bewildered, exclaiming: ""This elevator leads back here!? Holy crap!""In another stroke of genius, they decided to leave music out of the game almost entirely. They mean to make the atmosphere feel solitary and desolate, which they've done a pretty decent job at. On top of all this, it looks pretty decent for a 2011 game.A port of a console gameIn this part I'll be talking about some technical downsides that I feel stem mostly from the fact that this game is a PC Port from a 2011 console game. By default the framerate is capped at 30fps. Popular community made mods allow you to bump this up to 60, but at certain costs. This is the type of game engine where the graphical framerate is linked to the game's calculations. This means that the game will behave slightly differently at 60fps, yuck.The online connectivity is can be finnicky and might require community mods to work to your liking as well. It's not the most stable or reliably built game in the world, basically.Unnecessarily secretiveMy biggest gripe with this game is how it doesn't bother explaining new players a lot of their complicated mechanics. Don't get me wrong! The fact that this came doesn't spam you with popups saying ""Press R2 to parry!"" is mostly a good thing. The game's minimalistic HUD and GUI contribute to its unique atmosphere, but this is a double-edged blade.It takes most players a good while to figure out what Humanity is, how it works, what the number in your top bar means and what it means to be hollowed. To tell you the truth I still only understand how it works, but not why it works. I could go on and on listing bits of information or entire game mechanics that remain poorly-, mis-, or even unexplained throughout the game. This would all be fine in 1999, where the kid next door would tell you how to unlock a cool sword. But alas, we're in the era where extensive libraries of this type of information is at your fingertips. Sadly, at times this game almost beckons you to whip up the wiki, because decisions are permanent and you might not want to make any mistakes.The best way to play this game is by having an enthousiastic friend you can approach for specific questions, but will not tell you all of the ins and outs of the game.Summary and Final Words- Very enjoyable and rewarding gameplay- Looks decent, with great character & level design- Unique and myserious, sometimes to a faultNo matter what kind of player you are, you would be doing yourself a disservice by not at least trying this game. If you have any comments, questions, or critiques, feel free to add me on Steam. I'll even help you with the game if you want.			"

												Can be unforgiving at times but is never unfair. Feels pretty rewarding when you beat it and has very good armor and weapon design. If you like non-linear and challenging games that don't constantly hold your hand and allow for many secrets to be found through exploration then this is for you.One of the best games I have ever played, wouldn't recommend it without a gamepad though, it controls horribly when played with mouse and keyboard.

												If the horror stories are to be believed, Dark Souls is a punishing game that only those with infinite patience will ever see the end of. As with so many legends, there’s a grain of truth to these claims that’s been exaggerated out of proportion; yes, Dark Souls is a merciless beast whose demanding nature will put off a lot of people. But is it insurmountable for the average gaming enthusiast? I’d argue no.After a cryptic intro that raises more questions than it answers, Dark Souls places you in a prison cell armed with only a broken sword. On top of that, your character died before you even had a say in their life. All this sets the tone for an adventure that pulls no punches, and by the time you find a decent weapon you’ll have already run into some lethal creatures. But there’s nothing inherently unreasonable about the opening segment of gameplay; you’re told what buttons do what, then given a weapon and left to figure out the most efficient means of killing stuff with it. The result is a game that trains you to approach new areas with caution, never underestimate an opponent, and always have an escape route if things go ♥♥♥♥-up. It’s an intriguing hybrid of old and new game design, sans most of the cryptic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your nostalgia doesn’t let you remember.The combat is the dominant gameplay feature, of course, and I don’t hesitate to call it some of the best I’ve seen: a dagger feels completely different from a giant hammer, and neither can be called definitively better than the other. Dodging attacks and getting backstabs is a legitimate tactic, but so is tanking damage and punching through blocks with heavy weapons, not to mention the abundance of magical options I was too scared to try for a long time. It’s a strategic experience that something like Skyrim can barely dream of unless modded up the wazoo.Speaking of strategy, Dark Souls is one of precious few games that actually give meaningful penalties for death. Every time you die, you lose your accumulated points and have precisely one chance to retrieve them. If you ♥♥♥♥ that up, the points are gone forever. It’s harsh, to be sure, but checkpoints are never obscenely far apart and I learned early on that if you know your downfall is imminent, you might as well try and die in a spot that can be reached easily. It’s just another system to use to your advantage and will only screw you over if you push your luck: know when to retreat and spend your points, rather than lose them deep in enemy territory. That the entire world respawns when you use a checkpoint is bizarre at first, yet makes a lot of sense to me; sitting at a bonfire becomes a tactical decision, since it provides safety at the cost of undoing your progress elsewhere. And as crushing as it is to lose your hard-earned points, those moments are also the best times to throw yourself at a boss or speed through a tough area to grab items.Navigating the metroidvania landscape is the other great art of Dark Souls. Locales are varied (along with their inhabitants) and frequently bigger than they first appear, overflowing with hidden loot, shortcuts and even optional bosses. Backtracking does become a nuisance beyond a certain point, and the teleport option is hard-earned, but the only places I truly dislike are the handful suffering from framerate dips (on consoles) and finicky platform segments. Other than that, I find the game’s setup enjoyable, not least due to its role in one of Dark Souls’ most surprising triumphs: storytelling.There’s a wealth of lore to be found in subtle background details and item descriptions, and it really felt like I was piecing together the world’s history from the clues left behind. The slow realisation of just how boned the land is fits perfectly with the sense of dread pervading the gameplay, and even your character’s ability to rise after death is contextually justified. For a game that could’ve relied solely on its combat, I find it doubly impressive that Dark Souls manages to have a memorable world, and with a minimalistic style that’s refreshing in an industry whose attempts at storytelling often rely on overwritten cutscenes.Another remarkable aspect of Dark Souls is the online integration: players can leave messages that randomly pop up in people’s worlds. Some are helpful, some are amusing, and some are outright lies. Then you have a clunky but workable co-op mechanic, along with the danger of being invaded by other guys whenever you de-zombify yourself. The whole arrangement is seemingly unique to the Souls franchise, and has created a profound sense of community while also reminding you that nobody can be trusted.At its core, Dark Souls represents a raw yet fair challenge where death is almost never anyone’s fault but the player’s. And while your initial perception may be one of cruel chaos, dig deep enough and you’ll find a sense of order. By almost any measure, I think Dark Souls must be called an impressive piece of work. The only question is whether you’ll enjoy an action game which requires you to be methodical and treat every fight like a matter of life and death. Unlike some parts of the fanbase, I understand that it’s possible to not like something for reasons other than sucking at it.			"

												Dark Souls is probably one of my all-time favorite games. It's challenging but fair, features immersive gameplay, interesting lore, a deep combat system, and there are so many viable combat styles that you could play through this game over and over again without it getting stale.This being said, it's not a perfect game. There are some bosses and areas in the second half of the game that are blatantly unfinished, and the netcode can be iffy when it comes to latency, however the good aspects greatly outweigh the poor ones.

												When I first saw Dark Souls I thought that this game is exactly for me but when everybody starts saing ""it's super hard"" I gave up on this game. Some years later I said to myself that I should try it. I tryed it and I loved it.. I LOVED that feeling when I beat hard boss. I LOVED that feeling when i died by my fault. I LOVED the lore. I LOVED the game music. I LOVED Dark Souls environment. I LOVED pvp. I LOVED DARK SOULS!!

												You will loathe yourself for playing this game. Let me explain: it is the most sadisticly addicting games ever created. Let me furher explain: This game will test your skill as a gamer and you patience as a human being. Its challenges are numerous and seemingly endless. You will die and die and die again then, probably, hurl your remote (or keyboard, I'd highly recomend a remote though) across what ever space you are playing in and swear that you will never play it again... But then like Rihanna you come crawling back begging for more. The worst thing about all of this is that even though it will make you want to rip your teeth out, you'll love every second of it. The feeling of finally figuring out how to beat a challenge is so amazing at times you might feel like throwing a small party in celebration, and the rush you get when beat the game (your tormentor for the past many hours of game play) is even more so. You will be hard pressed to find a gaming experience as thrilling and rewarding as sDark Souls, as soon as you start playing it will become your most hated addiction.			"

												One of the most serious RPGs I've played in the recent decade, especially in terms of atmosphere. After the (initially) steep learning curve there's tons of fun and despair to be found in this game (as absurd as it might sound :D). Highly recommended.Also: Not to be approached lightly.			"

												I deleted my old review because I gave it unjustly more than likely due to rage. I've played a good amount, the part i was stuck on was the Tarus Demon and the part after that where it involved a knight and some random hallowed in a pincer attack. After taking a break for many months and then retrying it. I've progressed to the first bell. I don't know what the other reviews state when they ran into bugs, problems and etc. I have an unmodded version and it runs just fine. Sure the mouse/keyboard should be fixed but to be honest I don't mind using a 360 controller. Regardless here is my review.The game will in fact not hold your hand. The will game anally ravage you over and over again over a picket fence. The game is unforgiving. The game will destroy you.But do you know what the good thing about it? Every time I finally over come my rage, calmed down adn thought about it. Thought about how I could improve. Thought about how I was doing something wrong. The more times I tackled it. I got better and better at parrying especially when I went to kill Havel. I felt pride and joy. I feel so happy and better than I even got to the first bell. Now supposely that was the ""easy"" part of the game as my friends have stated but you know what? I am waiting for the challenges. I played all day on 12/16/2013 perhaps I only made it pass the butterfly moth, the belfry gargoyles and even rang the first bell.I will tell you the game is very hard but can easily overcome with patience and it pays off. You'll feel very accomplished at every victory. If you like a challenge then please get this game and play it. I await for DS 2.The only part I don't get is why you have to follow the laws of physics(aka if you use a long sword and hit a wall while attacking your sword bounces off and your attack doesn't land) but yet the AI can ignore it. Sure it makes it difficult especially since the AI for basic minions can be very stupid and I can see why they would set them to ignore it but perhaps they'll make better AI and you can use your terrian to stop a black knight from swinging while you keep prodding at him or even that he choses not to swing but prod at you rapier style instead of full blow swings. But regardless this part doesn't matter because I usually get a spear and one sword on hand so I can switch as needed rather it's a narrow hallway or not a narrow hallway.Beat the game.... Kinda disappointed at few bosses and kinda disappointed at the ending.... Still a good challenge and I still enjoyed it.			"

												It may be tough, and it may make you cry, but between the scenery and the difficulty, it is a beautiful and challenging game. The detail on the buildings, Anor Londo specifically, is to die for (since the things in the place might kill you anyway!). It is a tough game, for sure, and should not be sat down with while in a mental state that says ""I will be good at this, better than anybody else, and I will beat it."" You will more than likely end up frustrated in the end. The pc port is iffy, albeit playable (but makes the game a lot harder), but with a controller it's equal to playing the console version of the game. The major downside to this game is that when trying to either invade or summon, it is a hit and miss. You can either get lucky and summon/invade on the first try, or anything that isn't lucky, and be sitting for 30 minutes to an hour trying to summon your friends. (I'm not sure if this also happens when trying to invade.)Overall, the game is great and I can't wait for the second one, which will have better ports!			"

												This game is not beginner friendly and most new players are going to hit a brick wall for a few hours. But, once you start to get a grip on the game, it's very rewarding. It's an amazingly deep and complex RPG that rewards exploraration and skill. I actaully tried this game many months ago and had really bad first impressions because of the difficulty. But, I decided I really wanted to experience this game, so I picked it up again. One thing to note is this a really bad PC port, but at least it doesn't have GFWL anymore. Now, you can unlock the framerate without getting kicked off of GFWL. I highly recommend getting at least DSFix. Lastly, please use a controller for this game. If you're not going to use a controller, you're better off not playing it all to be honest.			"

												What can I say about Dark Souls that hasn't been said before?It's fantastic. It's unrelenting, challenging, stimulating and at times, incredibly frustrating. But all of those things are precisely why the game is so great. It doesn't hold your hand. It doesn't let you save whenever you want. It forces you to think and use reasoning. Instead of relying on the game mechanics to save you, you must learn to use it to your advantage. Once you take control, it's an incredibly rewarding experience unmatched by most modern action RPGs. This game will go down in history along with the likes of Elder Scrolls, Final Fantasy and Legend of Zelda.			"

												Dark Souls é um RPG Dungeon Crawler Hardcore de Hack and Slash de uma jobabildade excecional. O design e arte dos inimigos e masmorras bem como o seu combate são as estrelas deste jogo. Que é díficil mas justo, com um ambiente de fantasia medieval profundo, encantador e mortal. Onde a morte nos espera em cada canto mas que mesmo assim nos convece a ficar lá. É um dos melhores jogos do género. Possuí também uma história mistoriosa e complexa mas coerente e muito bem feita (que tem uma ligação forte ás sequelas). E também um modo de Multijogador (Co-Op e PvP) bastante divertidos.Simplesmente um clássico e uma peróloa de jogo.Dark Souls é suberbo, profundo, encantador, perigoso, dícifil, justo, poderoso, glorioso, coerente, inesquecivel, indispensável e épico!

												With 400+ hours put into the PC version and over 1000+ hours put into the PS3 version I have decided to write a review of Dark SoulsIt's a game developed by From Software who also created Demon Souls and Dark Souls 2. However Dark souls 2 didn't have the same team as Demon Souls and the first Dark Souls, that team instead went on to create Bloodborne. The team behind Demon Souls, Dark Souls, and Bloodborne have planned on creating a third installment of the Dark Souls series and will be released in the near future.Dark Souls probably has one of the heaviest lores of all possible games released. In addition to the lore being heavy it's not even fully explained to the player, instead you must discover this information by reading descriptions and understand the meaning inbetween each area and uncover all of the information behind it. There is many theories when it comes to this game but you should probably search for the information on wikipedias or from YouTubers if you're interested in that.Many people describe this game as a very difficult game with a huge learning curve but I disagree. Yes it's not an easy game however it can be mastered very efficiently pretty quickly. What you must learn is how to roll, block, parry, manage weight (distribute weapons and armor efficiently to make yourself agile but strong enough to kill your opponents), and simply put: not die. The game teaches you the mechanics early on but later never gives hints on what to do because you must teach yourself how to succeed. The sense of victory is what makes this game wonderful. Say you're stuck fighting a certain boss, you simply cannot beat it and you're close to giving up and lay the game aside. Though you have not given up completely, so you give it one more shot. You make it to the fighting area and you remember the countless attempts of you failing. You remember what killed you and you figure out how to avoid it. The boss puts out its patterns and you avoid it. You land a blow. Patiently you wait for another opening. Another blow. You fight for what seems an eternity however you quickly notice it's close to dying. Patiently you wait for your last blow to be struck. You swing and you hear the beast screech and fade away. The feeling after you kill what had been troubling you is overwhelming in this game however since I have put so much time and effort into this game the effects have begun to wane but I remember it clearly.So to sum it up, the game isn't super difficult and can be mastered very quickly with a mind of the willing to learn, it has tons of lore which makes the game deep. The bosses and areas have loads of variants and are all interesting in their own way.So yes I recommend that you get Dark Souls and experience it.Note: Please do not buy this game for the purpose of playing with a friend.Yes it does have co-op and PvP but actually playing with your friend is a difficult process which usually requires tons of waiting or modified files.

												This is a game that any gamer should atleast try. It brings a unique approach to difficulty in modern gaming. The best way I can describe the game is that it will break you down and rebuild you as a player. It has no room for those who wish to be catered to for it has no map and gives very little hints in terms of where you need to go or what you have to do for encounters so YOU HAVE TO THINK which is always good for you. : )			"

												If the horror stories are to be believed, Dark Souls is a punishing game that only those with infinite patience will ever see the end of. As with so many legends, there’s a grain of truth to these claims that’s been exaggerated out of proportion; yes, Dark Souls is a merciless beast whose demanding nature will put off a lot of people. But is it insurmountable for the average gaming enthusiast? I’d argue no.After a cryptic intro that raises more questions than it answers, Dark Souls places you in a prison cell armed with only a broken sword. On top of that, your character died before you even had a say in their life. All this sets the tone for an adventure that pulls no punches, and by the time you find a decent weapon you’ll have already run into some lethal creatures. But there’s nothing inherently unreasonable about the opening segment of gameplay; you’re told what buttons do what, then given a weapon and left to figure out the most efficient means of killing stuff with it. The result is a game that trains you to approach new areas with caution, never underestimate an opponent, and always have an escape route if things go ♥♥♥♥-up. It’s an intriguing hybrid of old and new game design, sans most of the cryptic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your nostalgia doesn’t let you remember.The combat is the dominant gameplay feature, of course, and I don’t hesitate to call it some of the best I’ve seen: a dagger feels completely different from a giant hammer, and neither can be called definitively better than the other. Dodging attacks and getting backstabs is a legitimate tactic, but so is tanking damage and punching through blocks with heavy weapons, not to mention the abundance of magical options I was too scared to try for a long time. It’s a strategic experience that something like Skyrim can barely dream of unless modded up the wazoo.Speaking of strategy, Dark Souls is one of precious few games that actually give meaningful penalties for death. Every time you die, you lose your accumulated points and have precisely one chance to retrieve them. If you ♥♥♥♥ that up, the points are gone forever. It’s harsh, to be sure, but checkpoints are never obscenely far apart and I learned early on that if you know your downfall is imminent, you might as well try and die in a spot that can be reached easily. It’s just another system to use to your advantage and will only screw you over if you push your luck: know when to retreat and spend your points, rather than lose them deep in enemy territory. That the entire world respawns when you use a checkpoint is bizarre at first, yet makes a lot of sense to me; sitting at a bonfire becomes a tactical decision, since it provides safety at the cost of undoing your progress elsewhere. And as crushing as it is to lose your hard-earned points, those moments are also the best times to throw yourself at a boss or speed through a tough area to grab items.Navigating the metroidvania landscape is the other great art of Dark Souls. Locales are varied (along with their inhabitants) and frequently bigger than they first appear, overflowing with hidden loot, shortcuts and even optional bosses. Backtracking does become a nuisance beyond a certain point, and the teleport option is hard-earned, but the only places I truly dislike are the handful suffering from framerate dips (on consoles) and finicky platform segments. Other than that, I find the game’s setup enjoyable, not least due to its role in one of Dark Souls’ most surprising triumphs: storytelling.There’s a wealth of lore to be found in subtle background details and item descriptions, and it really felt like I was piecing together the world’s history from the clues left behind. The slow realisation of just how boned the land is fits perfectly with the sense of dread pervading the gameplay, and even your character’s ability to rise after death is contextually justified. For a game that could’ve relied solely on its combat, I find it doubly impressive that Dark Souls manages to have a memorable world, and with a minimalistic style that’s refreshing in an industry whose attempts at storytelling often rely on overwritten cutscenes.Another remarkable aspect of Dark Souls is the online integration: players can leave messages that randomly pop up in people’s worlds. Some are helpful, some are amusing, and some are outright lies. Then you have a clunky but workable co-op mechanic, along with the danger of being invaded by other guys whenever you de-zombify yourself. The whole arrangement is seemingly unique to the Souls franchise, and has created a profound sense of community while also reminding you that nobody can be trusted.At its core, Dark Souls represents a raw yet fair challenge where death is almost never anyone’s fault but the player’s. And while your initial perception may be one of cruel chaos, dig deep enough and you’ll find a sense of order. By almost any measure, I think Dark Souls must be called an impressive piece of work. The only question is whether you’ll enjoy an action game which requires you to be methodical and treat every fight like a matter of life and death. Unlike some parts of the fanbase, I understand that it’s possible to not like something for reasons other than sucking at it.			"

												Dark Souls.... doesnt the name just make you cringe?! Well, it shouldn't! People will play games forever, whether it's marbles or Dark souls, but either way, somebody is gonna rage quit! some people will play a video game just to 'Beat' it. However, this game does it a little different.... instead of giving you a choice of beating it or not, it decides for you - and it's never in your favour! This game beats you.... to a pulp.... then runs you over in it's car.... and gets it's mates to help beat the crap out of you.... not even exaggerating a little bit! But why should that scare you off? It's just a game right?Wrong, ♥♥♥♥♥♥!This is more than a game, it's an achievement, an accomplishment, a challenge and a test for all gamers out there!This game is not reccomended for those who are prone to rage quitting, and it's definately not for the faint at heart!'But what's the point if im just going to die all the time?'Shut up, you're adopted! let me tell you what's in store for you!The rewards may be a few souls and a weapon.... but thats in game! Inside your head you have just played the same part of the game about 500 times, and you've died equally. You were about to walk away when you gave it one more shot! finally, you got the SOB down to its last bit of health and you stabbed it right in the ♥♥♥♥♥! You stood with your head held high when you finally killed that boss and you made it known that you owned it and you had intercourse with it's mother while shouting at the screen. The satisfaction levels are over 9000, and you could even say that you smiled after so much anger and frustration.... and trust me when i say that THAT very smile feels amazing!this game will take you a LONG time to finish..... the first area..... let alone the whole game! but it's not about time, its about how much you want it! it's about your desire to accomplish something! You can say to your weaker friends 'Hey look noob, i finished Dark Souls! what did you do in the last 600 hours of your life?'having said that, this game IS NOT a waste of time at all! if you play for an hour and dont even get to a new bonfire (Checkpoint [Very Rare]) dont decide it's no use, just keep trying.... there are more secrets in this game the illuminati dont even know whats going on!! Look for shortcuts, try new areas dont get caught in a rut!So yeah, thats what i think anyway! please consider playing this game (If you can get it working on steam [Need a games for windows account]) Dark Souls..... You are worthy of nothing less...9.3/10Dylan Burton			"

												Your girlfriend might think ""The Notebook"" is emotional.  Maybe it is, but it is not even close to being as emotional as Dark Souls.  For while that movie might make her want to cry, Dark Souls will make you run an emotional gauntlet that you have not known since you're early days.  You'll want to throw your controller and scream at your sceen in anger at times.  Then, later, you'll feel your heart racing and breathe a heavy sigh of relief at what obstacle you've finally overcome.  You'll want to tell you're friends, and if they've been through it, they'll know what you're talking about.Don't think for a minute that all of this is because the game is impossibly hard.  On a scale of 1 to ""Nintendo Hard"", it's probably a 7, if that.  The feelings that come from this game stem from one fact; every death is your fault.  You will know when you tried to block a hit you should have dodged, or when you rolled a second too late in the wrong direction.  The combat is slow and seems clunky at first,  Basically, whenever you attack, or roll, or do anything, you had better mean it.  This is Castlevania 1 stuff right here.  Every button you press has a consequence, and building this discipline is the first hurdle of the game.The first thing players might notice is the lack of a tutorial, save for a few very brief messages scrawled on the ground detailing the game's controls.  You are on your own for everything else, and this is crucial to the game's design.  The first boss will probably kill you a few times while you fumble around.  Soon you'll be able to kill him in your sleep.  There is no voiceover giving you hints and alerts.  There are no markers, or flashing enemy bits detailing weak spots.  Experimentation and persistance are key, and the repeated failures make the experience more memorable.  Who remembers any boss from a game that they beat the first time by running at it and attacking it until it dies?  My Steam Library is full of games that I blew through once and couldn't tell you much about what happened.  I was happy when I played them, but they didn't leave me with anything when they were over.I've never beat a game and had the immediate desire to start it over.  But Dark Souls gives that experience because it dares you to come up with a way to perfect your style.  It is easy at first to make a trash character who is useless.  But even if that character doesn't make it to the end, his experiences keep going with the player, who uses what he learns to get even further.  Of course, a bad character can still make it to the end in the hands of a skilled player, and leveling is totally optional.  Imagine if in Final Fantasy a skilled player could win the game at level 1.  In Dark Souls, it is difficult, but possible.I'll wrap up by saying that the presentation is great as well.  The landscapes are varied and all are memorable in their own way.  The settings have such a personality to them that just saying the word ""Blighttown"" might cause someone to nod and give you an empathetic grunt.  Most areas have no music, and that is perfect.  It's a lonely game, and the echoes of your characters footsteps add to that effect.  When there is music, generally in bossfights, it is top notch.  There is a story, and it is very good.  The story has a sort of Mythical feel, dealing with immortality, undeath, ancient lords, and lost cities.  Thorough players will be rewarded with tidbits of story from NPCs, item descriptions, and visual cues in the setting, and the player will be left to piece together much of the story for themself.  Multiplayer is definately unique, if not a bit flawed, made frustrating by the fact that high level players can weasel their way into low level areas.  It fits the uncaring nature of the game.  Welcome to Dark Souls.  Prepare to Die...I feel the need to bring up the fact that the PC Port is not the greatest.  Though Games for Windows Live will soon not be an issue, the mod utility ""DSFIX"" will be very helpfully in covering the port's shorcomings, from help with controls to resolution fixes.  Some of these fixes are pretty taxing on your hardware, so read the guides if you use them.  Also, a controller is pretty much a must in my opinion, this game was not designed for mouse and keyboard.  I used a Playstation 2 controller (seriously) with a 5 dollar adaptor and it worked just fine.			"

												 The game is a tough one, that is for sure. But it is very satisfying to do well in this game. Once you get the hang of it, you begin to develope playstyle (mine being run like a wuss and avoid all enemies) then the fun begins. Souls of alternate realities invading your world to wreck your day and others stopping to say hi and help. This game is frustratingly fun.			"

												The most challenging and jolly rewarding game you will play in a long time, Dark Souls combines the dark fantasy theme that gamers have always known and loved with the chalenge that only FromSoftware could get away with while still creating a successfully selling game. With a vaste open world to explore filled with wonderful scenery to gawk at while falling from a cliff while trying to roll away from a flock of hollows, jolly co-operation, a large variety of bosses and mobs alike which force you to adapt how you play in order for them to be mastered and npcs who will steal your heart (in a good way) and guide you on your path as the chosen undead, or not...The only real downside of this game is the inaccessabily of the story, even though this is the direction FromSoft were trying to go with the game, forcing you to uncover the story for yourself rather than shoving it down your throat, this just doesn't work for most. However when uncovered (i suggest youtube for those of you without the time to dig deep enough yourself) the story will pull at your heartstrings and make you question the things you have done an the things you must do aswell as boggling your brain.All in all Dark Souls is a wonderful game well worth the $19.99 you will pay for it and I would recommend it to anyone with the patience to endure it. If only more games could be so grossly incandescent.			"

												Well, I think you already know the formula of this game: Die, die, die, die, finally killing the boss. But this game is more than it looks like. The storytelling is silent, you need to get the information by looking at item descriptions, the bosses are truly amazing (O&S with Kalameet are my favs.) and the tense fights are jaw-droppingly awesome. The PC port, is the only thing what can hold back people, but don't worry, the players have found the solution for this problem.

												Dark Souls.... doesnt the name just make you cringe?! Well, it shouldn't! People will play games forever, whether it's marbles or Dark souls, but either way, somebody is gonna rage quit! some people will play a video game just to 'Beat' it. However, this game does it a little different.... instead of giving you a choice of beating it or not, it decides for you - and it's never in your favour! This game beats you.... to a pulp.... then runs you over in it's car.... and gets it's mates to help beat the crap out of you.... not even exaggerating a little bit! But why should that scare you off? It's just a game right?Wrong, ♥♥♥♥♥♥!This is more than a game, it's an achievement, an accomplishment, a challenge and a test for all gamers out there!This game is not reccomended for those who are prone to rage quitting, and it's definately not for the faint at heart!'But what's the point if im just going to die all the time?'Shut up, you're adopted! let me tell you what's in store for you!The rewards may be a few souls and a weapon.... but thats in game! Inside your head you have just played the same part of the game about 500 times, and you've died equally. You were about to walk away when you gave it one more shot! finally, you got the SOB down to its last bit of health and you stabbed it right in the ♥♥♥♥♥! You stood with your head held high when you finally killed that boss and you made it known that you owned it and you had intercourse with it's mother while shouting at the screen. The satisfaction levels are over 9000, and you could even say that you smiled after so much anger and frustration.... and trust me when i say that THAT very smile feels amazing!this game will take you a LONG time to finish..... the first area..... let alone the whole game! but it's not about time, its about how much you want it! it's about your desire to accomplish something! You can say to your weaker friends 'Hey look noob, i finished Dark Souls! what did you do in the last 600 hours of your life?'having said that, this game IS NOT a waste of time at all! if you play for an hour and dont even get to a new bonfire (Checkpoint [Very Rare]) dont decide it's no use, just keep trying.... there are more secrets in this game the illuminati dont even know whats going on!! Look for shortcuts, try new areas dont get caught in a rut!So yeah, thats what i think anyway! please consider playing this game (If you can get it working on steam [Need a games for windows account]) Dark Souls..... You are worthy of nothing less...9.3/10Dylan Burton			"

It takes a few deaths getting used to, but once you see that's what makes this game great and is how it teaches you, you'll always want to play more.Unfotunately the games main downfall is the lack of time the developers put into finishing this port to PC, so it's VERY IMPORTANT that you install DSfix to resolve the graphical and game issues. You'll be very glad you did. DSfix doesn't affect any capabilities of the game besides improving just about everything and even the delevopers even recomend it. Get it now!			"

												You awaken in a prison cell, hollowed and stripped of all humanity. You are an Undead, a cursed being trapped within the purgatory that is the Undead Asylum. Who you are and what brought you here are a mystery. The curse makes one forget it seems. As you break out of your cell messages written with soapstone start to appear. Slowly you will make your way through the Asylum, heeding the cautionary tales written by those who came before you. You will seek comfort in the warm embrace of the bonfire, an oasis amidst the rubble and death. Before long however, you will be faced with insurmountable odds in the form of the Asylum Demon. This is where you will most likely die. However death isn't the end of things, you're an Undead after all. Soon you'll feel the warm embrace of the bonfire once more. At this point you will try again, again and again. Until at long last you slay the beast and are liberated from this place. This is where Dark Souls starts and your journey begins. That journey will be beautiful and engaging. The world you'll explore, the characters you'll meet are all lovingly crafted and will stick with you until long after. The gameplay is brutally unforgiving and exceptionally rewarding. Every bit of progress you'll make in this game will be a personal victory. It is incredibly captivating, challenging and simply put fun. If you are looking for a lengthy hands off narrative with compelling, tense action orientated D&D style gameplay. Then do yourself a favor, pick this game up and praise the sun!That being said, it is not without it's faults. The port of this game is sloppy to say the least. Natively it runs at sub par resolutions and has it's gamelogic locked at 30fps. This means that out of the box this game is practically unplayable for most PC gamers. Luckily there are ways to fix these glaring issues in the form of DSFix. (V2.4 at the time of this writing) It is a third party injector created for Dark Souls Prepare To Die Edition that enables you to alter render settings at the engine level.All in all I can not recommend Dark Souls enough.Praise the sun!

												Dark Souls was a game that took me very much by surprise.Being peripherally aware of it around release as something focussed on brutality in its gameplay and its violence; I waved it off at the time as just being another typical 'AAA' title of being all flash and little substance.But was I ever wrong!There's no denying, of course, that Dark Souls  does  revel in difficulty and carnage - but what I actually found was something far, far more enlightened than that.The variety and handling of the gameplay (and I say this having played it only once through,) are immediately to be appreciated themselves.  Every weapon and piece of armour, with few exceptions, feels like it has its place and usefulness.  Every concept of class progression (while still being a fluid and malleable system, as per Elder Scrolls) feels rewarding to further your abilities and play-style.  The multiplayer, even being as indirect a system as it is without any means of direct communication, is a novel and exciting experience.  And the notorious boss fights and difficulty remain exciting and engaging even as they are kicking your ♥♥♥... repeatedly.  It is an 'action RPG', but one that challenges you to be quite deliberate and exacting in your methods.In terms of media, the game is an incredibly lovely experience to bask in as well.  Though the drive to look for the next monster to kill or quest to complete (or death to avoid) can push you along at a fairly brisk pace; if you take the time to admire your surroundings, every region of the game world is filled to the brim with character.  The amount of variety in said monsters is no less astonishing either, mark you, as everywhere you venture will have at least one creature that will give you pause to admire how cool/gruesome/terrifying a work the artists of this game have concocted.  The music meanwhile provides the right amount of background ambience to fill in the regions and add excitement to your challenges without coming across as too contrived or fantastical, always feeling very fitting to the dark and dangerous ambience of the game.  Both of these, perhaps best yet, are blended together beautifully in the game's masterfully done cutscenes.  The pacing, the camera placement, the description of them are truly highwater marks of cinematography in games.If there's a shortcoming to cite about this game, for me, it is the story's own lack of exposure.  After the opening cinematics and character creation set you off on the right foot - you suddenly feel like you've been thrust into a world filled with rich creative lore, but which will only ever show itself in snippets at a time.  I will entirely advocate the value and the power of games leaving things to the player's imagination, and cannot help but frown when a fictional universe will try to introduce itself too strongly or comprehensively; but this is one feels like it's just teasing us!  I found myself reading every item's description and hunting out every last piece of dialogue to try to understand the world going on around me, but it mostly felt like it was lurking just outside of my reach.  You're left with the distant feeling that your actions are meaningful, but are rarely quite sure why.The ambiguity extends to some of the gameplay itself as well; and while the spirit of the game is very much in the trial-and-error of learning your way through boss fights and other challenges through death after death - how you would be expected to know to head to a given area next or meet up again with another character at a potentially previous location - or what how the character stats, item upgrades, and scaling really come into the game... is something that puzzles me.  Without the knowledge from public wikis and forums, or at least an informed friend; I reckon that this game would be otherwise nigh impossible to comprehensively explore and experience if left your own devices.Nevertheless; such criticism is more than overshowed by the game's strengths - and it remains an incredibly immersive experience, even if and when you wish you knew just a little bit more of what was going on.  To be able to offer exciting and rewarding gameplay; a gorgeous artistic backdrop; *and* thought-provoking characters and themes (the ones you get a look at, anyway) - Dark Souls is a thoroughly worthwhile experience, and my strongest recommendations go with it.

												This game is one of my favorite games and does many things extremely well, but does suffer from some flaws that will cause many people to miss out on experiencing the game.My criticism is that the PC port of this game is awful and you must resort to outside fixes to make the game playable. The DSFix mod and the recent switch from GFWL to Steam for the online component of the game both allow you to play the game, but shouldn't be necessary in the first place. There are also some glaring flaws in the game design that are an added annoyance in the already frustrating game (looking at you Bed of Chaos).Now for everything that I love about Dark Souls. The amount of work that FromSoft put into the level design is astounding. Everything just seems to flow perfectly, your eyes are drawn to (or away from) things that you are supposed to find. Unlocking a shortcut or finding a new path can sometimes stop you in your tracks and blow your mind. The characters, the lighting, and the scenery all come together to immerse you in the world, every playthrough I find myself pausing from time to time to just stop and gaze at everything around me. You get the sense that you’re a part of something so much bigger than yourself (literally in a lot of ways). The lore is deep and rich, but you only scratch the surface in game, everything else is mystery or up to your interpretation. The frustration and feeling of accomplishment that follows. Getting stuck in an area and subsequently beating it is so satisfying.I can only recommend Dark Souls to someone that is not only willing to face the difficulty of playing the game, but also the difficulty of making the game playable.Good luck to all the Chosen Undead out there!Praise the Sun!   \[T]/			"

												Dark Souls, like Demon's Souls before it, treats the player to hostility not seen in video games since players started expecting to see the end. Dark Souls is not hard, simply fair - it even lets you come back an infinite number of times to try again. Enemies and their location decide the tactics a player should use, infinitely adding to their survivability. The game does not want you to win.When you win however, it accepts defeat.There are no Resident Evil style ""IT SURVIVED #OMG fight it AGAIN"" moments.They even held back the JRPG ""You gotta die"" thing, with one exception. They replaced them with ""You're not going to survive if you don't pay attention"" tests.Atmosphere-wise Dark Souls is a Survival Horror pretending to be a Fantasy RPG. Sure, it's got Fantasy elements, but they're all warped into a world where you, an Undead (marked with the ability to return to life at the last spot he sat down for a bit) are charged with deciphering a unreliably narrated world filled with plot and counter plot, where metaphors are blurred with reality. You're even perpetually attacked by alternate versions of yourself who hunt you for sport.On the negative side, the PC port was put together by taking the Xbox disc, grinding into thin paste and feeding down an ethernet cable. The button promts are still Xbox! PC controls are so badly implemented it's like they only playtested with the 19 fingered Chernobyl Bloodsucker that designed it. Get a controller, it does not matter which kind. You'll need a third party program to use a PS3 controller though.You'll also need ""DSfix"", a program that allows tinkering with many settings, and even helps the game run better. Optional are ""DSMfix"" for diehard mouse and keyboard battlers, and ""DSCfix"", which is fairly crucial to co-op with buddies.Multiplayer is woven into singleplayer with ""Humanity"" which turns your Undead self into a Human form fit to call living. Then people can kick your door down and take your stuff.Co-op is done through White Summon signs. which people leave around the place hoping to be summoned to your world. They will help you until you kill the area's boss.PVP is done through several methods, the basic is Invasion. One player will use an item in their own game, which will allow them to invade your game world in an attempt to kill you. Since all parallel undead are the same person, this guy is an alternate you who wants you-you dead. Fight. Overall Dark Souls is a game that will pretend it hates you until you realise it just wants an equally skilled opponent. It will make that opponent of you, or you will quit the game.Papa Nito loves you all.			"

												Dark Souls is a very difficult 8/10. The underlying game is genius, truly wonderful that eggs you on to discover what lays around the next corner. The fusion between Fighting game, Adventure, RPG is almost magical. But it is let down by it unforgiving personality. Some of the bosses I beat first time round (so it's not a skill problem), and nearly all of the bosses (up to the Lordvessel) were destroyed within a handful of attempts. However, this game really shouldn't take 50-60 hours to complete! A lot of that is wandering around trying to figure out what to do next, or trying to figure out the game logic. This game would be 10/10 if it was designed so that the same content (main) would take the average user 30 hours at most to complete. The first 30 hours were amazing for me, but it just became a plod and some of the later bosses felt like boring trial and error until something worked. Some of the challenge was not real ""challenge"" either. It was bad level design (even though overall the level design was rather superb), bad bonfire placement, glitchy and unpredictable collision boxes. I wanted to just love this game, and although I do truly see the brilliant glint in Dark Souls eye, it's still a Diamond in the Rough. Sort out all those shoddy hitboxes, clipping and dodgy bonfire placements and lessen up on the bulking up game time via over repetition.Stop allowing AI to hit through stone walls, where my blade fails, but then on the other hand let a dragon be shot slowly to death by an arrow because he hasn't detected you are slowly killing him. it feels cheap because it is.Still I can recommend this game to anyone that loves Dark fantasy, a deep challenge, and very wonderfully created world (even if thin to non existent on plot). But that kind of makes it even more mysterious.			"

												Great game! There is a fairly steep learning curve, and it is a difficult game, but success in the end is very rewarding. There are a wide variety of spells, weapons, armors, and techniques at your disposal; and there are unique pros and cons to each. The game also looks great, especially if you are using DSfix.The storyline is pretty fantastic as well. There are several sub-plots as well and they will differ based on your actions.Gameplay is absolutely wonderful.

												Dark Souls brings back the toughness in games. Remember playing Zelda on the NES? Remember how hard it was to find everything as a kid? Remember dying and going all the way back to the beginning just to start over and have the determination to finish? That's what Dark Souls brings back. It's not like your typical game like Skyrim where you can save 4 seconds before dying and just come back to life and fix your mistake 2 seconds later. You die, you cry. Everywhere you go, you're absolutely terrified and nearly ♥♥♥♥ yourself at the slightest change in atmosphere. But when you achieve whatever it was you were trying to do, you seriously ♥♥♥♥ your pants and punch your baby in the face in joy. You scream at your wife and tell her you want a divorce.

												   Lots of people complain about this game being hard. Some of them even say it's too hard, but this game is like any other game in terms of dificulty. The only job you have here is learn the game: you need to learn enemy movesets, and your own, parry times, when to dodge or when to tank, if you can tank, and you need to learn enemy placements. Never just run into a place thinking you can dodge and speedrun first time.    I've played this game on the 360 for a lot longer than 140 hours, and my time on PC just adds to it. The game developers knew just where enemy placement would be perfect, and in what amount so that when you lost it was your fault. Not all areas and bosses feel this way, ""Bed of Chaos"", but the majority of the game is fair. I've personally seen people get stuck at the tutorial boss. It's not unfair difficulty, it's just a lack of Dark Souls skill.   Thanks to steamworks the multiplayer is a lot [less confusing than GFWL's, ]albeit a little bit slower.Most of the time I can connect to my friends with little to no downtime, but there are those times when it feels like you are in offline mode.   This game has PvP, and it's everywhere. There is a forest where invasions are a regular thing, and there is an arena in the DLC area. Red Sign soapstones are things for honorable physchopathic murderers.  Almost any place you can encounter a boss you can get invaded. PvP is really great in this game because it requires all the knowledge i previously mentioned. If you get invaded, never underestimate your opponet, or you will not survive for long.     People really like the story of this game. I do as well, but it's not just told outright to your face. It's scattered everywhere, from item descriptions to NPC dialouge. Descriptions and NPC dialouge is also a great way to discover the lore about bosses or enemies.   I definitely recommend this game. It's got all the things I love. Great PvE, great PvP, and most of all it allows you to either make new friends or meet hiliariously bad trolls.			"

												The moment you buy the game whether console or pc, you already died.  The only tutorial you get is from the instruction booklet. Luckily there is an online feature that allows players to write helpful messages or brag about getting past a certain point, they can aid you or they can invade as if the game isn't hard enough already. Bonfires are your double edge sword, as they don't only heal you and refill your estus flask, but they also revive all the undead. As frustrating as this game is, when you beat a boss, whether it might be the first or the third boss, you get this momentum feeling like you just beaten the final boss and beating the final boss feels like you beaten the game and gained your soul back.

												The most challenging and jolly rewarding game you will play in a long time, Dark Souls combines the dark fantasy theme that gamers have always known and loved with the chalenge that only FromSoftware could get away with while still creating a successfully selling game. With a vaste open world to explore filled with wonderful scenery to gawk at while falling from a cliff while trying to roll away from a flock of hollows, jolly co-operation, a large variety of bosses and mobs alike which force you to adapt how you play in order for them to be mastered and npcs who will steal your heart (in a good way) and guide you on your path as the chosen undead, or not...The only real downside of this game is the inaccessabily of the story, even though this is the direction FromSoft were trying to go with the game, forcing you to uncover the story for yourself rather than shoving it down your throat, this just doesn't work for most. However when uncovered (i suggest youtube for those of you without the time to dig deep enough yourself) the story will pull at your heartstrings and make you question the things you have done an the things you must do aswell as boggling your brain.All in all Dark Souls is a wonderful game well worth the $19.99 you will pay for it and I would recommend it to anyone with the patience to endure it. If only more games could be so grossly incandescent.			"

												Wow! What a game!I always avoid console games because  they tend to be too easy and simple... But Dark Souls is a complete different game, It's one of the most hardest, different, challenging games that I have had played. Its weird in the same time, I mean, I always I been PC Gamer, so I prefer to play with KB & Mouse, but with Dark Souls, I had to play with a controller (Xbox 360) and it was a very nice experience. The way that the developers implemented the multiplayer was very original and something I never seen before. The PC port is not the best, but it's better than when it was released, back then it was GFWL, now its Steamworks. I recommend to install DSFix, It enhanced the graphics and resolution ALOT (You can't play without it). The plot is very irrelevant in my opinion but the gameplay is just amazing and espectacular. Just prepare to play and die! 10/10			"

												Dark Souls, like Demon's Souls before it, treats the player to hostility not seen in video games since players started expecting to see the end. Dark Souls is not hard, simply fair - it even lets you come back an infinite number of times to try again. Enemies and their location decide the tactics a player should use, infinitely adding to their survivability. The game does not want you to win.When you win however, it accepts defeat.There are no Resident Evil style ""IT SURVIVED #OMG fight it AGAIN"" moments.They even held back the JRPG ""You gotta die"" thing, with one exception. They replaced them with ""You're not going to survive if you don't pay attention"" tests.Atmosphere-wise Dark Souls is a Survival Horror pretending to be a Fantasy RPG. Sure, it's got Fantasy elements, but they're all warped into a world where you, an Undead (marked with the ability to return to life at the last spot he sat down for a bit) are charged with deciphering a unreliably narrated world filled with plot and counter plot, where metaphors are blurred with reality. You're even perpetually attacked by alternate versions of yourself who hunt you for sport.On the negative side, the PC port was put together by taking the Xbox disc, grinding into thin paste and feeding down an ethernet cable. The button promts are still Xbox! PC controls are so badly implemented it's like they only playtested with the 19 fingered Chernobyl Bloodsucker that designed it. Get a controller, it does not matter which kind. You'll need a third party program to use a PS3 controller though.You'll also need ""DSfix"", a program that allows tinkering with many settings, and even helps the game run better. Optional are ""DSMfix"" for diehard mouse and keyboard battlers, and ""DSCfix"", which is fairly crucial to co-op with buddies.Multiplayer is woven into singleplayer with ""Humanity"" which turns your Undead self into a Human form fit to call living. Then people can kick your door down and take your stuff.Co-op is done through White Summon signs. which people leave around the place hoping to be summoned to your world. They will help you until you kill the area's boss.PVP is done through several methods, the basic is Invasion. One player will use an item in their own game, which will allow them to invade your game world in an attempt to kill you. Since all parallel undead are the same person, this guy is an alternate you who wants you-you dead. Fight. Overall Dark Souls is a game that will pretend it hates you until you realise it just wants an equally skilled opponent. It will make that opponent of you, or you will quit the game.Papa Nito loves you all.			"

												You awaken in a prison cell, hollowed and stripped of all humanity. You are an Undead, a cursed being trapped within the purgatory that is the Undead Asylum. Who you are and what brought you here are a mystery. The curse makes one forget it seems. As you break out of your cell messages written with soapstone start to appear. Slowly you will make your way through the Asylum, heeding the cautionary tales written by those who came before you. You will seek comfort in the warm embrace of the bonfire, an oasis amidst the rubble and death. Before long however, you will be faced with insurmountable odds in the form of the Asylum Demon. This is where you will most likely die. However death isn't the end of things, you're an Undead after all. Soon you'll feel the warm embrace of the bonfire once more. At this point you will try again, again and again. Until at long last you slay the beast and are liberated from this place. This is where Dark Souls starts and your journey begins. That journey will be beautiful and engaging. The world you'll explore, the characters you'll meet are all lovingly crafted and will stick with you until long after. The gameplay is brutally unforgiving and exceptionally rewarding. Every bit of progress you'll make in this game will be a personal victory. It is incredibly captivating, challenging and simply put fun. If you are looking for a lengthy hands off narrative with compelling, tense action orientated D&D style gameplay. Then do yourself a favor, pick this game up and praise the sun!That being said, it is not without it's faults. The port of this game is sloppy to say the least. Natively it runs at sub par resolutions and has it's gamelogic locked at 30fps. This means that out of the box this game is practically unplayable for most PC gamers. Luckily there are ways to fix these glaring issues in the form of DSFix. (V2.4 at the time of this writing) It is a third party injector created for Dark Souls Prepare To Die Edition that enables you to alter render settings at the engine level.All in all I can not recommend Dark Souls enough.Praise the sun!

												Great game! There is a fairly steep learning curve, and it is a difficult game, but success in the end is very rewarding. There are a wide variety of spells, weapons, armors, and techniques at your disposal; and there are unique pros and cons to each. The game also looks great, especially if you are using DSfix.The storyline is pretty fantastic as well. There are several sub-plots as well and they will differ based on your actions.Gameplay is absolutely wonderful.

												Dark Souls was a game that took me very much by surprise.Being peripherally aware of it around release as something focussed on brutality in its gameplay and its violence; I waved it off at the time as just being another typical 'AAA' title of being all flash and little substance.But was I ever wrong!There's no denying, of course, that Dark Souls  does  revel in difficulty and carnage - but what I actually found was something far, far more enlightened than that.The variety and handling of the gameplay (and I say this having played it only once through,) are immediately to be appreciated themselves.  Every weapon and piece of armour, with few exceptions, feels like it has its place and usefulness.  Every concept of class progression (while still being a fluid and malleable system, as per Elder Scrolls) feels rewarding to further your abilities and play-style.  The multiplayer, even being as indirect a system as it is without any means of direct communication, is a novel and exciting experience.  And the notorious boss fights and difficulty remain exciting and engaging even as they are kicking your ♥♥♥... repeatedly.  It is an 'action RPG', but one that challenges you to be quite deliberate and exacting in your methods.In terms of media, the game is an incredibly lovely experience to bask in as well.  Though the drive to look for the next monster to kill or quest to complete (or death to avoid) can push you along at a fairly brisk pace; if you take the time to admire your surroundings, every region of the game world is filled to the brim with character.  The amount of variety in said monsters is no less astonishing either, mark you, as everywhere you venture will have at least one creature that will give you pause to admire how cool/gruesome/terrifying a work the artists of this game have concocted.  The music meanwhile provides the right amount of background ambience to fill in the regions and add excitement to your challenges without coming across as too contrived or fantastical, always feeling very fitting to the dark and dangerous ambience of the game.  Both of these, perhaps best yet, are blended together beautifully in the game's masterfully done cutscenes.  The pacing, the camera placement, the description of them are truly highwater marks of cinematography in games.If there's a shortcoming to cite about this game, for me, it is the story's own lack of exposure.  After the opening cinematics and character creation set you off on the right foot - you suddenly feel like you've been thrust into a world filled with rich creative lore, but which will only ever show itself in snippets at a time.  I will entirely advocate the value and the power of games leaving things to the player's imagination, and cannot help but frown when a fictional universe will try to introduce itself too strongly or comprehensively; but this is one feels like it's just teasing us!  I found myself reading every item's description and hunting out every last piece of dialogue to try to understand the world going on around me, but it mostly felt like it was lurking just outside of my reach.  You're left with the distant feeling that your actions are meaningful, but are rarely quite sure why.The ambiguity extends to some of the gameplay itself as well; and while the spirit of the game is very much in the trial-and-error of learning your way through boss fights and other challenges through death after death - how you would be expected to know to head to a given area next or meet up again with another character at a potentially previous location - or what how the character stats, item upgrades, and scaling really come into the game... is something that puzzles me.  Without the knowledge from public wikis and forums, or at least an informed friend; I reckon that this game would be otherwise nigh impossible to comprehensively explore and experience if left your own devices.Nevertheless; such criticism is more than overshowed by the game's strengths - and it remains an incredibly immersive experience, even if and when you wish you knew just a little bit more of what was going on.  To be able to offer exciting and rewarding gameplay; a gorgeous artistic backdrop; *and* thought-provoking characters and themes (the ones you get a look at, anyway) - Dark Souls is a thoroughly worthwhile experience, and my strongest recommendations go with it.

												This game is one of my favorite games and does many things extremely well, but does suffer from some flaws that will cause many people to miss out on experiencing the game.My criticism is that the PC port of this game is awful and you must resort to outside fixes to make the game playable. The DSFix mod and the recent switch from GFWL to Steam for the online component of the game both allow you to play the game, but shouldn't be necessary in the first place. There are also some glaring flaws in the game design that are an added annoyance in the already frustrating game (looking at you Bed of Chaos).Now for everything that I love about Dark Souls. The amount of work that FromSoft put into the level design is astounding. Everything just seems to flow perfectly, your eyes are drawn to (or away from) things that you are supposed to find. Unlocking a shortcut or finding a new path can sometimes stop you in your tracks and blow your mind. The characters, the lighting, and the scenery all come together to immerse you in the world, every playthrough I find myself pausing from time to time to just stop and gaze at everything around me. You get the sense that you’re a part of something so much bigger than yourself (literally in a lot of ways). The lore is deep and rich, but you only scratch the surface in game, everything else is mystery or up to your interpretation. The frustration and feeling of accomplishment that follows. Getting stuck in an area and subsequently beating it is so satisfying.I can only recommend Dark Souls to someone that is not only willing to face the difficulty of playing the game, but also the difficulty of making the game playable.Good luck to all the Chosen Undead out there!Praise the Sun!   \[T]/			"

												I told myself I would write a review once I was done with Dark Souls. And so here it is.Dark Souls. I am late to the Souls party, since it is 2015 and this game came out... what? 4 years ago? It's an action RPG with a story hidden behind dialogue and item descriptions where you can die numerous times and come back at a nice bonfire. The RPG part mostly comes from increasing your skills and joining a covenant. The game does not really provide you much options to be a character, but that didn't stop me from being Knight Benedict of Astora, Blessed by the First-Born. Most dialogue is also just ""Yes or No, mutafugger"".The game's popularity comes from being ""hard"" or ""difficult"" with many of the fans of the game telling newcomers who are having trouble ""Git Gud"". I had to hear that myself as I was starting out and when I died a pathetic number of times to certain bosses (Here's to you, Knight Artorias), but would I say the game is hard? No. I don't believe this game is hard. I believe this game is frustrating, with a lot of mechanics that I question each time I encounter them. Questions like ""Why can this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sancutary Guardian hit me 4 times in a row and keep my stunlocked and oh god damn it no, not the lightning again"" as well as ""Wait, these ghosts in New Londo can phase through walls and floors, because they're ghosts, but I can't roll away from them? How does that make- Oh no, now I'm surrounded and they're looking at my butt.""Perhaps the only difficult part in this game comes from the early game, when bosses like the Asylum Demon and Taurus Demon can be plunged attacked but (for Asylum) you can only plunge once or (for Taurus) you can plunge multiple times, but its a fight to climb up the ladder without him killing you. Then you realize that the ""git gud"" part comes from running into a specific part of the boss and just wailing on them because they can't hit you there (under Sif's legs, or against Seath's crotch and tentacle leg, for example). So the game is not hard. It's very frustrating, especially when you first start out, and when you encounter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like the ghosts that you cannot roll through, despite them being GHOSTS.The lore in this game, however, is very good. It's not all up in your face like certain games, and you got to dig to find your answers to certain questions, though only some will be answered (Who was Gwyn's Firstborn? Was it Solaire? Was it Andre of Astora?). I'm always a fan of world building, and FROM did some great world building with this game. Not much to say beyond that. It's good. It's really damn good.The online community is small, but that's to be expected. Dark Souls 2 is out, Bloodborne is coming, and the community is split between the GFWL players and the Steam beta players. There was also the Region Lock that was only killed a few days ago. The game, for me, got -much- better once I was getting randomly invaded. Was fun. Managed to kill me a Spirit of Vengeance and Dark Phantom back-to-back before I got my final achievements today. Made me feel like I was gud, unlike the bosses, which just made me feel like I was cheesing all of them. Like the Ceaseless Discharge. He is so easy to cheese.So the game is good? Yeah, it's good. The combat is decent enough, though you should learn to parry, even though all but one boss cannot be parried. The lore is good. The online is still there, even if they can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (thanks to the two guys who left messages on top of the summon sign for the Manus fight). Is it hard? No. It is not a hard game, it is only a frustrating one, and there is a HUGE difference.Buy it if it's on sale, though I suspect I'm probably the last person in the world who got this game, and I didn't even buy it for myself. Thank you, my friends.			"

												Dark Souls is the very definition of a game. It has action, it has stats evolution, it has an intrisic rich lore and universe that's there for those who wish to dwell into the story, but it also has one of the best and most beautiful level designs of all time. It's highly dificult, it's ruthlessly punishing, it's highly rewarding. One of the few games I can't get enough and keep replaying over and over again,  and even doing countless attempts of (utterly failed) speedruns. Possibly the most perfectly structured game of all time. One of my all time favorites.Always remember:1. Be patient.2. Don't get greedy.3. Study your enemies and surroundings.4. Persevere.(PS: ♥♥♥♥ Bed Of Chaos. Just ♥♥♥♥ it.)			"

After much more attempts, you'll eventually win this game pretty easy and every other dark souls game should feel like a piece of cake. After that even in your normal life you will never rage again and conquer the patience of a yoga master.You will feel peaceful to your surroundings and never tilt again.Conclusion: You 'll either end up being friendly to others or feeling like you wanna kill everything.Should you buy it?: HELL YES ITS THE BEST ONE OF THE WHOLE SERIES			"

												Dark Souls is fantastic blah blah blah, I get sick pleasure from pain and am a complete masochist, etc.  If you want a real review, there are plenty of them available.  Rather than a true review, this is a wakthrough on what you need to do to get Dark Souls working on PC.  When From Software ported Dark Souls to PC, they felt it was too easy to get into the game and decided to screw up the graphics and controls so that the player would have to do a quest before they even opened the game (/sarcasm).  The reality is, From Software had no idea what they were doing in regards to PC programming and game design, and only ported the game because there was large fan demand (so don't hold the crap state of the vanilla game against them).  The result was the game can't display HD resolutions and the keyboard and mouse controls are awful.  Fortunately there are some fixes available.  (One more thing: If at all possible, use a gamepad.)First off, after downloading and installing Dark Souls, right click the game in your inventory and click on properties at the bottom.  A box with several tabs will open.  Click on the last tab that says BETAS.  In the tab, there's a scroll down box with something like dspdte-2.0.  Make sure the box displays the dspdte-2.0 line and hit the close button.  You don't need an access code or anything, it just automatically downloads the beta.  What this does is it makes sure your copy of Dark Souls interacts with Steam for online activity instead of GFWL.  It also ensures compatibility with the most recent DSFix (see below).  Note: Supposedly copies purchased and downloaded after Steam integration default to dsptde-2.0 but having never tested it, I don't know if it's true.DSFix is the mod that fixes screen resolution options and rendering and less importantly if you are using a gamepad, key bindings.  DSFix can be downloaded here:  http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fdarksouls%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D19&pUp=1Just follow the instructions in the description.  If you experience crashing or FPS drops, there's a good chance that your copy of Dark Souls and DSFix are not the most recent versions.Before talking about the mouse fix, I really urge you to just use a gamepad.  The controls are pretty complex as far as keyboards go and it's a bit difficult to press several buttons at a time on the keyboard, something that will happen often in Dark Souls.  The game was designed for controllers and it really shows, especially in button combos.  If you are using a gamepad, congrats!  You can go die now!  By which I mean play Dark Souls.If I somehow failed to convince you to use a gamepad, then you need to get DSMFix, the Dark Souls mouse fix.  It is built to work with DSFix and can be found here:  http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/28/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fdarksouls%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D28&pUp=1Disclaimer:  I have not tested this mod out having never used keyboard and mouse controls, but I hear good things about  it and it probably can't make mouse controls any worse than they are.So yeah that's how you make Dark Souls playable on PC.  With any luck this will get upvoted enough to be displayed on the Steam store page.  The pain of setting it up is absolutely worth it.  The game is definitely one of the most well designed RPGs ever made.			"

												The Dark Souls series is famous for its gloomy atmosphere, the creative, sometimes grotesque, but always impressive art style and its very intense combat system. The player has to concentrate constantly, as almost every mistake might be punishable by death. In comparison to Dark Souls II, Dark Souls is a bit more welcoming to beginners because deaths do not cause the maximum health to decrease here (""hollowing""), so that the same nasty boss can be taken on without that additional disadvantage. For me, this was a frustrating turn-off in DS2, and I enjoy DS1 more. Also, unlimited enemy respawns in DS1 make farming and upgrading easier than in DS2, a significant factor for starters who prefer a lower difficulty.However, it is still crucial to study the game in order to advance. You need to know how stronger enemies and bosses can be beaten, either by your own observation or by watching tutorials. And you have to optimize your stats, at least as a new player, in order to gain some wiggle room for the inevitable mistakes. Basically, by optimizing your stats, you determine the difficulty of your game: Running around naked with a dagger and without levelling up is one of the highest ""difficulty settings"". If you want to have an easier first run, you watch tutorials and read wikis in order to - find the best locations to farm souls (= xp points and currency) in repeated killing sprees and subsequent zone resets (=enemy respawns) at a Bonfire- understand how the basic stats determine secondary stats (e.g. strength and physical damage, or encumbrance and roll speed) - get tips how to upgrade both your character and your weapons and armour- learn where to find or buy pieces of equipment that suit your playstyle and match each other.One example for matching equipment at the beginning of the game would be: - Zweihänder, a heavy and slow weapon that deals high damage and gives you a good chance to stagger enemies, but consumes a lot of stamina with each attack- Grass Crest Shield, a special item that boosts your stamina regeneration even when worn on your back, while two-handing your weapon- Elite Knight Armour, which is relatively heavy, but gives good defence values and poise, enabling you to take hits from quicker enemies while you build up your slow two-handed attack without being staggered or killed- Havel's Ring, a magical ring that increases your load capacity, meaning that you can still run and dodge roll relatively fast despite of heavy equipmentThis example should give you an idea how complex building a character can be, as there are so many interacting factors to consider.Due to the number of equippable items and viable strategies, all the DS games invite players to try out different combinations and find out what suits their taste most - not only regarding tactics and weapon movement sets that ""feel good"", but also the looks of your hero (the internet created the term ""Fashion Souls"" for a reason). I am quite fascinated by this game and give it a 9/10.			"

												This goes high on the list of games that are truly my favorites, and that surprises me because I have yet to defeat the whole game! Endless deaths and trial somehow push me through wanting to collect my souls for a level up and move on through a tough boss battle. The game is very punishing but rewarding in all the right ways, making me come back for more each time. If you like a challenge, are prepared to die many times, and enjoy unique level designs then this is the game for you. I don't just recommend this game but i highly recommend it. I've become addicted to it and I am an overall BAD player. I suck. If I can do it so can you. I can promise that its well worth your time. Practice makes perfect in a game like dark souls. The lore is rediculously interesting and the amount of replayability is high as well. There is a lot to do in this game and every time you move forward you will feel relief and happiness before the despair of realizing the next area you are about to go to seems to be an even bigger trial than before. Its all part of the fun!			"

												Dark Souls is the very definition of a game. It has action, it has stats evolution, it has an intrisic rich lore and universe that's there for those who wish to dwell into the story, but it also has one of the best and most beautiful level designs of all time. It's highly dificult, it's ruthlessly punishing, it's highly rewarding. One of the few games I can't get enough and keep replaying over and over again,  and even doing countless attempts of (utterly failed) speedruns. Possibly the most perfectly structured game of all time. One of my all time favorites.Always remember:1. Be patient.2. Don't get greedy.3. Study your enemies and surroundings.4. Persevere.(PS: ♥♥♥♥ Bed Of Chaos. Just ♥♥♥♥ it.)			"

												You have to learn the moveset of every boss in order to beat him - let's take knight Artorias for example - the boss fight is so good you have to experience it to know what I am talking about. You will die maybe 4-5 times and then you start changing your tactic. After you learn every move the knight Artorias has, you can kill him if you are careful. It took me over 18 tries. I died 18 times trying to kill him, and I was HAPPY about it. The feeling of dopamine and endorphine flooding your brain after you finally beat the boss is the greatest feeling I ever had in gaming.I wish I could erase my memory of playing this game, forget absolutely everything about it (beacuse at this point I probably know almost everything, even that the Ingward returns to Firelink Shrine after you talk to him after beating Four Kings, I found this information after 3 years of the game being out) and play the game all over again. The Best game I have ever played, I have the sweetest memories about the time I first played Dark Souls.I love Dark Souls. So should you, if you give it a chance.			"

												Don't get fooled by my playtime... I used to play this off steam way back when, shortly after it came out, and just now got it on Steam to have it in my collection there... playing DSIII now.This is the game that began the legendary DS-franchise. Yes, there were other games by the same company before that which were like the ancestors (Demon's Soul for example), yet this one, I think, was what got people in the West into these games.You can tell from the graphics that this is a couple of years old, but most likely, you'll soon download the popular mod that improves graphics anyway. I can't tell you whether you should start with this one and go to DSII and III from there... some people think it's important, others say you can start with any of them. What I can say is: It still can be quite challenging. Compared to DSIII, it's a bit slower-paced (the actual combat), as DSIII adds some elements of the popular Bloodbourne, so combat is faster. Still, it IS challenging, and if you're new to the franchise, you will die. A lot. But, here is the deal: That's part of the game, of the philosophy behind it. It's not like in other games, where dieing is rather uncommon or a really big deal once it happens. Dieing in DS is part of learning the game, of learning the controls, mechanics and fighting style of each boss and trash mob. Once you digest and accept that idea, you hopefully will stay calm once it happens. If you really really get ticked off when you die, yyou might wanna stay clear of this. However, for all the frustration and ""pain"" you endure, there is a big payoff - mastering the game, beating the bosses feels so very satisfying, is so rewarding. Other games afterwards might feel sluggish and too easy.Also, there IS lore in this game. Yet, it is not shoved into your face with big arrows and question marks and markers. You have to explore, take your time to look around, read item descriptions etc. Even then, things will be...dubious, but I find this mystery and the fact it's not ""read to you in a loud voice through a PA system"" quite fascinating.PLEASE take your time. Accept dieing as a big part of the learning curve. Practice with the controls. Try strategies. Don't spoil yourself too much with guides and walkthroughs. Dive in, explore, learn, and enjoy.I can't tell you whether this is the BEST DS game to get into the series as the graphics are a bit outdated, but it's a damn good starting point, so check it out, it's still a challenging, rewarding and exciting game!

												The level design is just about one of the best from recent years. RPG-elements are minimal and the fighting, atleast as a warrior, was pretty boring. Dodge/block slash was the way to beat the game. The game has been said to be hard, but as a bad player I didn't find it that hard. Most bosses I beat with 1-3 tries(two of the lordvessel bosses fell in first try, final boss in three). Towards the end, bosses became easier and easier as the charachter got better gear. Only the ""dark"" areas gave me a lot of trouble, but they were surprisingly few for an fantasy-rpg. Comparing these to a generic MMORPG bosses, I found that these were a bit too easy to learn and bit too generic to actually make the learning part essential.The game had some frustrating parts, but I fast realised that they were frustrating because I wasn't supposed to be there yet difficulty-wise, again another nod to the level design. When approached later, those areas became pretty easy too.The game has some flaws, mostly dealing with shoddy PC-convert(fixed with mods). Also the in the game I think there was too much running through areas already ventured, better fast travel system could've been implemented earlier in the game and allow much less boring grinding.Also I didn't much appreciate the fact that the flames were always after the boss, not before. So taking 3 tries, meant that one must also beat all the minions between boss fight and the flame which usually was more of a nuisance than an actual challenge.The game gives too little information which is a quite normal for a RPG. I wonder what is the major problem actually explaining game mechanics in game instead of having to find out about the with either trial-and-error, manual or using a wikipage.Nonetheless, the game felt like a breath of fresh air that got just a bit too stale in the end. The ""difficulty"" theme didn't quite carry to the end and rest of the atmosphere was therefore lost. I still highly recommend everyone atleast try the first 10-20 hours, as one starts to respect level design in a whole new level(badum tsh).			"

												I am pretty sure you're gonna be able to find a reasonable enough review above me, yet there is an important thing that is not being mentioned often enough. This is NOT a difficult game. It's not about dying all the time and not about raging all around. It is a marketing trick that worked for some reason, but you should not fall for it. Keep it in mind.Just like some of you, my sweet audience, I skipped this game when it came out. It was a weird idea for me to buy the game just because it's difficult. The one and only reason you'll be forcing this hardcore part is because the rest of them are not worth it. Right? Nah. Marketing team failed. It's not about deaths, not at all. It is the most fair game I've ever played. As long as you're paying respect to it, not trying to rush the whole location or avoid those fights in any way, you'll be going through this dark world as a hot knife through the butter.You'll die, of course, a  couple of times, but you'll know perfectly what happened. You'll adjust your strategy and try again. It's never about location being bad or monsters being strong. It's always about you making silly mistakes due to your arrogance or ignorance.  This is a thing that is capable of bringing back your thirst for gaming if you've lost it as I did. It is an absolute masterpiece in terms of making something complex with a very basic parts. It is something you definetly should try if you're fond of gaming. It doesn't even matter if you're filthy casual. Eventually you'll git gud.			"
