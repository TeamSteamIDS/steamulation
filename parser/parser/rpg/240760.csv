												Wasteland 2 is unapologetically old school, which is both its main strength and main weakness depending on how you expect to be entertained. Right from the start you have to create 4 characters and strike a difficult balance between 8 attributes which all are decisive factors in combat (though some arguably less so than others). Add to that 30 different skills and very few points to allocate. There is no obvious build for you characters, and you will likely question the validity of your choices for most of the early part of the game. If you expect to be able to uncover every nook and cranny in one playthrough you will be bitterly disappointed. You probably won't be able to open more than half the containers that are scattered through the early to mid part of the game, or to solve quests in a satisfactory manner, so if you can't handle that kind of frustration this game isn't for you.At its core the game is about choices and consequences, but like in real life, the nature of the choices aren't always clearly defined, nor do these choices wait for you to be made. At various points in the game you will be confronted to situations with timers, if you don't act decisively and fast enough you will have to face terrible and unfair consequences. Don't except a smooth ride from zero to hero, in Wasteland 2 nobody is going to pat you on the back.  You will be treated harshly by the NPCs, who are both unreliable and often ungrateful. Everybody is just as victim to their circumstances as you are as a player, the game doesn't treat you like a child.Which is where the game shines most. While the main intrigue is rather dim and hardly original, the factions and situations (both entertaining and thought provoking) you will encounter along the way all build around that core of finding purpose to your actions, to your survival in a bleak and brutish world. As Desert Rangers you will roam the wastes, explore areas as they pop on your map, and deliver justice one bullet at a time, as this game's central feature is combat. While not particularly deep, it is tactical enough to be entertaining without requiring you to ponder forever before passing your turn.Last but not least, for those with limited time and attention, you want to take into account the considerable length of the game (~70h) and its slow pace. While there is quite a lot of content in the game it takes a lot of time to unfold. You might take hours to uncover areas, scavenge and solve quests, areas that you could cross in less than 30s if you went straight forward. It's not an adrenaline packed experience, full to the brim with action and excitements. A lot of efforts are asked from the player, and the rewards might not always be what you expect these days when it comes to gaming. Because sometimes the challenge is the reward.			"

												IntroductionWhat do Duran Duran, toaster repairing and a post nuclear wasteland all have in common?Around 1988 I played Wasteland 1 on a C64. It was a cross between Bards Tale 1 type combat with Ultima IV type world movement. It was one of the first games to include a persistent world. The manual asked you to create a copy of the game disks so that choices and consequences you experienced during the game were saved. If you suspected your entire party was going to be wiped out or a gaming catastrophe was imminent and tried pulling out the floppy – it failed.You were prompted to read chapters of text from a booklet at key points in the game to further the storyline. Wasteland 1 was released in a world without many hard drives so computer memory was restricted. The story booklet also provided a form of copy protection. The developers included fake text to give cheaters a hard time and prevent players from reading ahead and discovering the plot.Time passes and its now 2015. It fascinates me that I have read reviews about Wasteland 2 from RPG “experts” who were not even alive in 1988. It’s been a long time. Reading these thoughts from youngsters about a sequel to a game they have never played was slightly interesting and mostly offensive. Saying that, I know nostalgia can be a powerful thing. I am glad that the passage of time has faded my memory. Some days I believe any old game released in the 1985-1995 period was a great game as there wasn’t many around. Or more accurately I could not afford that many – heck I was in school. Just look at me now with Steam or GOG – I don’t even have to leave my mother’s basement :)WL2 is set in Arizona after a nuclear event destroyed much of civilisation. It is a RPG where you can control a party of four rookie desert rangers that have been asked to investigate the murder of a veteran named Ace. As your progress through the game you can recruit NPCs that join your party who bring along their own skillsets. Lacking a medic in your party? Recruit a Doctor. 15 long years have passed since WL1.Character designWhen you begin a new game you can create a party from scratch or import and amend existing rangers. In an attempt to show traditional RPG credentials – the developers have given each character seven attributes using the CLASSIC method (never heard of it either – hardly classic). These include Strength, Intelligence and Awareness. Interestingly Luck and Charisma also appear. These two seem to be a throwback to D&D and live gaming with a Dungeon Master. Developers seem to struggle finding a real use for them and most players will therefore roll a low score in these to obtain higher scores in Strength, Endurance etc. I would have preferred a more balanced approach regards the attributes so that they were all equally important depending on the build or concept for that character.It’s almost become fact now that Intelligence is the most important attribute in WL2 as that determines the ability to learn skills. Pretty soon it becomes apparent that unlike many RPGs your attributes do not always link with or enhance your skills. For example a character with 1 ST can be highly skilled and effective in a skill called Brute Force. This disparity is not quite fatal but a poor show nevertheless.The skillset of your characters are the key factor in determining on whether you will be successful – at anything. The skills are divided into three groups, general, weapon and knowledge and each has ten levels of expertise. There are far too many for any one character or party of four to excel at everything. You need a plan. If you want to recruit other party members beyond your base four – learn the Leadership skill as that improves their combat abilities and keeps them in check.If you prefer to shoot first and chat later – you may want to ditch the three conversation skills. Over my 100 hours of game time – I found that levelling is quite generous and any reasonable INT team member would gain sufficient skill points over the game. I also found that combat skills and ‘how to open stuff’ skills were used 95% of the time. Skills such as Animal Whisperer, Alarm Disarming and Surgeon were hardly required. The Toaster Repair skill just seemed to be included without much thought and relied heavily on pre-game knowledge. For example, if you fixed a toaster in day 5 of gaming and subsequently acquired an item, that same item would only be of value if you happen to have it in your inventory on day 55. Items from toasters are not marked as quest items. Poor show.Game EngineThe game engine has a two-fold approach. Movement across the world map is a 2D affair – think Indiana Jones in his airplane. 95% of the game is top down, 2.5D isometric movement with a camera that can zoom out and turn left or right. Graphics were sufficient and I cannot remember any bugs or glitches. Sometimes the game would slow down a trifle in heavy combat or densely populated areas.The local map representation of towns and places you visit is just diabolical. I struggled to find any use for it apart from seeing where your party is in relation to your entry point. For some reason the developers camouflaged the entries/exits to buildings and other locations on the local map so it takes the gamer about 50 hours to even realise they are there. Not fantastic. I thought we were going back to Wasteland of 1987 – not some crappy game from 1957. Ask the developers when Ultima Underworld was released – for goodness sake!SummaryThere are a lot of things wrong with this game. I would really like to know if players spent more time on opening things or in the dialogue system. I would like to know why in the Rail Nomad area I had to criss-cross the various maps about 100 times. I want to know why the local map is crap.Looking back to all the press about it, I wonder about the ‘choice’ you are given at the beginning of the game and why so many journalists sang its praises from high. I couldn’t remember which items emerged from toasters.Then I met Simon Le Bon in a random encounter that was Hungry Like a Wolf and then Frankie told me to Relax. Then my heart just melted away and this somewhat not that bad game became something special.I really enjoyed storytelling for once even though some of it was boring and mundane.I really enjoyed building up my team of four and wanted them to do well. I watched over them, groomed them and bent them to my will. I was proud each time the radio sent me a message back promoting them in the field of operations. I spent 100 hours on this game to completion and the only reason I didn’t do another playthrough was because I have some urgent business working through a list of 71 other decent games.			"

Wasteland 2's story places you in the boots of four raw recruits to the desert rangers. The game starts you in the desert wastes of Arizona as you attend the funeral of Ace, a desert ranger who was recently killed. As the funeral ends the desert rangers leader General Vargas throws you into the deep end and sends you off to track down Ace's killer.Let's start with character creation, in the game you start with four characters. You have the option of either creating your own characters or choose from pre existing builds, you can even have a combination of both. In terms of aesthetics the character models are not pleasant to look like and there isn't a large variety of faces to choose from. That being said the statistical side makes the appearance’s short comings up in spades. Your characters have both attributes which are things like strength and skills. There is a large range of skills available including things like lockpicking, safecracking and more. It's often best to create a diverse group after all the more skills your party has collectively, the more options you'll have throughout the game. I myself opted first for a assault rife bearing squad leader, a sniper with lockpicking and computer skills, a melee focused demolitions expert and a shotgun wielding medic, aptly named Doc.When your not actually in a location, you'll be traversing the wastes on the world map. There are lots of locations to discover in the world and you can find hidden cache's of loot so its worth spending time to explore. On the world map you have to take several factors in to account when travelling. First is your water supply, your group has water canteens, each mile you travel will use up water and if you run out your party will take damage from dehydration. You can however stop of at any oasis you find in your travels to fill your canteens. Another factor is radiation, after all nukes do tend to leave some nasty after effects in the environment. Safe travel through irratiated zones can only be done by having the appropriate radiation suits, if you don't your party will die of radiation sickness very quickly. The world map also has random encounters not all of which are combat focused. Many will be raiders or animals that you must combat or run away from. Some will be travelling merchants or on the occasion something much more interesting. Graphically Wasteland 2 isn't the prettiest of spectacles, However its art direction does bring a certain harsh, grittiness to the affair which is very appropriate for the post apocalyptic setting. I think the character models could have been done better as some of the models and animations have a blocky look to them which looks out of place. While it is not the prettiest of games, the effect animations such as explosions look well done. On top of that the things like NPC character art is fantastically done. On thing that does shine in the game is sound which is no surprise whenMark Morgan who was responsible for the soundtracks to fallout and fallout 2 is your composer. Everything from music, sound effects and surprisingly voice acting is done superbly and brings a real atmosphere to the whole affair.Let's move on to one of, if not the main part of the game, combat, after all theres plenty of dangers lurking in the wasteland and you can't avoid all of them. Those familiar with the recent X-com or the even more recent Divinity Original Sin will be right at home with Wasteland 2's tactical turn based system. Combat is straight forward and works from an action point system. Your characters attributes determines the amount of AP you have at the start of each turn as well as the order of which characters take their turns in. The combat is fairly fast paced similar to X-com enemy unknown, there is both cover and crouch mechanics too. The cover system is simplistic and being in cover gives you defensive bonuses. Crouching on the other hand improves your chance to hit as well as raising your chance to evade attacks.Depending on the difficulty combat can become fairly challenging. Particularly later in the game when you meet tougher enemies and enemies with both unique mechanics and better weaponry. As you go through the game you can gain followers to your squad, these followers if you don't have the leadership skill can have a chance to lose control and they will do as they please in combat. Your weapons can also jam, usually at most inconvenient times, plus you will have to regularly reload your mags and watch your available ammo.Overall the combat is solid, challenging and fun. It can throw you a few curve balls along the way too which is always good for keeping you on your toes. It's something that InXile had to get right and thankfully in my opinion they have executed it very well.Wasteland 2 boasts a large number of quests to embark on. The great thing about the game is that you often have the freedom of choice in how to deal with the situations you encounter. Depending on who you have in your party and your skills, there are often multiple outcomes to any given scenario. An example of this is when I went to a graveyard and dug some graves, all was fine with me looting form the dead however upon reloading an earlier save I gained a different follower on the path and when I went to dig the graves my ally took offence to disturbing the dead and turn on my group. Things like this can happen all the time in the game and its great to see all the different possibilities there are. Not only does it ensure a good amount of re-playability but it also ensures that while two people can play the same game, different things will happen to each.In conclusion wasteland 2 lives up to its namesake and not only provides a great post apocalyptic rpg experience but it provides a memorable one too. You will spend hours laughing at the video game culture references throughout the game as well as enjoying the well written characters. One thing I love is that the game doesn't hold your hand and lets you solve problems as you see fit, if there’s a wall in your way you could use the brute force skill or just throw a grenade, the choice is yours but the game won't tell you to do either, its up to you to come up with a solution if at all. The games story is strong and with its multiple choice system, there’s plenty to see and do. It's a solid title from InXile and something that you certainly felt after having such a successful crowd funding campaign, one that had to get right. While its release date has been pushed back several times, in all it seems it was worth it and Brain Fargo and the team have created a fitting sequel. While it does have its occasional issues and minor bugs, its a game that I would highly recommend adding to your collection. Whether your an avid RPG player or not, the majority of gamers will find hours worth of enjoyment in Wasteland 2.			"

												Look at my name.  LOOK AT IT!  And tremble before the fearful countenance that is my Desert Dweller portrait!Yes...I'm an old Wasteland 1 fan.  Loved it then back on the old C=64.  Loved Fallout 1, 2, Tactics and Fallout 3, all of which were inspired and modeled after Wasteland.  So I am admittedly a little biassed in this brief review.Some things I like about it so far:- Depth of choice- Consequences and world alteration based on those choices- Deep character customization- The atmosphere created by the visuals and audio- There is 'enough' eye candy and ear candy without going overboard- Multiple approaches/solutions to many problems- Challenge and reward levels feel apropriate- There is 'enough' realism to add in planning and tactics that help immersion without being burdensome- Lots of nods and references to the original that actually fit into the story and make sense- There is 'enough' voice acting with apropriate emotion that isn't too cold/dry or too flowery/dramatic- The written story is deep, interesting, concise and easy to follow so you can move on quicklySome things I would like to see improved:- Character creation needs more detailed notes for newcomers.- It is not clear HOW or even IF most of the C.L.A.S.S.I.C. attributes alter your skills.  Derived stats, yes.  Skills, I can only see one stat that will impact some of them.- Screen edge scrolling/panning of the area map is a little slow.- Would like a little more freeness in the camera controls.  Rotation, zoom and angle.  I don't care if I see map edge.- Sometimes hard to tell what is and is not cover in combat.Overall though, it is great fun and stays very true to the original.  Even with the few lumps it has, it is very polished, rock solid stable, and seems optimized well for multicore CPUs and multi-GPU setups.  Characters and quests make sense and are well scripted and laid out to be intuitive and challenging.  There is some fun exploring little nooks in the areas to find hidden loot and bonuses.  And while it is fairly linear, the branches you can take are divrese and plentiful.  I see a lot of replay value just from the choices you can make.  And your choices will have impact, sometimes in unexpected and even unplesant ways.So, grab your Proton Axe and Meson cannon...and don your best suit of Pseudo-Chitin armor.  It's time to go out adventuring among the muties.  Just be careful, so you can come back to camp and share your stories around the fire over a bottle of Snake Squeezins.  Radioactive glow and 3rd arm optional, of course.*** Disclaimer - read before you comment ***This review is my personal opinion.I'm not interested in debate or discussion.Argumentative, hijacking and/or trolling comments will simply be deleted.To me, hijacking my positive review to push your negative review is the epitome of laziness.

												Imagine that you step into a bar with optimistic ideas of fun and casual tomfoolery. You are about to say hello to the bouncer, but just as you open your mouth, the bouncer punches you into that open stupid mouth. He then proceeds to beat you up viciously with no end in sight. But then after like 10 hours he will go, ""Dude, you're alright"" and let you in. Then it turns out to be like the best damn bar ever, with 1 dollar beers, Motörhead is playing Live and Kate Upton needs your help to untangle her bra with your teeth and you're like ""Daaaaamn! that 10 hour beating was totally worth it!""  The first mutated frog killed my party about 20 times, then I got lucky and beat it. Played about 6 hours after  the frog incident, realized my party sucks the ♥♥♥♥ of a Sumerian demon goddess and I had created just about everything wrong. Restarted the game, created a party with knowledge about useful and less useful skills. Now I'm the Terror of the wastes, The ambassador of Bad Assity and the Iron Chef of Pounding Vag. 10/10.			"

												Did they pull it off?I don't quite know what I was expecting when I first backed the Kickstarter. Wasteland was a beloved classic, my first proper PC game, and it showed me just what games were really capable of. Problems with more than one solution, missions that could be failed without forcing a game over, the player's responsibility to build a balanced team, the combination of descriptive paragraphs with the limited graphics to paint a more vivid picture; the experience blew my fragile little mind at the time. A contemporary title can do many or even all of those things, but whether they can match that feeling - the impression that I'm playing something truly groundbreaking - is a much more loaded question.Many positive reviews of Wasteland 2 frontload the criticism, ending with some variant of ""but I liked the game anyway because etc."" It's easy to see why: bugs still being ironed out, a rather clunky interface, widespread locks and traps with long skill use animations, overuse of a limited pool of music, some weak story elements, large chunks of wasted space... you don't have to look too hard to see some serious flaws. The enjoyable aspects are likely to be subjective: how well the combat clicks for the player, whether they like the setting and overall fiction, the extent to which building a proper team is enjoyable, and so on. Indeed, in their bid to create a classic-sized PC RPG, it seems inXile could have made the game play better without sacrificing its hardcore appeal.For instance, the locks and traps thing: consider the Baldur's Gate games, which also made use of frequent locks and traps on obstacles. Where BG has the advantage is that skill usage is practically instantaneous; the character moves to the trapped item and, if successful, the trap field simply disappears. WL2 added some needless visual flair to the process - your ranger rubbing their hands before working on the object, or kicking it repeatedly as a meter fills, or whatever - which adds a few seconds to each skillcheck. In a game with hundreds of them, those seconds start to add up. Little changes to things like that could have smoothed out a lot of reviewer complaints, with few if any adjustments to the core mechanics.  No doubt patches will address this and other issues over time, but the impression has set in nonetheless.I'll be blunt: I put a fair chunk of change into the Kickstarter, and I can feel the little nagging doubts in the back of my head. Would I be fair if I saw something that bugged me, or read criticism? Would I go easy on the game, knowing that some of my own money was somewhere inside? Would my opinion be more biased than others? It's a reasonable question, and I never did come up with a good answer. Even putting that aside, I'm not gonna deny I was a little nervous when this came out. It's been a long time since the Infinity engine was king of the hill. Did I still have the stomach for a big PC game? What if my appetites had simply moved on? Doubts upon doubts upon doubts.Did they pull it off?Like putting up with the wizard fight at the Friendly Arm Inn while you're still level 1, the appeal persists: a game that won't pull its punches, that will try its best to bring me down. WL2 definitely has the spark of those classic RPGs, that hard-to-define something that makes them hard to put down once I start. Fights were tactical, kinetic affairs: cover got destroyed, enemies repositioned, backup weapons were handy, well-timed explosives turned the tide, and even a difficult encounter could be mitigated with the right preparation. Environments presented their own challenges, and with several ways through a given obstacle I was more often than not encouraged to work around a failed skillcheck rather than savescum. Uncooperative plot elements or even bugged out triggers could be answered by force-firing, and there was no problem that the right size bomb could not solve.Arizona did drag and suffer from design problems - the Prison being chief among them - but it held its own curious charms, and it presents a neat contrast with California. At the start, you control a bunch of customizable scrubs whose mission rapidly spirals out of control. Echo Team starts in known territory and gradually pushes the boundaries, earning their stripes in the process. Water is precious, communities are scarce, and civilization is on the knife's edge atop a pile of late 80s-early 90s rubble. By the time I did get to California, Echo felt every bit the veteran ranger squad, doing what rangers do best: venture into wild territory and bring order to chaos. There, the script is flipped: water is everywhere, settlements are common, and it's on us to put our best foot forward. Every arrival the base, every interaction with the public, every time we stepped in to right some wrong felt like it mattered somehow, like it could have gone differently - and like everything we'd done before had shaped us for that encounter.That's a key spice to those old titles: variety. What happens if I do this instead of that? What does this guy say or do if I mention this? What if I didn't have that skill, item, or party member? What are the consequences if we just kill everyone? Is there a way to get what I want peacefully, and if so how bad do I want it? I was constantly asking myself those questions during Wasteland 2, and it's for those reasons that I know I'll be back. There's more to see, even if I think I've seen it all; there's more to try, even if I've already sunk some 80 hours into the campaign. Old PC RPGs sometimes get a shot of life from modding communities, but even before I had heard thing one about mods, there were some games where I knew - just knew - that I'd be back, just to see what happened this time.And god help me if I didn't get drawn in at times, just a little. I searched frantically during a hostage situation, wondering if there even was a third option between 'take down the enemy' and 'save the hostage.' I debated whether to intervene in a loophole-ridden religious dispute, and if so how. I paid attention to the radio broadcasts in LA, making mental notes of who's who in the neighborhood.  The villain was something of a one-note antagonist - there were moments of good writing, but his was a stock grand scheme - but there was a respectable sense that something was tracking Echo and the Rangers. There's a strange appeal to being stuck in uncharted territory, surrounded by potential enemies, with friends well out of reach and one hell of a longshot goal ahead of us. It's predictable in the end, but not without its highs; the trick of bringing back everyone you've made friends with for the final battle is an old one, but no less effective.Sometimes it's not the game I'm after, but the adventure, the challenge. Sometimes it's the sense that I am probably going to lose if I play this game like I play every other game. So it was with games like Arcanum: flawed to hell and back, difficult to recommend, but special in a way that most games simply aren't for me. So it is with Wasteland 2.Did they pull it off?In my humble, flawed, biased opinion: yeah, I think they pulled it off.			"

Early Access Review
								EDIT: This review was originally a thumbs down.  To see my original post, read below.  I originally didn't recommend the EARLY ACCESS version of Wasteland 2 for several reasons but the main point was it being nearly unplayable.  The argument against this was that it's in ""beta.""  I don't disagree with that statement, but to ask $60 to test a product that can barely be tested makes me not want to recommend it.  I felt there were features missing and a general lack of polish that shouldn't exist in a product that was in development for over a year and then released for PUBLIC testing.  ""That's the point of a beta"" some say, and I don't disagree.  But when you sell a product, you must justify why the customer should buy it.  I Kickstarted the game so my money was already spent but I didn't recommend someone with no personal connection to the game suddenly drop money just for beta access. Some people thought this meant I hated the game which is far from the truth.  I like Wasteland 2.  I like how it's shaping up.  NOT RECOMMENDED doesn't necessarily mean ""bad game"" it means ""hold your money for now.""So why did I change my opinion?  Because a recent glut of updates has brought the game to a pretty polished state.  The UI, which was once a buggy mess that often refused to work, is now workable.  Combat no longer favors fast, strong blitzing attackers.  Some tweaks to the beginning of the game help lessen the impact of practically going out naked.  Your party will now do stuff as a group such as reloading.  There's a huge list of updates and changes I could go into but bottom line is that Wasteland 2 is now looking like a commercial product whereas the original beta release was somehow less playable than the leaked Van Buren alpha from a decade ago.I still have a hard time recommend dropping $60 simply because you're paying as much as a Kickstarter backer while recieving fewer rewards.  And that's just an unfortunate side effect of how Kickstarter works but if you really want to get into the game and seriously test it out, now's a good time.  Better yet, as of typing this there's a limited window for Kickstarter backers who didn't buy into the beta to get it for a flat $10.  I can recommend that.Wasteland 2 is looking like the Fallout 3/Van Buren we were promised years ago and I'm excited to see the finished product.--ORIGINAL POST--Before you drop 60 bones to get early access, understand something: This is a beta.  An ACTUAL beta, not the feature-complete-a-week-from-going-gold betas that most big companies sling around.  The game is unoptimized, a quarter of the skills are either not implemented or don't work correctly, there are bugs galore, the UI is a wreck, and it's only a small chunk of the final game.  I have a mid-range PC and get 18-40 frames at max but people with beefier rigs get maybe half that.That's not to say I don't enjoy the game or the testing process, because I do.  I backed this game and was looking forward to testing it and I'm not disappointed.  I love the game's aesthetic and design.  I see there's a good game buried here.  I'm not warning you away from the game itself, I'm warning you that unlike 90% of the games on Steam early access you are actually buying into a beta that's being actively worked on by the community, not a near finished stable product.

												I must say I ended up being somewhat disappointed. In case you never heard of this, it's a turn based roleplaying game set in a post apocalyptic world, extremely similiar to Fallout (the original Wasteland 1 is the spirtiual predecessor to Fallout). It offers a very good amount of content and great athmosphere. The world is well built and interesting. The story is ok (you pretty much just help local folks, the big bad only rears its ugly head every few hours for a line or two) - it's a game that is living more off the lore than off the plot, which is totally fine (see for an excellent example: Morrowind). The disappointing part is everything else. The attribute and skill system is just bad. There are only 3 viable character builds attribute wise. Attributes are completely detached from skills, so the only thing attributes concern is combat. So there are strong guys who can walk fast (melee) and guys who can shoot well and often (sniper) and intelligence chars who suck at combat but get more skills (skill donkey). There are a ton of skills, for example lockpicking, animal whispering or mechanical repair, as you'd expect from a RPG. But the difficulty scaling of skill checks is made in such a way that you need expert characters to keep up with the skill checks. So every character just gets 2 skills you'll dump all your skill points in every few levels. There is no customization or thinking involved in building a character after it is created and you start the game. Every level is just new skill points you have to spend in the same skills every time. Terribly boring. The skill checks themselves also ultimately become boring as hell, because every single chest in the game is locked AND trapped. It just becomes an annoying chore to disarm and open it. The reward is usually just 3 bullets of ammo and a bit of junk to vendor off. You'll also constantly come across containers with only 10-30% success chance. Prepare for the exciting meta gameplay of quicksaving and then trying and reloading as long as it takes to finally open the junk. Or simply ignoring it. But at least early on, the game is balanced around you really going after every scrap. Later on it becomes irrelevant instead.And the biggest problem, the combat system is very very bad. It looks like another take on the tried and true Jagged Alliance/XCOM formular. Only it's the blandest iteration I've seen so far. There are no skills, no classes. There is just one type of cover. At the end of the day there is nothing to do but just sit down all your chars behind a wall and keep firing at the nearest enemy until the fight is over. By the end I didn't even bother with cover anymore. I just left my guys standing in a big blob where the combat started and kept shooting. That's how dumb the combat here is. The maps also only very rarely offer interesting tactical opportunities. Most maps seem to have been made with aesthetics in mind and not tactics. Blackguards for example was WAY more inventive here, where you could clearly tell that the designers hand crafted every encounter and tried to get a unique twist out of every battle. In Wasteland it's just cannon fodder fights with a random fence you can use as cover if you want, or not, it won't make much of a difference.Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible game. What kept me going was exploring the world and seeing how the small surviving communities in this world worked. Still, I can't help but feel terribly disappointed over the massively wasted potential on display here.			"

												Wasteland 2 is a flawed gem.I'll start with the bad:-A lot of the weapon classes are downright useless. Pistols and submachine guns aren't worth bothering with period. Shotguns are alright, but you only really need one party member proficient in it for when you're in close quarters with a lot of enemies bunched together. Energy wepons are only useful against enemies with high armor ratings, so they really only come into play mid to late game. The only three weapon classes worth focusing on are Heavy Weapons, Assault Rifles, and Sniper Rifles. Even then, Heavy Weapons guzzle ammo like there's no tomorrow, which isn't terrible late-game when you have a ton or resources saved up, but they aren't practical early on. The only melee skill worth taking is Blunt Weapons because its high armor penetration keeps it relevent through to the end-game.-On normal difficulty, the combat is very challenging until mid-way through. You really feel like you have to conserve ammo and resources, and every move counts. But unless you intentially build your party to suck, everything gets pretty easy by end-game. I had more money and supplies than I knew what to do with.-I experienced huge performance issues in certain areas even on my 970. It was smooth sailing for the most part, but it's pretty clear the game isn't terribly well optimized. Being a turn-based game, FPS drops aren't a huge concern, but it shouldn't be a problem on a rig that far exceeds the recommended specs.Now onto the good:- The story is good and the writing is solid. The mains story, while not mind-blowingly amazing, is good enough to keep you ineterested, though it is suprisingly linear. The side quests are far more interesting, I think, and they offer much more freedom to approach it how you want. Almost every encounter has multiple outcomes depending on what choices you make, and the game does a good job of giving you the sense that these chioces actually matter. Many of the characters have rich backstories and opinions to offer. You will run into a lot of messy situations that you can choose to help resolve through diplomacy or violance or ignore altogether. At the end of the game, you are rewarded with a little slide show (à la Fallout) that goes into detail about all the characters and situations you ran into throughout your travels, which is a nice touch.- Inventory management. It took me around 55 hours to complete this game. I reckon I spend at least 10 of those hours in my inventory screen. If you're a freak like me, and you actually enjoy inventory management, this game is a treat. It is extremely easy to move items between party members, quickly see all their stats, and compare equipment to what you have equipped. It even tells you the average damage output per action point a given weapon will deal, which I think is pretty sweet.-Combat. No, it isn't a diverse and interesting as something like XCOM, but it does a good job of scrating that turn-based strategy itch. A lot of people have complained that the combat essentially boils down to ""shoot stuff until it dies,"" and, that's pretty much true. Unlike XCOM, there aren't any speicial abilities, and you won't find nearly as much cover to hide behind. Wasteland does offer a greater host of enemies and weapons, though, which keeps things interesting enough, espeially late game when your enemies start using energy weapons and suddenly your heavily armored super-soldier who could normally tank round after round of enemy fire suddenly loses half his health from a single hit.All-in-all, Wasteland 2 is a great turn-based roleplaying game that isn't without its flaws. If the forthcoming Director's editions addresses some of these, I think Wasteland 2 could be a truly fantastic RPG.7.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								I want to start this off with this comment; the game is currently in beta. That said, I am sure you have read that multiple times now through the various posts. So, where to start? PROS:--Character customization and looks in game. --Story is great thus far.--Combat will be great once game is complete.--Graphics / audio / and interface thus far are all great.--Gameplay is sweet. I said it may not be for everyone because combat is tactical / turn. So, think back old school with X-Com. I love that part of it, personal opinion. --Combat animations / effects are sweet. --Choice and consequence are a part of this game. You save someone from drowning, his parents offer him to you as an added party member if you want. Plenty of characters to change up the party.--Different skills are used for different things. Obviously, ha ha. Those chances to use the skills on a frequent basis are not persistent in other games. There are a lot of opportunity to use each skill you have in your party. I like that. --A TON of interactions within the world. Be it digging stuff up, repairing gadgets, even down to repairing toasters, ha ha! (definitely have someone in your party that can repair them, because you never know what's stored in one!)--Completed game will hands down be great.CONS:--Loading a save will often change the portrait of your character(s) if they are created from scratch. A minor annoyance, unless you get into combat, then you have to go by name. Or, if you made a guy and your portrait is now a gal.--Combat, sometimes, can be a bit.. Interesting. You have a sniper, that has 0.0% chance of hitting a target. That same target now moves behind cover, and you now have an 80.00% chance to hit. --Combat again, some enemies have ridiculous move / attacks. They will move across the screen, attack you twice, then move again... BETA, remember. It will frustrate / annoy you though, ha ha. --Make sure you get a dedicated surgeon / healer. I roamed around for a bit trying to find someone that could heal my wounds, to no avail. --There are times when walking around on the world map you are accosted by bandits, raiders, whatever, only to enter combat (if you choose) and find everything dead. Good for the free loot, bad because you never know what will really happen!--The game crashes from time to time AFTER combat is completed. --Some game choices have to be made on the spot, you do not have a lot of time to fart around and trying to figure the puzzle out. You take your time, (drowning boy for example,) he will die. Some people may not like that part. --With no tutorial yet, character creation can be.. difficult. --Finally; some characters you may spec for conversation bonus dialogues, sale prices, et-cetera. Once you enter dialogue, there is no way to change who is talking, so in cities, towns, you want to lead the party with the talker if that is your thing.Fans of Fallout 1 and 2 need to play this game, awesome on so many levels! There's real consequences for your actions, believable dialogue, survival based resource alocation (water), and toasters!What to say about this game, there really is nothing else to say but for you the reader to choose do you want that really nice mouse or keyboard or do you want a peice of history... I am from Canada and @ $59.99 its worth every penny, from the short 10 hrs i have played of this game... see my person reaction to all sorts of game including this one @ Live Streamhttp://www.twitch.tv/apandaco 8pm PST Daily.Youtube Playlist of Wasteland 2https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIYwV8V2ObyHz395njTCSOfoW_U34T8qjStart Here If you want to see gameplay :

												Wasteland 2 – 8/10 (This review is based on PATCH 2)The good: Maps are often rewarding to explore Overall art style Tactical round based combats A lot of weapons and items A polished first act Overall Writing (even though the quality varies) Interesting (while also over the top) Factions Companions  A good use of choices & consequences (Telltale/Bioware take a note here) A lot of inside jokes and fan service Music from Mark Morgan (not as memorable as what he did for Fallout/Planescape though) Radio transmission (especially during first act)The bad: The second act of the game still has a lot of oddities, glitches and bugs Some skills seems forced for the sake of re-playability, and would have been better off combined/graded or as perks Not be able to shoot other parts of the body besides headshots (thus no enemy slow down or force a weapon drop) Your base team will never develop beyond their skill stats and your fantasy Heavy reuse of character portraits You cannot set own traps You cannot sneak...and the ugly: Chance evaluation feels broken to me (from weapon jams to critical misses to ...well everything) Heavy quest items which you have to drag alongVerdict:For lovers of classic RPG and the setting i surely can recommend it. I backed it two years ago with a good sum of money and I don't regret it. Will it be remembered a classic 10 years from now? Probably not, but it will sure find it's fans...at least I'm one of them now.On a sidenote:Even though Brian Fargo makes fun of DLCs in the game, I wouldn't mind to explore more maps and side-stories with my team. The hub like system seems so predestined for such things. It's a missed opportunity to not give fans and in the end Fargo the chance to continue refine Wasteland 2. Since he could live off it for years.			"

												I cannot recommend Wasteland 2.  I played and heavily enjoyed the original, and have played all Fallouts.  I enjoy most turn-based tactics titles like X-COM (original and new), Fire Emblem, Silent Storm, what have you, and Wasteland 2 is not worth your time.  It's mechanically shallow, the skill system is a joke, and weapon types are ludicrously imbalanced.  It's a completely bare-bones system, skills are absurdly redundant (somethign like 6 different skills to open boxes for six different kinds of boxes), the loot system is has zero appeal, and you'll quickly find that the only weapons worth using are your assault rifles, with maybe one sniper specialist.  Ah, and explosives, which all have 100% perfect aim regardless of your demolitions skill and can trivialize most encounters.  Due to clunky armor systems, you'll find yourself taking off your armor to fight some of the game's toughest monsters because they actually do less damage to you without your armor.Mines are annoying.  You'll find your characters disarming hundreds of these through the game just to walk through, and they do enough damage that even one can cripple your party - which means that either you're going to walk really carefullly all the time, or most likely, you'll just reload when you run into a mine - something I'd normally feel guilty about doing, but let's face it, the only reason this happens is because there's no formation system to speak of.  A further consequence is that there's really no good way to position your characters before a battle.  Sensibly, you'd like to put all your guys behind cover, maybe leave your sniper further away.  Except in Wasteland, you're almost bound to trip their detection, giving them the first shot.  After awhile, you don't bother with setting up with the clunky system, you just switch all your guys to long range weapons and have them alpha strike, or maybe have your snipers shoot simultaneously at a target, because anything else is likely to give them first shot, and get you killed.The story is nothing to write home about, and the writing is okay, but it gets wearing after awhile the sheer amount of pop culture thrown in.    Honey badgers were cute the first time you ran into them, but after awhile they're an annoyance, especially since they are essentially zero threat unless you screw up and let them get in melee range, after which they're deadlier than anything short of a robot-death-machine, but also have ridiculous number of hit points, meaning that early on you're going to be kiting them.  Speaking of which, at higher difficulty levels, hit points become ludicrous, which I've always felt is the sign of a lazy difficulty system.Anyway, not recommend.   Mediocrity.Edit:  Due to the multiple ridiculous comments saying that I had played the game ""too much"" and thus can't comment on how mediocre it is, I must mention that I did not actually play ~130 hrs of the game, I use the magical ability to run games and do other things at the same time without closing them down through the magic of alt-tab.  Realistically, I probably put in ~30-40 hrs into the game, which was far too much because the game is not very good.And seriously, the game is super easy on anything but the hardest difficulty, which difficult primarily in terms of annoyance rather than tactical difficulty from things like large hp pools, forced kiting, high armor making already generally inferior weapons like SMGs lack any utility in the game whatsoever, and any trap, mine, or explosive being able to OHKO or at least cripple you.  The game is much easier than playing X-Com on the easiest difficulty level, the Fallouts on normal difficulty, or Wasteland 1.But regardless of difficulty, the game is simply a very shallow experience, in terms of either tactical combat or story.

												While I really enjoy Wasteland 2, my recommendation would have to come with a huge dose of ""your mileage may vary"". It's a long, slow, burn, and if you like to jump straight into things, or find yourself easily losing concentration or focus, you may find yourself giving up on Wasteland 2 before it really begins to shine. But some patience will pay off, if the genre interests you. Of course, if you don't like turn-based strategy games, then you should be giving this a pass. The writing is really top-notch in this game, and I found it both enjoyable and rewarding to play through.Focused on a team of 4 rangers (which you can create yourself, or use several pre-built characters), and using very detailed attributes and skills - the CLASSIC system (Coordination, Luck, Awareness, Strength, Speed, Intelligence, Charisma), it took me a while before I realised that some attributes and stats were extremely important, while others... could be passed over, especially depending on the followers (NPCs) you decided to acquire. Unfortunately, it can take some trial and error before you realise what you should be doing with your characters and what is important for them to have. Or... you could just forge ahead anyway! I quite liked that there were no classes, giving you the freedom to do whatever you wanted with your characters. You could have a guy carrying heavy weapons, while being a melee tank and also healing... for example. Though this can also be a negative, if you wanted to see class specialisation, perks, and so on.And so, I was introduced to the fun (???) of character creation. And uhh... naming my characters, which proved to be a disaster... after an embarrassingly long time, I settled on ""One"", ""Two"", ""Three"", and ""Four"". Original, right. The vast array of skills can be intimidating at first, and leveling them up (especially at later levels) can become quite frustrating and very grindy, but it does add a lot of depth to the game. One thing I did not like as much though... how much time it took, and the animation, whenever you wanted to use a skill. Using a skill meant that your Ranger (or follower) would have to move to the location (clumping up your Rangers if you moved them all as a group makes this an exhausting chore), before an animation begins. With the vast amount of skill checks in this game, the checks do add up and can become very time consuming and therefore annoying.Additionally, there is quite a lot of travel involved in this game, both in the larger world map, and also within smaller exploreable areas. Even if you're not in a rush, the travel can quickly become aggravating. I wished for quicker travel myself, despite the fact I don't mind slower paced games.While you are limited to Arizona and California, one after the other, the world map is still pretty expansive, with secret areas to discover dotted around the place. Travelling isn't worry free though - not only are there standard enemy encounters (which can become annoying quite quickly), but also some more welcome encounters, which is a bit different and somewhat refreshing in comparison to the usual fare where encounters in the wild just end up being endless fights. There are also two unique mechanics: water and radiation. Your team carries canteens, which can, and should be refilled at any well and oasis you find. Once you run out of water, your team starts to dehydrate and can die. Similarly, in the post-apocalyptic wasteland, nukes have left lingering radiation in various areas - so you also have to watch out for contamination... or again, you'll find your team dropping like flies.The musical score, sound effects, and even the voice acting is all done quite well, and combines well with the graphics to provide a smooth and enjoyable spectacle. The graphics are not the best in the world, but they do set the tone of the game well, and are very appropriate to the game's setting - harsh, gritty, and unforgiving.Combat is generally quite straight forward, with the standard turn-based combat fare reappearing here, though more in-depth compared to some other games due to the more extensive attribute and skill system. Your attributes and skills will determine in what order your characters go, and how much they can do in their turn. There are also crouch and cover mechanics, though some weapons can destroy cover. However... there is not much else. There are no real special combat moves, or combat specific skills - they increase your damage and hit percentage, and that's it. No executes, no cloak, etc. While there is headshot and ambush... they are honestly not that great. It's just point, click, hope to hit (the RNG seems to be a bit odd, with a lot of misses even on shots with a high hit percentage), rinse and repeat. There is no cover, no flush, no interesting and genuinely unique abilities.Additionally, RNG can always turn around and give you a hard time. Or... adversely affect the enemies. Critical hits, critical misses, weapon effects, and weapon jams can all have a surprisingly large affect on the outcome of an encounter. I also like the emphasis on scarcity and the need for careful management of your resources, which is quite fitting for a game like this, especially the ammo. If you just blaze away, you'll be out of ammo before you know it, so you do need to think before you act. Vendors are limited too... The combat is decent, and I enjoyed it, but I will admit there could have been more to it.While your team revolves around 4 characters, you are able to recruit a number of NPCs to join your team (3 followers for a maximum team size of 7). While you are nominally in control of them, leadership is important here as there is the chance your ""follower"" (only if they are in a good mood) will just decide to do their own thing in combat - running into cover, shooting something you didn't want shot, etc. Overall, the combat is fun and challenging, with a variety of enemies to conquer - both man and animal.Despite there only being two areas to explore, Wasteland 2 boasts a wide variety of quests, many of which have a variety of ways to finish - but be careful, your choices do have serious and lasting consequences. Which is something else I really enjoy about the game - your choices DO matter. And have a ripple effect. This is not just limited to quests, there are some actions while just generally playing and moving around which could have an affect, especially based on which followers are with you. Do you dig up some graves? Do you disarm the alarm? Do you deliberately trip it off? Do you use strength or a grenade to break a wall? Do you help this faction, or the other faction? Mediate a ceasefire or shoot everybody up? The variety of ways to overcome things in your way is definitely a highlight of the game. I really enjoyed the varying options available, and weighing them up, based on what you want your team to do. Your decisions may cause followers to leave your party, or even turn on you. Not only does this create an interesting in-game dynamic where what you do will affect how other in-game characters interact with your party, but this also allows for extensive replayability, if you so choose. ""What if"" questions are plentiful in this game.Finally, I particularly loved the odd references and humour. The Wasteland 1 disc was a particular highlight. While not particularly game-making, or breaking, it was something that I enjoyed. The grand adventure that plays out, in addition to the continued support and patching by inXile, make me give this game two thumbs up.			"

Early Access Review
								Fans of Fallout 1 and 2 need to play this game, awesome on so many levels! There's real consequences for your actions, believable dialogue, survival based resource alocation (water), and toasters!*****Review will be updated closer to release************Additional Info******Okay so further to what I origionally wrote here's a few key points- Have you ever played one of your old games and though what would it be like to play this exact game with todays graphics? Well that's essentially what InXile did; and that is brilliant! InXile had a winning formula, and they did what a lot of studio's seem unable to do; stuck with it highlighting the best features rather than changing them.  - InXile have done a great job of listening to their origional backers, and not simply taking the money and then making a game for a different target audience- like say MW:O- This is the first game of the year that lives up to the hype! Rome 2, CoH 2, BF4, and many others were huge disappointments this year. So I''m glad one studio was able to deliver on their promises.- If you're into Baldurs Gate type games take a look at InXile's other game Torment: Tides of Numenera, which I feel is safe to recommend after seeing how this turned out- Understand that this game is fully 3D however the camera is top-down isometric like: Jagged Alliance, Fallout 1+2, And most D&D games			"

												Wasteland 2 is a decent CRPG, but it's lacking in the depth that FO1 and 2 offered.The character creation is intimidating at first, but the manual will explain things. For the most part it avoids having any single attribute as a dump stat, although charisma and luck come close. The skill system could use some work. Three dialogue skills is two too many, and a lot of non-combat skills are just various ways to open loot crates, although there are several cases where high repair or demolitions are needed to progress in a quest. Strangely, your attributes only affect your derived stats - the majority of which are sadly hidden from you - but have no effect on your skills.Combat is a huge part of this game, and while it is fun it's also rather simple. It uses a turn based system similar to Fallout, but you get control of each member of your party. There's an ambush attack similar to overwatch from XCOM which is pretty useful, but there aren't any aimed shots except for headshots, which are pretty boring. The weapons are seriously imbalanced, with assault rifles becoming really good about 1/3 of the way through, and godlike in the end-game.The quest design is decent; there are a handful of major quests in both areas of the game that are pretty complex and fulfilling to solve but the majority of them are short and combat focused. The quests in the first half are more polished while the back half feels rushed and incomplete.Wasteland 2 is worth playing especially if you loved the old Fallout games and wish Van Buren was real. A word of warning: the game can still have some pretty poor performance even if you meet recommended specs.			"

												Wasteland 2 truly is a fantastic game, but you won’t see that until you’ve spent roughly 10-20 hours on this sprawling RPG. The game suffers from an archaic user interface and the first half of the game isn’t very notable, I’d recommend having one character invest into the Outdoorsman skill, because random encounters can easily take off another 20 minutes of your time without really providing much of interest, plus you will likely find yourself walking away from your screen quite a few times as you wait for your characters to move all the way back on a map. It’s a slow, slow game. Yet, Wasteland 2 has so much to offer. The second half of the game is an immediate improvement in quest and map design and features interesting factions and story choices. The second half opens up a lot more, giving you less directed main quests and giving you a good amount of freedom to solve your way through side quests at your own pace. The roleplaying aspect of Wasteland 2 is great. Designing your specialized characters and seeing how they make their way through a story with real consequences offers a good deal of replay value. If you are patient and give Wasteland 2 the time it needs to show its potential, it will be a tremendously enjoyable experience. Time definitely worth investing. Full review:

Early Access Review
								UPDATE: August 13, 2014I have been trying to not play too much in an attempt to minimize the amount of replaying the beginning of the game. As a result, I didn't dive too deep into the latest update but I poked around enough to confirm one thing: this game is easily one of the most solid Early Access titles available (in my humblest of opinions). The positives from my original review still stand and some of the negatives have been resolved. Ammo no longer needs to be equipped to be used; simply have it on your character and you are good to go. I didn't have nearly as many instances where my characters got stuck (in fact I don't recall sticking a single time). There were few instances out in the wastes where a click wouldn't register but I think this was more due to me moving my mouse at the same time as I clicked so this could be user error. In my short playthrough I encountered one oddity that was so minor it's barely worth mentioning. It doesn't appear all of the item names are in use when making a trade. I found when trading items such as bullets, the log would read ""Bojangles traded <blank> with Gidget"" where blank was obviously missing the item name. Otherwise, this new update has definitely improved upon an already soild looking title. It faster, smoother, and slightly more violent (I shot a guy and his head and arms came off. I mean, c'mon, what's not to like?). While I still recommend the game even in its current state, I would suggest holding off for now simply because it is (I have heard) releasing soon. That said, if you don't mind restarting when updates come out and not being able to progress past a certain point due to missing content, I can't really give you any reason to not dive in. It's really shaping up to be something awesome and I can't wait to get my hands on the full thing.Additional thoughts: There were two instances that sort of threw me off and I'm not sure if this is due to my not paying attention or just a need for tutorial/paying more attention. I wanted to mention them here to potentially help new players or perhaps confirm what others may have felt.- When leveling, I expected there to be arrows to add or subtract skill points. Instead there were simply light blue boxes with no real indication that you were meant to click the boxes to add points. This may have been the way it was previously but it threw me off at first. Easily solved by slight investigation. It just wasn't obvious how I was meant to allocate points.- I didn't realize I had completed the first couple of objectives in the beginning and the journal didn't really seem to indicate I had either. I ran around aimlessly for a bit before I thought to radio in my progress at which point I was able to move forward. I'm not sure if this is just a lack of me paying attention when completing some of those objectives or if the game just wants to put an emphasis on the radio as a communication device at all times (they do say in the beginning to radio in often to report progress and while I took this as an indication I needed to radio in to level, it could have had other implications). ORIGINAL REVIEWDo I recommend shelling out 60 dollars if you're just looking for something new to play? No. Do I recommend shelling out 60 dollars if this has been on your radar and you just can't wait to get your hands on it? Maybe.Do I recommend shelling out 60 dollars if you want to see this game evolve, have a hand in seeing HOW this game evolves, and want a taste of what is to come? Definitely.I was hesitant to spend the asking price on this Beta (Deluxe Edition goodies included but let's be honest, I wanted to play the game). I spent days watching videos on YouTube, reading impressions, looking at Steam reviews, trying to convince myself not to buy it yet. I caved. But I'm glad I did.The current state of the game is buggy. Sometimes buttons don't seem to activate when clicked, sometimes characters get stuck. Sometimes the game seems to hang while loading. Some thing aren't explained very well (Protip: make sure ammo is EQUIPPED or else you will not be able to reload). But all of this is to be expected in a development build. Have I experienced anything in the game yet that made me ragequit? No. In fact, I had to pull myself away from the game after I bought just to eat.Combat is your basic turn based affair ala XCOM or Fallout Tactics. All actions use Action Points and can be saved up between turns (to a max) so there is definitely some call for strategy prior to moving yoru characters. Cover can be used and even destroyed to get the upper hand on your opponents which I always find to be a nice touch. There are plenty of opportunities for loot and this is made even more possible by allowing players to lockpick, break doors open with brute force, or blow things up with explosives. The choice is yours. The maps I have played so far have had nice secret areas to explore, mounds of dirt to dig to find goodies, and branching paths that, while the end goal is the same, allow for additional exploration on the players part.The character creation is also quite well done at the moment. You can choose a group of four based on premade characters ranging from a demolitions expert, melee specialist, sniper, or even a jack of all trades. You can also create your entire team from scratch, putting points into attributes and points into three categories of skills: Combat (assault rifle, energy weapon, pistol, etc), Knowledge (brute force, lockpicking, safecracking, toaster repair (no I'm not joking), etc), and General (surgeon, barter, evasion, field medic, etc). There are a multitude of group dyanmics to play around with here. You can also pick up additional NPCs for your group that you then gain control over in battle and exploration (they sometimes ""lose control"" and go rogue during combat. I'm not sure what dictates this but it never seems to detract from the action). All in all, I have actually been extremely impressed with the current state of the game. I went in expecting, to be honest, not much and I was pleasantly surprised. While I agree with many people out there that 60 may be a bit steep, I have absolutely no regrets with my purchase. I am looking forward to playing more and seeing what is offered and I truly believe the end result will be a phenomenal experience and worthy of the price of entry.			"

												This is a long review so let me give a tldr: I personally do not understand the plethora of positive reviews this game has garnered. If don't know about this game, save yourself some time and money and just boot up Fallout Tactics. For me, this game doesn't live up to it's reputation. It struck me as an unpolished and uninteresting product. I kickstarted this game, and was excited to play it partly because of its purportedly stellar writing. Unfortunately, the basic format of tactics rpgs colludes with the lack of mechanical depth to severely limit the relevance of the writing. So while descriptions of areas that appear in a small text box are indeed well-executed and occasionally evocative, the lack of any meaningful interaction between your party members (or, indeed, any character or NPC) means that whatever that shows up in that little text box feels like window dressing. The lack of complexity in the gameplay means that what's contained in the textbox is also largely irrelevant to the experience of playing. The end result is pretty hollow. I suspect you could complete the entire game without ever glancing at the writing. This feeds into a more insidious problem, where the game's overall and immediate plots start to feel like a procession of meaningless skirmishes connected by an ephemeral charade of narrative, the kind you see in any MMO questline. ""But hey, this is a tactics RPG! Who cares about characters or writing or any of that crap?"" Valid point. But unfortunately the game's shortfalls here are many, and worse. Where the writing was well-executed but irrelevant, the gameplay is unpolished and shallow. A problem for a game who's central focus is something like tactical combat. Combat in WL2 is a linear shootout, a numbers game where there are no meaningful tactical decision to be made once you're outside of a merchant's screen. I could make a really long list of gripes here, and cite the basically equidistant ranges of weapons, how gear is the single most important character element, aggressively incorrect ""Hit %"" in the UI, lack of any enemy AI outside of ""rush up to face and use gun/crowbar"", zero terrain relevance, and a hundred others. But the takeaway is that lack of polish I mentioned. The combat dies from a thousand of these tiny cuts, each of them trivial by themselves but fatally boring taken together. And honestly, it could maybe have survived all those problems if the game had interesting choices to make. But. Remember that lack of mechanical depth I mentioned? In WL2, your only meaningful interaction with the world happens through skills. Skills have basically two purposes in the game: Opening Boxes and Murder. Social skills are a member of the former category. Maybe that doesn't seem like a problem, as hey, Fallout 1 and 2 come dreadfully close to doing the same thing. But compare this tactical rpg-elements game to other tactics classics like XCOM, Icewind Dale or Final Fantasy Tactics. Different Classes or Abilities on the battlefield dramatically change the landscape of any individual battle. ""Should I Suppress or Flush?"" is a question you have in XCOM only after you've acquired those abilities. Should I tank that group or kite them? Lightning Bolt or Fireball? No skill or weapon or indeed, any element in WL2 is going to approach altering your game choices, because all skills do is open boxes and give slight bonuses to hit chance. Wasteland 2 relies on ancient game ideas with no new spin on them, and worse, seems to forget many lessons that've been learned about these systems in the last fifteen years. Which alone, would be acceptable, even enjoyably ""retro"". But the lack of polish or depth to these systems made playing the game aggressively monotonous. If this game had come out in 1999 it would have been a reasonable but ultimately forgettable companion to the then-game-market. But honestly, there are better places for your time and money, and if you're expecting a post-apocalyptic XCOM or Fallout experience then you're looking in the wrong place.			"

												This game... Im not even done yet. Coming from a fallout fan id say is spot on what i wanted, Game is about tactics and smarts not reaction times (Check), Game is full of lore (Check), The maker of it took 1 million of his own personal money and used it to make the game better (Check), No dlc (Check!). Now past that theres more. The lore is so intense i spend lots of my time just reading lore. If you like lore then you could buy this game just for that. There is no ""reaction time wins"" here. That means no, if you call ""skill"" seeing who can shoot the fastest then you wont find that ""skill"" here. Skill here is about whos the smartest. And how you positioned your people. If you bring even the best weapon to an easy fight you can still loose if your stupid. This game is by one of the best game designers you can trust. Brian Fargo. He has never let me down on a game. Be it Fallout 1, Fallout 2, any game. And even when he did sell fallout to bethesda he made sure it was a good company. He could of sold it to EA im sure but he picked another good company. Fallout 3 may be diffrent from the old fallouts but its certainly not a bad game. Same with vegas. So in short its a great game with acutal skill good lore made by a REALLY good game designer and company and NO DLC. None. Also you can trust this from me. Im practicly an expert on old and new fallouts. Just check how much time ive played fallout 1, fallout 2, fallout 3, fallout nv. Also i even got more time on consoles. So again im not just some random guy i know whats a good game and a bad game.Also there is msny little things in the game that make you think lots. For example a woman wanted me to put her out of her misery i did so, then a kid told me he was gonna tell the authorites and i shouldnt of done it, i had to kill the kid. I think about that scenario alot. Theres many more like it so that when your done it makes you think long and hard about all youve had to do. There really isnt winning in this game because if your human you will find a way to do something horrible that has to be done. Even if you dont do side quests you could still end up having to fight a kid. So this game is one not like cod where you blindly shoot, it makes you think about each person you meet or kill.			"

												As a lover of Tactical and turn based games my whole life, is with a heavy heart that a say i can't recomend this game to anyone. Tactically the game is very poor,there is none to little strategy involved, the levels are so flat and linear that the battles does not have any changes from one to another, it's very rare to find a point of advantage and there are just a few elements to act as cover in the levels, the developers said they would add special moves, the only thing they add was a ""headshot"" option. You'll see your rangers missing a lot of shots, is normal to miss 5 or 6 70% shots IN A ROW, whille your enemies have much more AP and acuracy, to much sand in the eyes of the desert rangers?.There is only HeadShot(Useless, since your rangers are blind), Ambush (wich is pretty much useless), and that is. There is no advanced tactics, there is not even a simple stealth mode, were you can use a sneaky char to surprise your enemies. With no Special moves and a very linear environment, the battles are very repetitive and purelly luck based. The developers didn't keept their project promisses,just like the special skills, early videos featured a lot of armors models showing in the characters, but they simply chose to change this, so now, does not matter the armor you have equiped, your ranger will just change their clothes, so you can have a power armor equiped and your ranger may still show a ragged shirt.Character customization is minimal and the models are so ugly that you could easily mistake it for a game of the 90's.The game offers a false sense of open world but actually is very linear, the base missions are very boring ""go to place, click something, come all the way back"", the roleplay is also very shallow even with the very good story.The story is very good and the game isn't that bad, but i can't say that i'm satisfied, both the hight price and hype didn't help with it. After 25 years the wait is finally over, and i wasn't worth it.Wait for a 75% sale to try this.			"

												I strongly can't recommend this title at the current price point of 40 bucks and am disappointed that it has been launched in this condition.Its not polished, the AI is ridiculous, the ending had absolutely nothing to do with what I actually did in the game, with key npcs that I killed still living and running the show. The characters that I recruited throughout the game only one of them made the ending credits and her future was forgettable.Regarding the AI for a tactical turn based strategic game for the npc AI to do exactly the same thing for 80 hrs is unforgiveable. All enemies without fail bum rush you from off the screen moving further in one turn than your sniper can shoot. Worse valueable player npcs without fail do there best to commit suicide every single round.I found a couple of quests that can be turned in infinitely for xp and rewards. Not a huge deal for single player game but considering how linear the progression is I don't understand how it was missed.Armor is so broken currently. Buying the most expensive armor in the game will result in you being one shot by anything with an energy weapon whereas running around naked will have that plasma just tickle your exposed fleshy bits.Some quests particularly in the second half of the game dont conclude appropriately. Free slaves, woot freedom, they stand outside the cages with a bland thank you interaction.Its not that this couldn't have been a great game its just that everything has been dumbed down so much that the depth and complexity has been gutted from offering leaving a grindy on rails choose a or b limited experience.Plenty of the skills are absolutely worthless which really makes me wonder why they included them at all.Anyway I hope they do the right thing over the next year and patch or turn it over to the community; for me the ending was mass effect 3 cringe worthy and I hope they have better ideas for Torment.

												If you're a fan of the original Wasteland, the long-awaited sequel hits just about all the right notes you'd hope for. It builds upon the original's style, writing, skill systems and combat in a completely logical way, without getting ""too modern"". It's also chock-full to the brim with references to the original, both in dialog and in the locations you visit (the whole first half of the game is basically a love-letter to the fans, as a matter of fact). So if you're coming into it from the same nostalgia-fueled background as me, you'll probably enjoy the game. As for everyone else, I am really not so sure. The game is good, but far from perfect. The biggest issue is probably that the combat can get to be a bit simplistic and tedious after a while. Although there are elements of strategy to it, you almost never need to do anything ""outside of the box"" to successfully win a battle. The story is OK, but nothing you haven't seen before - a post-apocalyptic wasteland threatened by a megalomaniacal antagonist... yadda, yadda, yadda. The writing is good overall, striking a nice balance between serious and playful, though some of the dialogue ends up being a bit cheesy (especially towards the end). Two other big issues are the pace and length of the game. It really takes a while to get rolling. This is partly due to the aforementioned tedium in combat, but mostly because of the sheer size of the game. It becomes pretty obvious after a while that the developers just decided ""screw it, this is our one chance to do this, and by god, let's go all out""... and ""all out"" they most certainly did. They threw everything they thought of in there, plus an extra kitchen sink. On one hand, that's admirable and I completely understand it. But I also just ended up feeling that maybe they should have scaled back their ambition just a tad, which would have allowed more time to tighten up and polish the experience overall. There are quite a few bugs in the game, at least as it initially launched. Thankfully, there was nothing completely game-breaking that I found, but there were definitely some bugs in various quests and dialogue options, and a few other glitches that popped up here and there. Finally, I also felt that the skill and weapon systems weren't quite balanced properly. After completing the game, it became kind of obvious that some of my skill, attribute and weapon investments were more or less useless. Again, not the end of the world, but the game could definitely use some additional balance in its systems.Overall though, none of these minor issues greatly affected my personal appreciation and enjoyment of the game. I backed this Kickstarter project on day one, and don't regret it for a second. That said, I am also pretty forgiving when it comes to these sorts of things, especially when I know what a labor of love the project was for Brian Fargo and his team. So while I do recommend it overall, I would suggest it primarily for fans of old-school turn-based RPG/tactical-type games. Casual players, or those on the fence should probably check out some gameplay videos of the combat, in particular, to see if it's up your alley. If so, and if you are willing to look past a few minor flaws, definitely give Wasteland 2 a shot.			"

												When inXile Entertainment announced the Director's Cut of Wasteland 2 and promised modding support I was very sceptical. I had played the original Wasteland 2 until I reached California and stopped playing because the gameplay was dull and repetitive and the story not motivating enough to compensate for the deficiencies of the gameplay; all in all, the game was in desperate need of a powerful modding tool for the modding community to take over and fulfill those promises Brian Fargo and his team had made in the first place.Let us go back as early as 2012 when fans on the inXile forums started talking about their hopes for the game being moddable. These hopes were not posted on some obscure, way off website but on inXile's own forum. However, after the game's release in 2014, it became clear pretty soon that the game was unmoddable. This notion was voiced again not on some obscure website but on inXile's own forum. After the release of the Director's Cut, technical director John Alvarado came up with a lot of excuses and some vague plans on modding. More than four years after the first customers and backers asked for a modding tool, Mr. Alvarado was still talking hypothetically about the possibility of releasing a modding tool if enough people were interested in it. Now, if we take a look at inXile's forum again and search for ""modding support"", the only thing we find is that modding support has virtually ended.A well-known modding site has a total of 48 mods for Wasteland 2, mostly collections of character portraits, a few save games, some camera improvements, nothing more. Now you probably ask yourself why I'm riding this horse to death. I've spent some 170 hours with the game and should be content about it. Am I? No, not at all. This game is ""from the producers of the original Fallout"", so it has some solid games to compete with. Brian Fargo told his backers that the entire crowdfunding context gave him the freedom to create the game he wanted to create, without any interference from publishers. Thus, he can't blame the publisher for any imperfections. Does the game have any deficits? Despite so many critics who were eager to praise the game and so many fanboys who defend literally every game they own without being able to criticize them properly, I've to say that the game has a number of severe deficits. That's the reason why I wanted a modding tool, so that all the modders interested in modding the game could do so and improve upon it, and that's also the reason why I'm so disappointed.Let's just take a look at the main points that need improvement and that could possibly be improved by modders if they had access to a decent modding tool, and I'm not talking about the localization in other languages referred to by John Alvarado because this isn't modding but should have been done by inXile in the first place.1. Repetitive and Limited Random EncountersA great part of the game consists of walking around Arizona and California. Do you remember those random encounters from Fallout 1 or Fallout 2? Yes? They were cool, weren't they? Moonshiners being attacked by geckos, caravans defending themselves against all sorts of critters or raiders, different factions fighting against each other - there was so much going on in the wastes that you could travel across the world map for hours without feeling bored. In comparison, Wasteland 2 has a very limited set of random encounter maps to chose from, and the enemies are virtually always the same. Damn, even Fallout Tactics had more diversity. A modding tool that allowed for an easy implementation of random encounters could solve this issue.2. Option to Turn Off Silly, Immersion Breaking ElementsFallout New Vegas had this wonderful concept of turning off weirder elements of the game world by not choosing the trait Wild Wasteland. By doing so, you could get rid of the more silly elements of the game. In Wasteland 2, there are numerous highly immersion breaking elements. Not every gamer likes these silly elements. On the one hand we have a harsh, deadly environment, on the other we have all kind of toasters or silly shrines. Just take a look at the inXile forum again and you'll see that gamers have voiced this complaint before. There should have been an option to turn these elements off in the first place. However, having a decent modding tool a modder could get rid of this nonsense. Quite a few players would probably like this.3. Lackluster Scripting and Unresponsive Game WorldHave you ever returned to Highpool or other places just to see that the NPCs had nothing to say or do anymore after you've finished the respective quests? You could do this back in the 1980s or early 90s when NPCs did nothing except standing around 24/7, waiting for the PC to talk to them. Is this extremely oldschool gaming, or is it just laziness on part of Brian Fargo and his team? The game world is unresponsive, the NPCs never really come to life: in short, the famed story telling totally fails in terms of mimesis, it fails in creating a living and responsive environment. After you've finished the respective quest lines, the NPCs literally cease to exist: there's no possible interaction anymore. The game just wants you to procede at all costs to hide its shallowness. There are great story-tellers in the modding scene, so why not give them the opportunity to work on that and improve on it? Perhaps we would end up some day and have some properly scripted AI - who knows?4. Tactical DepthIf the doctor had dropped me on my head at my birth, I would probably still have no problems defeating the AI of this game. I could try munching Prosac and emptying a bottle of whiskey before playing this game, but I don't think this would be a solution. A lot of modders have come up with AI modifications for other games, so why doesn't inXile give them the chance to do this with this game as well? After all, Brian Fargo and his compadres can't be that blind to ignore the deficits of their AI. If they don't see the necessity of improving it properly, why not give the modders a chance to do so?When playing the game, I had so many ""♥♥♥♥ You, Brian Fargo!"" moments that I stopped counting them. I've never finished the game: it ended up deinstalled like so many other games that failed to impress me on so many different levels. It has its moments, it has its potential, but it has failed to elaborate on them, and that is a shame because I've tried so hard to like this game, to enjoy it. The promise of a modding tool hasn't been fulfilled, so there's no chance that anyone will come up with a solution to these deficits. Brian Fargo is already working on his next big title, on his next big promises. Perhaps it's just John Alvarado who isn't doing his job correctly, who knows? But it should be clear to all those responsible that they've missed a big chance. Just take a look at games like Morrowind or Fallout 3: they're old, but they have a solid modding community who has access to some powerful modding tools. These games are still being played because of their modding support. You could have done the same, but you've failed completely.DO I RECOMMEND THIS TITLE?If you belong to those players who rush through a game without enjoing its details, then there's probably not very much to complain about with this game. However, if you belong to those gamers who linger around, enjoy the details, the characters, the locations, the writing itself, variety, or complexity, you could end up pretty disappointed by this title. Thus, as I belong to the latter group, I cannot recommend this game. If I could give a neutral assessment, I would do so, but I can't, so I'll end up with a negative recommendation and the hope that some day someone will come up with a modding tool before this game is as outdated as the original 1980s Wasteland it boasts of.

												It's okay, but not great.  Its clear a huge amount of effort went into the artwork and world creation, so kudos to the developers for that.  But for all that work, the truth is the gameplay doesn't feel all that compelling and quickly devolves into a tedius slog.  Despite the size of the world, you really don't feel ""free to explore"" it, because the area you are allowed to explore is artifically constrained depending on where you are in the plot.  Once you finally gain access to a new area, there is no reason to go back to the old ones.  It all results in highly linear gameplay, rather than world exploration.  There are other ways to control the plot development, rather than walling-off the player.Adding to the tedium, about halfway through the game it gets really preach-ey.  And I mean really.   It's clear the developers have a social message they are trying to send, but it's so relentlessly beaten over the player's head that it comes off with a very self-righteous air.  I just wanted to play a game, but I felt like I was reading a never-ending steam of someone's angry Facebook rants.Lots of potential, and it looks like a lot of work went into it...but I regret purchasing the game.

												Wasteland 2 is an isometric party-based role-playing game set in a post-apocalyptic southeastern United States.The Great:- Deep and expansive story that starts quickly and expands out in numerous branching paths- Real player choices that change both the progression of the story and how gameplay mechanics play out (can avoid combat using conversation)- Incredible amount of quality content as the story expands to tremendous length and allows for deep explorationThe Good:- The combat system is of good quality and gives much variety and satisfactory tactical optionsThe Bad:- RPG progression skills and traits are locked once selected which can cause significant potential problems for new/inexperienced players- Some of the areas are notably barren or seemingly unfinished (e.g. all the random encounters that are nearly exact repeats of each other)Conclusion:Wasteland 2 should be on everyone's short list for engrossing stories in RPGs.9.0 / 10.0			"

												I had been looking forward to this game's release for a long time. A lot of things were done quite well. I liked the general setting and story outline and the fact it used turn based combat, but there are a huge number of letdowns in this game.
 Plot. I think it's supposed to feel immersive, but I just didn't feel like it was. Other than radio messages and a couple of places overrun by end-boss henchmen, nothing connects the end of the game to the start or middle. There is no feeling of building to an epic conclusion. The side-quests are fine. Skills. There is hardly any synergy between stats.Your Computer Science skill character for example, his intelligence level is irrelevant on skill checks... that makes no sense. I think it would have been much better to keep skills more closely linked with stats. Partly I think this has happened because of the ludicrous number of skills/stats. There is just no point in having safecracking, lock-picking and alarm disabling as separate skills. Less skills, less stats, less skill points and this problem would have gone away. Also, especially the stats feel very ineffectual, each char might get 2 or 3 points to allocate throughout the game. What can you get for them? Not a lot. Skill-checks. I'm guessing there are 2 kinds of players, ones who try and fail to open lockboxes/doors/safes and accept that and move on (potentially to lobbing grenades at it) or ones who will save/reload until it opens. The system in place does not really handle it that well for either. The randomness is just a complete waste of time. If the former type of player got to a box and the tooltip says the skillcheck is too low, that would be fine, they could move on. If the latter type of player did the same, ditto. It's just making busy work for people who want to explore event inch of the game and open all the chests. Later in the game there are chests that will be 20% chance to open with maximum Lockpicking + Luck... what is the point in that? If it's supposed to be because sometimes in lfe you can't overcome a challenge... then just make it that you find lockboxes which can't be opened at all. Using skills. There is no reason for it to take several seconds to try and fail/succeed to perform some action, especially if you have to do it several times in succession. Mine fields are a prime example... Quicksave, right-click, disarm, wait, wait, wait, repeat. How tedious. Combine near instant usage with some absolute (i.e. not random) skill-check like I describe in (3) and it would have made the game a lot less annoying. Combat - Tactics. This is perhaps the biggest letdown. There is no excuse for this at all, the combat is incredibly dull and you inevitably start to feel like your trying to trick the game's AI instead of trying to waste some raiders. Combat - Positioning. This could have had a big effect on most battles, making them more tactical and thus more interesting, but in the majority of cases (especially in the end-game battles) the bad guys are entrenched and you come in the door and the battle (or cut scene leading to battle) begins. It would have been a lot better if there was some kind of stealth skills that you could have used to get into better positions. Also, it would have been great if there was a way to tell whether you were in an NPCs line of sight so trying to position your squad cleverly wasn't an annoying save-reload procedure. Combat - Cover. I like cover, it's a fun mechanic, however, because of the positioning, often by the time you reach it you could have already won. The last few battles I felt were pretty crap tactically because it was almost impossible to make decent use of cover. Also, if you have any melee characters, obviously they can't really make use of cover so should be appropriately armoured... Combat - Melee/Brawl. ... which they aren't. My blunt weapons dude was maxxed out on strength with all the armor and constitution and crit dmg reduction perks... he was still a ridiculously easy target. In the end game, if he got into melee range before being killed that was a surprise. Massively disappointing. Made worse by... Combat - Armor. ... the fact that heavy armor makes you slower. Ok, that makes some sense, however it makes melee chars slow (especially as they'd have to have taken high strength to be useful at the cost of other stats, like speed) and thus less able to get into position to pummel the enemy. I get that having the whole squad in (enclave) power armor (FO2 stylee!!) doesn't make a lot of sense, but combat speed was the stupidest thing to reduce when wearing it. Much better would have been a loss of coordination or evasion. You can make it RP by saying that it's like mech armor, giving them more speed to make up for the heavy armor. In the end-game, melee is almost completely useless as there are snipers who can take them out in a couple of shots. Conductive armor... this is a stupid idea, if you are struck by lightning/energy weapons, the best thing you could be wearing was a huge suit of power armor as the faraday cage effect would ensure the wearer remain unscathed, it's basic physics. This all basically means you have to carry 2 sets of armor around per person to ensure you can change when a battle will be energy weapon heavy. This is a massive hassle and adds very little to the game. I think it would have been better if the novel use of energy weapons was that they were less applicable to precision strikes (for obvious reasons), but overall a little more powerful than regular weapons to compensate. Make them a little better against robots and a little less against biological targets, by all means. Having your energy weapons guy be almost entirely useless for the first half of the game... great! Combat - Followers. Maybe these guys aren't meant to last long in combat? When they 'bum-rush' the enemy in every fight you either do a lot of save/reloading to keep them alive, or just let them die and get on with it. Kind of a pity. Combat - Healing. Given that in any tough fight, unless your party is 100% snipers and assault rifles, people will have to move in closer, and will get incapacitated... Having the surgeon get to them is nearly always impossible in combat as it takes more than 1 round to get them back on their feet, in which time the surgeon will almost certainly be out in the open and gunned down. Also, you use surgeon to get people back on their feet after a fight, great... but now they have a real-time (some are 600 seconds!!), unremovable debuff reducing their stats. What is that for? Mandatory bathroom breaks? All it does is introduce an annoying time delay before you can go into combat again.  Weapon types - Nobody wanted to use weapons other than sniper/assault rifles right? Oh, you did? Well, that's too bad because they are pretty crap. Car - One of the best ideas in Fallout 2. It allowed you to move around the map a lot faster (not a huge Wasteland 2 problem), but more importantly, you had your 'bank' nearby, so when you get to a place you can go and grab that heavy quest item or 'white' item when you find someone who wants it without having to go all the way back to base, then inside the base to the chest, then all the way back again. Definitely should have existed here.In summary. The game wasn't terrible, but particularly the combat was a big let down. While there are some new things from where Fallout 2 was (oh Marcus... did you just kill 2 of your own party members with your minigun...again!?), this game did not get them right. Given that we're 17 years down the road in terms of game design, it should have been much, much better.			"

												TL;DR: recommend with caveats.How do I possibly rate this game? I've played it for countless hours, and I would say that most of those hours were fun, and maybe a little addictive. So in terms of value and providing positive gameplay feedback loop, it's a success.And it does so many things right! So many things I want! The writing is consistently competent, despite the punny character names, and the areas and the scenarios they present are generally compelling. I really love that there are no truly good or bad choices in most situations.It's an isometric tactical RPG THAT ISN'T fantasy! Be still my heart!And it's huge! Too huge for my taste; I'd have preferred something about half as long, but everything feels full and fleshed out, so I can't complain about that.But there is a LOT to complain about.Let's start off with my biggest gripe: it is impossible to play this game well without reading a guide. This permeates every bit of the game, from character creation (make one character good at charisma and leadership, but DON'T make it your social character, and for God's sake, don't EVER give another character leadership. Also, always dump luck and almost always dump strength, and you might could have a competent character) through individual scenes (oh, you want the good ending for this area where people make up and mutually coexist? Well, go ahead an reload that game from four hours of fighting ago, and disarm that bomb. Oh, you thought you couldn't do that during the cut scene?) to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pixel hunts required to find the ONE CORRECT PATH through (to me) critical quests.And then there's the inverse bell curve of difficulty. The beginning of the game is hard, in a way I don't mind. The middle of the game is really easy, to the point where combat is a chore. Then the last third ramps things ALL THE WAY UP, and the best weapons all feel like peashooters, because the same enemies from before now have 5x the HP.I like the moral ambiguity, but I hate that the decision points, or the impact of those decisions, are neither clear nor logical.Sure, I'll recommend it. It's fun, if you're not averse to doing some googling for your games. But as someone who's played through Fallout 2 10+ times, I'll never return to Wasteland 2. I hope Wasteland 3 is a more focused and less opaque game.			"

												I have played the game through, nearly to the end, and after investing a couple dozen hours into the game have decided that (at least in it's current state) while playable, it has real problems.First, there's a plethora of bugs, specifically regarding the different ways to solve assorted missions. I am officially stuck in the second area, unable to complete the mission to bring peace between two waring factions (names left vague to avoid spoilers for readers) but because I put one guy on one side in charge first, I am unable to complete the quest. It is not a main story quest, but half the fun of games such as this are the side quests.Second, prepare to spend a lot of time... watching your team do the same thing 20 times. See that toaster you want to repair? Save first, you're going to have to try five times and if you critically fail you will have to reload. Almost more annoying, you have to sit there and fail over and over just waiting for the one lucky chance that you will succeed. You really do spend a good portion of the game either randomly moving around the wastes (which just takes a long time) or attempting to unlock / hack / disarm things. - It would be profoundly helpful if the developers had figured out either a more engaging way to do these things or just made them instant pass / fail tests so you could sit and spam attempts until they work.Third, there really is a 'winning party', you will have to have one person with essentially every skill to be successful in this game. Which is fine, except that there are more skills than you end up with characters able to have them. It is nearly impossible to do a good chunk of the game if no one has lock picking / demolitions / field medic, and at the point where they are essentially required skills to win, why not at least tell people when they start building their party?Going past that, I really do question the effectiveness of their random number generator. It can be really strange watching someone with a 95% in a skill fail 20 times in a row. I realize that is in fact the nature of an RNG, but it leaves me questioning how they did their seeding.That all said and done, the game is strangely graphics intensive for how simplistic the graphics are. They really do need to do some optimization to help the game either run more smoothly or look better, a game with graphics this old should not be struggling on most modern PC's.All in all, the game had a ton of potential, but the execution leaves a lot lacking and other games of the same approach (Shadowrun for example) have done a better job at engaging players and keeping them involved with minimal bugs.

finally, Finally, FINALLY.  FINALLY!!  FINALLY!!1!1!eleven!1!!And that isn't a crack against how long it was in development, I've been looking for an INTELLIGENT thinking mans game since the orginal Fallout 1 and 2, we had touches of it with Baulders gate and games like it were great, but I've been in freaking LOVE with post apocyptic games since the fallout series (pre 'DERP LETS TURN IT INTO A FIRST PERSON SHOOTER!, hey, we only have like 11,237,423,423,523 FPS's, lets compete in THAT market some more.  What do you mean there aren't even enough TACTICAL squad based games that you can count on a single hand, that means that genre is DEAD obviously! every big developer for the last 20+ years)The problem, many of us apparently, have had with most games these days, they are set in one of three settings, 1.  Fanasty setting  2.  Current setting (lets shoot ethnic minorities in sandy countries with modern weapons!.... pass) or 3.  Lets kill Zombie Hilter controlled clones for the millionith time.    All of which CAN and ARE sometimes great games, but how many games do we have set in Post apocalyptic worlds.   A world where yes, there are guns, gernades, rifles, and melee weapons, but also more exotic stuff like plasma and laser weapons.  Also, where combat IS a major part of the game, each and almost EVERY mission has a VARITETY of ways to solve it.   EXAMPLE (BUT NOT FROM THE GAME, MAKING THIS ONE UP MYSELF no spoilers!) Small town is being harassed by a two local gangs, how do you solve it as a ranger?  Possible ways to solve it![/u]1.  Guns blazing - lets BLOW EM ALL UP AND KILL EM!  2.  Dialog/Diplomacy - Infiltrate both gangs, and give them clues that the OTHER gang is out to slaughter em, make them fight it out via planted evidence, then finish off the survivors so the small town can be free!3.  Use mechanic skill to turn off water/power to bandits bases - unable to support themselves the bandits move on4.  Use Animial Whisper skill and turn wild life against bandits - a combination of patience and timing makes the bandits a 3 course meal for local wildlift and saves the local townETC. ETC. ETC.THESE are the kinds of ways I like to see a game able to be played, not where the only option is 'aim at ONLY moving targets on screen EVER, and pull trigger until enemy is no longer moving.  It lets you not only have different ways to get things done, but you ALSO have almost unlimited replayability, even with knowing how things can generally go, you want to try new things BECAUSE there are so many possible ways to GET TO THE SAME RESULT.Like I said, a little more intelligence and/or patience is required, and for an industry that is chock full of FPS's, and 'Who can twitch fastest is the best' games it's been long, LONG overdue where we can have a top down game where I can use terrain, combat skills, and different weaponary to beat superior forces.Oh and lets not forget the morale parts of the game, instead of the typical 'become a boyscout or SATANS RIGHT HAND MAN' there are just dozens of shades of gray all through this game, and people will treat you differently in one location over the next, almost as if they were part of isolated communities that had a hard time talking to each other.... .......  ...............    Eventually things WILL filter down, and where you might end someones suffering from pain, another person could see you and say you killed them in cold blood.   Almost NOTHING is clear cut, and you'll find yourself actually having to think of different outcomes rather than the typical game.I really hope the ADHD that has infested the gaming industry the last 10+ years can be put aside for a few mintues for WL2, it's not MEANT to be the 'run of the mill' crap we've been force fed over and over.  It says it gives you 80+ hours of game play, I spent all weekend playing it and I'm not ashamed to say I took a sick day tomorrow so I can play it all day without interuption in an empty house.   It's THAT good, at least to me anyway.Now, there are a few things that will work against it.  It's NOT perfect, it's a little rough in a few areas and sometimes you WILL be angry that you can't find a particular item, NPC or easy solution.  Other times the game will surprise you with it's richness and attention to detail.Oh and that's another thing, HUMOR is big in this game, there are tons and TONS of refferences to all sorts of things from the last 25+ years all through it.  I won't ruin them so hopefully you can get them yourself, but lets say some characters from other games, movies and books do make apperances through out the game.  Some might be as simple as walking past another Ranger team and closely looking at their names and saying to yourself  'wait a second, .. oh damn, that's !!!!!!!!  son of a B!  That's AWESOME!'  Other times you'll notice little pieces of inventory 'junk' that make you just grin, I've found everything from a Chia pet to old gaming consoles from the 80's and 90's.  Each and everything I've also read the description on, mostly because it just makes you laugh at some of the crap they threw into the descriptions since many people just skip by them in most games.  In WL2 I'll say it's worth the reading the items at least the 1st time you see em, after that np, see it again just skip it, but up the Devs got more then a little creative with some of this stuff.Oh and while this IS a tactical combat game mostly, I will say that you should probably make a play through where you focus at least one character with high intelligence, charisma and a hard path of the dialog skills.  There are simply SO many times in conversations where I wish I was able to choose some of the other options but I couldn't because I was too combat focused.  So there is a great chance to have multiple play throughs on this, I'll give it that as well.  Something with most single player games just hasn't been the case these last years.  And yes, I'm obviously dating myself with some of what I've said, but I've been a gamer for almost 25 years now.  And a really good tactical squad based thinking game has been lacking since the late 90's.   Wasteland Two has made me feel all of those good feelings I got when I played the orginal fallout games.  I'm just hoping that by writing this, obivously long as all hell review, that it will make a few people on the fence about getting it swing to the 'let me give it a shot' option.  Then if you like it and you are one of those people that do 'Let's plays' please do one for this, I'm not technical, I don't know how to stream or record, but I'd love to see this game get the attention it deserves and, HOPEFULLY, will reawaken developers to the fact that we need more then clones of the same 4 genre's invented, reinvented, re-hashed and regurgitated over and over to a market that does have more then a few of us that have more then the 'push button - recieve result x 10,000 = YOU WIN!' mentality.Yes, I've been a bit harsh in parts here to certain kinds of gamers, I aplogize for that, but we need MORE details in games, no dumbed down crap over and over, Wasteland two has me just grinning like a madman the entire weekend.  To the point where my wife just looked at me and said 'go... play that nuclear death game all you want, you'll be useless to me all weekend anyway.'   That's rare and I can't stop smiling about it.Thanks to the Dev's for making it and I really hope I've brought a good case to a few of you that will take the time to read, and hopefully find this (early) review useful.-Banlish			"

Early Access Review
								New Review: Did you know an Early Access Game meant you could play, rate and review an unfinished game? Did you know that people violently defend something they cant possibly understand or judge something based on very little information provided? Fanboys would rather say this poo doesnt stink because of what they think the end result of the product might be. Something impossible to determine. This last update helps a lot of these folks save face. While the game is still a buggy mess, its still probably better than half the games out there now. I've been actively involved in bug testing, aka playing, this game since november when it first came out. It has made large strides to this still unfinished game and thankfully the community and developers are pulling through. For any of you who played the original fallouts, this is what fallout 3 should have been. Regardless of the bugs (fallouts were REALLY BUGGY even in release) you need to save often. Because either the game will crash or you will die. Its not hard to be roaming the wastelands and be mobbed by a bunch of methed out raiders with giant axes. Pros: The gameplay and UI is really shaping up. Still not perfect but the bits and pieces that have changed would seem that the rest will fall in line soon enough. There is enough new content and changes that make replaying the first 3 levels over and over not seem so repetitive. Its fallout 3. Sick twisted humor with gore, unavoidable consequences and quick decisions make this game thrive. Cons: Its still pretty darn buggy and has its fair share of holes and such that arent gamebreakers but are easily noticed. UI still needs some work. Still worried about dropping 60 bones on it? I'd still hold off. Check back in a few months. This isnt a game for people that want to play a game. Not yet. You will lose your saves and everything often as it updates. Its still a heck of a lot of fun and I've burned through 40 hours in the last two weeks. Sincerely,http://www.thecomic-community.comOld Review:It looks like it will be good, and i'll update this when I can actively play it for more than 15 minutes at a time. Definitely a good mix of fallout with that text based game flair. Before you say, OH well this is what fallout is based off of, well its not. Go play wasteland 1 and tell me how its like fallout again? Maybe a theme and designers, but not much more, fallout stands on its own and this is what fallout 3 should have been even though I love fallout 3 as it is.  Cant wait for it to be finished, but unless you want to 'support the devs' until the game is finished, I'd steer clear of this guy for a bit. It has a very hard time loading maps and transitioning and its mostly memory access errors. 32 bit quad core with 4 gig of ram and higher end nvidia card just isnt cutting it right now. performance is great on any level of resolution or graphic quality so not sure what going on.Cons:UI needs a bit of work, its not intuitive sometimes and breaks a decent amount of the time. Loading areas crashes 80% of the time. Save often.Pros:Everything that isnt a con, this will be a great game, from what i can experience at quick intervals, there is a lot here to see and has that great quirky feeling from the original fallout games.I know this is a beta, and i'm waiting on getting bug reporting credentials from them so we can shore all of this up, so if you still take the plunge maybe you'll have better luck than me. I'm really looking forward to a truely playable build and the end product.Update: I'll be installing this game on a different pc and even a laptop soon to help me shun the non-believers. Update 2: Still not ready to change. Other computer doesnt seem to matter, perhaps you need a much bigger and powerful rig.Update 3: Still not playable. Shucks.Update 4: Playable! Oh my. Played it a lot, still not ready to change my mind. Even upgraded my pc to a nice new 64 bit with more memory and fun stuff. Its still super buggy! Like, I joined the bug thing and submitted 11 bugs in 60 minutes of playtime. Not all gamekiller bugs but theres not much more to do than just test out the game engine.			"

												Wasteland 2 is finally here, courtesy of Kickstater, and for all the good it does to the genre, it's still a mixed bag.//Contains spoilers//It opens up really nice, with a live-action intro, thrusting you into the unforgiving, post-apocaliptic setting as you bury a fellow ranger. A scene later and you notice a unique shotgun straped to the hip of a nearby guard, all thanks to your perception skill, and with a little bit of convincing (another skill) you can make it yours. Across the bridge you can charm yourself a butt-kicking goat companion, which raises one of your ability scores by 1. And all that's in the very first, small area. It's a great start, I found myself thinking, and if this reflects the rest of the game, I'm sold. Love me some world that actually reacts to my character build.Unfortunately it isn't so. Perception soon becomes mainly a mine/trap finding tool, and truth be told, at some point it's simply better to detonate the explosives and accept the blast directly, then to try disarming any of them. There goes role-playing. Try watching the same disarming animation over and over and over again, and you will know what I mean. You are better off using a healing skill every once in a while. You can still find some buried junk using it, but it gets somewhat underwhelming after the initial shotgun surprize.Taking about junk, You will easily find yourself at weight capacity carrying around all the junk you just found, hoping that someone somewhere may want it. And they do, but the game gives no hints as to just who may be interested in baby wipes. You may just as well gather all you can before you leave Arizona, and re-visit every single npc in the world looking for dialogue cues. And did I mention there are regular junk tems, and shiny junk items? Yeah. And when you use the Sell All Junk button at stores, the UI is hell-bent on selling the shiny ones too, even after you specifically flag them as not junk. Item management in Wasteland 2 is a game on its own. You can't see your character's weight capacity on the merchant screen, you can't compare weapons with the ones you have in second hand slot, and you can't compare trinkets. All the clothing items look the same in the inventory screen, so unless you want to spend additional time trying them on and seeing what they actually look like, you will just sell them, like me. Armor does nothing to change the way you look, and the merchants screen gets really laggy when there are a lot of items. The game has its moments, but they seem very few and far between. There is one giant robot fight, well three if you count fighting the same robot model again, and then its flame-throwing cousin. Yep, no huge mutant creatures, and no big ♥♥♥ bosses for you. The combat works at the bare minimum, and may get stale pretty quick. There is little excitement to be had on that front, and 95% percent of enemies can be taken out by a single shot from an RPG-7 if you get the enemies to clump together. Imagine my dissapointment when I finally got to fight Dugan, one of the few uniques bosses, and he went down in a single rocket blast. True, you can tune up difficulty, but as far as I know it only decreases your damage and incresases enemy's. And the last thing I wanted was to have weapons which don't do the damage they have in their description. How about more enemies? Or more hp for them at the very least. Ehh.Random encounters have all the same flavour. Fight enemies, fight enemies. I got some barbecuing cannibals once, which seemed like a unique encounter, but the excitement was gone as soon as they attacked. In the end I just raised my outdoorsman skill, and tried to skip them alltogether. Had enough of the simplistic combat in other areas.I found two different merchants braving the wastes, but they didn't even seem to re-stock. Curiously enough, one of them actually attacked me when I refused to buy anything, and it was a nice little way to spice things up. But still – Fallout 2 had it in spades and done better. Then there are...bugs. Visual bugs, dialogue bugs, and of course quest-breaking bugs. Take your pick. There are whole forum threads on how to complete the Hollywood questline. There are people who spent hours on end, saving and reloading, trying to finish up quests in the correct order just to get the quest log cleaned up. Hats off to them. Personally, I could not get to finish the quest where Heidi asks my rangers to help her take over the Bastion of Faith. Hell, I could not even talk to her anymore. Her dialogue screen went blank. No “Hello”, no nothing. At this point I just said ♥♥♥♥ it and rushed to the ending. I don't know perhaps I talked to someone I should not have. If that's all that could be achieved with nearly 3 million dollars, I shiver to think what the game would feel like if the devs got only what they asked for - a mere 900k. The games gets patches regularly, so there's hope. But for any potential buyer, I would suggest to wait a few months (and I thought I did that...) and try it then. Hopefully your experience will be better than mine. Do I regret buying it? No. Am I planning on re-playing it? No.The game's a good effort, and has some heart, but the brain is just not there yet. And just because it's a long-awaited sequel, it should not get a free pass.Not recommended at this patch stage.6/10			"

Early Access Review
								This review is being written on September 18, 2014 - the day before the game is released. It is a review of the final playable beta version.If you haven't played the original Fallout or Wasteland games, this game is like KoToR * X-Com. It's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, best game I've played in recent years.That said, a day before release, it is still buggy as ♥♥♥♥. I've put 30 hours in and came very close to completing the beta (which they said was 40% of the final game), but I can't progress any further because I killed one of the bad guys instead of letting him live, and that bugs the whole game out and I can't progress any further. I've also had to manually edit my save file 2 separate times to fix game-breaking glitches. Hopefully this is all fixed tomorrow. If it is, then buy it at whatever the launch price will be. If not, I can't justify spending more than $25 on this game.			"

												It starts out fun. Character creation is decent, there's a mystery to be solved and a sense of urgency, and all loot is pretty valuable (at first).You'll go out exploring, and everything will seem pretty novel and interesting. The world map/exploration is cool, and you'll wonder what kind of stuff is out there waiting for you. You'll have random encounters with bandits, and those will be enjoyable.But then the fun starts to break down. You'll realize that random encounters all take place on the same 2 or 3 maps. You'll find quest-breaking bugs with the majority of sidequests. Loot will become boring and repetitive. Travelling within settlements will be a long and frustrating headache, as there are no local map markers. You'll be forced to make choices in unrealistic and senseless dilemmas. You'll be hugely encouraged to spam saves.IN SHORT: The first 25% of the game is fun and exciting, but the remaining 75% is extremely frustrating/repetitive/boring. "

												I really wanted to like this game. My two favourite games are Planescape Torment and Fallout 2. I’ve completed both numerous times, however I gave up on Wasteland 2 halfway through due to a combination of boredom and frustration. Let me try to explain why.Before the final release of the game, I was pumped. I read the whole manual, then sat down and wrote lore friendly bios for my four rookie rangers and distributed all the stats according to their role in my team. In the end I found this whole process more fun and engrossing than the actual game. Basically the game is boring. These were the main things that I found dull:•It’s filled with loot which is pretty much junk and doesn’t give you a proper reason or options to customise your character load outs.• Drawn out, repetitive, dumb combat. They could have learnt some lessons from X-Com here. Basically there are no tactics, there’s no cover, no use of the terrain. I ended up maxing out the Outdoorsman skill and skipping Outdoor encounters to avoid the snoozy combat and the same tiny maps I’d seen so many times before. The combat boils down to a battle of attrition. I hurt you a little, you hurt me a little. Repeat.• Poor level design combined with a plethora of boring fetch quests which force you to run from one end of a massive map to another.• Finally the choices you make don’t impact the world in a way which made me care. The only noticeable impact was that in the main base everyone was like “Why are you so big and strong and everybody likes you!” Which I generally liked. But it does feel shallow after a while. I hadn’t really appreciated how immersive and good the quests were in Fallout 3 until I played this game.In the end I hit a bug where one of my party members got stuck in a quest and I couldn’t get him back or replace him. I think that bug has gone now, but I still feel no inclination to go back to the game.Basically I can’t recommend this game even a little. If it was free, I’d suggest that your time is too valuable to spend on it.Also I forgot to mention. At one point you have the opportunity to free a bunch of female sex slaves from the Red Scorpion Militia and one of them is called Schnitz, which I found to be poor taste and it’s the kind of joke a kid might make. This gives you an idea of the maturity of the people that put this game together and the kind of story telling you’ll be exposed to playing it.			"

												Take this review with a grain of salt. If there was an option in between 'Yes' and 'No', that's what I would have chosen. Also bear in mind, at the time of writing this, I have *not* completed the game. I'm not sure I'm going to just yet until they do some serious work on it. I'm about halfway through the main story. With that said, here goes... (warning: minor spoilers throughout)-----------------------Conclusion: 6/10 - The game feels like a beta. I'm glad it was released, but it needs some serious work. I'd hold out on buying for patches/mods. If you are really looking for something to play, the game is fun, it just lacks a large amount of polish that is necessary to make this game go from ""okay"" to ""fantastic"". Also, I hit the word limit. Definitely missed some things.-----------------------The Good+ Storyline is interesting and easy to get caught up in.+ Voice acting is great. Not everything is voice acted, but where it is, it's done well. + Character Customization is great. You can create your party of 4 from scratch, or use pre-made characters if you so choose. There is a large amount of build variety. However: [See associated con.]+ Random skill-use events. While venturing out into the Wasteland, you'll often come across various obstacles that can be passed by one of your party member skills. Ie. ""My wife is sick! Please help her and I'll let you loot this stash I left in my house!"", in this case, a party member with the 'Field Medic' or 'Surgeon' skill would be able to heal his wife and get access to some loot. + Recruitable party members! From your starting party of 4, you can have up to I believe 3 more members of your party that are recruitable as you progress through the story. The first of which is available almost immediately when starting the game. These guys can help fill a lot of the gaps in your skill selection and provide some alleviation on skill-events and some flexibility in combat.+ The game is huge. A lot of content and a lot of story. Developers suggest it'll take 60-70 hours to beat. That is awesome.+ Random radio chatter. I really enjoyed this aspect of the game. You'll be wandering around and randomly hear radio chatter about other rangers in another part of the world checking in about taking down this fugitive or saving this town, etc... There is also random radio chatter from radio stations in major towns, from psychopaths from various factions, etc... Awesome addition to the game. The Bad- WEAPON JAMMING. This is absolutely my biggest complaint. I'll get weapons with a 1 or 2% chance to jam, yet they jam almost every-other encounter and cost almost an entire turn's worth of AP to unjam. Absolutely infuriating. This also goes for hit chances & skill succeed chances. - Weapon variation. Weapon variation in this game is pretty obnoxious. I've been using a crowbar on my melee toon since about 30min into the game and I've yet to find anything better. Going through Arizona, you find the same weapons over and over again. Even at the vendors! Protip: Make sure you level weaponsmithing on one of your toons! Or you'll find yourself making the long trek to a vendor more often than you'd like.- The travel system. The travel system in WL2 is just plain bad. I understand what the intent was, but it largely just made the experience frustrting. Areas are very large and in order to travel to the world-map, you need to find an exit on the map to ""The Wasteland"". Once in the wasteland, you have to travel across the map to your destination, regardless if you've visited it before or not. It's slow, tedious, and takes away from the immersion. I constantly find myself needing to travel to some distant point on the world map and thinking ""Eh... Maybe I'll take a break and go play something else for a bit.""- Character customization limits. If you create your custom party when you first try out this game, chances are, you'll miss a skill that limits things your party can do. There are skills associated with opening different kinds of safes, accessing a large amount of loot, getting through various doors, remaining undetected in hostile areas, you name it. There are also quest elements requiring you have specific skills. These skills are not necessary to have, but not having them when you find a vendor that will only sell to you if you can use x skill to help him out, is upsetting to say the least. Especially to those, like myself, who enjoy doing *everything*.  [See associated pro] ALSO, be sure to level perception on at least one character. If you don't, you'll end up with your whole party perma-dying due to land-mines. - Factions and choices are very opaque. Early on in the game you visit an area where you are assisting in getting their water system & power fixed. Afterwards, you are supposed to back a certain candidate for mayor since the previous mayor had been killed during a raider attack which you helped stop. After fixing the power/water, you exit the tunnels to find the election already underway and the ""bad"" candidate being elected by a landslide without you being able to do anything about it. You are treated like scum by the town & going back to your HQ everyone makes smartass comments about what a ""great job"" you did. Turns out, you had to do ALL of the sidequests *before* the main quests in that area, as well as a couple other arbitrary things. I was fairly frustred with this, especially seeing as how the ""good"" candidate was extremely happy with me for helping her out, then after the election, I was suddenly dirt. The questlines here were not very well articulated. - Assocated with the previous con, choices are fairly hard to differentiate. You may decide you want to go for a ""good guy"" playthrough as you may have done in similar games. Good luck keeping that up. There's one point where you have 3 different factions all approaching you and all giving you quests to screw the others. You have no idea which one gives decent rewards, no idea which one is actually the good guy. No idea which one you should be following so you don't get in trouble with Ranger HQ. So, you guess, you end up screwing them ALL over because of this or that reason that you were unable to control. It all gets very unorganized and tedious. - Random items you pick up that you aren't sure if you should hold onto or sell. No descriptions, just random. Protip: Hold onto ANYTHING white. Safe to sell gray stuff except for one type of item that you'll find out about shortly into the story. The Maybe+/- The combat system I'd say is a maybe. I personally enjoyed it, but there are a few things that made it incredibly frustrating.+/- The grahpics aren't great. This isn't a complaint for me, but I am aware that this is a big thing for many people. This will likely be improved with future mods. +/- Honey badgers. Honey badgers everywhere. You encounter honey badgers so often in this game, it should be renamed to ""Wasteland 2: Revenge of the Honey Badger"". While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it breaks immersion for me. You look at the combat log and it's *filled* with stupid honey badger jokes and references that just repeat themselves over and over again for the duration of the encounter. Upon looting the corpses, you get a bunch of junk including ""badger's nutsack"". While this was humorous as first, the honey badgers quickly got old for me.+/- Upon leveling up you are required to call into central command for a ""field promotion"" before being able to allocate your gained skill/attribute points. While this isn't a huge deal, it gets fairly annoying after awhile. Especially with your party all leveling at different rates. You'll end up with 2 party members having leveled, calling in, then 10 minutes later another party member, then 10 minutes later, your remaining party members. I often find myself holding out until my entire party is ready to level before calling in. Not a bad thing, just a minor annoyance.			"

												*Contains minor spoilers*Well... I went all the way from loving this game into hating it and then to accepting it and finally to like it. So, it turned out that:1. This is NOT a Fallout1/2. It's more like Fallout Tactics with FO 1/2-ish endings.2. You can solve most of your problems 2 ways: using speech or lockpicking skills. Or both.3. Devs thought ""We will make 3 kinds of speech and 3 kinds of lockpicking skills. It will create so many choices"". Well, actually no, it's still 2 ways.4. Assault rifles are most useful weapons in the world. All other weapons are not worth your skillpoints.5. Melee specialists will do nothing first half of the game except getting hurt all the time. During second half they should learn how to use assault rifles.6. Throwing weapons do not require a skill. Even monkey could throw a grenade, right?7. You can never tell from the view of your team which armor they are wearing. Cause stockings with garment are more important in the wasteland then power armor, right?8. Energy weapons do very little damage to unarmored enemies. Please read this line again to understand the level of absurd.9. Main story quest deviated very little from ""the search for GECK"". Actually you'll look for 2 types of chemicals.10. You can dig all the graves in the world. No one cares.I could go on with this list, but I think you get the picture by now. Not to mention clumsy 3d-models with ugly skin and absolutely unnecessary sims-like character editor (can give you nightmares). It's mostly poor choice of engine. But if you like a good tactics with turn-based combat in a postapocalyptic setting - you'll buy this game. It will punish you in order to make you start another playthrough. And you'll learn to accept it ""as is"". Like I did.			"

Early Access Review
								29 June 2014IntroductionWasteland 2 has been Early Access for some time now and those of you who remember the awesome Fallout 1, 2 and Tactics, I can confidently say that this is the true successor unlike Fallout 3 which was Elder Scrolls Oblivion with guns.GraphicsThe first thing classic Fallout veterans will notice is the transition from 2D to 3D and it’s great to finally explore the Post Apocalyptic world and watch all the action from any angle you choose. The world itself is suitably detailed and the animations are great and more than adequate for the job. Although there are games with better graphics, Wastelands 2 is all about the gameplay which I’ll cover later in more detail.Sound/MusicVoice acting is great and the music fits nicely with the theme. Sound effects including weapon effects, enemies during encounters and items are again more than suitable. So far so good but this game is £39.99 in Early Access and it seems to be okay so far .... so why would anyone pay such a large amount of money for a game that’s not yet complete?GameplayThis is where Wasteland 2 more than earns the right for such a high retail price. When you first start the game you have the choice to create your team (highly recommended) and the list of abilities that your character can develop in are great,Barter, Pistol, Shotgun, First-Aid, Heavy Weapons, Surgeon, Weapon Smithing, Toaster Repair, Melee, Blunt Weapons, Safe Cracking, Alarm Disarming and more. All of which require skill points to master that are awarded upon levelling up.Characters can be equipped with 2 weapons, primary and a secondary (Sniper Rifle and a Pistol side arm  for example) and be fitted it with various Armour and Trinkets (Literally thousands of combinations). There are over 150 Weapons in the game and the fire-arms can also be modified with the use of weapon smithing to increase accuracy or decrease the chances of stoppages.The Wasteland world has lots to interact with too (Objects highlighted in Green), even more points of interest to add to the immersion (Objects highlighted in Brown) and how you interact is up to you, use a lock pick to open the door or a rocket launcher the choice is always yours.The desolate world is also filled with NPC’s and some are offering lots of information via an interesting chat system (certain words will be highlighted and added to your vocabulary to enquire about as the conversation proceeds).Wasteland 2 is also full of decisions and consequences, some are small like attempting to pick a lock early on with low skill level can destroy the lock forever to much bigger decisions that will decide the fate of entire towns and NPC’s, who you decide to  save or let die is up to you but you’ll inevitably have to face the consequences later on.Now onto Enemy encounters, this is probably my favourite part as I’m a big fan of tactical combat. Once you encounter Enemies the game will switch from free roaming to turn-based where you’ll have a set number of AP (Action Points ) to use on movement, crouching, reloading, unjamming weapons, single round shots and burst fire.Different weapons have a different effects too, Shotguns have a wider spread to hit multiple enemies whilst Sniper Rifles will have the ability to penetrate and hit another enemy  in depth, killing two with one round and let’s not forget the animations, lots of gore and I was able to blow one guy clean in half with a Shotgun and watch him crawl around on his hands.I’ll be honest in saying that I’m only about 7/8 hours into the game so far but it’s got me hooked which is a rarity as I tend to bounce back and forth from game to game (I even annoy myself sometimes), the game is also not without bugs (the odd graphical glitch) and some of  the voice acting is still to be added but that’s Early Access for you.Pros so far1 True successor to fallout 22 Character customization3 Game altering decisions4 Great turn based combatCons so farThe usual bugs normally found in early AccessConclusionFantastic game but is it worth £39.99........ If like me you loved Fallout 2 then definitely, it’s the sequel I’ve been waiting years for, luckily for me I picked it up during the Steam Sale for around £25 which I’m more than happy about, feel free to comment and I hope you enjoyed my review. Score so far9/10			"

Early Access Review
								On the inExile forum there is the discussion how to rate the game 1-10.I give it a plain 9/10.Is it looking like a modern game is expected to look. No. But the graphics transport the atmosphere in a way modern engines lack. In fact it´s not the graphics that lack, but the story and sometimes the gameplay.And that´s because it only gets a 9 - there is room for improvement, the combat system is well known from Fallout, the first parts, though it differs. I do miss some more tactical options, like delayed ambush or the ability to protect a weaker char. On the other hand it leaves you room for unorthodox methods of defeating an enemy.Still Jagged Alliance had the best combat system ever.So why give it a 9?It transports the original feeling, many of you might not have experienced, so well, i hardly can get myself away from it, even if i should - get some sleep, just take a break or make something to eat that takes more than 5 mins of preparation.Back when the orignal Wasteland was released i did not play RPGs, nor was my english (german here) any good.And i have to say that Wasteland and an english-german dictionary was quite advancing my knowledge, shortly after  i began reading english books.In Wasteland 1 there were no fancy 3d graphics, no sound and surely no voice acting. If you have the digital deluxe edition, try the old one, if you haven´t experienced the DOS era, you might think, how the hell anybody could play such a game.Well, it was like a good book. You had to image the places you visit, only having (great) text based descriptions to fan your fantasy.I can still picture the inside of Cochise base.And there is one thing W2 does a lot better - it gives you more directions. W1 was pretty much open world, leaving one often with no clue what to do next, except from mentioning a city somehow. I do remember i had no idea how to get the visa card for the guy in... Needles, Quartz? Well he eats them, but that i needed it and how to get it....In W2 you are pointed more directly in the right direction, but still you have to figure out how to solve things. I miss that a lot in modern games - as long as you can shoot stuff, you win. Quite boring.The storytelling is great, if you take your time to read all the stuff. READ? Yes you have to read a lot and it is rewarding, though some areas have a bit too many people telling pretty much the same about the situation. Nevertheless, Wasteland 2  is a more than worthy and greatly rewarding game, that lives it´s orginial strengths inside a modern shell.Modern? But you sais the graphics... Yep, i did.Again, it does not take a 3d engine that requires 5 Nvidia Titans in SLI Mode to make a great game. And there´s the matter of time a game takes. Okay a good deal is reading, but i consider those modern games, i play through in 16 hrs. straigt still entertaining - but way to short, even if they look fantastic, but i often find myself that i don´t value the work the company put into it, just because the game ruhes me by it. W2 slows you down. And that is a good thing.I spend DAYS with the original Wasteland. I have spend DAYS with the Early Access already and thats just 50% of the game, though i replayed a bit, tested other options.Where other games need a DLC after those 16 hrs gameplay you paid for, that will enterain you for 2 hrs at most, this game just sucks up your time and you want to do it again, just a different way next time, or just doing it better the next time.Do i recommend it? Though i cannot judge the other half, if you like a great story, with more than adequate presentation, tactical combat and some serious dark humor, i don´t think you can go past Wasteland 2 - even if it´s not a 9 for you.

												TL:DR buy Fallout 1&2 and play those instead; they are similar, superior games and cost a fraction of the price.I backed this on kickstarter and was very enthusiastic about playing the finished product.  I loved all the old Interplay games back in the day, and I thought that a modern remake of Wasteland that stayed faithful to old-school RPGs couldn't possibly go wrong.It's a real shame that Wasteland 2 turned out to be such a slog. The 'tactical' combat is basic and repetitive, with no tactics beyond making sure you have your best weapons equipped, and focusing fire on each enemy until they are dead. This game is supposedly the spiritual successor to the early Fallouts but the combat is actually a step backwards from them. No aimed shot limb cripples, torso-shredding burst fire crits, stuns, knockdowns, or anything beyond hitting and subtracting hitpoints - headshots are available but they just take a bigger chunk of HP. There is a half-hearted cover mechanic but if you don't use it, it doesn't matter. Even when levelling up later in the game and getting better armour and weapons the combat is still the same grind.Levels are certainly sprawling, but are mostly full of monotonous fights and heavily trapped/locked boxes (that usually turn out to be full of jokey 'flavour' junk items). Fight, help locals, move plot forward a bit, travel to next area. Not necessarily a bad formula but it is the same over and over, coupled with the incredibly dull combat. Text pops up for dialogue and to describe things happening but it appears in a tiny box at the corner of the screen which can't display much of it at once - which seems bizarre when there is so much reading to be done, and very little voice acting.The setting is interesting and the plot isn't bad, with some genuine laughs and memorable characters to encounter. But when they come wrapped up in such an unpolished, uninspiring package with such ancient production values, it's very difficult to appreciate them.			"

												Step 1 - Don't play this game using pre-concieved notions of gaming.Step 2 - When creating characters, put all unused stats into INT nothing else. Once full, coordination and or strength.Step 3 - Lockpicking, Safecracking, Perception, Demolitions, Toaster Repair, Mechanical repair, Medic and Surgeon should all get instant attention and be taken instantly. Get weapon skills as you go.Step 4 - Cruise control. Take it easy for a bit, ease into the first few fights and build up a couple weapon skills once roaming.Step 5 - SAVE HACK LIKE A PRO!!  The game specifies to save OFTEN and it does mean this. Situations can get out of hand easy. Make a few save files to keep yourself ready.			"

												With so many great CRPGs coming out  that were backed through kickstarter, I definitely recommend adding Wasteland 2  to your collection. It doesn't have the same freedom  as D:OS (Divinity Original Sin) but there does seem to be some meaningful consequences in the choices you make. The BETA was fun and buggy, with many issues ironed out in  the full release. I haven't ran into anything  game  breaking as  of  yet (only bug  that was slightly annoying was  that I saved  a burning house and  when I loaded my save the  house was burnt  down).I highly recommend picking this up if you're a fan of the original fallouts (including Tactics  which I loved).Edit: I  will throw  in some of  the cons. The biggest one in my mind is  that Wasteland 2 isn't a very pretty game (running on max settings), the textures  and models  of the game aren't good,  and the voice acting is  on the same level. All in all, the humor, references, combat, and story (apparently 50+hrs worth!) makes this a must buy for any CRPG  / Turn Based RPG enthusiast.			"

												While promising, Wasteland 2 is ultimately a shallow experience. The tactics used in combat never change--the enemies all rush the player or hide behind cover like their feet were nailed in place. The weapons never get particularly interesting. The skills are generic and essentially amount to ""use X to open box."" The dialogue is buggy and often opaque.I put 55 hours into this game before giving up. Not because it was hard, but because it was dull. The story beats are the same you see in every post-apocalypse story. If you've played the Fallout games, everything here is distressingly familiar without ever improving on or deepening the experience.The characters are all one note. The story has virtually no twists. It pretends to be an open map but is really a guided, railroaded experience. There are no random encounters bringing levity and humor, like in the Fallout games. And any emotional resonance the game has requires you to have played a 20-year-old game. I get that it's a sequel, but it shouldn't be so slavishly a sequel. The game could have been fun and engaging, but instead it's a shiny promise that becomes a chore.			"

												This is NOT AT ALL like Fallout 1 and 2 or similar classic CRPGs which offer significant choices and freedom, interesting dialogue, chances to use your creativity.It's mechanical in the most boring way. You march linearly through a sequence of mostly empty areas. In each area, you do the same tedious and repetitive click-and-wait, which is all minor variations on the following minigame: find box, disarm trap [wait], disarm alarm [wait], unlock lock [wait], unlock tumbler [wait]. The waiting really is excessive. If you accidentally click things in the wrong order, which is guaranteed to happen since the click-wait dance is so boring, the box blows up or the alarm goes off. When you succeed, you get some minor loot. Which you must hold on to forever, because there is only one container in the entire game that you can put things in, and the game tells you things are junk when they might be useful.Skills are all for boring skill checks like this; too few points, and you'll keep failing and waiting over and over, or have to take the long route through the area. That's too bad, since skills are your only way of interacting with the world outside combat.Occasionally an area contains a friendly NPC. I guarantee that NPC has nothing interesting to say, and don't expect deep dialogue trees with important and rewarding decisions. Even the writing is boring. Just click all the topics until they go away to update quest status. Then go to some other area, do same tedious boxes-and-combat dance, come back to turn in quest for reward. Your reward is to level up and increase the mandatory weapon and box-opening skills. These are also illusory choices, because if you put points into the wrong skills, you will just be waiting more. It turns out there's one optimal way to make a character, this is impossible to determine before you have played the game or copied the perfect recipe, and if you didn't do it, the game is even more tedious. Unlike Fallout, you can't make weird characters like a a low-intelligence talker character or a nonviolent sleazeball work out. Just restart and build the character in the combat-oriented way you are forced to do.What this leaves is a ton of unavoidable turn-based combat - which is decent, though simplistic; it mainly tests whether you put enough points into the right gun skills, because several of the gun skills are really not worthwhile. Please do not buy this game unless turn-based combat is your primary interest. It's a ""tactics"" game. If you expect anything else, you'll be disappointed. If what you want is an RPG with choices, run away. There are no real choices. Your choices (such as they are) are morally 1-dimensional, you can't affect the politics or world in any interesting way, and it's not really possible to be bad or even strange. The only thing it is possible to be is a character which marches through the predetermined missions shooting things as intended.			"

For the sake of brevity..Genre tags: Turn-based, Strategy, CRPG, Party BasedValue Proposition: Tons of Content, Encourages replays, well worth your timeBSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): The Fallout 3 we deserved. Fallout Tactics 2; Post apocalyptic/western XCOM without base building Concomitant Exposition and SummationWasteland 2 is a 7 person turn based CRPG set in the fictionalized post apocalyptic world of the western border of the United States. Namely Arizona and the Los Angeles region. The setup has you create a 4 person party using either pre-made characters or custom ones that you assign attributes and skill points to yourself. 3 additional NPC party members may be recruited through  throughout the game. I personally found nine. Though, through some reading I did after I finished there are some I never even encountered. This is one of my chief complaints, I fully understand why NPC's can't make up the whole party as there are numerous narrative reasons but I don't understand why you are not allowed a full 7 person custom party. It provides no advantage other than balancing skills throughout each person. Rather than forcing reliance on NPC party members for skills not attained or have high enough proficiency. This game isn't the most friendly upfront, I say this to bring attention to the fact that the character creation has no direct classes and has tutorial missions up to 3-5 hours in that if not careful can result in full party wipes or at least the early loss of characters. Perma-death is a very real concern but with a nominal understanding of the games mechanics, (for instance the difference between field medics and surgeons) perma-death is rather forgiving. I, admittedly after restarting twice a few hours in, finally got a grasp of what was happening and didn't have anyone die my entire playthough. However, I had a number of very close calls. Attribute points are assigned at the beginning of the game and only change very minimally throughout the entire playthrough. They, in essence are what makes the character more suited for certain skills. Skill points are what to pay attention to here as they are the ones that change the most from gaining XP and leveling. They're what you'll be directly using in game. It's not directly understood immediately but it allows for far more customization in your party. From shotgun wielding surgeons to charismatic snipers good at computer science, the game even allows for a space to write a custom bio for each character and use a custom portrait so long as it's 256x256 pixels. IF, you wanted to. Additionally the game after completion exports these characters as “veterans” for use in other playthroughs. I've heard a number of complaints that the world map random encounters can become rather monotonous in tedium. However, there is a very easy and lore friendly way around that aspect. The outdoorsman skill is your friend. Use it. The game has a ton of optional side quests that really fill out the world and definitely affect the ending. That being said, I found the the main line end game a little lackluster, I didn't find myself caring about a large portion of the characters near the end game. It felt a little cliché and uninspired. Which is a little disappointing given the rest of the games content. THE GISTI adore this game. There are some minor technical bugs, sometimes in combat the shader map would detach itself from the geometry and WASD which normally controls the camera (it has edge scrolling as well) would not allow you survey the battlefield in the way you might want to but would correct itself after the turn was taken. It also can feel a little contrived in sections not allowing you to resolve things the way you might desire without passing a dialogue check or other skill check. However most of these things have multiple solutions. Custom parties can make the game feel much more personal and make you want to not only replay it to get different results in relations with groups and cities in regards to the Rangers but in gameplay as well.  I also appreciate how the game while serious in tone at times, doesn't take take itself overly serious and pokes fun at the situation or game itself.Follow my curation page for more. "

												Wasteland 2 is perfect definition for term ""mixed feelings"". At best, it's just mediocre post-apocalyptic cRPG. At worst - it's game full of bugs, inconsistencies and bad design decisions. But for some strange reason, I couldn't stop playing it. So pick it on sale with 75% discount.Pros:- Story you may like, especially if you're a fan of Terminator/Mad Max movies. There's enough bandits and robots to kill.- Most quests can be solve in more than one way. Or you can just shoot everyone.- Music.- Radio broadcasts are fun- Some strange magic - I couldn't stop playing, despite all flaws (and there are many flaws)- California - whole second part of the game is cool. Great factions, more interesting quests, etc. Unfortunately, more bugs too, and you first need to play 40h of boring Arizona. There's big chance you will never see Holywood.Cons (long list):- Bugs, bugs, bugs - broken quests, cutscenes not diplaying correctly, messed-up scripts (leading to broken quests) and more- Game looks bad. Really, really bad. Fallout 2 looks better. Probably any game released last 10 years looks better. It's first game I wanted to quit while making character. And yes, I completely understand that graphic is not important.- Massive FPS drops.- Unresponsive UI - sometimes you need to click several times on button or on the ground to execute action (go somewhere, change or reload weapon etc.)- Tactical, turn-based battles? Forget it. In most fights (many, many fights) you just need to shoot enemies while they come to you. You can't cover (because there are no covers), head shot is not valid option (because of massive penalties) and most enemies are just chargin on you. Shadowrun offers more tactical battles that Wasteland 2. So, Wasteland 2 is not Divinity: Original Sin, XCOM, Jagged Alliance 2. It's not even close.- Pathfinding - if you want to move from one end of map to another, your team most probably will not be able to.- Character development - there's nothing interesting in it. With each level you get some skill points, sometimes 1 attribue points. As you need all skills (or almost all), trying to create some unique builds is not an option. And there are no perks or anything that would allow you to create really unique ranger.			"

												Tactical turn based combat, a cover system, optimal fire range's on all the weapons that you will have to consider, crouch and head shot options, overwatch mode, weapons that can jam and need to be reloaded mid battle, all of which will cost you action points to utilize in combat. You also have a skill system for outside of combat that include things such as toaster repair (think the wasteland version of treasure chests), perception (land mines, trap/alarms on objects), lock pick and safe crack, computer repair, mechanical engineering and much more. All of your skills you will be finding yourself using quite often in your travels to do many things such as get the core out of a plastic man to performing surgery (a skill) on a kid who had his leg blown off from a land mine or fixing various broke down machines you come across for the people of the wastes to make their lives easier. There are so many places for you to use your skills that they never feel like a useless point dump when your weapon skills are high enough. With a story set in a post apocalyptic wasteland where life is cruel and unfair and just a bit radioactive (maybe more if you're not careful) that's what kind of game this is. The variety of people you meet along the way and places you will journey is just amazing, there were a few times where I found myself laughing out loud at something stupid I came across from some junkie's camp or in wonder at the place I had just discovered filled with robotic junk and run down machinery. It really was a joy to explore in this game I have to say. Many of the characters have some real personality to them that you will remember long after you move on which really makes it feel more personal when the NPC's you meet aren't soulless bunches of code and pixels you know? Often there were times where I found it had a very elder scrolls quality to it where you just look around you and go wow I can explore ALL OF THIS which, if you ask me, is just a fantastic thing to feel in a game.

												There are few games that have come out recently that I would say are must-haves.  This is one of them.  It's an unforgiving game in the style of games I grew up with that you played knewing you would regret some decisions, and you can't win them all - so you have to make careful choices.It's a tactical shooter done along the lines of fallout 1/2 - with the turn based stuff we wished was in fallout.Also I wanted to say that I didn't realize that the red boots DLC wasn't available for regular steam orders. I guess it's fortunate that I got this game from being a backer but I think I'd be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ otherwise.			"

												Warning, if you are running Windows 10, you will need to go into Properties>Set Launch Options: ""-force-d3d9"" to prevent your game from crashing every time you open the inventory panel. The moment I did this fix, I ran smooth.Initial troubleshooting aside, I love this game. It reminds me of the challenging fun I had with the original 2 Fallout games. (For obvious reasons)SAVE OFTEN! The consequences of your actions stack up quickly. Also, play around with your parties builds. Search forums to find the party you would like to build, there are lots of resources out there for you.Again, I love this game. Recommend it to any fans of the Fallout series and cheap immitations. :)			"

												Scratches an itch that I've had since 1999.  Feels good man. Pros+ Fully customizable squad of 4 Rangers.  You assign their starting stats and skills, pick their starting wardrobe, and can even give them their own backstory.+ Fantastic turn based combat that takes advantage of cover and line of sight.+ Well written quest lines and dialogue.+ An atmosphere that mixes the brutality of the wasteland with minor camp, but doesn't overdo either.+No stealth!Cons-The View Map screen is quite poor.  Very small. No landmarkers. No ability to add your own landmarks. No ability to move your squad to a place on the map by clicking on a location via the map screen.-Some maps are a large jumbled messes. It's hard to understand where you are and where you are going, even with a UI compass.-There are some dead stat points that provide no bonuses, forcing you into a break point if you want x bonus from your stats.-No stealth!

												I backed it on Kickstarter, I'm a huge fan of the Baldur's gate series, Fallout 2 to New Vegas, Diablo, and many other RPGs, and think Wasteland 2 was absolutely terrible.With 40+ hours of game-time I feel like I have a pretty substantial view on Wasteland 2, and in the end, I  think the devs just don't understand what actually makes a game ***fun***:* Walking across an entire area cleared of all enemies to get back to the world map is not fun.* Holding back on my attributes because I might run into some challenge requiring more lockpicking is not fun.* Being interrupted on the world map for nearly always boring-as-♥♥♥♥ random encounters is not fun. (Seriously though, couldn't you make some unique random encounters that are more than nameless badies, or stop spamming me with encounters when I have a 100% chance of running?)* Save scumming is not fun. Holy ♥♥♥♥, 50% of my time is spent save scumming. Want to open a safe? Save scum. Want to take apart a weapon and need a certain piece? Save scum. Starting a hard battle and need to hit an enemy with a hard-to-hit headshot? Save scum.""Oh but just don't save scum and accept the consequences"" is the worst excuse I can think of. It is simply human nature to shoot for the best outcome; failing at a percentage based challenge we know we can avoid by save scumming just feels bad. It feels almost equally as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to waste time trying to get the desired outcome, but still feels better than getting ♥♥♥♥-all for your effort by accepting your ♥♥♥♥ luck.New Vegas did this right: If you had the attributes to attempt a challenge it was pass fail. There was no reason to save scum,; save scumming wasn't even an option! Diablo did this right: If you exit the game, you save the game; you aren't even able to save scum! How did the devs mess up this crucial component in 2014?**Graphics and Camera**The graphics themselves are only OK. I don't expect them to be ground-breaking on an indie game. With that said, Fallout 1/2 and Baldur's gate still stand the test of time because every background is a literal work of art. Wasteland 2 simply looks, well, OK.The real issue is that the 3D camera mechanism SUCKS. The compass is constantly off in some unexpected orientation, things are often hidden from view, and the map system is painful at best. The landscape is so bland and monotonous that you can't tell where you are from simply looking around. Even after 40+ hours of game time I still get lost unless constantly looking at the map and re-orienting the compass. Even Baldur's gate, a game made in the late 90's, had user-placable map-markers, and BG 2 had pre-placed markers on top of that so you could tell where the ♥♥♥♥ you were.On top of the confusing camera and map, there is almost NO quick travel. Why do I have to walk across the entire prison map or Ranger Citadel to get in and out!? How does that enhance my experience? How is that enjoyable? It certainly doesn't make the game any harder, it just wastes more of our time.**Combat**Combat is OK; there is some element of strategy, and action point management is mildly interesting. That said . . it could really use more variety. Games like Diablo and the BG series had so much variety with spells and skills. Fallout 3 and New Vegas had the VATS system, stealth, and live combat. Wasteland 2 is just a throwback to Fallout 1/2, which is fine on it's own, but 15+ years later they couldn't think of anything new?On top of this, the lack of pause and coordination before a fight is maddening. In baldur's gate you could issue tasks to each member of your party to do unique and interesting actions . . you know . . LIKE A REAL AMBUSH!? In wasteland 2, all you can do is shoot the ♥♥♥♥ out of one person. Hell, even fallout 1 and 2 let you go into VATS mode!When I win a fight in Wasteland 2, I don't feel very GOOD about it. There simply isn't enough strategy to actually make much of a difference in a fight. The real decider of outcome seems to rely on your weapons, and the enemies decisions. If anything, I feel like I should go grind for experience to have a better chance, and that just makes me sad about wasting more time to progress in the game.**The Attribute System**Fargo talked all about making characters with specialties but absolutely failed. Getting by with a character who has under 8 intelligence is a pain in the ♥♥♥ because you miss so many skill-based opportunities. None of the other attributes influence your skills, so they are all a depressing mix of combat-stats. Charisma only needs to be high enough to pick up companions, and you're left ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off if you put it too low to include one. It all just feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ min-maxing formula: ""At least 8 int, at least X charisma for these party members, and whatever mix gets the best AP for the rest of the stats while retaining a reasonable combat initiative. All this tailored to the weapon (higher CI for close-range weapons)"".Because the stats do not influence skills, they all do practically the same thing. Nobody is actually specialized because making a character with too low of AP or combat initiative makes them near useless. Anyone used to a little bit of customization in RPGs will just make everyone a bland average that optimizes as much AP as possible.**The writing/acting**Good god, I don't know if it is the writing or the actors, but this ♥♥♥♥ is cringe-worthy the whole way through. From the insanely clean live-actors (really? No dirt on a DESERT ranger?) to the how-in-the-♥♥♥♥-am-I-supposed-to-suspend-my-disbelief voice acting, it is just painful. Did anyone actually enjoy the live-action video? Couldn't that money have been spent better elsewhere? Does Vargas talk like any real person you've ever heard?And finally . .**Side Quests**Rails nomad is the only place in all of Arizona that is full of quests you don't need to do to finish the game. All other standalone areas either have only a handful of trivial sidequests. The main areas themselves have many trivial side quests . . but none have any *substance*. The nuke silo is about the only substantial sidequest I can think of, and even that is pretty damn trivial in length. Compare to things like Fallouts 1 - New Vegas or BG, where there are side-quests spanning multiple areas, and MANY areas at least as intricate as Rails Nomad. All the side quests in Wasteland 2 just feel like shallow time-sinks.			"

												Kind of amazing that such games like Wasteland 2 still gets developed. It plays and looks like a CRPG from 15 years ago and it's just great. I mean, to me Fallout 1 is undoubtedly the godfather of all RPG games. Fallout 1 was a mature, amazing game that almost everyone liked. However the inspiration for the creation of Fallout was Wasteland. Now we have Wasteland 2, which greatly honors the CRGP genre unlike the modern iterations of Fallout. If you enjoyed these types of games back in the day, you will love the gameplay and the unforgiving challenge in Wasteland 2.

												This game is not Fallout or even Fallout tactics. It is horrible game that might be okay for 1980, but not for 2014.-Horrible skill systemYeah, it is. Artifically bloated skill list in order to put some artifical replayablility in the game. If character with sniper rifle skill 10 will take assault rifle (it's like sniper rifle, but without a scope) - he won't hit anything and vice versa. Stupid? Indeed. Social skills - pretty much the same. Instead of one skill responsible for speech, we have 3. And those skills aren't alternatives to each other in order to bring diversity in gameplay - different situations will require different skills. Why? Of course to enforce you to replay the game again and again. Let me remind you how it was in Fallouts: one skill that gave you different choices and those choices affected the result. When they wanted diversity - they were adding other skill/perk check in play. And don't even get me started on trade skills - it is all the same. We've got separate skill for cracking safes and we've got separate skill for picking locks. Why? Oh, see above. We also got WTF skills like 'brute force'. While it will be used once or twice in game - it is still separate skill. Why devs couldn't make strength check instead of it? Well, cause we need 'diversity'. Oh, and you can't recover mines you disarm and use them later. Cause, well, this isn't Fallout, it's much much worse game. And stealth skills in game about SpecOPs unit? Never heard of them. And this isn't even deep analysis of how horrible skill system is - I can go on and on about every skill. And perks/traits like in any proper RPG these days? Nope, they don't exist-Horrible level designYup. Your ranger team can't climb on the roofs or hide in the trenches, unless designers intended you to do so. They convinently put the boxes in the battleield so you could use them as intended. Awesome. Levels feel like they are copypasted. Night/Day cycle? Nay.-Horrible (N)PCsIn Fallout 2 a lot of named NPCs followed schedule. Shops opening and clothing, NPCs eating and drinking and so on. That was 1998. In 2014 Wasteland 2 we have static NPCs that stand or patrol all day and do nothing. Not acceptable for the game that position itself as RPG. Even more - your rangers in unit never talk to each other or in any other way express their personality. Even followers don't express themselves as personalities. You can't talk to them at all.-Horrible gameplayBut maybe all other problems is redeemed by awesome gameplay and plot? Nope. Plot is all the same - save the world, blah, blah, blah. But it gets worse. We've got long checklists instead of proper reputation system. For example. We got 2 tribes that are going to war. In normal RPG we help each of the tribes, build the reputation and then convince them to stop fighting and bring the peace.What we have in WL2? We have chief of the tribe with checklist: ""You disarmed bomb - check, saved us from raiders - check, saved child from the lake - check, found drug dealer - check, but you gave my dog beef instead of chicken and therefore the war won't end"". This gameplay design is crap. Oh, and don't forget the forced choice between settlements to save. You can't call reinforcements, you can't split your group, you have to make choice and then the game will make sure that you feel guilty about the choice you made, even if it was forced.Conclusion: don't buy it and don't believe those who compares it to Fallout 2. It's much much worse. If you don't believe me - watch letslpays on youtube - they will confirm everything I said. P.S. I didn't mention outdated game graphics, because I don't think that graphics is what determines how good or bad game is.			"

Before you pass this review by the number of hours, please note that I have put 50+ hours from GOG. I simply couldn't pass reviewing one of the best role-playing experiences I've had, period. I jumped on board with the free-weekend experience to review Wasteland 2.Imagining a Rocket-Ship from a Cardboard BoxWhen I say that the role-playing is W2's greatest feature, some might translate it as the story or mechanics are very shallow. That is a gross misunderstanding, so I feel the need to explain this praise in-depth.The most remarkable aspect is not that there are so many options; it's that the developers trust you with all of them. The level of care put here can be seen when the game accounts for almost every action/consequence, and the team's flavor-text of cheeky, sardonic humor simply adds to the experience.If that's too confusing, then know only this: The developers role with your actions. What may seem like the game leaving too much to the player it feels more like a father adding the rocket sound-effects and shaking of the cardboard box for his child. (Or in a less emotional context, the Dungeon Master who believes in the ""Never say no"" rule.)The game provides as many solutions as possible. Whether it is handling factions with negotiations, violence or some other means. To making the best out of your team with their strengths and weaknesses. To wandering off from the main-quest at any point. (You can even end the game early.) To even how to bypass obstacles like doors, safes, or terminals. The result is that the game respects that you can handle it. And with the Director's Cut, this experience only has gotten better. Quirks, a deceptively simple feature, does so much to characterize your cast by making in-game benefits and downsides. (And unlike in Fallout 1/2, you have four main-characters, so you can roll with the negative effects.) The UI for using skills is now simplified to a right-mouse click if you have your whole team selected. Precision strikes offer more tactical options in battle, and make your character's growth feel better when you can utilize them in the end-game with better odds.All of these extra details will make creating squads just as much fun as playing the game itself. If you care only for min-maxing characters, however, then I think you're missing the point of the system.A C.L.A.S.S.I.C. ExperienceAlthough there is no wrong way to build a character, there are several missteps you can make to make a bad team if you don't read your character sheets for the details. So a few pointers might be helpful.If you have never played a CRPG, start on Rookie. You won't have to worry about the difficulty at the start.Never specialize in multiple weapons at the same distance; have a short-range and a long-range option. (Also, be wary of shared ammo pools at the beginning.) Stats for guns are realistic for once; you increase your handling, not the damage (outside of luck). Charisma for recruitment is cumulative (somewhere between 18 - 24 is good, which you don't need from the start). For leadership, which is one of the few essential skills, Charisma is a must.The way leveling up works is like this: You get a number of skill-points per level based on your intelligence—so long as you get two you should be fine—you get a perk which is based on meeting some skill-requirement every four levels, and for every tenth level you earn an attribute point. The max level is 50, so your attributes won't change much but it might fix some deficiencies. Combat Initiative helps you get to attack first, and before you get to L.A. you will want a minimum of 12 so you don't take too many first-hits.Skills' effects do not stack with multiple characters (but perks do like Radiant Personality which gives you 2x charisma for that character), so specialize characters' skill set. (Never have two leaders.)The only essential skills you will want someone to have are the following: Outdoorsman (higher rank, lower random encounters which is not required), Perception, Explosives (to disarm traps), and Leadership.If you cannot get every essential skill, don't worry as the NPC Angela Deth is a beginner's tool. (She leaves at Titan's pass, so don't rely on her—the only one who will leave by the plot.)Although almost every skill is viable Animal Whisper and Toaster Repair are more fluff than real skills. They do yield unique stuff.If you know this info before going in, then I think the stats' screen will be less intimidating for newcomers and a friendly welcome mat in time.  While the story may not warrant replay value for more context, the content itself is worth replaying, even if you've seen the Wasteland once before--but in another time and space. You're Entering A World of Similar Sounds, Sights & Time...While many people too often criticize W2 for not being more like Fallout, there is a unique problem with the similarities between the Fallout universe and Wasteland timeline. Addressing the problem of ""Who's on first"" doesn't matter but what W2 doesn't take it into consideration is its identity problem.W2 acts like the original in the 1990s wasn't scrapped and that Fallout never happened. Except it did, and it results in a feeling that you've seen everything already if you have played Fallout 1/2 (or New Vegas).For example, many names come off as the Mad-Libs for Fallout staples:-The DESERT RANGERS are a militaristic, militia-based army in Arizona that has territorial expansion in mind as they claim the Wastelands as a unified force. -The Rangers took over the Citadel base of the GUARDIANS OF THE OLD WORLD, a xenophobic group that claims ownership over pre-war tech like power-armor.-The MAD MONKS revere Titans (nuclear warheads) as religious beings/forces of power.-Synths, Roboscorpions, Super Mutants, Mutant animals, a ""not-New-Vegas"" L.A and other not-Fallout staples appear in this game.It's weird to call this issue out, but the first half of the game relies on these similar faces that I think many people might not stick around for L.A. where groups like the God's Militia, the Mannerites, Hollywood, and the Children's Citadel come in. This is one of the only few writing problems I have with W2.As for the main-questline, it suffers from reusing the same objectives (attach repeater units, get kitty litter, get super kitty litter and two more repeaters). The means to fulfill these objectives, however, are different.Lastly, when it comes to the writing the only bad aspect is its sexual content. Sometimes it is really, really cringe worthy (more so than Borderlands and New Vegas), and sometimes it can be really ill-timed. (Ex. Sleeping with show-girls in a brothel with murdered women in the other room.) I don't have a problem with the content as it's optional--I simply wished they hired a show-girl or porn-star to better handle it. Sex should be sexy. All of these complaints, however, pale in comparison to the worst offender some might find: The combat.Don't Die On Me Just YetFor all its complexities, I rather enjoy the system for what it offers, and it kept me engaged for the first 35 hours (before Hollywood). However, by that time I was either expecting the game to end and/or add more. Unfortunately, it doesn't and I had to lull in the final ten hours to my ending.To offset its tediousness, enemy variety keeps it fresh just to the end without RNG encounters. What I think needed more effort are the weapon mods, an ability to distracts enemies' attacks to one player,  and control over NPCs in battle. These aspects feel very unrefined to the rest of the game, and they are the only other faults to be found. If you can accept a little bloated content and dull edges, then you can enjoy an IBM computer classic made in modern times.			"

												Sigh, what a complete letdown, they completely half-arsed the game.  I was a $100 backer on kickerstarter and the short of it, this game sucks.  Bugs are one thing, and there are plenty of those here which is quite disappointing.  But the real problem is that the game itself does not even look remotely close to a $3,000,000+ game.  What the did they spend that on, because it sure was not the cheapo Unity3d engine (looks just as bad as Shadowrun did with Unity3d, which just makes me mad).  The miserably bad live action intro (really?  I mean really???) maybe?  I'm guessing they pocketed it.I am looking at this game from the perspective of having played every single major isometric in the history of gaming, period.If you were letdown by Shadowrun (which I was in a BIG way), be prepared to be let down again, just as hard.The Bad:- Really bad, very primitive interface, does not seem to avail itself of any modern interface concepts.  Want a chat log?  forget about it, best write stuff down *manually* or just have photographic memory.  Quest tracker?  Forget about it, it is kind of there but is missing critical quest details, especially if you save and come back the next day you are left wondering what the heck is going on.  Moving items between people is painful.  In game help system is terrible, it is arbritrary not reviewable, fire once and then disappear forever which seems to be the basis for the entire game design.  Want to rotate your camera?  Be prepared to be fustrated by the terrible pausing mechanism (camera ""hitches"" on the cardinal directions) which prevents smooth rotation.  Limited options all around, the interface options you want are probably not going to be there.  Awkward, clunky, primitive, not a $3,000,000 interface!- 3d characters looks cartoony, again the same problem with Shadowrun and I will just straight up blame Unity3d and the laziness of not just doing it yourself.  In a game like this, a ""serious"" game, a $3,000,000 game, the last thing I think you would want is any kind of cartoon look and they blew that.- Very limited skill selection and character customization.  You load it up and you are like, huh, looks like quite a few skills there, especially in character creation (if the rest of the game had that level of customization, the game may have been worth a damn).  Then you realize it's mostly gun skills with a few tacked on skills like lockpicking and then the lol ""hacking"" skill that all work EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.  Click, watch an icon change color a few seconds, soon you will be bored.  And then a few hours later in the game you will be depressed by the limited amount of customization available once you start the game and next thing you know you are leveling up ""submachine guns"" to get 5% better chance to hit.  Joy, so fun.- Inventory / loot - terrible.  Just terrible.  You walk around mostly picking up Junk, literally called Junk.  Oh sure they spent some time putting description on the Junk, which you can one-click sell to vendors.  Whoop De Frickin Do.- The world map.  SIgh.  Why, why not just take some time to make it *cool*.  But no, it is half arsed like the rest of this game, you get to watch a spinning sheriffs star icon move across a static map.  Sometimes you find an ""oasis"" where absolutely nothing happens except to fill your water bottle, fabulous.  Some random encounters, with no plot attachment, no story, just random meaningless garbage.- The bugs.  I love watching NPC's run around with empty text bubbles over their head.  Right in the beginning of the game.  Right where even the most primitive QA process would have caught it.  QA.  That's an interesting word, one they obviously did not bother googling even, certainly did not spend any money on it.- I'm depressed, not because the game was super awesome, dark, apocalyptic and really drew you into the setting of the game and left you with the post apocaplytic feeling you have been craving for years after dumping money into this kickstarter project.  No just the opposite, it was so bad it draws you *out* of the game as you are appalled by the low quality that $3,000,000 can produce.  Well done there Inxile, a good notch on your belt.  Which is probably a Gucci belt that holds up your Versace pants as you get into your Mercedes AMG and laugh at the kickstarter chumps all the way to your McMasion.The Good:- Excellent job with the ambient music.  I would like to say that this extends to all the in game sounds, but not so much.  The bugs appear to make some of the sound not work to begin with, for example missing voiceovers, you will have one character with a voice over and the other character just has text and no voice, really poor form (I can't even write anything good without hitting the bad - BAD SIGN)- Good story.  Which would have been great, like really great, if it was paired with a game that was worth anything.- It is a post apocalyptic setting and you are fanboi and don't care about any of this...go for it.---Finally a special thanks to Kickstarter for making this steaming pile of garbage possible and stealing all of our money.  Thank you, really, no, thank you.			"

												War. War never changes. Wasteland 2 is such a spiritual successor to old Fallout games that I almost expected Ron Perlman to deliver those iconic lines during the opening video. Now, let’s not forget that the original Fallout was inspired by the first Wasteland game. And now, in turn, a Wasteland game is inspired by the first 2 Fallout games – and as such, should be a treat for all those Nuke Cola loving, bottlecap collecting vault-dwellers out there.It’s been more than 2 years since Wasteland 2 campaign on Kickstarter was successfully funded – and after more than a few delays, a full version is finally available – but is it polished? Well, yes and no. While the reports of bugs are everywhere on the interwebs, in my 10+ hours of playing I encountered only one game-restarting bug when my party just refused to move from the spot. A quick restart solved the problem, but such bugs should not happen in a game that was delayed for so long and live tested with the huge community of early access players.I won’t spoil the story so far, but the main premise is this – after the politicians “pushed the button”, the survivors of the nuclear wasteland are living in small interconnected communities, looked after by “Desert Rangers”, a self-made police of the apocalypse. You are one of them.The choices you make in the game will affect the story, just like in any good RPG. For instance, near the beginning of the game, while you are patrolling the desert you get 2 distress calls at the same time – one from a farm where mutated plants and animals started wreaking havok, and one from a town being attacked by raiders. You can’t save both – I helped the town attacked by raiders, and when I managed to got to the other town, it was completely destroyed and overrun with mutant zombie plant people. Yup, enemies in Wasteland 2 are awesome.Anyway, my choosing to ignore the first one while helping the other had a consequence – mutated plants were now spreading across the wasteland, so now you encountered zombie plant hordes on the map, solving additional quests that included ridding the affected villages of them and treating the water supply with the serum to stop them from spreading further.This is definitely a game that just has to be played more than once – and I love that.One more thing I loved about Wasteland 2 is the sense of “yikes, I’m getting the hell out of here and coming back later with better weapons” feeling – the dangers in Wasteland are real – and some of them will require you to run with your tail between your legs.That’s all I’m willing to write without spoiling details of the game further. Except for this one little spoiler: there’s a skill in the skill tree called “Toaster Repair”. Yes, there’s an entire skill dedicated to repairing toasters. Of course I invested points in it! :) In short, if you loved Fallout 1 and 2, you will LOVE Wasteland 2. If that was not your cup of radioactive tea, look elsewhere, because turn-based combat and slow but steady exploring is not for everyone.More game reviews at www.bundlehq.com "

												There have been a lot of high profile Kickstarter projects as of late, and few have been larger than Wasteland 2, the project that first showed up on the crowd funding platform back in 2012. RPG fans have been keeping an eye on the title for a long time and, after a lengthy period in early access and a few delays, it finally arrived in September 2014. It’s very faithful to its roots and it provides a lot of the complexity that fans of this genre have been hungering for. This challenging and addictive epic should hit the spot for old-school gamers looking for a party-based RPG fix.The game is a slow starter and it takes at least several hours to sink its addictive hooks into you, but it is an overall success, despite its ugliness and some blunders with the interface.As a sequel to the 1988 classic Wasteland, Wasteland 2 stays very faithful to its roots and picks up about a generation after the events of the first game. It takes place in what used to be Arizona, which has been cut off from the rest of the world by deadly radiation. Your party of four is part of the Desert Rangers, a group of enforcers sworn to protect the innocent in this futuristic wild west.As a post-apocalyptic game, Wasteland 2 contains just about all of the staples of the genre. It has mutant plants, mutant beasts, an assortment of guns, lawlessness, raiders, small settlements separated by vast empty space, survivalism, and radiation. It even has a de facto currency (“scrap” in this case), and just about every other feature that you may have already experienced if you have consumed the glut of post-apocalyptic fiction that is available today in games, TV, and movies. And, herein lies arguably the biggest problem with the game – its setting is stale and it does nothing to provide it with a breath of fresh air.The somewhat overused setting shouldn’t be taken as an indictment of the game’s writing, though, which is very good.  The game has a ton of dialog, lengthy dialog trees, many memorable characters, and a lot of well written lines. You can skip through them if you want, but if you do you would be missing a critical part of the Wasteland 2 experience. The game sprinkles in a healthy dose of dark humor, and there are multiple laugh-out-loud moments. Much of this humor stems from the game’s basis as “1980s retro-future”. Wasteland 2 immediately drops you into the thick of a mystery and asks your green recruits to head out and solve the murder of a fellow Ranger who was trying to set up radio transceivers in the area. Controlling them will be immediately familiar to anyone who has played any nineties CRPG, and helpful tips will guide you through the initial orientation. Moving your party around an area is as simple as selecting them and clicking the desired destination, but zipping around towns is not recommended as you will miss out on a huge amount of information. Pop culture references are littered throughout the game, both relevant and obscure, and range from smirkworthy to hilarious. The breadth of coverage is extraordinary, running the gamut from Blade Runner to Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, via The A-Team. Ever want to see junkie barflies sing the theme tune to Cheers? You've come to the right place. The writers have obviously had fun building Wasteland's world and exploration is thoroughly rewarded, not just with enjoyable throwaway lines but often with useful items for the inquisitive.The story is broken up by the excellent turn-based combat system which will be familiar to Fallout fans. Combatants are queued up and assigned a number of Action Points (AP) to utilise. These are consumed by movement, attacking, reloading, and other actions such as crouching or preparing to ambush assailants which stray into range. When your AP are used up, the turn moves to the next attacker in the queue. You can store a small number of AP to use on your next turn and may benefit from Luck which can grant you extra AP or critical hits. Battles usually take place in areas which are strewn with objects to take cover behind or destructible items such as fuel cans to aim at, which adds more strategy to proceedings. Similarly, planning for encounters is essential to success - charging in gung-ho will get you mown down, especially if your gun jams. Instead, remembering to reload after battles, taking higher ground where possible and utilising the best weapons for the job are key. Sniper rifles are as useless up close as handguns are from a distance, so giving your team a combination of arms alongside hand-thrown munitions will generally give you the best chance of survival.Combat is genuinely fraught, and your team can become afflicted with unconsciousness, bleeding or more serious negative status modifiers which tick down to imminent death. You’re able to inflict these on the enemy of course, but if your medic is out of reach of the party, or worse, momentarily taken out, the tension can be unbearable. Even the new recruits to your team - amongst them a washed-up hobo and a diehard mercenary - have their own ideas during battle, and can often take fights into their own hands and throw your carefully managed plans into disarray.The inventory system is laid out well, although the distinction between useful goods and junk which can be immediately sold is not as clear as it could be. The balance between available goods and the amount of scrap you have for sale is reflective of the overall setting; ammunition is scarce and you’ll need to make each bullet count. Caches of goods can be found in safes, crates and on the bodies of your assailants, but you’ll want to ensure that any traps are dealt with beforehand.If the game falls down somewhat, it’s in its aesthetic. It’s far from the prettiest adventure you’ll play through and the browns, yellows and greys of the post-nuclear landscape are not particularly easy on the eye. That said, the areas you’ll visit are clearly distinguishable. Whether a lush, overgrown agricultural centre or the dingy tunnels of a water treatment plant, the variety of locations is impressive and the game gets by more on the personality of the characters within the world than the actual dwellings they inhabit.The situations you’re thrown into and the decisions which Wasteland 2 forces you to make are what elevates the game beyond standard CRPG fare. The humour is as black as it comes and the gory dismemberment of your foes by shotgun and plasma rifle is easily matched by the disturbing encounters you’ll have with some of the world’s inhabitants. Early on, you’re given the choice of saving one of two key facilities. Choosing isn’t easy and the game will make it abundantly clear to you that your actions have damned the population of the location you neglected, in quite disturbing tones. Similarly, for many of the quests you’ll be handed, the “right” decision isn’t always the correct one and the repercussions of your actions will be felt further on in the game when you least expect it. The most enjoyable aspect of it all is that there is no set path.Wasteland 2, for the most part, provides everything that its Kickstarter backers and fans of the genre were looking for. It has genuine role-playing, a lot of exploration, solid tactical combat, and a long and satisfying campaign. The game’s ugly graphics are the result of budget-related tradeoffs that RPG fans will probably find perfectly acceptable. Its unimaginative fiction and interface issues may be harder to swallow. These issues do keep the game from achieving true greatness as an RPG, but Wasteland 2 is still a very strong entry into the genre.			"

												Wasteland 2: Director's Cut is a diamond with rough shapes, imperfect, not the most attractive, unpolished...but still a diamond!A very fun and enjoyable experience, especially for older RPG fans (Fallout 2 and earlier era), with decent story, interesting choices, freedom in creating your team with lots of skills and perks.You can solve many missions in different manner, lot of homage and easter eggs can be found(or digged) in this game, funny characters and followers and good ol' turn-based fighting system.Overall, it's been a while since I've enjoyed in a new game that wanted to pay respect to older classics.Two thumbs up!p.s - time spent in game was almost 80 hours....

												For the first half of the game, it feels great, the world design is on point, the world feels alive, and the characters are vibrant and insteresting. HOWEVER, for the second half of the game the world space becomes becomes one flat piece of land, and the intricate quests are boiled down into one tedious and annoying fetch quest. Also it is worth mentioning that the combat falls short, enemies move way to far on their (and so do you) some weapons are downright useless, some are overpowered, and the AI is horrible.The party system starts out great, like a lot of things in this game, you create 4 rangers specify their skills and backstories to make each character unique. After creating these characters they become mere interchangable cardboard cutouts, they atribute nothing to the story. The companions you can find throughout the wasteland help combat this, most of these NPC companions are useless though, most become useless halfway through the game.The attribute system is a joke, if you try to create 4 diversed characters with each a unique set of skills, you will have a bad time. The only useful attribute is Intelligence, as it determines the amount of skill points you get with each level. All of the others are effectively useless and only determine if you can see something, swing something a bit heavy, get your turn first (sometimes), or shoot your gun twice instead of once.Wasteland 2: Directors Cut added a system in which you target a specific part of an opponets body, each part would have different effects on the enemy if you hit them in that spot, however each part makes your chance to hit significantly lower, to the point where it is useless, it becomes either, you MIGHT be able to shoot this guy's gun out of his hand, or you can just straight up kill him. The sysytem is interesting on paper but is just garbage in practice.Here's hoping Wasteland 3 doesn't fail in the same way.			"

												I have played both Wasteland 2 and Wasteland 2: Director's Cut. I *really* wanted to like this game, and there are things I do like about this game, but unfortunately they are overshadowed by several design decisiosn that I feel are completely game breaking, decisions that ultimately left me feeling nothing but disappointment.To get this out of the way first, yes, there were a *lot* of bugs, from graphics not lining up properly, to strange problems with the names of clothing, to crashes to desktop on load, to a horrific problem in Ranger Citadel where attempts to load the game in Ranger Citadel would leave me with a completely crippled interface and the feeling that I had somehow broken the game so much that it would never recover. To be clear, while these were annoyances (yes, even the Ranger Citadel bug for which I eventually found a work-around), none of them were bad enough to actually make me dislike the game.Also, to get THIS out of the way, I agree that the visual style could have used some work, and the audio definitely left something to be desired, especially the background noises which, in the Ag Center, nearly had me tearing my hair out at one point. But, again, none of this actually made me dislike the game.Instead, up to a point I liked the game *in spite* of these problems. I liked the combat system. Sure it was relatively light on tactics if I wanted to just plough through encounters, but if I was smart, I could end encounters in one or two rounds. I liked the weapon and armor system well enough. They were definitely servicable, and modding weapons was kind of fun. I liked character customization well enough. The perks and quirks were a nice addition. I also liked some of the rebalancing, and felt like my characters in the DC were better able to handle themselves in a variety of situations than my original Wasteland 2 characters. I liked the plot for a while. I saved Highpool on my original Wasteland 2 playthrough, I saved Ag Center on my DC playthrough, and I liked them both. I liked the Rail Nomads, and the little hidden surprises scattered around the wasteland, including the random encounters. I especially felt good about the number of options I seemed to have for resolving a number of the situations I ran across. It felt good. It felt right. I was pretty happy.Then I went to prison, and everything went to hell. Suddenly all my options went away. Without spoiling anything, the prison area presents you with little in terms of choices, and it is frustrating. Especially in the DC, I got to the prison with characters that had a lot of options available to them, and yet at the prison they were largely unusable. Further, the logic that the game presented behind *why* I had no options just did not follow. What's worse, the outcome at the prison seems to be the same no matter what you do there. I've searched for an explanation online, only to discover various apologists saying that the development team was trying to hammer home the idea that the wasteland is really terrible. The problem with this argument, of course, is that you do not have to take away player agency to get this point across, and yet this is what we are left with. Confusingly, in earlier versions of this game those choices did exist at the prison, and there seems to be no good explanation as to why they were taken out.And, unfortunately this is where I had to stop playing both versions of this game. This is when it stopped feeling like a role playing game, and started feeling like a visual novel with some cosmetic combat, and not a particularly interesting or engagine one at that. Is it unfair to judge the entire game based on my experience? Maybe. But I have tried to get back the feeling I had of playing a role playing game, the one that the game still managed to engender early on in my playthroughs, but the immersion has apparently been broken irreparably.Maybe if I hadn't seen the setting half a dozen times in other games, or if the plot were more unique and engaging, or the gameplay more interesting, or the game less frustratingly buggy, or the graphics more beautiful or the audio less . . . horrific . . . Maybe if these things had been the case it would have carried me through this immersion-breaking area and onward towards the end of the game. And maybe I will still be inspired to play through the rest of the game, experiencing it in its entirety and I will change my tune. But every time I try to play again, I am presented with the fact that my choices in the Prison area will have no impact on the game, not even any HOPE of impact, and then despair sets in and I cannot continue. Not despair over the setting or the plot. Not despair over the fates of the individuals in the Prison area who are doomed because the wasteland is a horrible place. No, my despair is over the poor design decision. I *know* that it could have been a better game, that they could have confronted us with an unforgiving area that showed us how brutal the wasteland can be without taking away our options/choices/agency. But they did not, and so I cannot recommend this game.			"

												A better Fallout game than Fallout 4. If you want a good CRPG with: story, choices, characters, gameplay, and plenty to explore. This is the game for you. The only 'downside' to the game that I can think of is, if you haven't played other games of this type such as: Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale you might be a bit lost to begin with. If you've only played RPGs that hold your hand and tell you what you can and can't do then this might be a shock to the system. The game is about exploring and finding your own way of doing things, even if the game doesn't state you can do, it doesn't mean you can't.			"

												Look, all I've ever wanted was another Fallout 1. This isn't it, but then again, perhaps I am not the target audience.If there's one word that sums up Wasteland 2 then that word is OK. The combat is OK. The writing is OK. The gameplay is - you get the picture. The only way Wasteland 2 distinguishes itself is its length.Play this if you have a 100 hours to kill and don't mind pointless difficulty, then forget about it in a week. "

												I was a kickstarter backer for this game and originally played it back when it launched. The game at launch was very buggy. I remember about three separate times when I had a problem with a quest but finished it anyway only to get a patch the next day that fixed the problem I had. I don't remember much of my original playthrough other than I stopped playing at the canyon of titan and decided it would be best to let the game incubate and then restart it some time later when it's been all patched up.That was almost three years ago. Since then, they've released the Director's Cut edition complete with better textures and a new perk system. They've even moved on to promoting Wasteland 3. Surely Wasteland 2 must be in its finest form by now, right? Guess not. Instead of having a bunch of minor bugs with unimportant sidequests, I have run into a game breaking one that prevents me from progressing the main story. My current campaign that I have invested 26 hours in has been a waste of time. I couldn't even get further than my original playthrough. This alone makes me unable to recommend this game to anyone for any reason. To be more specific: I was trying to get to Damonta. I talked to Red at the junkyard and asked him about the Rad suits and he told me to talk to a prisoner at the citadel. For some reason, this conversation never registered. Vargas nor the prison guard will awknowledge it. After aimlessly walking around, I went back to Red only to find that goat mountain had reset and so had all of Red's dialogue. Asking the same questions a second time still did not result in being able to speak with the prisoner in the Citadel. But what if there were no bugs? Even then, I think the game would be OK at best. You start the game by creating four rangers. Its impossible to make characters that look good unless you really like the punk-ish, mad max ""junkyard tribal"" look. In fact, the game in general is kind of ugly and low poly in a bad way. Even for 2014 standards. Should I have different standards for kickstarter game graphics? I'm not sure. A quick search for mods to remedy this revealed only additional character portraits. You can control seven characters total and the small bit of praise I will give this game is that the characters you can enlist along the way are all better looking and way more interesting than your four main rangers. The enlisted characters also allow unique interactions with some quests. Seeing how they fit into the world was always neat.  When characters lose all health, they go into a downed state. If they're attacked in this state, they're dead forever. Theoretically, you could kill off some of your four main rangers and have mostly enlisted characters, but the enlisted characters can leave your squad for story reasons so that's not the best idea. The core component of the game is combat. It's fine. Combat is turn-based and takes place on a grid. Each individual unit takes a turn with the order of turns determined by the unit's stats. Its very similar to the pre-bethesda fallout games. You can put your troops behind cover to get aim and evasion bonuses, but what counts as cover seem inconsistent. There were also a few times when the combat grid did not properly fit inside a room resulting in the east wall counting as cover and the west wall being half a square off grid and impossible to take cover behind.I think my biggest gripe with ideal bug-free Wasteland 2 is the skill system. Skills are things like being able to shoot shotguns well or pick locks. Each skill has 10 tiers. There are way too many skills for you to construct a team that can handle everything. That would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that some skills are way less useful than others and you won't know this until you are well into your first playthrough. I'm convinced that Wasteland 2's skills could be organized into a tier chart much like people do with characters in a fighting game. I found toaster repair and animal whispering to just not be worth it at all. I've never tried safecracking and I'm afraid safes are the same as toasters, just random high-value loot stores. It's also hard to know what spreading a character's skillset too thin looks like at first. From my limited experience, I would not recommend giving someone more than five skills but I can't be sure what that will look like by the time you reach the end of the game (*IF* you reach the end of the game). If five seems limited, it gets worse when you consider one or two of those skills should be a weapon skill. Maybe you can get away with having a pacifist utility character, I haven't tried it. I don't like the idea of missing out on the end of a side quest because I wanted to shoot a gun more accurately when I should have invested in computer science and wish they had separated the progression of combat skills and utility skills. It's important to be able to shoot the bad guys but finding alternate routes through quests using utility skills is fun! What if you could do important AND fun things?!But I guess Wasteland 2 isn't about doing fun AND important things. Its about wasting your time with bugs. Waste... 2 much time... land. Yeah.Don't buy this game. Have doubts about the upcoming sequel.A final story-related nitpick:I also remember not assuming that giving the leader of the topekens the brake shoe would result in war and instead, I would be given a chance to reason with the topekan leader. I made that assumption again in my most recent playthrough and was very disappointed to fail that quest a second time. Is that on me or is the Rail Nomad stuff poorly designed? "

												I really wish instead of a yes or a no we could choose ""Eeeeehhh"" when it comes to whether to recommend a game, because that's basically how I feel about Wasteland 2. While the story is interesting and the character creation is deep, the combat is basically broken. Your party members will miss most of their attacks regardless of what their to-hit-chance is, and I literally just spent two and a half rounds watching every single character I had miss every single attack over and over, and each of them had a percentage chance to hit their enemy higher than seventy. This isn't unusual, and the frustrating thing is your enemies typically have no such issues, and always have greater AP than you do, so when you're frequently facing off against multiple enemies, you're basically just watching your party take piles of damage. It got so bad that at a certain quest location, I had to leave the area to purchase more supplies because my party had no way of healing itself, and the NPC who was with us called us cowards and left the group, and now I have no way to complete the current questline without going and grinding up levels so I can sink points into the required skills she had to pass obstacles. It's not about challenge, it's about a lack of balance in the to-hit numbers generator. When my characters can succeed every single time cracking a safe or defusing a bomb with less than a 30% chance to do so, but they can't hit something standing right in front of them three times in a row with a 76% chance to land a blow, there's something broken. Similarly, though this is more an issue in the player's favour, early Raider loot is sort of ridiculous. If you wander around outside the Ranger HQ and grind levels there, after one level you should have no difficulty slaughtering the raiders that pop up as random encounters with ease. Not only do they give a solid chunk of EXP each time you win, but they drop PILES of expensive healing items and ammunition, sometimes multiple stacks of them, and everything else they drop can be sold for a ton of cash. The machetes, for instance, go for $42, and while not every Raider will have one, they still drop frequently enough that you can simply farm them for cash and equipment until you have stacks and stacks of healing items and armor and ammunition.The other complaint I'd offer is that the setting and world doesn't feel very apocalypse-y. Yeah, it's all sand-blasted, but water seems to be plentiful, people are growing food, and the atmosphere fails to give a sense of tension and danger. This is largely due to the fact that travel simply happens on a map, and the random encounters take place in the exact same little mini areas each time (down to the placement of objects), so the world seems very small and empty rather than giving you an idea of scope and the consequences of the end of the world. It feels less like an RPG and more like a linear turn-based strategy game... there's no real reason to explore the world map, and there's nothing to do unless you continue the main quest, which you don't really get any input in. In all honesty, I likely would have been a lot less harsh on this game as a whole if the accuracy issue hadn't soured me towards it, and if that were patched I'd recommend it a lot more. It has the potential to be a rock-solid, challenging, deep strategy game, but as it stands, it feels like it needs more tweaking under the hood.			"

												They should never have summoned the name of Fallout 2. A game that can never hope to find its match.There are about 5 skills that are basically a different form of unlocking chests. And 3 skills that are persuasion. It's redunant and feels arbitrary. The choices in the game, at least at the beginning, are basically moot. IE: Choose food or water. Whatever you choose, prepare to hear what an idiot you are from everyone in the game constantly.Also, after playing the first mission twice and experiencing both sides of the quest, I found that one side is monumentally more developed than the other. With more voice acting, more characters, more missions, and a much better story. It's so incredibly weighted in one direction is its kind of gross. You end up with far more loot and levels after completing one side of the quests than the other. Very strange.What got me to write a negative review was getting to a town where a NPC is drowning and there is only one way to save him. The player must have one particular skill leveled up to save him or he will drown and you will hear from 50 different people what a screw up you are. That's not clever. That's not good game design. That's just lazy.PSDon't play this game on anything higher than the lowest difficulty. The combat is interesting at times but grows tedious. And you'll want to skip having to replay a fight just because all five of your team members had their weapons jam in one round of combat.			"

Early Access Review
								First of all, this is my 3rd review or so?  Anyway, over the course of the development my opinion on Wasteland 2 has changed considerably.  Like a few others, initially I wasn't too happy with the progress and the money, but over time and updates ive grown to accept it.  It is a promising game, that I hope will resurface the Brian Fargo legacy, as it is an interesting setting for a video game.  Being a fan of fallout, I jumped to this game shortly after the early access was announced.  However recently there have been a number of large updates, most of which render saves useless, which is understandable.  I won't be playing it though until the stream of updates and patches come to a halt, as I am eager to see the finished product.  If you are considering this game, I'd say go for it.  You will have to be patient, as Rome wasn't built in a day, and post-apocalyptic Arizona wasn't nuked in a....well you get the idea.  It will take time, but i'm sure the hardworking developers are putting a great deal of effort into it.  Combining the X-Com and Fallout genres, this might be the game for your summer.  As far as recommendations on what to do with it, i'd like to see an improvement on all aspects of combat, like guns jamming, limbs being torn after you do an overkill.  One thing I would love to see is a more basic version of the Sniper Elite killcam, with bullet time.  Im not sure if that would work, but definatly might be a nice reward to snipers in game. Anyway, rant over, buy the game, enjoy the summer, aaaaaaannnnddd im done :D.			"

												Tough, painful, and worthy of ragequitting. And no, I'm not talking about the game being difficult.I'm talking about:A skill system which is brokenAttributes which mean nothingclunky game mechanicsthe AI taking multiple turns in a row with unlimited SP and near 100% hit ratestatistics shattering weapon jams and missesutterly no roleplaying experiencea tactical game where you only need one tacticand the list goes on.In fact here's one example, you have an assault rifle, there's no one around you, your enemy is in the ""sweet spot"" as in not too close, not too far. Your gauge shows that you have a 70% chance to hit. and you miss. not just once, but 5 times in a row. or more. As I posted on another person's review in a comment: ""I really think the devs need to go back to hs and take some statistics, cause the odds of missing so many shots in a row when it's 70% or more ""to hit""... is beyond stupid. Think about it, a 3 in 7 chance to miss five times in a row is 3 in 16,807 (or a 0.01% chance of happening). But it happens so frequently it's more like the reverse 70% chance to miss. But then again, even the odds of missing 5 times in a row would still be 7 in 243 (or a 2.88% chance of happening).. which is still absurd. And yet the game does this for most people I've heard talking about it.""This is a common experience. and it just keeps going. enemies almost always hit, have twice the range of your snipers (from even the beginning missions), your guns jam at least once a battle (when each gun's jam rate is 5% or less), and so on.I just about rage quit the other night because the immersion in the story is so awful it just breaks you out of the game by destroying the suspension of disbelief. You get ""badass"" rangers telling you that they are the team that goes in and kills other rangers, and get told stories of other rangers making tough choices and coming out on top. Then you try and do anything contrary to the story and you're done. You do one thing wrong and an entire town aggros against you. And no there's no charisma stat that calms people down, no speechcraft skill which says ""slow down compadre,"" no kill the leader and stop the aggro, it's just one bugged out exchange where you might as well reboot to your last save (if you're lucky enough to not trust the game to make backup saves from time to time) or you kill the entire town/area and (as some have said) you cannot complete the game. I personally don't have any experience with that, as I'm only 20 something hours in, but come-on, this is ridiculous.It's not about a complex storyline or making a game that's tough, it's sloppy game design mixed with poor story writing. And it's bad programming, on numerous occasions I've experienced a plethora of bugs including one where the camera won't pan, but for some reason I can move the sun in the sky (yeah, no joke). And the stuff that is programmed ""right"" is just poor. There is no choice in the game other than linear save town A and you have problems with town B for the game, or save town B and have problems with town A down the line. Then there's the AI and battles, at first it's new and fun and interesting. Then it's just a poorly designed squad tactics game where the enemies do the same thing every time and so do you. I really only employed one strategy in 20+ hours of gameplay. set up 2 short range fighters, set up 2 assault rifle fighters and 1 sniper and the rest of the game is a cake walk. It's not fun, it's repetitive.Another problem is the ""fans"" who jump on any topic you make or post and immediately say it's your fault the game is bad, or that you're not reading all the text, or that you are doing combat wrong, or... blah blah blah, but the game is as I've stated above, one-dimensional, clunky, broken and worthy of ragequitting. This last bit about the fans can't be the dev's fault, but the hype about this being the game everyone wanted Fallout 3 to be, is like gasoline on a fire, it just burns hotter and less controlled. If you take an objective look at the game, you'll see the same stuff that I and many others have pointed out. At least with the story stuff I'm willing to agree to disagree, as I can see how if you don't think about the story or complete failure on the roleplaying aspect of the game then you've got yourself a repetitive one-tactic game where you make choices like a train choosing which railroad track to take, sure you can take the long way around, but the end result is the same, you're still stuck on the tracks.I really really really wanted to like this and I just can't. Maybe I'll give it another try down the road, but I've got a sour taste in my mouth right now.			"

Early Access Review
								I want to start this off with this comment; the game is currently in beta.  That said, I am sure you have read that multiple times now through the various posts.  So, where to start?  Straight up, this game will not be for everyone.  No, that does not mean it is a bad game.  Far from it, honestly.   I bought the deluxe edition on a whim.  Wanted to try something new.  I saw it was beta, so I started playing with that mindset.  That, so far, is the biggest thing.  It is not a complete game, so some things do not work, or work as expected.  Now, keeping that in mind, if you get this game, the end product in my opinion, will be phenomenal!  I am playing on max settings, looks and runs smooth, no issues.  I DO NOT have a top of the line machine.  Voices thus far are good, dialogue is great.  Combat mechanics are good.  Story so far seems great as well.  To make this easier, if you take the time to read this, I will break it down.  Again, keep in mind this is a BETA.  Not a beta you may be used to, more like end of the line alpha.  Point being, a WORK IN PROGRESS.  PROS:--Character customization and looks in game.  --Story is great thus far.--Combat will be great once game is complete.--Graphics / audio / and interface thus far are all great.--Gameplay is sweet.  I said it may not be for everyone because combat is tactical / turn.  So, think back old school with X-Com.  I love that part of it, personal opinion.  --Combat animations / effects are sweet.  --Choice and consequence are a part of this game.  You save someone from drowning, his parents offer him to you as an added party member if you want.  Plenty of characters to change up the party.--Different skills are used for different things.  Obviously, ha ha.  Those chances to use the skills on a frequent basis are not persistent in other games.  There are a lot of opportunity to use each skill you have in your party.  I like that.  --A TON of interactions within the world.  Be it digging stuff up, repairing gadgets, even down to repairing toasters, ha ha!  (definitely have someone in your party that can repair them, because you never know what's stored in one!)--Completed game will hands down be great.CONS:--Loading a save will often change the portrait of your character(s) if they are created from scratch.  A minor annoyance, unless you get into combat, then you have to go by name.  Or, if you made a guy and your portrait is now a gal.--Combat, sometimes, can be a bit.. Interesting.  You have a sniper, that has 0.0% chance of hitting a target.  That same target now moves behind cover, and you now have an 80.00% chance to hit.  --Combat again, some enemies have ridiculous move / attacks.  They will move across the screen, attack you twice, then move again... BETA, remember.  It will frustrate / annoy you though, ha ha.  --Make sure you get a dedicated surgeon / healer.  I roamed around for a bit trying to find someone that could heal my wounds, to no avail.  --There are times when walking around on the world map you are accosted by bandits, raiders, whatever, only to enter combat (if you choose) and find everything dead.  Good for the free loot, bad because you never know what will really happen!--The game crashes from time to time AFTER combat is completed.  --Some game choices have to be made on the spot, you do not have a lot of time to fart around and trying to figure the puzzle out.  You take your time, (drowning boy for example,) he will die.  Some people may not like that part.  --With no tutorial yet, character creation can be.. difficult.  --Finally;  some characters you may spec for conversation bonus dialogues, sale prices, et-cetera.  Once you enter dialogue, there is no way to change who is talking, so in cities, towns, you want to lead the party with the talker if that is your thing.Again, it is a beta.  So far, overall, great.  Most of the cons I have listed will be fixed (I assume / hope) with end product.  If you can look over those things for now, you will not be disappointed.  ESPECIALLY if you like RPG, tactical combat, decision making, and crafting.  I do not typically write reviews, but I wanted to get one out there since there are a lot of negative reviews.  A hidden jewel for a game, even in beta.  I give my nod of approval.			"

												I really enjoyed this classic-style turn-based CRPG. Imagine something similar to the original Fallout games, but with an interface more akin to the new X-Com. You can rotate the camera and zoom-in and out. Plus, you create four characters rather than control a single hero. The skill system, quest structure, and NPC selection add greatly to the replay value.There's also some fun writing and scenarios you'll find yourself in. It's definitely a bit gritty, but not without some humor of the dark, grossout, and lewd varieties.It's not without faults, but in my opinion it's a great tribute to the original Wasteland and a great game on its own.

												This game is not Fallout by any means, but true sequel to the original Wasteland. Familiar places and characters, tons of references to the original game and even plot continues W1 storyline almost directly. Graphics is functional and personally I like the style and design. Combat is pretty fun and satisfying, death animations are gorgeous, but most of the time it is very straightforward and tactical depth is lacking. I think it is not a huge problem because it is  not a pack of ""clear the map""  missions unlike Fallout Tactics (don't get any ideas, I love it) but true big CRPG with choices and consequences and you don't need to fight anything on your way. And there is so much things to do here! So many non-obvious ways to deal with problems, that you hardly see 65% of the game content in one playthrough. Beating this game once took me about 80 hours. Pretty lengthy for the nowadays non-sandbox RPG's, I should say.Absolutely recommend this. Truly immersive, packed with amazing dark humour, tons of skills and stats and exceptional replayability potential. Post-apocalyptic RPG's fan heaven.			"

												This game isn't so much 'wasteland' as 'wasted opportunity'. Where Fallout/F2/FTactics were self-explanatory in regards to mechanics and tactics, this game mistakes 'complexity' for 'depth'. I play tactical turn-based (TTB) for the pleasure of planning and setting up effective ambushes and assaults and despatching enemies efficiently. It is this element that is at the heart of all turn-based tactical games, from Silent Storm and Jagged Alliance through to the original Fallouts. Wasteland 2 throws this aspect of the genre out altogether. What is not clear is whether this was intentional, or just the result of really incredibly poor game design and a lack of knowledge of what the genre is all about. Remember, Wasteland was an RPG, not a TTB, and Wasteland 2 has not made the transition well. It's not RPG enough to be an RPG and not TTB enough to satisfy the TTB grognards. The combat system is borked. There is no tactical complexity to the combat at all. In all real combat, the side with the initiative tends to win. In this game, initiative automatically goes to the enemy. No setting up mutually supporting arcs of fire then luring the baddies in. No, you set up your mutually supporting arcs of fire, fire a single shot, then the baddies swarm you.  You only get to try to gun them down when they're next to you. They are able to run across the map to get you. My 'leader' toon has an assault rifle. When he fires a single shot to initiate combat, enemies (even those outside his range of fire) have the opportunity to run fifty or sixty yards and initiate hand to hand combat before he can fire a second shot. It's ludicrous to include a semi-automatic rifle in the game that fires the equivalent of once every fifteen seconds. A hundred years ago, soldiers with bolt-action rifles were firing aimed shots every two seconds. Does InXile understand how firearms work?The probability engine is also borked. It's not uncommon to miss 5-6 60% shots in a row. This also extends to other skills such as lockpicking or safecracking. Many other people giving negative reviews have also commented on this. The presence of indestructible objects (ie, the vines in the Ag Centre) that block progress until other goals are achieved is inexcusable, especially considering the confusing and unclear mission objective system. You literally cannot approach a mission in any way other than that deemed appropriate by the developer. The character development process is bizarre. Your Strength stat has nothing to do with your strength-related skills. Your Charisma stat has nothing to do with your social interaction skills. You may as well put all your points into Intelligence to maximise stat points on level up and enough into Agility to maximise your action points in combat. To reiterate: no matter how rubbish your stats are, as long as your skills are high enough, most of the stats really don't matter.I completed Fallouts 1 and 2, and got as far as I could in Tactics until the bugs killed the game, and never felt as frustrated as I have with this game. The fact that I have 20 hours invested without even completing a single module says a lot about the game. The graphics are, to my mind, no better than we saw in Fallout nearly twenty years ago.  But I could forgive that if the core gameplay was there, but it's just not. The tactical aspects are ruined by an idiotic system that ALWAYS gives the enemy the initiative. The mission log system is unclear and confusing. There are booby traps on at least a third of the items, doors and chests EVEN IF THERE IS NO REASON FOR IT. I applaud the attempt to bring Fallout-style gameplay into the present day, but this game is just a wasted opportunity. I wanted to believe, and instead I just wasted $40.What a tragic waste of time and money.EDIT:You know what?The only thing funnier than how bad this game is, is the number of people who keep comparing it favourably to Fallout 1/2/Tac (bearing in mind those games are 10-15 yers old).The only thing more tragic than a wheelbarrow full of cute puppies on fire is the number of fanboys who cruise the negative feedback section giving 'not helpfuls' to people trying to steer unsuspecting buyers away from this piece of crap.It's just sad.

Early Access Review
								Edit:So, months ago I said to check back to see if how it has come along.  The game is getting pretty wild.  Destructible cover, Weapon modding, improved inventory, character sheet, and character creation pages.  Tons of content for being an Early Access game.  Not perfect, but damn good.  If you can't wait till the August release date you better go ahead and get it.I decided to add to my edit today.  As I am clearly a fanboy and need to offer up some of the negatives.  The AI still aren't the most diverse group of people.  The different factions all wear the same gear.  Sometimes they make really strange decisions.  Mostly they are balanced, sometimes WAY stronger than you expected.When you put on that awesome new combat armor you just purchased it seems to fit under your leather jacket.The character creation system lacks some depth that I came to love with the SPECIAL system.  However they have made serious improvements from my January review.Original:Pros:This game really is a relative of the Fallout 1 and 2 titles.  You will notice.Plenty of juicy story for an early taste in beta. Looks great if you can crank up the settings.Cons:Isn't optimized yetsome bugs are annoying, some break thingsIt is Early Access BETA.  Other Thoughts:Plenty of updates are coming.  If you don't get it today check back in a month or two!			"

												One of the first rpg's I ever played was Wasteland 1 as a youngster (Either first or second). I have great memories from it, at the time it was something very new and different. Years past by and when I was a bit old Fallout 1 came out, while not the same it was great to play a game with the same ""heart"" as my beloved Wasteland 1. Then came Fallout 2 which was even better and Fallout Tactics which was alot of fun to. Years later Bethesda does a new ""next gen"" fallout game with fallout 3, which while good for the mainstream and new players to the series, to vets it just wasn't the game we had hoped it would be. It didn't have that fallout (or wasteland) feel to it, the story was crap, most the characters extremely dull and overall a game that just realy felt like Oblivion with guns (as annoying as that saying was to me before fallout 3 came out, it did ring true for me after fallout 3 came out and I beat it). Thankfully Obsidian came to save the day and released the wonderful Fallout New Vegas. I was excited by this, Obsidian has alot of old Black Isle devs (guys who made fallout 2) and sure enough the showed Bethesda how to do a proper fallout game with there engine. A bunch of factions helped, Obsidians wonderful writing for the story helped, the dialogue was well done, interesting characters, great voice work (John Goodman? Hell yes), it felt ALOT more like the early fallout games (it just had that fallout feeling, something fallout 3 just couldn't nail)..After all that we have Brian Fargo bringing his talents to Kickstarter and getting Wasteland 2 kickstarted. What we have here is a wonderfully crafted game, jam packed with content, Wonderful writing (characters, story and dialogue), tough choices that matter (best since Alpha Protocol and New Vegas decisions imo), great atmosphere, fun gameplay, Controls are good and a great job of balance (especially in the skills and character builds you can do). For new comers asking ""What is this game like? I never played wasteland or Fallout1/2!"". Well it has a bit of Wasteland 1, a bit of fallout 1/2 and a bit of xcom all mixed together. The turn based combat is a joy to play and doesn't get boring as each battle can be different then the last.You're choices actually matter in this game, you might make a decision and not think about it, only to have it come down on you later as it shows the consequences of you're choice. The game does a wonderful job in the writing department as I said above, having Chris Avellone from Obsidian helped in this aspect and it shows. Characters you meet are interesting, the dialogue is very well done and the story keeps you very interested. The game world is harsh and unforgiving, you better make you're decisions wisely, always make sure you have ammo and medical gear and be on you're toes. You will thank me later :)This game is deep, complex and I friggin love it. The game has come a veyr long way since it was in alpha, at first the UI they had was terrible and I was worried this was really going to take away from my enjoment of the game. Thankfully though the developers tried some new versions, listened to fans and in the end made the UI a ton better. Alot of missions have multiple ways of doing them, you will find yourself either playing the game 2-3 times or saving the game and seeing how different decisions or actions effect the game and the world around you later on. Sometimes I find I have made the right decision at first and then hours later you might hear of bad things that happend because of what you picked. The game is not perfect, there is a few bugs, I wish there was more visual customization for characters and the graphics are not the best, but the good far outweighs the bad in this  new modern crpg. If you are looking for a new rpg that has hundreds of hours of gameplay, great replay value, wonderful writing, nice atmosphere and great gameplay give this game a go ASAP. You can really tell that this game was crafted with love, no publisher telling them to get it out early or telling them what to add to make it more popular. This Brian Fargo and his team at there best and this is a testament to old school rpgs and doing kickstarter/early access the right way. After spending 100+ hours on this game (and plants to play atleast another 100-200 ours), I can say it was well worth the wait, it is one of the years best games and that I am very excited to see what InXile comes with next for there new Torment game. If it is as good as Wasteland 2 we are in for another treat and another resurection of a charished old school rpg. 26 years after I first fell in love with Wastelands charm we get Wasteland 2 and Inxile sure did deliver, this game rocks boys and girls. There are a few things I wish where in the game and a few negatives but 95% of this game is a masterpeice I must say. As someone who has been playing rpgs for 25+ years, this is just what I wanted from a Wasteland sequel, good writing, fun gameplay, interesting characters, tough choices and tons of content. In a day and age where old game series get new reboots and games totally different from the original games, it is a breath of fresh air to have a sequel to an old game be JUST what the fans of the original want.

												I backed this game on Kickstarter and would do so again, if only to feed the hope that classic Western CRPG's might live again someday. After all, it inspired some other Kickstarter RPG's I've enjoyed, like Shadowrun: Dragonfall... But Wasteland 2 is not the messiah we were waiting for. It's a passable game that ticks all the right ""old-school RPG"" boxes, but it doesn't feel inspired. It doesn't feel like the game that a team of devs had been dying to make for years, as the story went. It feels by the numbers, cheap, and boring.Wasteland 2 simply disappoints in almost every respect. The graphics are passable, and have improved significantly since the beta, but they have no art direction or style - they're just, well, ugly. The gameplay is cool at first, because it's nice to have turn-based combat and actual RPG skills back, but as you progress through the game you start to realize how unbalanced it all is. Combat is either far too easy or impossibly hard, with enemies one-shotting your fully leveled and heavily armored Rangers. Most skills are only ever used for opening different types of boxes filled with random loot that usually sucks, and since you can easily max out all skills across your party fairly early, the ""hard"" skillchecks just become annoying random dice-rolls with a high chance of failure, even with full skill.And worst of all, the characters and story are amazingly bland and forgettable. There are plenty of ""choices and consequences"", but few of them are affected by how you built your character (only 3 skills are ever checked in dialogue - the dialogue ones), they seldom intertwine or branch out, and they're just not interesting. Most of the situations in the game are actually comical (or at least try to be). Why should we even care? It's hard to believe how many skilled and experienced writers were supposedly on board for this project, when the results are this utterly forgettable.I enjoyed parts of Wasteland 2, just because I enjoy any oldschool RPG where you can create your own party. But in the end I felt compelled to finish it only because ""Well, I've come this far..."" I would not recommend the game to anyone, not even a hardcore RPG fan. Just play one of the classics again, and don't bother with Waste-of-time 2. I sure hope inXile's future RPG attempts are better.			"

Early Access Review
								Woe to any game that comes out between September and early 2015 - Wasteland 2 is the old school CRPG we've all been waiting for.  The beta still has some beta wonkiness, but the game that is emerging is everything I hoped it would be.  The systems strike the nifty balance of being both deep and intuitive, and I can't say enough good things about the writing.  Long and the rest of the writing team might just have crafted one of the best written RPGs in history.  The tone is super specific and unique, and there is just an embarrassment of writing riches.Wasteland 2 doesn't feel like a throwback.  It feels like a modern game that evolved naturally in some alternate universe where cRPGs never went out of style.  This is an easy Desert Island Game for me.  And it isn't even done yet!			"

												I've preordered this game, via steam, as an early backer. I can only speak for the beta, which I would give 8.5/10.This game is a tactical RPG (Think Final Fantasy Tactics, Fallout, Might & Magic) with a setting in a post-nuclear wasteland (Think Fallout, but different). The REAL spiritual ""Fallout 3"", the story is a successor to Wasteland 1, but NOT a requirement to play the game, it's completely standalone.The biggest strength of this game is: The feels. Early on (15 mins) you get a choice which will immediately change the storyline in a minor way.Over and over you will feel the sting of the game as your actions bite back in an emotional way.Ask yourself these two questions, and then you're ready to play this game:""Do the needs of the many really outweigh the needs of the few?"" and ""If I save this man from death, how will I know he will not harm others?""Game on, brothers and sisters.

												I wanted to like this, but it's just no fun. Your characters have no personality, at all. The conversations are just a boring series of ""Tell me more about X"". There's no need to choose your characters' skills because you can cover everything between your team. Stats are woefully unbalanced, there are clear and simple *best* stats and *dump* stats.Worst of all, the gameplay is so, so slow. Everything is about slowing you down, wasting your time. I played for 4 hours across 3 sessions, and every time I stopped it was because I just couldn't handle the tedium any more.I backed the kickstarter, everything sounded good, but the final product is mostly mediocre with a few really awful bits spread around. I wouldn't recommend it for free, because it's such a boring waste of time with no redeeming features.			"

												I first played Wasteland 2 back when it was finished. Its was a damn good game but with a couple of issues here and there but overall a really fun game that was essentially the closest thing to Fallout 2 since Fallout 2. (I love the original Fallouts almost as much as I love the new ones.) Im happy to say the Director's Cut version is a massive improvement over the original. With a multitude of fixes and additional content/mechanics to make the game feel fresh. Its overall the superior experience. It does still have a few bugs, a few confusing quests and overall slow pace early on in the game but despite this the game is great fun. For those of you that dont know Wasteland 2 is the sequel to the original game from the 80's and a spiritual  sequel to Fallout 2. Its an isometric turn based post apocolyptic RPG, one of the few of its kind. You have some really in depth character customization/rpg elements and some really damn good combat. Seriosuly its great, its even better than X-COM's combat. Overall if you love Fallout, RPG's, post apocolyptic games and have some patience then Wasteland 2 Director's Cut is the game for you!(Note I have deleted my original review and updated it with this one)			"

												This is a bit of a spoiler, but I met a weird guy out in the wastelands who professed his love of vintage video games. Dude's place was stacked, every wall covered with game posters, every shelf packed full of memorabilia--dude even had a collection of vintage arcade cabinets. We had a fun little conversation and after I left that town I didn't think of it again. A few weeks later I'm out dicking off in some obscure corner of the in-game map, wandering around looking for an oasis to refill my canteens when I stumble upon a little easter egg: the buried literal truckloads of unsold 1980s ET atari cartidges. There were a ♥♥♥♥-load of them, way more than we could carry in our packs. Then it ocurred to me: you know who I bet would be into all of these cartridges? Video game collector guy.So we load up with as many cartridges we can carry and backtrack all the way to that town. Now, we exhausted all the quests in that town, met with all the dudes and solved all their weird problems; we had no real reason to return. The game gave me no indication that this dude would be interested in these ET cartridges. No quest compasses, no journal entries, nothing. But lo and behold collector dude loses his ♥♥♥♥ with excitement over the ET cartridges. It was like we brought him the holy grail. We got experience and rewards for doing it. And this was something that we easily could have missed, something I easily wouldn't have even thought of doing. But the game knew. And the game rewarded it.♥♥♥♥ like that will never happen in a Bioware or Bethesda game. Even in an Obsidian game, I reckon. Next level RPG. A+			"

												This game is HUGE and AWESOME! If you explore thoroughly and do everything you can, the game will take at least 70 hours. And if you enjoyed Fallout 1 and 2 then you will almost assuredly enjoy this.But the real reason to play this, and something I don't see discussed much for some reason, are the choices you get to make throughout the game. I've played a lot of games where you are given quests and different ways to resolve them, but this game blows all of them out of the water. Almost all main quests and most side quests have 2, sometimes even 3, different ways to resolve them. And it isn't just a simple resolution with a different reward, characters and sometimes places change based on your decisions. Almost right at the beginning of the game you are given the choice to save one of two towns (or neither) and both places have their own unique recruitable NPC and quests. Not to mention the ever present option of ""kill everyone you meet"".In fact, there are unique dialogues put into the game if you choose to kill indiscriminately. For fun I decided to save my game then kill everyone in the mayor's office of the town I saved. Afterwards some anonymous citizen radios Ranger Citadel and snitched on me, so Vargas radios me asking if it's true and I'm given a choice of admitting it or playing dumb. If you play dumb he tells you to go check it out, if you admit it he asks you why and then gives you a free pass this time. I'm pretty sure if I had continued my murdering ways Vargas would send after me the elite squad I met at RC who handle ""problem rangers"". I reloaded though.It's not uncommon to go to a town and there be some kind of conflict going on. You pretty much always have the option of siding with one side or the other (or neither), but more than that there are usually different ways to solve it for either side. If you have high enough speech skills you can usually make it easier and/or more diplomatic, or do what the leader wants you to do (like eliminate the opposition instead of finding peace). Although, since this is the wasteland, few people are entirely ""good"". Almost everyone is bad in their own way, though not always entirely malicious. Sometimes the bad stuff they do is to try to help others, so is bringing them down truly the best choice for that town in the long term?What really impresses me is not just the incredible amount of quests and their multiple ways to solve them, but all the little touches made based on your choice. In one town there was a guy about to be executed and I had noticed a pre-dug grave for him. After I managed to free him I decided to go back and re-examine the grave, and there was new text saying someone had taken a dump on the gravestone. I love it.Yes there are some bugs, including quest-breaking ones. But when you understand the mind-boggling amount of connectivity everything has based on quests and the many different ways to do them, then I think you can forgive the relatively few bugs there are currently in the game. And don't worry, the devs are working on fixing them!In closing, there is an extraordinary amount of replayability in this game. If you love the ability to make choices and see those choices have a real impact on the world around you, then you simply cannot pass this game up. Buy now, no need to wait for a sale!			"

												This game is so close to being awesome. The characters are fun, the world is immersive. The weapons upgrade system is alright. Exploring is fun.The combat is what is really difficult to handle. The grid system is horrible. During regular movement, characters can move and stand in what seems independent of a grid system. But when combat starts the characters are forced into a very clunky grid formation. This makes diagonal shots somewhat of a cheat when hiding behind ""cover"".  Also, there is no way to move your party in a formation, which means that when walking into an obvious ambush, there's no way to keep your party in good order. They just move into a lump. It's hard to have a good time with the combat system with these limitations. "

												Sure as hell don't recommend it for the price.I played the original ~20 years ago and this does well as successor.  It tugged at my nostalgia in every way it should, making me excited about what the wasteland had been up to in the aftermath.  I wasn't disappointed with this game.  The turn based strategy combat was easy enough to get used to, the fights were challenging and offered a sense of accomplishment, and world exploration forces you to map out your path prior to embarking across the wastes.  I genuinely like this game.But not for its base price of $40.  If you're going to get it, hold out for a half off sale.			"

												Wastelands 2. What to say. First off, if you like turn based games wich offer immersion, depth and an enjoyable long story then this game is for you. Wastelands has quite some really good things going for it but some flaws as well as I see it. I'll try to list them below.Good:- The setting. Really well done. Heck, the intro made me misty eyed and I felt my emotions responding to things happening in the game more then once. I was quite touched when a companion died for one and really came to loathe the bad guys even if they weren't bad for the sake of being bad. All the factions made sense to me and their struggles were a delight. - Your choices and actions matter. Maybe you don't see it at once but very often you do see the results of choices later in the game, sometimes quite subtle. Well done! Actions have consequences. Quests almost always have more then one way to solve it.- The combat system is well done even if it isn't entirely balanced and I feel some stats (speed) and weapons (assault/ sniper/ late game heavy) are better then others (luck/ charisma and melee, shotguns and hand weapons.)- The game looks quite nice. The locations are quite varied and ussually carefully made. Some minor locations and battle scenes were slapped together or recycled though. It takes a while to fully explore a town and that's good.- Lots of easter eggs and hidden secrets - you are rewarded for taking a good look as opposed to rushing through. - The voice acting is really well done, adding to the immersion. Not so good:- Quests tend to need a string of actions to be done in exactly the same the correct order to get the optimal solution. Who cares if I order first and then put coins on the counter or vice versa in the shop? This is a source of frusteration. You also likely will look untill you are eighty or crack and shoot everyone for the solution of some quests without using the internet. Ye gods. This would have ruined the game for me more then once if the story wasn't so compelling.- The difficulty spike half way the game is beyond silly. For a few encounters you have to fight vastly superiour enemies with hugely sub par weapons. I don't enjoy duelling a fully armored knight with a wooden sword thank you. After you find some new weapons the difficulty goes back to a much more acceptable level. This really needs a fix.- I didn't like the first major choice and how it would doom people no matter what I did.If you can live with three two above points I think you should grab the game, pin on your desert ranger star and start patrolling Arizona.

												I can't recommend this game. I guess I can't complain too much. I am a huge fan of Fallout and Fallout 2 and it is truly a blessing someone wanted to create a game in that vein. However, there is too much that cannot be overlooked. The game looks hastily prepared. Interactions feel generic. There are countless in game glitches. Pathfinding is very difficult and that makes it hard to complete the missions without having to read clues from forums. Even when you know exactly what you are supposed to do, it is sometimes very difficult to make the NPC's progress to the next quest item or find the resolution without hunting down some obscure almost unrelated item to trigger the resolution after doing all the rudimentary work to complete the quest. I tried to find enjoyment, but after a while, the game became tedious as I had to level up a specific skill in order to complete a mission. That meant I had to wander around the wasteland searching for enemies to kill just so I could level up skills that would open my dialog choices or help me ""see"" things in order to trigger events. So if you are playing, make sure you level up perception, kiss ♥♥♥, smart ♥♥♥, and tough ♥♥♥ skills. If you level up combat skills and the usual lock picking, medical, hacking skills, you will not beat the game. That leaves you with very little freedom in choosing your skills, and to add insult to injury, you are only allowed to level up to level 50, therefore you cannot waste your skill allocation on something you might need in the beginning of the game like melee weapons. Energy weapons are almost useless towards the end of the game. Only level up in Assault rifles, sniper, and maybe Heavy guns. Lastly the back stories were dull and uninspiring. FInding things and reading things was a treat in the predecessors. The history books and back ground journals are dull and tedious adding to an already tedious game. When the game hinted of a Wasteland 3 game, I thought oh no.			"

												If you played the original Fallout or Fallout 2, and liked them, then definitely check this out.  It feels like what Fallout 3 would have been like if Bethesda hadn't taken it FPS.  This game is really fun and has a lot of depth to it.  The story is ok, nothing amazing but solid and keeps you wanting to find out more.  Keep in mind that ""fun"" doesn't equal ""exciting"".  It's a slow paced, tactical rpg.  You'll get 50+ hours of exploration in a single playthrough, gradual character development, etc.  It's also got replay value, considering there are a few choices that you have to make that alter the game quite a bit.  There are some mechanics that I could see frustrating some players, like friendly fire chance if there's a teammate near the person who you're shooting at, weapon jam percentage, etc.  But I think it adds to the fun when you start upgrading your weapons to NOT jam so damn much.  Skill checks are a bit annoying, since you have to wait a bit for an animation with each one, and there are a LOT of them.  But it feels like they shortened the wait time in the Director's Cut (along with other improvements that were made to UI and graphics).  The graphics are solid.  Nothing special, but really feels like a polished, higher texture version of a late 90's top-down rpg. The best part about this game, to me, is how the story just kind of develops around you.  For example, my first playthrough:  I'm trying to get my sniper out of this jail.  I'd offered to have him locked up in this settlement (fairly far into the game) while I complete a quest for the leader.  But after I complete, he refuses to let him go!  It's my sniper, so I try to take a hardline against the guy.  This sets off agro for the ENTIRE TOWN (dozens of people and soldiers to suddenly fight).  So my team's backs are agains the wall, fighting endless waves of guards.  As we're fighting, I accidentally target the town's merchant as he's fleeing (the target was red, I thought he was an enemy!) and kill him.  Sorry bro.  Keep fighting, and after 30 minutes or so I finally have murdered the entire town, but my sniper is free!  While I'm looting the corpses for ammo and such, I come across the merchant.  His ENTIRE inventory is on his body, and lootable!  I bank upgrades for all of my characters, plus armor, plus a sizeable amount of money.  Did I feel sad about murdering the town?  Hell no, they'd double crossed me.  Felt more like I'd hit the lotto!  Would do it again.So if you need constant excitement and stimulation to enjoy a game, this won't be for you.  But if you can appreciate a well designed game that unfolds slowly but gives you a great story with random humor mixed in (the screaming goats, lol), then check this out.  I highly recommend it.

												I waited for the finished version of this game with great anticipation. The hype and the promise of a return to old school, turn-based, squad based adventure gaming in the mould of Fallout 1 and 2 was enough to have me keen to play.Ultimately, having just finished the game, i have to say it was a disappointment that fell way short of my expectations and my desires. The gameplay is a regression to 20 years ago (with updated graphics). The environments look good, but they are mostly eye-candy and are not interactive at all (except for doors,chests,safes and holes in the ground).It is as if the last 25 years of turn-based games never happened, and none of the detail and gameplay innovations from games like JABIA have been considered for this game. Worse still, the game is not even as good as Fallout 1! The combat is so old-school it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...one of the worst turn-based combat engines I have played in years. Like I said...as if nobody in the development team had even played any modern turn-based games in the last 20 years, or if they had, they had chosen not to apply any of the principles to their game.It is barely a sandbox - with two small maps and about 6 major locations on each map. The game felt very scripted and linnear and freedom of gaming choice felt very limited. This game is not worthy of admission into the post-apocalyptic hall of fame. It is as if Fallout 1 and X-Com Enemy Unknown had an unwanted, stupid, ugly child.All in all- NOT woth the $40 u.s.d. that I paid for it and it has left me feeling very disappointed because I wanted so very much for this one to knock it out of the park and to redeem the genre for a new generation. It looks as if I am still waiting for a game that completely updates my favorite style of gameplay, with an intricacy of detail that modern computers make possible, and a depth of interactivity with characters that I create within a massive story that I control through the choices I make.

												Wasteland 2 is Fallout and it isn't. Imagine meeting a long lost relative from a gruffer more harsh time period when men were men and there wasn't any horseplay. That's how Wasteland feels compared to a younger Fallout series that doesn't take itself as seriously. I see a lot of replay value as the game forces you to make hard choices right away you know will impact the rest of the world. It's a very mature game for hardcore RPG veterans with rock solid graphics for a period game revolving around atmosphere, and if you were a fan of the old series you'll feel right at home.Here's an update as of 7/11/16:My take on Wasteland 2 vs the Director's Cut: You can't go wrong with either, and my only regret is when I played Wasteland 2 at launch the achievements werre bugged so I need to go back and get those at some point but....I have yet to go back to Wasteland 2: DC because the original left me so satisfied. It took roughly 135hrs to power my way through Wasteland 2 (I'd say about 45 of those hours were spent backtracking/loading due to bugs/glitches/ai RNG cheese) thoroughly and it was worth every penny. Very well written and detailed. Acceptable graphics and combat. Feels like a great Fallout game if you don't mind it's a tad linear.			"

												Wasteland 2 is the best written game I've played in a very long time. Every time I find a new piece of junk I rush to read its item description. It helps that the gameplay is straight out of classic RPGs like Fallout 1 & 2, Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights and Arcanum. The world isn't black and white but also not grimdark, you get the sense of a place where most people just try to scrape on by. Add to that challenging combat, believable characters, interesting environments (full of things to use your multitude of skills on and interesting to explore) and mood-setting flavor text at every turn. I've already spent a ridiculous number of hours in the wastes, and I imagine replaying this game many times in the years to come.			"

												Of course its not the best looking game, nor is it without a few crashes here and there,  but this game is great.  The depth of the story is just awesome, it pays plenty of homage to the original Wasteland, and took me back to a time in which the gaming world wasn't totally focused on multiplayer or FPSs.  If you are a fan of old school RPGs go for this, especially if you loved the old school fallout games. I did get a tad frustrated with the ineffectiveness of shotguns, and it would be nice if you could have your squadmates target individual enemies so you can ambush them before entering combat.  However, as I said before I really thought it was fun as heck every time I played it. "

												Maybe one of the best games i've ever played. Excellent Turn Based RPG.  Story Driven,  Build your own character.  Excellent world and lorecraft. This was made by the same people who made the original Fallout games and it very much is the true successor to that line of games.  Dozens of choices throughout the story add loads of replay value and customization.  While there are some great characters you can recruit throughout the game, you can start out with your own 4 man squad that you customize yourself, giving you tons of controll over how the missions will unfold.  Can't recommend enough.			"

												** Quick note: I spent around 60 hours playing, and Steam tracks those hours under the 'Directors Cut' sub, but makes us review the game under the vanilla sub, which is kinda odd. **Wasteland 2 is an isometric RPG with turn-based combat set in a post-apocalyptic world. The story is simple enough; you as a group of new Desert Ranger recruits must set out to investigate the murder of another Desert Ranger, and continue on with the work he was trying to do. In your travels you will meet plenty of folks out in the wastes all needing help of some form, and you are free to carve out your story as you see fit. This game excels at throwing moral dilemmas at you, often making you make some pretty tough decisions. Most of the situations you face or often many shades of grey, and you often find yourself trying to decide on what the lesser of two evils may be. I love that sort of gameplay element. There is no ‘good guy’ or ‘bad guy’, and the Wasteland world is a harsh and complicated place.The decisions you make in your travels do have a big impact on the world around you and I love that. You will see a montage upon finishing the game reminding you of the people you met and how your decisions changed their lives or situations.  It also means this game has high re-playability, with multiple story branches to follow on further playthroughs.Apart from that there is plenty of loot to find with all the usual weaponry at your disposal, and your Rangers have fairly diverse skill tree’s to play around with. This game can be quite tough though so unless you’re a veteran to these sorts of things I would suggest playing on normal difficulty and remember to save often. Highly recommend to all CRPG fans.

This game is good, but be prepared for a hard game because this is the sequel to wasteland 1, the game that inspired fallout 1. but if you are going to play it - make sure you 1) make a guy with medic skills, 2) surgeon skills.

												Man is this game good. Wasteland 2 should be the benchmark for franchise reboots and how to do them right. So often, when a beloved franchise of yesteryear gets a new game, one of two things is the result:1) The game is pretty cool, and has the same theme as the original, but is wholly different in most other ways, and has completely replaced all your classic gameplay with something else. (See: Fallout)2) The game is faithful to the original to a fault, the big fault being that the original was sort of clunky and it's now many years later so they should have made this ♥♥♥♥ a lot less cumbersome, but chose direct adaptation over quality.Wasteland 2 manages to thread the needle and avoid both of these traps. All that good classic Fallout-type gameplay is there, but they've gotten rid of all the agonizingly slow annoying clunkiness. This is just pure old-school fun. The skill-use system is great. Assigning skill points is great. Making decisions that matter and effect the world is great. This game is an exemplar of the form, and while not everyone enjoys tactical combat and meaningful choices in a harsh world, anyone who does should play this game.			"

												Temporary Place Holder, short and concise until my official review is entirely complete.This game has deep roots and it lives up to what it once was.  Many know but less are aware that this series is what gave birth to Fallout. Fallout 1 , 2, and tactics. cRPG at its best. This game rivals that of the recently released Divinity, especially because it has  some voice overs for important stuff. The game is very deep. Especially with player choice. The graphics are decent.  A lover of turnbased rpgs will greatly enjoy this game. Someone who loves lore will love this game. Someone who likes post apoc theme will love this game. It is not flawless, no game is. But ultimately it is a fun, enjoyable, and super engaging experience that so many games have been  lacking the past few years. It is great to see the team back in action. +Rep to inXile for this great release. The only thing that could make it better as a cRPG honestly would be MOAR!!!! VOICE OVERS!..... and coop.			"

A turn based rpg just like they used to  make them, top quality. The people that are down voting this game are COD kids or people who have zero patience or finesse in games like this. In my opinion this game surpasses fallout 1 and 2 and all the other turn based rpg's i have ever played. So far i have played it twice and will probably continue to play it until they release wastleand 3 which will be even more badass than this one was.

												I should note, that this game takes time. First 4-6 hours i wondered what's so good about it, but later it was impossible for me to stop playing, so if you're having problems with the game just try to force yourself through couple of first quests. I promise you, it gets better. Pros:+ nice and versatile story. There are several different outcomes of the main quest and each is interesting in it's own way+ gameplay is good. It's turn-based and mostly depends on your positioning, gear and your character's skills+ visuals are fine. Sure they're not stunning, it's not Crysis, but it'll do+ tons of cool side-quests and ways of completing them. You can go in guns blazing or take a more subtle approach(es). Each choise has it's own advantages and good sides, but it's up to you to decide what to do.+ interesting characters. Not all of them, of course, but mostly characters (aswell as the story) are written very good with a nice slice of humor. + exploration is really rewarding. Game encourages you to go where you're not supposed to (like radiation clouds and other places, where you might find shrines or cache)+ lots of weapons, clothes, equipment and other stuff+ tons of fun easter eggs and references+ is generally fun to play once you get a hang of it Cons:- sometime it feels like the game overstays it's welcome - some quests and their alternative ways are really not so obvious. Some people might like it that way though- it's really easy to screw up your character (try to pick 3-5 skills for each character and only level up those. Otherwise your char will be a mess) - it's slow. Because of turn-based gameplay and lots of walking-there-doing-that some basic quests take lots of time.What i expected: bigger-better-cooler FalloutWhat i got: basically what i expected			"

												I really wanted to love this game - I've played through, completed, and thoroughly enjoyed the original release: sure, it was always buggy, and almost ever gaming session ended in a crash, acheivements never worked for me on OS X, and there were numerous glitches - but it had character.So, with the chance to finally make this the great game it always had the potential to be, I'm sad to say that the Director's Cut is a distinct step backwards which appears to have needed more refinement and playtesting before release.There are numerous bugs which seems to have been reintroduced (Mac and Linux acheievements are again MIA) or created (when you expel a character from your party, they disappear forever - you're supposed to be able to recruit them again) and then there are the technology problems: there's apparently a significant memory-leak in the Dynamic Shadows implementation which progressively kills long-running sessions, and there are serious issues with non-nVidia graphics cards.Running the game on OS X on a Mac Pro, the frame-rate is awful and the game crashes 100% of the time when trying to leave the first area, both with custom and stock parties: the game is unplayable.Although it pains me to say this, as I really do wish the game well, in its current state I'd wait for further patches and confirm via the forums[forums.inxile-entertainment.com] that the major issues have been resolved... but I remain concerned that the game made it to release in its current state.I'll update this review if and when the problems are patched.

												EDIT: For some reason I can't seem to be able to put my review under the Director's Cut version of this game so that the hours played would show correctly. The original version of this game I have only idled for 15 hours or so get the cards drop (which seemed to take forever by the way). In Director's Cut I have 210 hours, and this review is for the Director's Cut only.Maybe the best testimony I can give of Wasteland 2:Director's Cut is that it made me put in 210 hours in less than 6 weeks. Now I might have been a bit slow and thorough, but as you can tell by those hours the amount of content is huge. Maybe the first 20 hours or so I spent playing with my first crew which I then discarded, having learned enough of the mistakes I had made creating it. The rest of the time, 190 hours were divided between two complete playthroughs maybe by a ratio 100:90 respectively.It's not a flawless game and it may be easy to disagree on various amounts of it's design decisions. Nevertheless it certainly is a worthy effort in it's genre, and as a whole it captivated me like only a few percent of all games have done. If the post-apocalyptic theme appeals to you and/or you miss the classic isometric RPGs, I think you would be potentially denying yourself one heck of a ride by not giving this one at least a shot.

												This is my first review ever here on steam, and never has a game compelled me so much to review it as WL2, so here goes.Short Review:  This is an unfinished game.  If we, as players, accept this very low bar of completion as OK, then we will reap the ""rewards"".In-Depth Review: I think it's important to understand where this game is coming from before criticizing it.  Tons of Fallout fans were less-than-impressed when Fallout 3 came out and, despite being promised something other than a re-skinned Oblivion (now Skyrim) got just that.As such, the hype was huge for a game from the original makers crowdfunded a true sequel with tried-and-tested Firaxis on board.  The target of 1 million was met and grew to 3 million dollars. The game won a GOTY award and has been well-received.That was all I needed, so jumped in and was ready for just such an experience.I did some reading and carefully crafted characters for the long journey ahead, nevermind thst there's very little in a tutorial to prep you.  I'm seasoned gamer, so go!So I end up roaming the wastes and get random encounters.  Some I try, some I try to flee.  You get ""caught"", and then you're loaded into an instance.  The mobs are now romaing about in the instance, not chasing you, and you get to do these a lot unless you have one skill.  Same scenarios and maps.  Hmmm...is this GOTY material?Then you get into your first quest to go to X place and do Y things.  Along the way, my noob party visited a much higher level area than they were fit for.  Hmmm...no warning?Luckily, we left and didn'tengage our certain death.  We went on to the Ag Center.  I was woefully unprepared, but managed to survive most of it...until I found myself at an impass:  I had tried to crack a safe that has a critical keycard to enter one of the next areas, but I critically failed which essentially bricked the safe, which was the only place where I could get the keycard.I went on having learned the critical rule of this game: you save about every 2 seconds and keep vast repositories of save lists.  Unfortunately, I learned this after i borked the safe with the keycard.  Not one to give up, I went on to other areas and did a boss fight where only 2 of my people had ammo left.  After about 20 tries, we got the guy without running out of meds for people he wasted.Now, that's what happened in the game.  The combo of ridiculous bosses, minimal resources, and the CRUSHING fact that I might not get the keycard I needed nearly caused me to uninstall.My reaction to this is now what you might expect, but it's what gets repeated ad nauseum on forums related to this game.  I took this as old school. You just have to deal with your decisions.  YEAH, and this makes everything more realistic, right?  So I left and had my NPC surgeon Rose desert us and picked up Angela Deth, who is great and all but nobody told me i'd need her, and we progressed...But at the same time, the clunky camera and its limited zoom functions created this ""very atmospheric"" sense that I was lost.  I was...and just wanting one more level of zoomout as compared to the satellite view in my inventory.And then you go into a scenario and place your characters just like you want them as you've done a thousand times by this point: in the right position but facing walls.And this was the point of no return.  I just realized that, for all the ""difficulty"" you face,  the execution is just sucky.  I knew that, if enough people complained, patches would fix things,but, I thought to myself for the first time ever, ""THIS is GOTY?""I stopped blaming myself and started thinking ""these are the problems that justify the existence of play-testers.""  Did anyone playtest this game before release?  Not based on my experience, and forums suggest I'm not the only one who's had the same problems I've encountered.AND AND, if you want to see this done right, X-COM does it to near perfection.   Bottom line: the game required a million dollar budget.  It got 3 million.  In turn, we got something that is still in beta. finished.I don't blame players who are enjying this, but I'll never trust entities again which have chosen it as GOTY when it's not			"

												Having had a long, wonderful history with the old Black Isle games (Fallout 1, 2; Torment; Icewind Dale; Baldur's Gate; etc.) I jumped at Wasteland as soon as I read who was developing it. With 20+ hours of gameplay so far, I'm enjoying Wasteland 2 more than I have any other RPG in years -- more than I have any other game I've gotten from Steam in a long time with the exception of Civilization releases.Wasteland 2 is engaging, thought-provoking, well-written, intellectually stimulating, and even educational. Every battle is a new puzzle. No amount of playing can make the player impervious to what may come next. The writing is superb (surprise, surprise) the music is great, the graphics are beautiful -- although not a selling point -- and all in all this game is easily a 9/10 in my book, and it's not even selling at a triple-A title price (just 40 USD on release day).Negatives: people say there are bugs everywhere. I have encountered one. It was not a game killer and I expected to see more bugs than one within 48 hours of release.People say it is too hard. If you were born after 1990, you'll probably hate even the normal difficulty and very likely the game altogether. There's plenty of reading to do and very little hand-holding. I don't mean to be guilty of ageism, it's just that games have gotten far, far, far more user-friendly since the days of Atari and Infocom. The truth is, Wasteland 2 has 1/10th the difficulty of Wasteland, and W2 is catering to the same crowd. In short: this is a *compromise,* and InExile Ent. isn't apologizing.Conclusion: if you loved the Black Isle games and are on the fence about W2, don't be. I'm hardly through my first sizeable misson and I haven't relaxed so deeply into a game in years. It's like all those comfy afternoons playing Baldur's Gate, except new and improved and back in the Wasteland I spent my 20s in. Quality game development in my book, through and through. "

												First, let me say that I LOVED the original Fallout games (fallout 1 and 2), and enjoy the occasional turn-based strategy game (X-com, for instance). However, this game just fell a little short. I'm not saying it's a bad game, but I probably wouldn't recommend it, especially at its current price.Pros:- The graphics are good enough for this genre.- The sound is okay- The setting is great, and the overall storyline seems kind of interesting.Cons:- THE CAMERA. Ugh. Unfortunately, the camera does not seem to expand far enough in any one direction, and the overall size and spacing of the terrain means you will constantly be heading into dead ends because the camera didn't let you see far enough ahead. It's not a game breaker, but is consistantly annoying.- Too many skill options. I understand that maybe this eventually improves replayability, but it's frustrating to make it through a couple of quests, level up a couple of times, and still be level 1 in most of the skills you've chosen for your character.- Controls and gameplay are annoying. I don't know of a better way to describe it then that. They are not bad, they are not game breaking, but it is constistantly a nusance to come up on an enemy unexpectedly, and all 4 of your squad members are clustered together and are immediately getting shot at.In summary, it's not a bad game, but so much of it is frustrating and cumbersome that it becomes kind of annoying to play. If it's available on sale, maybe try it out, otherwise pass.			"

												Wasteland 2 hearkens back to the day when a 7% chance to fail meant failing 3 out of 4 times, and a game would beat your ♥♥♥ into the ground for the first hour or two, and then dramatically ease up after you get to sink a few skill points into your characters.I'm not sure whether it's more appropriate to say that this game is Wasteland 2 or Fallout 3D, given it owes so much to the original Fallout, which in turn owes a lot to the original Wasteland. In any case, if you've played any of the original isometric Fallout games, then you will be right at home playing Wasteland 2 as the locations, world map, sound track, random encounters, combat, sense of humour, and missions all hold strong comparisons. Also, interestingly, there are positive aspects of the combat that are borrowed from XCOM: Enemy Unknown as well. But that's not to say that this is just knock off - Wasteland 2 is deeply linked to the original Wasteland in its lore and the developers have learnt from the long gap between releases and taken the best of the old and the new and combined them to create a well-designed and deeply entertaining product.Speaking of well-designed, as much as I generally dislike what Early Access has done to Steam, this is one of the games that has clearly benefitted from the system as you can spot numerous little features that have been implimented to improve the game's basic playability and fun-factor. Things like a button to sell all your junk at once, comparisons between the weapon you want to buy and the weapon you have, a solid log book that displays your missions, a button that reveals all objects that you can interact with, and the choice to automatically distribute your loot intelligently to the people who would use it best. All these things and more save the player time, eliminate clunky inventory management or frustrating moments when you don't know where to go or what to click - issues that were all too common in the heyday of isometric games. Wasteland 2 is a loving heir to the original, and exists as a well-designed gem in a genre that typically suffers from over-complexity, suffering little of the clunkiness that one might expect from what one could call a 'throwback'. Its world is real and believable, the combat is fun (even if, at times, the hit chance feels skewed) and its characters are numerous, colourful and well-acted. I highly recommend this to anyone who loved the original Wasteland, any of the Fallout games, or indeed anyone who likes a well-optimised RPG.			"

												This is not a very good game. The NPCs and their dialogue are boring and lack character, they're little more than placeholders to guide you to the next quest, which is unfortunate because Fallout 1 and 2 had such interesting NPCs and conversations.There is no perk system. Attributes other than strength and intelligence are pretty pointless. Levelling isn't exciting since there's no reason to diversify your skillset, so you wind up dumping all of your skill points into one or two different skills.There is WAY too much combat. In fact, this game is almost exclusively combat focused, in my time playing it is very rare to move the story forward without a lengthy combat sequence. While this isn't ideal, it'd be fine if the combat were at all interesting. There's a cover system, but it's hardly used and most combat takes place without being around any cover. There's no bonus to pincering an enemy, so there's not much point to moving around during combat. Gone is the Fallout system of targetting different body parts to cripple them, or make them drop their weapon, the only option you have now is to take a headshot for two extra AP at -50% chance to hit for 200% weapon damage (which is never worth doing since your chance to hit will never be above 95%). The jamming system has replaced the critical failure system. Now you can have a weapon that has a 1 in 10 chance to randomly jam up, wasting your turn.Using skills is tedious. After combat you will want to heal your rangers, which requires using first aid. Each use of first aid requires watching a cross fill-up over 5 seconds, and most rangers require two first-aid packs to fully heal. With a party of 6, healing after battle requires about a minute of not being able to move around or do anything else in the game. Almost every loot container is locked or booby-trapped, oftentimes both, which requires watching some other animation that lasts 5 seconds to fill up. Waiting for animations to complete gets very tiring.One of the strangest design choices was to have a rotating camera. The camera is VERY annoying, you'll frequently miss important items, people, and entrances and exits because your camera wasn't pointed the right way. Designing the levels from the ground up to have a fixed camera perspective would have made a lot more sense.Lastly, the game just doesn't have much character. So far it's a lackluster wasteland without the zaniness, wonder, and humor of the classic Fallout games.I hope they do a lot better with Torment...			"

												'there was too many text to read''the game play is retro , the play map is confining , claustrophobic , the combat is mediocre'Sorry kids that the game is following back to it's roots, but not everything can be a Fallout 3-4 clone.The game is great for what it is and meant to be: a roleplaying crpg post-apocalyptic adventure. Going back to when you had to READ text to understand a story or plot, Wasteland 2 allows you to become immersed in your story with even allowing you to create your own backstories for your characters and customize them. The game has tons and tons of backstory that you can read through if your aren't as lazy as many of these negative steam reviews are. Of course this might not be the type of thing people aren't into but there's no reason to give a negative a review just because you thought the 'gameplay is retro - dislike' like really? What did you expect a game to be when it's trying to mimic the same techniques from a game made in 1988?? This game brings back it's cRPG roots from a 26 year long hiatus, and if you don't like it: it's alright, but don't go placing a dislike due to it being a 'waste of HD space' because it obvious that you can't come up with any constructive criticism that follows up with your argument of it being a 'waste of time'.I'd give it a 9/10 - for what it's trying to be, it does it flawlessly. However, it does suffer from the occasional crashes and camera problems.			"

												First and foremost - THIS IS NOT FALLOUT (first nor second)! Drill this to your head. Do not buy this game thinking it's Fallout. Do not PLAY this game thinking it's Fallout. Wasteland is one thing, Fallout is something completely different. Now lets begin.Do you like post-apocalyptic lite CRPGs? If you do then this is something you should definately check out. Now when I say ""lite"" I do really mean it. This game feels, at times, extremely shallow and simplistic in everything from interactions with the environment, quests, combat and items. Everything is simplified. Yet this still is a good and enjoyable game and worth every penny you spend to buy it.The closest comparison that I can make to this game is Fallout Tactics, which in my opinion was vastly underrated and received way too much flak than it deserved, and I still rate Fallout Tactics higher than this.Character creation is based on the CLASSIC system (whereas Fallout uses SPECIAL) with just attributes and skills. No special perks or traits. You can customize your Rangers appearance, bio and so on but none of that affects your game in anyway.Combat is single squad, turn-based and squared grid layout playing field. Nothing too fancy, straightforward and to the point. You have different guns, bombs and heavy weapons with some different fire modes and ability to try a headshot. The cover system is similiar to the new XCOM Enemy Unknown game with the icon showing cover positions.Quests are typical (somewhat gliche'd) CRPG quests of fetch things, solve problems and make binary choices between factions.Environment is a bit stoic. Things you can interact with can be highlighted with a press of a key and that's about it.Game is full of easter eggs, dark humour and references. This was actually something that really started to annoy me. It feels like in every scene and place you visit is just riddled with them. I mean come on! Candy is nom noms but too much candy makes your stomach hurt.As a whole Wasteland 2 is a good game. It's not fantastic or rebirth of CRPGs. It's just a good game. Just do not try to compare it to Fallout games. The only things these have in common are Fargo and the post-apocalyptic theme.			"

												I have 45 hours in Wasteland 2: Director's Cut. Steam doesn't allow reviews from that version of the game for some reason so that is why my time in this is so low. Anyway, onto the review.Wasteland 2 is a solid game. There is no denying that fact. It scratches the itch of old CRPG's within the tactical genre and it does a lot well. It just does not manage to grab me in the same way other games within the genre do.Good:+ Solid storyline+ Great individual character skill, perk and attribute customisation+ Great combat+ Interesting charactersBad:- Poor visual character customisation- Very little actual ""role playing"" elements- Massive variation in character build qualityThe game is strongest in developing and enhancing the abilities and equipment of your squad and putting your efforts into practise during combat. The problem with this is that they're weapon types in the game that are almost not worth using. The reason for this is simply becuase they are outmatched by the stronger weapon types in the game. The same is true for the character skills in the game and this is my biggest problem with the game. You will realise around 10 hours in that some skills are worth more than others and a broad range of skills within a party is more effective than a highly specialised party. This is fine, it just takes some of the role playing out of the game when compared to Fallout 1 and 2 or other games in the genre where they're often alternative methods for completing objectives in a desired fashion. Whereas here they're instances whereby you need certain skills to simply progress forward. The same is true when you compare the damage and overall functionality of an energy weapon, heavy weapon or a handgun to an assault or sniper rifle. The game therefore artifically begins to pigeon-hole you into creating certain builds in order to make a character or the party in general to be effective. It is almost important to note that if you haven't played a CRPG like this before then you can get truly lost and/or stuck. You may need to use a guide in order to find your way around but this is relatively minor. What I will point out though is that the game can simply gimp you for picking certain followers as I found out in the final battle. Without spoiling anything some followers of mine were rendered useless during that fight with very little foreshadowing or warning of it occuring beforehand. There also seems to be very little choice in how your characters directly handle storyline events or in side quests. You will invariably be forced into a fight at some point to complete a quest and the game rarely deviates from that formula.Is it a bad purchase or is it worth the time to play it? I think that is more of a personal decision depending on what you have personally played. If you haven't played the classics like Fallout 1 and 2, Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment or more recent examples like Pillars of Eternity or the Shadowrun franchise then I would suggest playing them first since I would consider them better games. If you have played CRPG's before and you want something familiar but don't mind using the ""optimal"" weapons and skills then this is a good game for those players. Otherwise I would look elsewhere for your CRPG itch. "

												I might as well recommend this game now. Etiquette tells me I should wait until I've completed the game to give a full perspective, but let's face it- this game is deep enough I'll probably never get to it.It contains all the best parts of the old text-heavy, turn-based RPGs of years ago. The isometric perspective might be nostalgic, but it works so well. There are a ton of great details that make combat fun and interesting with more than enough skills and attributes to make each point assignment a tough debate.Perks are sadly missing. That really would have iced the deal. Regardless, you're getting a great script, fun old-school gameplay with some modern tweaks.If the game has already caught your eye, you aren't going to be disappointed with a purchase. Between this and Divinity: Original Sin, you've got the rest of your year set on PC games and then some.			"

												If you loved ""Fallout 1"" and ""Fallout 2"" as well as ""The Fall - Last Days of Gaya"" you will absolutely love Wasteland 2.  Party based RPGs have been missing for a LONG time, those in a post-apocalytic setting for even longer. Wasteland 2 brings this forgotten genre back to live with thrilling tactical combat, great story telling and that sense of humor that made the orignal Fallouts so great in the first place.I am not sure how far in the story I am now but after doing the first set of major places (4 of them visited) I can also say that they really stuck through with their promises that choices in this game would matter. Both local and immidiatly as well as on the grand scheme of things to come. And I love the game for it.I am not really sure what some people's gripe with the combat system is because as far as I can see there is not much difference from X-Com's and Shadowrun's systems other than some rules about iniative that lead to enemies doing their turns before some of your squadmates do as well as squadmates having two action phases per round. And hey for the most part the AI acts a lot smarter than in those games, which makes overcoming forces that outnumber your squad quite the challenge. You gotta use the terrain and cover otherwise you are quickly out of means to heal your squad or even worse out of ammo.A Modding Toolkit is announced for some time after release and when it arrives I am looking forward to playing some really great mods.

												Ian McEwan once said that very few really long novels earn their length. I feel the same way about computer roleplaying games - especially the kind calling itself Final Fantasy.Wasteland 2 is a game that requires a ♥♥♥♥ing huge commitment - beating it took me 100 hours (more or less, I tend to be a slowbie). And that was just one playthrough where I played the game as a stereotypical do-gooder hero, exploring everything and being a helpful do-gooder with a ♥♥♥♥ed up set of character skills and a tendency to reload and find the best outcome to satisfy my sad, sad do-gooder neediness.But god damn it, this game is worth it if you're into these kinds of timesinks. It's a mix between the old gameplay styles of Wasteland and more recently released computer roleplaying games - a lot of the mechanics of the original Wasteland are at play here, re-tooled for an experience more suited for modern gaming. What I liked the most about it was the ability to solve problems through different means without hinting too deeply at what a solution could be, letting me get creative whenever I could. Locked safe? Hit it with a grenade. Locked door? Get that sledgehammer and ♥♥♥♥ it apart. Terrified settler due to gigantic robot scorpion? Hack the mini-scorpions that it produces to distract the big scorpion while drilling .50 caliber rounds into its face. A guy begging for a CD-i? Shoot him in the face and take his video game rocket launcher to sell for Snake Squeezins. This is such a refreshing breath of fresh air in a roleplaying game, this ability to solve problems!And yes, it looks like something from 2003. Yes, you shouldn't need to read a little text box to figure out what's going on in the game, but what are you, scared of reading? Are you yeller about words? If I had any complaints beyond those two, I'd say the combat gets a wee bit much at times, the atmosphere and story are good but a bit flat in some places, and the thought of playing it AGAIN over another fifty hours or so is not something I'm interested at all in doing right now (but then again, I don't typically re-play video games I beat, mainly because I'm out chasing after a new experience or doing something equally wasteful with my time, like moving my eyes to read a page of things in a collection of pages bound by a spine that also is host to two covers HAVE YOU FIGURED IT OUT YET, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S?)So yes. I wholeheartedly recommend Wasteland 2. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ joy to play, experience, and mess with.			"

												Wasteland 2 is a tactical RPG sequel to a very old text-based game.  While I had never heard of it before, it was the inspiration behind the well-known Fallout games.  To have a sequel come along after 27 years is unheard of, and thankfully they did a very good job with it.While the game was released in a pretty buggy state, inXile diligently released patches to fix everything.  When I played it, I didn't run into any significant problems and there is a director's cut special edition coming in the near future to improve the game even further.  While I feel bad for those who bought the game at release, I'm very glad that inXile stuck with it rather than leaving it a buggy mess like many companies would.  Hopefully their future projects will be released in better condition.As for the game itself, it is a top-down squad RPG with tactical turn-based combat.  There is a metric ton of text dialogue, with the main story being voiced.  The writing and voice acting is ok, nothing special, though there is a lot of humor and references to many other games and old technology which I found enjoyable.  I would prefer more voice acting since I get tired of reading text pretty quickly but I understand that inXile wanted to stick to a similar style to the original game and at the same time having the whole game being voiced would likely be too expensive.  The pathfinding is some of the best I've ever seen in a game with your squad able to easily navigate all the way across large maps with a single click.  Unfortunately, traversing these large maps can take a long time and you will be doing a lot of this, especially if you want clear out your inventory which I will go into later.Wasteland 2 has its own unique RPG systems, with a standard stat system providing bonuses to various skills.  Each character will only get enough skill points to be competent in a couple skills so specializing is required.  There are even special skills that can only be acquired by finding specific skill books throughout the game.  Several of the skills deal with unlocking containers and doors and this is where one of my sticking points comes in.  Even with maxed out skills, your characters have a very low chance of succeeding (and an accompanying high chance of critical failure) and these objects can only be repaired once.  Following a second critical failure they can never be accessed again.  I believe it's meant to convey a sense of permanence to decisions but I feel like it just encourages save scumming.The combat could be a sticking point for many people, though it's not an issue for me.  Everything functions as you'd expect but later in the game, tactics becomes less and less useful.  Arranging party members behind cover can get tedious and isn't necessary later in the game since as you level up, enemies are less dangerous.  At the very end of the game however, it becomes necessary again.  My only real complaint about the combat is that at the very beginning of the game, it is extremely difficult.The game's biggest problem though is inventory clutter.  The game is filled with the greatest variety of junk items I've seen in a game.  Most of these are just sold to shops but some have a shining effect indicating that they are useful in some way but you don't know how.  Unfortunately the ""sell all junk"" button includes these shiny items so you have to manually remove them from the shop each time.  In addition to the junk there are tons of miscellaneous items, each of which can be given to a specific NPC for a reward.  There are tons of these items and tons of NPCs with no hints about who wants them other than remembering what NPCs may have told you when talking to them.  It's a royal pain trying to deal with it all but can be ignored if you aren't a completionist.The game makes good use of the Unity engine with DX11 support and pretty good graphics, though unfortunately due to using Unity it does not support fullscreen mode.  This led to significant performance problems for me.  I'm really hoping that the update to Unity 5 for the director's cut version will fix this particular problem.  Regardless, the game does seem to require much more power to run than it should for the type of game it is.  It seems to be a common problem with Unity games that aim for high graphical fidelity in my experience.Despite a few problems, Wasteland 2 is a fine game.  It has all the RPG depth you'd expect and plenty of content to play through.  Having skipped most of the dialogue due to not wanting to read so much, it still took me more than 50 hours to beat the game.  Wasteland 2 is a game I can highly recommend to RPG fans.			"

												While I can't NOT recommend it, I can't exactly recommend it with flying colors.It's not a bad game, unless you get stuck encountering bugs that show up due to your hardware configuration (and there are a lot of hardware configurations this game doesn't like, both AMD and Intel, both Radeon (AMD) and Nvidia (Intel) graphics cards), you will probably find this game endearing and a bit nostalgic at first.Then you'll realize that's just icing, and there is no cake underneath. It's a very thin layer of icing too.Fallout 1 and 2 are available on Steam.Get them if you've never played them.You'll understand why this game has so many negative reviews.If you want to drop 40 bucks on a game that doesn't hold a candle to games you can currently get for $5-$10, that hails form a modern era but lacks so much of the depth both in combat and questing systems and dialogue that Fallout has... then buy Wasteland 2.In Fallout 1, you're pretty much released from the intro mission, and given the ENTIRE game map to roam. You can follow the quests or wander off, and time isn't completely irrelevant either, but it doesn't punish you for exploring and side-questing.There is very little of either, exploring or side questing, in Wasteland, due to the constrained play areas at each step of the plot. The plot is fairly linear, and often the plot's goals and requirements are not only unintuitive, but completely nonsensical, and not even brought up or highlighted or alluded too in any dialogue with any characters. (One quest you have to stop a small war from breaking out, the only way to do it is to murder a drug dealer who I'm not sure how he's even related to the damn quest at all... But you HAVE to murder him. Only way to stop it. Both unintuitive and very narrow).In short. Buy the game on sale. 20 bucks or less.You'll get LONG play time out of the game, but its really up in the air whether that play time is quality enjoyment, or tedious simplistic combat with a constant feel of nostalgia reminding you... There's more to the Wasteland than what you're doing.Cheers and good gaming, peeps. "

												Let me preface this review with the following: Do not buy this game unless it is $15 dollars or less. In this game Armor actually kills you and you have to strip down to actually beat some encounters or you will die!Spoilers will be in here.So after 70+ Hours I think I have played enough of this and gotten the mechanics down to write a review. Now I get this is supposed to be a classic styled game. I loved Wasteland and the Fallout series which is why I had to play this. I went in expecting some pretty decent gameplay ala Fallout 1 & 2 style. While the base game has some decent overtones and it looks extremely polished. The feel and amibiance are fantastic game looks and feels great and just oozes style. However the mechanics are what destroys this title or should I say lack thereof. Unpopular Mechanics: How the Waste was made.So lets get this started you have Attributes which give you various bonuses to derived stats and a lot of skills. Every skill or stat goes from 1 to 10 including the  equipped armor stat, but more on that later. Now most of your stats are straight forward extra skill points on level up or higher crit chance on in particular is interesting ""Combat Intiative"". Seems pretty standard it makes you act sooner in combat right? Well partially right, it allows you to act faster in combat. Meaning you can go two or even three times more then a character with a low score. Making it a godly stat if you get enough of it. Also the average of 13-15 is considered low by the game. Enemies have average 17-19 meaning they go first and sometimes twice before you do. That leads us into the mess which is Wasteland 2's combat system. Lets start with weapons and see what does what.Assault rifles: High damage, wonky stats between rifles as some higher tier ones do horribly low damage and most have a solid three round burst mode. This is the go to weapon for most situations the only draw back is they have accuracy penalty at point blank range and if a enemy moves next to you a further aim on all shots is inccured. Also the enemies WILL do this every chance they get to cripple your snipers even if they don't attack them. Pistols: high crit low base damage. Early ones fire for a pittance of 3 action points a shot allowing you to do some damage. Later higher but not assault rifle damage ones are typically 4 AP a shot. A decent side arm for using 4 ap you can't shoot with a rifle as you switch between guns, not particularly effective though, As you can rarely get a third shot off late game.Heavy Weapons: These are joke level, they waste huge amounts of bullets to fire large bursts of VERY low damage shots that combine up to equal a couple good assault rifle shots. Bonus joke is you start with a broken M2 .50 caliber machingun rechambered in 5.56 if you select this skill at start. Even though you get .50 BMG ammo later on there is apprantly no real M2 that uses it. To put it in perspective a assault rifle using the same round does 44-70 damage for the 20-30 damage of a heavy weapon. Both of which will be reduced by enemy armor making even a minigun barrages damage miniscule. No mods can be used so they will jam or not have great chance to hit/Hit your own dudes.Submachine guns: These are to pistols what heavy weapons are to assault rifles. Low damage bullet wasters.Energy Weapons: Now we are talk here is the games central gimmick and one of things that breaks the game utterly. The more armor the target has the more damage it takes from energy weapons. Late game enemies use energy weapons and melee weapons that go right through your armor. There is a ambush later in the game where synthetics attack you from all directions, I died after 2-3 turns and retried this encounter many times and went back and leveled up and did stuff I might have missed. I was level 34 at my highest character and still died. Solution? I took off my armor before entering the location and the 120 damage hits I was taking turned into 15-20 damage hits. I completed the whole fight with no one under 80% health and having done NO healing during the fight.Totally disgusting as all my power armor and cool gear I worked for actually slowed me down and made me take MORE damage. Also Explosives do straight damage ignoring armor so a pipe bomb always does 50 damage and a frag grenade does 100. To reiterate I had to take off all my armor in order to progress through the game or I would die if they I wore armor. Shotguns: Laughable for a good eighty percent of the game. Enemies will often kill each other with the low damage cone effect. Later ones gain burst fire but insane accuracy penalties where they will either do maybe a shot of assault rifle damage or triple shot remove late game enemies.Sniper rifles: High damage and long range, Keep enemies back or lure them in for close combat. The best gun in the game is likely the .50 caliber sniper rifle you pull out of the dump as it can and will crit for 250+ oh and like pistols these have a high base crit and rarely miss when in range. Oh and uh melee weapons: they do more damage based on levels you put into them even though it apprantly doesn't say that. Anything with AP 2-3 is extremly viable especially against rifle using enemies who will run away from you. If you max these out early they are absurd like no other. Especially as later ones have very high armor pen and status effects. Do not trust the listed damage, once you are 6-8 skill points in they pulp whatever you hit, and you can swing multiple times.Skills or how I learned to extend play time through save scumming. Every skill besides first aid (unless surgery on npc's) has a critical failure. Even a easy 92% check has a chance of going HORRIBLY wrong and maiming your character or breaking whatever you were interacting with. This can straight up break entire quests as you break a lock and are unable to progress in that chain. Frequent saving and loading on critical areas is advised. The game loves to throw critical failures even when its only a 5% chance to hit them.Weaponsmithing is a mess as it provides a chance to get weapon mods by destroying guns. The random list has older mods which are no longer useful. Though breaking weapons can lead to weapon parts which can be sold at the ranger citadel in arizona for huge profit once you get the basic tier of mods done. Even maxxed out the chances of good mods is not that good unless you have stacks of high tier energy guns and assault rifles. which can instead be sold for bullets and health items better guns.Theres also a bunch of crazy trinkets that you can swap out for stat bonuses though you will have to save scum when you realize you didn't have your ranger badge on when you needed that extra point of hardass in a conversations as the conversation skill prompts are removed if you quit the conversation or talk about something else no backsies!Speaking of no backsies, if you pass up a safe or locked item only to come back when you have higher skill. Several times the safes are now ""looted by scavengers"". Tough break.The quests, dialog, writng, amibiance, voice acting, art style, animation, story and basically every thing else are top notch. However this game most reminds me of Arcanum with its horrible skill and combat system. So in summery: Armor kills you and also slows you down, Assault rifles blow basically everything out of the water, even more so when weaponsmithed (save scum those laser sights!), Combat intiative is the best stat next to action points, You can go two to three times for their one and get all your action points each time. Heavy weapons are a funny joke by the devs and are ineffectual unless enemies spam them and even then kinda meh. Finally, you can't polish a turd but you can sure ruin something trying to polish it with a turd.			"

												Wasteland 2 is a great take on post-apocalypse. It's very similar to Fallout 1 & 2 and should appeal to anyone who loved those.Game's a mix of RPG (both character development in terms of skills and attributes, and choices in story and consequences). The story is again similar to Fallout series, with a dose of humor and typical post-apocalypse madness. It was definetly entertaining and motivating to find out, but could have been slightly better written to enhance the immersion. The world in Wasteland 2 is huge and allows a lot of exploration, but is not entirely open: you have to progress the story to gain access to certain areas. The world itself is highly detailed in content, and is therefore fun to explore. My favorite part of exploration is that you can find interesting and weird stuff where you least expect it. Here I rather mean finding weird characters and in most cases items, and not unique new quests or adventures like you do in the newer Fallout games.I was somewhat disappointed by the graphics. The details of certain objects and buildings were non-existent. I wish the game simply was sharper and more detailed, which would farther help increase the atmosphere. The voice acting was in most cases pretty good, but not always convincing, and to compare to Fallout 1 & 2 lacked some of the uniqueness in the characters you meet (i.e. like Marcus), but only to a lesser extent: there are lots of weird people out there.In general the game is absolutely worth your time. Strongly suggested to Fallout fans (especially 1&2) and those who are into post-apocalypse in general, or just someone looking for a game that can draw you in for at least 50 hours. I spent 80 in the end, and still hadn't explored every corner in the wasteland and finished all side quests.			"

												EDIT: Thought I'd rewrite this now I've played it fully through. I still recommend it, but some earlier gripes have gone.The Good+ Great Ranger/Squad character creation+ Solid turn based combat, which rewards strategy+ Good roster of companions who have unique commentary on people and places+ More than one solution to each problem (if you can't pick a door, fire an RPG at it..)+ Some great locations and characters+ First half is excellent overall+ Morally gray writing; less ""goodies"" and ""baddies"" more ""devil you know""The Bad- More than a few locations feel unfinished, lack-lustre or just plain empty- The later acts feel a bit rushed and dry, with no real building up- Easy to miss entire sections of story if you miss an NPC or pick the wrong choice- None of your big choices have an impact on how the larger story plays out- Difficulty spikes, even with maxed out skills you'll face locks in the last half that you only have a 20% chance of passing.. - Too many obtuse solutions to quests; for example there's a hidden text option in one quest that is the only way to settle things peacefully. The game teaches you that typing anything other than the available options won't work, /but/ this one time it does but it doesn't tell you. That's not cool.Overally, I'd still recommend Wasteland 2. It's a great game, genuinely interesting and a lot of fun.			"

												Please stop comparing this game to Fallout 1 & 2.  Please stop saying things like it's ""the true Fallout 3.""It's not.  It's not even close.  It lacks any and all of Fallout's whimsical charm, it forces you to create a squad at the beginning instead of striking out on a lonely, eerie struggle.Moreover, the game feels like it's high on its own supply.  Overhyped, oversold, generally just not ideal for someone who wants an original Fallout experience.  There's a big difference between this super serious, staid setting and the wacky retro-future of Fallout.Honestly, this is like a better verison of Fallout: Tactics at the end of the day.  I'm not saying this is a bad game, it's just extremely misleading to compare it to the original Fallout titles.  It is NOT like them.  No traits, no perks, no color or humor.  Not enough attribute and skill points at the beginning for an individual character, since you're supposed to make four.  There's no room for character development or finding your own identity.  The very first conversation, I'm pushed into saying ""sir"" constantly and being a military recruit.  Maybe I don't WANT to join the rangers.  Maybe I want to just run out into the wilderness or find a city hub and just make my own path - like I did in Fallout.I realize everyone is different.  But part of the reason I loved Fallout was that my companions had their own minds and I didn't have to micromanage them constantly.  It ended up creating hilarious (and sometimes awful) situations in which my companions surprised me in combat.  Overall, it was more immersive (to me) because I was focused entirely on my own character, instead of mysteriously mind-controlling a group.Overall, it's hard to say whether or not I recommend the game.  I know some people will love it.  But I can't get over the vast disappointment after I was lead to believe, from literally everyone, that this is like Fallout.  It's not.  Fallout, in my opinion, is way more fun.  Mechanically, aesthetically, and otherwise.Just one woman's point of view.  Take it or leave it.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. But i can't. I love isometric RPGs and i played them all. I even replay both the original Fallouts once every three years or so. Sadly, the Wasteland 2 fails on so many levels that the few that are actually good won't save it. And the fact that Divinity: Original Sin and Shadowrun: Dragonfall came out recently and are superior on almost every level makes this game look even worse.Combat:Total letdown. Almost no tactial options. While in Divinity i would use my rogue to sneak behind enemy lines and start with an ability that costs a lot of AP and is therefore only useful as an opening getting bonuses from backstab as well as from attack from stealth. After that i will use the artifact and teleport my tank to the rogue and make him knock down the most dangerous foe while my mage will teleport oil barrel near the enemies and ignite it. While my tank has fire resist over 100% so the flames actually heal him.And in Wasteland? I open with a shot. After that all my other characters shoot. Some use the weapon ability to shoot multiple rounds as it has the best dmg/Ap. Then all the enemies shoot, now all my characters shoot. When you are skilled you can try for a headshots (And that just causes more dmg, no penalties to the enemy or anything and you can't aim for any other bodypart) Sometimes you can use verticality or cover (that has been clearly added to the game as an afterthought as it is not possible in most of the fighths) And THAT IS ALL! No abilities, no gadgets, no skills, no perks. NOTHING!!!Character progression:There is none! You have attributes and skills. Attributes can be minmaxed as some are clearly better than the others. Skills are just your percentual chance to do stuff. You will NEVER gain new ability or perk or anything. Nothing that will change the gameplay. You will just know how to open a box better. Mainly because boxes near the end of the game are harder to open than the boxes at the beginning of the game. Yes, the same boxes...Quickloading:As the game desing is bad you will load very often. In fact you will memorize the loading screen very well. You see, everything is percentual and dependant on your skill. Luck based. You see a locked box with a trap and an alarm. You have 50% to disarm the alarm, 40% to disarm the bomb and 70% to pick the lock. So disarm - fail - disarm - fail - disarm success - alarm - fail - alarm - fail - alarm - success - pick - fail - pick - critical fail - LOAD and repeat.Graphics:Amazingly bad. I mean really bad. Much worse than Fallout 1 or 2. It is technically bad (low res textures, low poly models) and aesthetically bad (repeating of assets, assests with different textures next to each other, the same mood everywhere, the same models everywhere). You don't even have much of an avatar picture choice when creating your characters. And some of that pictures are later used in the game on other characters! The graphics are much worse than in The Fall: Last days of Gaia which is old, low budget german post-apo game from noname developer.StoryHere it isn't bad. The story is quite good. Sadly it is told via big chunks of texts. I like to read in games. Planescape Torment is one of my most beloved games and it has much more text. But the text in that game is exciting and relevant. Here most of the things that people will tell you are things that you have already heard milion times from others. But you have to read it all because sometimes in this ocean of text there is useful information.ChoicesThe choices are a mixed bag. You are often presented with multiple choices and you actually feel the consequences. That is very good. But sometimes the choices themselves seem illogical. At the beginning of the game you have to choose to save one of two settlements. Either the superimportant one that feeds all the surrounding settlements (including your ranger base), or the other superimportant one that provides water to everyone. You as a new recruit. One ranger of many. And after you do that you suddenly hear the other rangers chat on radio. How they helped to save some merchants or how they saved some cows. Yea, but they couldn't save the superimportant settlement...Conclusion:This review might seem too harsh but if someone asked me what game to play - Wasteland 2 or Fallout 1, the game that came out 17 years ago, i would recomment F1 without hesitation. And that tells you something about this game...If you want to play good modern isometric RPG, play Shadowrun: Dragonfall or Divinity: Original Sin.			"

												I've never played the original Wasteland so I had no particular expectations about this game.I hold Fallout 1 and 2 in high regard and I can say that Wasteland 2 is what I would have wanted a different Fallout 3 to have been. A PC-centric isometric turn-based cRPG through and through; detailed stat sheets, lots of options, lots of skill and much room for exploration. This game has a learning curve, it doesn't hold your hand in the way many modern AAA RPGs do. It's also long. Very long. Depending on how thoughrough you are with side quests and exploration it may take between 40-60 hours to complete. The many choices you have in the game does offer replayability, but the gameplay is quite combat-oriented.But it also has some problems though:1) Pacing. This game requires a lot of patience. It takes a while before the story gets off the ground. The skill checks eat up time as well. I needed to take a break from the game about half-way through (I found some of the areas midways somewhat uinteresting and the combat was becoming repetitive) and then come back to it again after a couple of months. However the second half of the game feels better. I almost think it would have been better if the developers had cut some of the content to make the game more focused. 2) Armor system. This is just badly designed. Armor comes with a armor threshold. Weapons come with armor penetration. If weapon penetration exceeds armor threshold then armor does nothing. And it so happens that most enemies you encounter use weapons with armor penetration that just about match the best armor you can get in that part of the game. And later in the game more enemies use energy weapons which deal increased damage to high armor ratings. Thus you find yourself in situations late game were your armor is either detrimental or useless. This really calls for a major balance rehaul patch.3) Graphics and animation. This game would have looked good ten years ago. The animations are fairly rough and stiff at times. Many backgrounds are nice, but the overall impression is very mediocre. But these issues should not deter you if you're into long and involved turn-based cRPGs.			"

												Absolutely great!  As someone who recently went back and picked up Fallout 2 only to realise it was a LOT better in my memory, than in my 2014 spec PC reality - Wasteland 2 is exactly what I needed. OK so sure, I hear what some reviewers are saying - as far as tactical combat goes, this is not XCOM. Nothing is. But the game has all the elements I used to love in the original Fallout series; gritty humour, no imposed moral code, diverse skill system, crafting and more. Definitely gets my crystal clear recommendation to anyone who loved the Fallout originals. If you've only ever played modern RPGs (and therefore is not struck by nostalgia like myself), try it anyway - and maybe catch a glimpse of what all the rave was about.			"

												Wasteland 2 is a good game. If you want an old school RPG, you will probably enjoy this. Unfortunately it has some flaws. The graphics aren't pretty (I think it's getting an overhaul though), the combat could be more polished, the AI was frustrating at some points regarding followers you can't control, and I didn't like the way certain skills worked, for example you could have a lot of points invested in lockpicking and still have a high chance to fail at it, encouraging you to save and reload.Despite all this, the reason why I recommend this game is because it's a true RPG. Choices matter, many things change depending on how you act, I found many quests and places in the world to be interesting and made me think if what I was doing was the right thing to do, and what consecuences those actions would bring. The story is decent for a video game, the writing is good and many NPC's were very unique. Now that it's been some time since I've finished it, I can say that it was a very memorable experience.

												I was looking forward to this game since its announcement. Sadly, Wasteland 2 dissapointed me a lot. There is no strategy, challenge nor variety involved in the combat, which wouldn't kill the game so much if the role-playing elements were superb (Mass Effect 1 for example). They aren't however. Quests are filled with numerous bugs (especially in LA) that make them uncompletable. Almost none of the loot matters. The choices you'll make throughout the game are mostly black and white. Characters feel like clichés instead of actual people. You don't build any loyalty towards the game's protagonists Desert Rangers because your communication with them basically amounts to them levelling you up. And so on...But! For some reason it did still compel me to complete the game. So it's definetely not as bad as I'm making it out to be. However, I'd still like to warn those interested in this game to look deeper into it, buy it on sale, or when an even more definitive ""Director's Cut 2"" is out. That or play Fallout 2 for the billionth time.			"

The fact you move your characters around in real time before a combat start oftens leaves you're characters all huddled together before you can start the combat, as at least 2 or 3 members of your party are out of cover. The combat soon turns into a waiting to see if you're lucky enough to hit as the AI just charges forward or stays still shooting at you. The options in combat for crouching, headshots and ambushing just aren't enough or actually useful, the combat is really stale it really could have done with copying xcom wholesale.The game hides the fact of which skill to use on particular objects, which left me to go to the internet to figure out that the demolitions skill allowed you to disable traps. The uses for the various skills are fairly pointless, you need perception, demolition, lockpicking, first aid, surgeon and safecracking, then you need to invest heavily in combat skills to stand a chance of hitting anything.The conversation system could have been wonderful and added much needed depth to the game, it is generally well written, but it turns into a case of just clicking every single option to find out all of the information the uses for social skills tend to be few and far between. There are apparently hidden key words in the conversations, I tried asking about lots of different options and none of them came up.The camera also is pretty limited and hides things, you'll end up pressing z almost constantly whilst exploring to see stuff to interact with.

												You can't actually write a review for the Directors Cut because... Steam. I have 94 hours logged on that game and finished it so, here's my review then!In many ways a throwback to classic isometric PC RPGs. Can be brutally difficult at times but I enjoyed the challenge. There is some degree of learning curve to deal with as well. Basically if there is a stat you can level up, it's probably useful. Do not sleep on Kiss ♥♥♥, Smart ♥♥♥, Hard ♥♥♥, and Perception. Even Toaster repair is pretty useful. Other than that, explosives are your best friend. Unless the explosive in question is one of the many land mines you will step on... hence why perception is important.I wouldn't say it's an incredibly ambitious game but it gets the job done. The game seems to run fast and largely bug free. The graphics get reused a lot and really aren't anything amazing. You'll see the same character portrait several dozen times. They actually seemed to have crowdsourced a lot of the assets. So you funded the game... and you kind of made it too... It may be spartan, but it may finally push you to get off your ♥♥♥ and make your own game in Unity.When it comes to cons, the worst part of the game would have to be the VO. I played the majority of the game without headphones on. Some of the voice actors sound very amateurish and seem to want to drag out their lines for an eternity. I can only guess this was a backer reward or maybe one of the developers owed someone a favor. Other than that, the music is decent enough. In some ways Wasteland 2 was more enjoyable than Fallout 4. There are many times your decisions actually have impact on the outcome of the story (F you Preston Garvey!). The sense of humor, while juvenile, gives the game a nice vibe that contrasts with the dark subject matter. It has much more personality and challenge than Fallout 4 but it is also more ballsy and ""adult"" in subject matter.If you love classic isometric RPGs then give Wasteland 2 a shot.			"

												I really wanted to like Wasteland 2, but in the end I feel it failed me on most counts, the first and foremost being the writing, to the point where I couldn't muster the will to finish the last mission after 81 hours in (Director's Cut).The good?* Squad management with all the skills and weapon types is actually fun.* Combat is enjoyable enough.* The setting has some gloriously bizarre moments and characters.But all of it is undermined by shoddy execution, overall simplistic writing, lazy and uninspired artwork (honestly, Fallout Tactics looks better and put more effort into customizing character portraits) - all the things that kill immersion and suck the fun out of the game.As far as execution goes, there're plenty things in the game that feel unfinished or unpolished. Pieces of dangling quests here and there or failure to react to you doing things in wrong order, small things like rearranging squad formation or viewing completed quests sorted in order, reused locations - all contribute to the death of a thousand cuts. Squad management fun is obliterated by the fact that your companions don't level if you leave them at the base, which effectively means that you'll be stuck with almost the same party throughout the game. So much for recruit diversity.But what really killed the game for me was the writing. I'm honestly struggling to see the lauded brilliance here. It's a pulpy shlock, by design, sometimes funny and eccentric, but so over the top that it kills all tension and willingness to care. It doesn't know what tone it wants to set. On one hand it attempts to be grim and portray a ruthless wasteland, but most such moments go hand in hand with cartoonish grotesque hilarity. First third-to-a-half of the game is a tedious linear slog. The Prison -> Canyon -> Damonta stretch is a dreary and dull timesink with no redeeming qualities or payoff. But when it suddenly becomes somewhat more open, you are still offered only cartoon characters, clear cut black and white choices and moustache twirling villains. The choices are obvious, the outcomes are formulaic, quest chains predictable, no subtlety, no suspense, no stakes. The one moment of doing something different literally happens during the 2nd assignment, and that's that, the only trick up Wasteland's sleeve.It probably sounds a bit too harsh and bitter. If I had an option, I would've given WL2 a mixed review. Ultimately it's a game that can be fun but is undone by its flaws, and in the end looking back all I feel is frustration and disappointment, so I can't honestly recommend it. ...The first Shadowrun Returns also left a sour taste of disappointment in my mouth. But it was followed by Dragonfall and Hong Kong - two games I love to death. Here's hoping that inXile could only go up from WL2.			"

												8.5/10 (-1.5 mostly mechanical reasons, bugs, cannot edit the appearence of non-ranger allies and the CAMERA Control is annoying in some areas. I have 2 native american people who look 'out of place' with what they're wearing. Who wants some twigs held together by threads protecting you in a gun-fight?)This is one of those games where you're playing it for the 1st time, you're about 30+ hours into the game and you cannot wait until you complete it, simply so you can start a whole new game. A lot of games these days boast about how your decisions effect the story and the path you'll take but in reality they're usually weak and have very little consequences to your actions but here, you'll be enqountering many branches, each as strong as the last in terms of how your team will grow and what plots you'll follow. A shout out to people who start bad reviews with ""I'm a fan of the old fallout games"" - If you played the old fallout games and don't like this game.... you must not be a big fan of them OR you don't realise you've become a fan boy.+ The characters are great, imaginative enough to make you want to learn more them, instead of doing it not to miss valuable info. I've also become very attached to my own custom characters who have intertwine backstories.+ Weapons etc keep you interested in, what's in the next box? If you play right you can have some explosive firefights. I once had 2 rangers use burst fire, 1 ranger use his SMG, one use his pistol, 1 use her sniper rigle all in the space of a second in an ambush attack. + It is TACTICAL. I have about 400+ hours on Arma3 and what you learn from that can be applied to this game.+ The mechanics in place like, weapon variety, abilties, perks etc have been crafted very well and the feel' of being a TEAM is strong. If I lost a member, I'd be lost for some time, morally and strategically.  + EPIC replayabilty... I really mean it.   TLDR : If you cannot enjoy this game, You must be out of touch with your inner geeky gamer or bought the game out of hype. "

Wasteland 2 is a post-apocalyptic CRPG created by InXile Entertainment. The long overdue sequel to the 1988 game Wasteland, it takes place in the western United States, in Arizona and later California, after that brutal 1998 nuclear war that totally happened. You create a squad of characters, all new recruits to the ""Desert Rangers,"" a group trying to bring a semblance of lawfulness back into a desolate wasteland. Wasteland 2 can be seen as the spiritual successor to Fallout, as it's viewpoint, combat, and general feel is much closer to that than the original Wasteland. The combat is somewhat similar to the original Fallouts, although much more focused on in this game. Instead of controlling a single character with companions being completely AI, the game allows you to control each character on their turn. This adds more of a turn-based strategy feel in the combat; it's more about positioning and tactics than straight up firepower and ability to withstand said firepower. Fallout Tactics holds a similar, albeit clunkier, playstyle. The different skills are pretty good for the most part, although some weapon types do stand out as more useful.The freedom in this game seems scant at first, as you are immediately forced into the Desert Rangers and sent off on a mission, but diverges almost right away with multiple choices as to where to go first, who to help, etc. Only one time limit is imposed, and this time limit simply alters the game rather than ending it outright like in the first Fallout. Folks who prefer the darker side of life also have the option to go rogue in one of two ways, but I'll leave those up for you to discover. It's not completely open world, but more a sequence of maps linked by an overworld map.The graphics get the job done, but they're by no means stunning. Running in the Unity engine, the optimization is okay. The general aesthetic is certainly good, but it doesn't quite jump out at me like Fallout 1 and 2, or even Wasteland 1. The primary complaint would be the character models, they're not too distracting, but they aren't exactly the fluffiest sheep in the barn. To say it bluntly, the character models are bad, and at times don't even match the portrait of the character in question.ProsCombat system is complex and strategic, especially compared to it's predecessors.Freedom to approach situations, although combat is less avoidable.The world itself is goodVarietyConsCharacter models aren't very good.Some skills aren't as useful as others, although most are fun to use.Can be difficult for a first-time player.Final Thoughts:Fans of its forebears will find it pretty enjoyable, and certainly a worthy successor, and anyone who needs that CRPG itch scratched will be plenty happy with it. Those who like fast, action-packed games will have to look elsewhere. Rating: 9/10This review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.   "

												Ultimately, Wasteland 2 is an average game that scratches a particular nostalgia itch for many gamers and is receiving praise beyond its merits.  Quite frankly, the Turn-based strategy genre has been in a drought for nearly a decade and fans are dying of thirst to the extent they'll lap up contaminated water riddled with disease and ask for seconds.  They're so enamored with a sub-standard product they don't recognize they're dying a most dishonorable death from dysentery.Combat - The combat is lackluster and is not tactical nor strategic in any sense of the fashion.  OK Corral gun duels might be more appropriate, except slow and with none of the skill involved.  If you want a game with good combat, just replay XCOM2012 or Xenonauts.Character building - No skill tree, no perks, nothing to be found except redundant skills to simply dump your stat points into every time you level up.  If you're looking for the complexity and fun of a D&D style character sheet, keep looking.  If you're looking for a Fallout perk system... keep looking.  Even Diablo 3, which the avid fans of W2 seem keen to mock, has a far more indepth character building system.Story -  Glaring plot hole at the beginning of the game that most people seem to overlook or simply not notice.  Even if you look past that, the only clever aspect of the entire game is the little Easter Eggs you'll occasionally find.  However, finding kitty litter, a condom, or big black didlo for the 15th time is just sad.  It's funny the first time, but like any good joke, you have to know when to quit effing telling it.  If you want a game with a good story, reboot Mass Effect, BG, Fallout... pretty much any other CRPG.Characters - Easily forgettable and none that will be remembered.  No Minsc & Boo, HK-47, Commander Shepards, Irenicus (best villain ever), Tomi Grin Undergallows etc.  No Delita or Ramza to be found here.  For the most part, they're as bland and lifeless as the Arizona wastes you'll wander around for the first half of the game.  Exploration - Some of the environments are interesting, but with the terrible combat and random loot, much of the fun is taken out of it.Graphics - The game wasn't trying to inspire us with graphical prowess or eye porn, but what it delivered is unpolished and ugly.  Some will argue it's stylistic or gritty, but to each their own.Sound - Ok, but no gripping musical scores to be found here.At the end of the day, everything W2 set out to do has been done before (obviously), but done far better.

Wasteland 2 Director's Cut PC Review{shortened}  Prelude Wasteland 2 is a unique and incomparable game series that stands out from the competition being Fallout and XCOM. In Wasteland 2 you play as a squad of members, desert rangers to be more exact who are required to fulfill certain roles defined particularly through the attributes, skills, character and personality you choose in character creation. You can either hop right in by choosing the default squad option that creates the default characters that the developer has included in this game with specific attributes, personality traits and other characteristics in which they have selected or create your own. Wasteland 2's genre is not defined but rather it is a blend of many genres including turn-based strategy, open-word role-playing, action role-playing within its armor selection, equipping items found in the wasteland and finally the camera rotation and movement parallels the computer role-playing genre, which in recent years has disappeared but was re-imagined mainly in 2015 by Pillars of Eternity through Obsidian Entertainment and published by Paradox Interactive that redefined the whole computer role-playing ( CRPG) genre and it has done really well in its revival.  Wasteland 2 released on September 19th, 2014, published and developed by inXile Entertainment. Some of their other well known games are  Hunted: The Demon's Forge and The Bard's Tale. Genre: Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy.   Others say that Wasteland 2 is just another Fallout, but a more stripped down version that is full of poor combat mechanics, bugs and some other areas of concerns that don't seem to overshadow this game's success.  Let us take a look now and see how all of the elements fit in as well as any concerns I may have with this newer addition in the Wasteland series. Story     The story is incredible. You can tell that the publisher took their time with finding actually good voice actors that have personality, character and specific dialects that complement their attitude, behaviors, character, personality traits, skill attributes and action points that are assigned to strengthen specific skills that they have. The actual characters you play have no voice dialogue as far as I am aware of which would have been cool to see. We don't have the option to choose between different male and female voices in character customization which is a large disappointment I wish would have been included to make the story more immersive. It is ok though because Wasteland 2 makes it up through proper grammar that adapts to the dialogue of each separate non-playable character (NPC). Story Overall Score: 9/10 Character Customization, My Specific Squad, and Crew UsedMy Squad     My squad consist of four unique characters in which I incorporated two of those, being actual friends of mine with their respective alter egos. I will only briefly describe the biography of my characters and post them here as such.Friends Kai & Morgan, Alter Ego's1. Morgan-  Morgan is my right-handed girl. Her role is to keep Nathan and even Kai confident and upright when we lose sight of larger situations that may get out of hand. She is my right-winged woman that I go to when I need reassurance that what I am doing, is what needs to be done. She is calm, persistent, loving, caring, trustworthy, always in prayer and loves you for who you are. She has known Nathan, a team member since he was very young at the age of fifteen years old. She has grown him up into being who he is now. She is a bestie of Nathan's and necessary towards his survival because of his polarization. She is modest, cool and beautiful in her own right and unlike the others, she has no identifiable quirks.2. Kai - Kai, on the other hand, may be young at sixteen years of age within her adolescence as a ranger, but she has confidence, heart and is easy to earn your loyalty and trust. She connects through talking to others, although her quirk is ' delayed gratification'   She is confident, loving, mature, responsible, forgiving, honest and just wants to be understood all the time. We love you Kai and welcome to the team. I gave her the attributes of intelligence and charisma, her personality and desirability and she uses sniper rifles and sub machine guns because those are her favorites.3. Nathan- Nathan is a remarkable young man that is the leader and intelligent powerhouse for the whole group. He is the strongest physically and mentally being able to withstand much damage per second. He was raised in the most stable environment, a Christian household that was of middle-class socioeconomic status. Now, he holds skills in writing, understanding others and in showing the unseen, imperceptible within certain defined environments including those in which are more secluded.4. Lastly, we have Ashley. I will not talk to much about her since she is not modeled after some real-life encounters I have had in my life. She is fictional and is characterized by the quirk of manic depression in which her skills and attribute traits in the game, constantly change due to mood swings and alterations in her personality.Options     Now, we get to my first main disappointment with Wasteland 2. We have very little customization options when it comes to the way in which our characters look. Males have more facial traits that can be selected rather than females. All physical traits and even outfits are pre-made and cannot be edited or changed which allows very little room for personalization. Despite these nuances, I was still able to sacrifice some parts it lacked to make beautiful female characters in which I imported a couple of my friends into it, virtually with me which makes it more unique and interesting. I gave them real-life attributes through this first partial playthrough of Wasteland 2. Customization, Writing, Graphics, Presentation, Sound & Control Overall ScoresCustomization 5/10Writing 10/10 - Proper grammar, dialect, punctuation and supporting details with very elaborate points.Graphics 8/10 - Incredibly well done within the setting of Arizona.Difficulty 8/10 - Difficult compared to modern games.Sound 9/10 - Excellent intricacies.Controls 7/10 - Nice camera controls, takes time getting used to. The mouse is preferred for the most authentic and realistic experience.Presentation 10/10 - Presentation is far more appealing than the wasteland included in Mad Max & the Fallout series.Elements - 7/10 - I can't give it an 8/10 because the combat is very challenging as far as positioning right, not being able to dodge attacks too often and some flaws that can sometimes be seen in the cover system.Overall/ Verdict (combined average) 8/10 -  Astounding, the perfect alternative to Pillars of Eternity and the Fallout series Age/Content Rating     According to Common Sense Media, Wasteland 2 is recommended at the age of eighteen years and above because of sexual themes, violence, and very strong language. Similar to Fallout, there is a brothel you can visit, and you can actually catch sexually transmitted diseases (STD’s) if you choose to engage with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Also, some audio clues and in-game sequences are set in brothels. However, no actual sexual scenes are depicted. This is dialect and strong language you would normally find in western based movies of the past and in present times. Lastly, there is some sexual moaning at the brothel and also some parts of a mission where drugs are involved.

												I remember playing the original Wasteland on my dads computer 13 years ago and I was clueless as to how the game operated and I spent no more than 2 minutes with it and never went back to it until last year.I played through Wasteland and found myself pleasantly suprised by the depth the game had and how enjoyable and how much I got attached to my custom made rangers.So now we have finally come to Wasteland 2 a game which has been patiently waited for by fans of the series for over 25 years (You give Half Life fans a run for their money) and it's return is glorious.The story of Wasteland 2 is as follows, You and your group of rangers(All of which you can personally customize) are tasked with regulating the hostile wastes of Arizona and later Los Angeles from raiders, mutants, robots, cyborgs and more.One aspect of Wasteland 2 is choice, like most games that have cropped up recently Wasteland 2 is no acception to choice based gameplay.One of the first choices you make is decieding whether to save the town of highpool from raiders or saving an agricultural facility from mutants.It was great to see that this choice had a lasting effect, as I choose the AG Center first, Highpool was destroyed and taken over by raiders as a result.The gameplay is similar to the original Wasteland but thanks to the advancement of technology we now have gameplay which will be more remeniscent of the games which Wasteland inspired allah Fallout with it's turn based gameplay and chance based combat, this means you have action points which are used in combat and anything from movement, attacking, healing and reviving all take up points.This means you have to be strategic and choose your actions carefully so 2AP for crouching, 3 for moving into position and 3 to take a shot.Weapons all have different AP usage rifles typically use 7AP and using pistols and fists takes up 3AP.Now onto the graphics.Wasteland 2 uses the unity engine and it does a pretty good job of capturing the look and feel of the post apocolaypse with run down buildings, sandy plains and nature taking back the enviroment with green plantlife and vine covered roads and buildings.It's been a long time coming and it does not disappoint in the slightest.If you are a fan of the original Wasteland, Fallout or stories set in the post apocolaypse Wasteland 2 is one that will kick you to the ground, stick your head into an irradiated toilet and keep you invested until the bitter end.

Remember Wasteland? 1988, a pivotal year towards the close of the last century. Arnold Schwarzenegger discovered that Danny Devito was his long lost twin.Tom Cruise encouraged Dustin Hoffman to play a little blackjack and George Bush senior had just been voted into office.A fact which I'm sure had no bearing on the emergence of a brand new gaming genre, the post apocalyptic RPG. Let's not Fall Out over it! The original Wasteland was a ground-breaking title back in the day with recruitable NPC's populating a persistent world. This is something we take for granted in RPG's today, but back in the pink and blue neon haze of the 80's this was unheard-of. Even if you haven't heard of the original Wasteland, I'm certain you'll be familiar with the Fall Out franchise. A franchise which would probably not exist had wasteland not come before. In the ""meantime""It was nearly 10 years after Wastelands release before we got our hands on its spiritual successor Fallout. Sequels were planned for Wasteland but they never quite came to fruition, but now thanks to a little thing called kick starter and loyal fans with long memories ... Apocalypse Now ... We have the imminent and long overdue release of Wasteland 2. After 26 years lost in the wilderness, expectations are high, but are we in danger of placing Wasteland 2 on a pedestal, expecting too much and inevitably about to face disappointment when September 19th rolls around? Four Rangers and a FuneralAfter hitting the play button for the first time you'll find yourself at the character creation screen. Here you'll find more stats and options than you could shake an iguana on a stick at, with skills ranging from animal whisperer to toaster repair.Prepare to spend an unhealthy amount of time agonising over the attributes and skills sets for your posse of wannabe rangers. Not that this isn't fun, It's a good kind of agony trying to build your perfect team but if this kind of stat tweaking isn't for you, there is a roster of pre-built characters all lined up like puppies in a pound waiting for you to give them a new home in your squad. Once you've settled on what you hope is a complimentary skill set for your four rangers you'll be treated to a highly atmospheric cinematic which cleverly fills in a little of the back story for the desert rangers and leaves your group standing around the fresh grave of a fallen comrade. Ace in the Hole The writing on the makeshift coffin reads ""Born a man, died a desert ranger"" It's here that the game starts as ""Ace"" is laid to rest and you're team picks up his failed assignment. It's this assignment that will be your first thread of the main quest that you will follow through Wasteland 2. Triffid or not Triffid, That is the QuestionAfter some interesting conversations with the NPCS at the graveside you'll head off on your first mission and it's here that the first moral choice hits hard and fast. There's a distress signal from Highpool, a community under attack, they need your help, then almost immediately another from the nearby agricultural centre that's having some ""plant problems"", you'll only have time to try to save one, but which.... It's decisions like this which really make Wasteland 2 come alive, whatever you choose will have repercussions, you're a part of this dying world and your choices matter. We come in peace, Shoot to KillThe tough decisions don't all come in the form of moral choices either. The turn based combat present here will test your tactical decision making too. You'll be glad you spent all that time tweaking your stats and skills and matching your weapon load outs to your strengths when bad guys, gals, animals and plants come for you.When they do come, they'll look great. you'll find crisp detailed graphics and atmospheric audio in Wasteland 2 which makes every encounter a vivid experience. The end of the world never looked so good. It's The End of the World as we know it The experience InXile are creating here is shaping up to be one of the most interesting RPG's in a very, very long time.At the time of writing the game is still in Beta, although you wouldn't know it, the experience to be had in the first few hours of play is already highly entertaining and very polished.If you remember, earlier in this preview I expressed my concern that anticipation for this release is too high and that it can only lead to disappointment. So how do I feel about this now, after I've actually played the game? I Feel FineFrom my experience with the beta, the answer to this question is a resounding No. Wasteland 2 is everything I'm looking for in a crunchy RPG and I love it. This is going to be something special. I'm genuinely excited for the release of this title and I'm certain I'll be sinking an ungodly amount of time into the wastes over the coming weeks.

												Edit: they've patched the game a lot since I wrote this and I don't know if its more fun now than it was on launchAs a Kickstarter backer I got this game for $15, but if I had paid $40 for it I probably wouldn't be happy at all.The whole way the game interacts with you is ripped out of 1987 in the worst ways. There's no fast travel, you watch your party walk for ages, because that's the only way out of the labaryth maps, walking back to the entrance, slowly. And there is plenty of mandatory back tracking. The combat is boring, and the RNG makes it an annoying chore, but most of the time you can't avoid it. Put points into outdoorsman and flee every random encounter.There's no cool stuff like reverse pick pocketing a land mine into someone's back pocket, or shooting their legs off so they can't flee. Just aim, and miss or get jam or whatever.The character creator is super unintuitive and weird and kind of horrible. INT doesn't help with ""wisdom skills,"" charisma has nothing to do with your ability to influence people in dialog, and strength has no bearing on your ability to break down a chain link gate. Why not? Because!There is an over-world, but don't think that it's open, you need to follow the linear plot.There is lots to see, but the game moves ridiculously slowly, ie level 5 and done with the first dungeon in ~12 hours.The story is really decent and the game delivers a lot of it's ""old school"" promise, but honestly most of that is the bad things from the old days that should have been forgotten. For $40 I wouldn't buy it, and after my $15 I'm not sure if I will have the patience to finish it, even though I like the story.			"

												Wasteland 2 is CRPG set in a post-apocalyptic world. Coming from the mastermind behind Wasteland and Fallout, Wasteland 2 closely follows the traditional Fallout approach to the gameplay.Incredibly detailed world gives hours worth of exploration, that you'll spend chasing all the tiny secrets available.Turn-based combat is mechanically simpler than it was in Fallout, but that is covered by a fact that you have to manage a team of rangers, not just your character. And as well by a very nice level design that almost always gives you a set of opportunities you can use to engage with enemies.Add an intriguing storyline, some nice voice acting, years of waiting for a good fallout-like game - and you'll get Wasteland 2. Totally worth it!You can have a look at some gameplay with commentary in the video:

												Wasteland 2 is an amazing game and instant classic. It's very much like Fallout 1 and 2 (which were based off the first wasteland game), with lots of differences. First of all, you start by creating a party of up to 4 people (and can have a party up to 7 from npcs recruited in game), there a tons of different skill to choose from for each character, ranging from mechanical repair, to computer science to assault rifles, pistols, shotguns, outdoorsman, smart ♥♥♥/hard ♥♥♥/kiss ♥♥♥ (3 dialogue skills that vary on attitude), etc. There is also a decent attribute system, much like the SPECIAL from fallout, except this one is called CLASSIC (coordination, luck, Awareness, Strength, Speed, Intelligence and Charisma), and the attributes have a huge impact on characters and what they can do.The battle system is much like DnD or any D20 system, grid turn based combat, using initiative to choose when people act. If you've played X Com then it's much like that, except more in depth (then the newest x com) in terms of mechanics and what you can do. As opposed to the two move system from x com or D20, this one is based off action points (like the original fallout games), you have so many action points (depending on your speed, strength, awareness and many more) that you can do in a turn. Walking 1 square requires 1 action point, shooting different weapons require more as well as other various actions.Travelling the world map, again is very much like the original fallout games. You have the map, and your icon traverses across it as you may run into random encounters, there are oasises everywhere that give you water (as you gotta refill water to keep traversing the map), and you can run across various settlements this way. There are also radiation clouds that you must watch out for, you can go through them but you need radiation gear otherwise your party will get killed while walking through  it.On top of the game mechanics and battle systems, the quests themselves are very intriguing, lots of side content and missions to do, and A LOT of choices to do in those missions. You can do missions so many different ways, from sneaking into a fort and killing some dudes to negotiating with them and allying them with you, to poisoning their food and killing them off. The main big missions usually have various different outcomes in the missions, each giving you a drastically different faction running an area, or having you liked or hated by another faction, and even unlocking different potential companions depending on how you finished the mission.The game itself sort of gears you to be a ""good guy"", in that you are a team of rangers that are supposed to be a police force in a post apocalyptic wasteland - but you don't have to be. Though the game would be MUCH harder being a bad guy, there's nothing stopping you and you can kill anyone you feel like for any reason. Though your NPC characters (that arent created by the PC) usually dont like when you go around double dealing guys, killing innocents and just failing to protect people (though there are other NPCs that don't mind you doing so, just dont expect the philantropist doctor girl to stay with your team when you betray a settlement or start murdering people indiscriminately).Hell, you can even roleplay the morally gray ranger that is willing to sacrifice people and lives for the greater good if you so desired.So far, i'm about over 100 hours in game (right now steam says im at 88, but after an update when i was about 20 some hours in, it reset my hours played for some reason), and I'm only about half way done the main game (though ive been doing any side stuff that i come across). So far the game is amazing to me and im having a blast with it. Been waiting for a game like this for a long time, and definitely having a lot of fun with it and to me, this game will be a classic that i go back and play multiple times over the years, much like other classic RPGS such as Fallout 1 and 2, Knights of the old republic, Bauldur's gate, Neverwinter nights and Morrowind and so on.I would recommend this game to any RPG fan, specifically hard core RPG fans, and this game is definitely worth the 40 dollars for the base game. Such an awesome game!			"

												While this game is normally quite expensive, I really enjoyed the free weekend. It reminds me of Spiderweb Software's titles and of course Fallout. Everything runs smoothly here. Nice character creation engine, stats that matter, good combat. I'll definitely be picking up the digital deluxe version if it's on super sale come sale season.			"

												It's challening, it's well written with interesting characters and although it doesn't feature quite the same level fo Agency of the original fallouts, it's likely to remind you why those games were so good, specially compared to what's come out since.Definitely give it a shot if you like cRPG's.

												Really nice game, you can do a lot of things.It's a mix of Fallout 2, baldur's gate and Jagged alliance 2.-Post apocalyptic style from Fallout.-Not that much from baldur's gate except the talking interface. -Baldur's gate was tactic with a  button for freeze the whole game, where you made your decision if the battles goes to quick.-The battle system is something similiar to jagged alliance 2. *That's just my opinion.*You are a desert ranger, to bring justice to the wasteland. :)Many weapons, blunt, bladed and brawling weapons.Pistols, shotgun ,smg , assault rifles, sniper rifles, heavy weapons,grandes , rocket launcher etc. ^^On thing is just you need to level up for skillpoints, but you can also get skillbooks.They aren't so many skillbooks. Talking skills are useful in some matters... side quest... items... also resolve some differnces,but up to you. Of course you can shoot your way through. ^^If you like turn-based post apocalyptic style game with splatter effects. :DThen go for it, but is not my decisions. ^^PS: It's not fallout 2! ^^			"

												Are you an intelligent gamer interested in actually reading the colour text and searching between the lines in conversations for clues, looking for a deep, superbly-written role playing experience with a dash of turn-based tactical interest thrown in?  Yes? Then you absolutely MUST get Wasteland 2.I could rave for hours about the old-school feel with the up-to-date features. I could go on and on about the stellar writing that was a core premise of what got me into gaming so many years ago. I could even enthuse about the art style, the tone, the humour, the grittiness and the lack of punches pulled in the overall theme.  I won't, I don't need to. If you have any sense or any taste whatsoever, you will play this game, you will give it your attention and your love and in return it will make a little home in your heart such that it will stay with you forever.Simply superb.

												If you're idea of a hardcore RPG is fallout 4 or Final Fantasy go away. But if you started with the original Fallout, Torment or Baldurs gate...wellcome home brother. While the pace can be slow to the point of glacial, the game goes have lots of atmosphere and story. The tactical elements can be tricky to get the hang of but can be rewarding. Some of the skill checks are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying but this is another throwback to oldschool CRPG's. Graphicly it's not a gigabite throtling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I'll be honest I'm not a huge fan of the copy paste unity engine used in many kickstared games but rpgs used to be more about the writing. So to sum up, great writing, good game, fun to be had from an amazing team. Lame graphics, ocasionly irritating bugs but enough nostalga and new gameply to make it worth a go. 8/10			"

												Summary at bottom for those of you in a hurry. I approached this game as a newcomer to the series. I had never played the original. So, I have no fan boy bias at all. I will probably end up comparing it to Fallout at times, but I WAS NOT expecting it to be a clone of Fallout. I will repeat that to make sure everyone understands that. I WAS NOT expecting this game to be exactly like Fallout. That being said, nobody can deny the two are similar. They’re both apocalypse’ish games that are centered on RPG mechanics.The Good: I actually liked the looks of the game. They’re aren’t the most high definition graphics, but they do look right. The game mechanics work well when it comes to combat. I liked that you got to customize up to four characters to play as. That’s something you don’t get to see very often. The last time I remember getting to customize more than one character in a game like this is Jagged Alliance 2. The combat was pretty solid. It has some issues, but nothing that can’t be fixed with some tweaking. The sound effects were good and so was the music. Sadly that’s about where my praise for the game ends. The Bad: The characters. I didn’t really find any to get attached to. The only character I liked was one of the random NPC characters you can pick up. Any game like this has to have characters with personality. You have to either love or hate at least some of the characters for anything to matter. Fallout 2, which is the closest game to compare this to, had great NPC characters. I just would have liked more connection with the characters. I remember going around with Cassidy (and his daughter in New Vegas) and enjoying their company. Next, there are the bugs. This game has acres of them, but I’m willing to give that a pass right now since it’s new and this is an indie developer. They seem determined to fix them, so good on them.The Ugly: The story. I found it boring. There was no hook to it. The story starts off with you attending Ace’s funeral. Ace was a ranger and so is your party. You are tasked with the mission he was trying to complete of attaching devices to some nearby towers to track a transmission. This transmission has been transmitting some very worrisome messages. The problem with this whole plot is there’s no attachment to it. I didn’t know Ace before he was dead, so there’s no attachment to him. I don’t know the Rangers, so I can’t feel attached to them. This comes especially so when the General doesn’t let you in the main fort to get supplies. He even lampshades this saying something about it being a real dangerous mission when you ask to go inside to get supplies. You can very minimal supplies outside at a trader, but still. You don’t feel like you’re being treated like one of the group, so why should you care about them? Without spoiling anything, you get to a point in the story where some bandits are harassing the area, so you have to deal with them. Now, their camp is guarded by these huge invincible turrets. I was gratuitously over leveled at this point because I had explored every square inch of the game so far, but they slaughtered me. I was frustrated with this, but accepted it at the moment. But, on a whim, I decided to see if I could take on Ranger Citadel (the Ranger HQ). I wanted to do it just for fun, not to actually keep as part of my save. I slaughtered everyone with ease in there and the only one who posed a threat was the General. The four turrets in Ranger Citadel went down it 2-3 hits each. It made no sense that the highly militarized and organized group had worse equipment than some bandits. To be fair though, I did like the second half of the story a lot more. The second half of the game could have been the start and I would have liked it a lot more. There was more personalization with the characters and therefore the events happening in the story mattered. Long story short: I do not recommend this game. The story was lackluster. It lacked any sort of immediate trouble in the game. There weren’t any memorable characters for me. I had the same problem with Skyrim (I know they’re very different games). They both had good gameplay, but lacked anything that could remotely be called a good story or characters. Good story and characters is pretty much 75% of an RPG.			"

												Alright so we have all done drugs, but the question you need to ask youreslf is, ""Am I doing the best drugs"". This game is like injecting a combination of cocaine, meth and heroin directly into your jugular vein whilest you take a health lung full of Phencyclidine(PCP). Obviously viagra was included in the standard oral format so that you may have a raging and engorged peice of man meat to murder the wastes with.			"

												I loved this game.. I truley did. But it all fell apart. The game is great if you can get it to run right, but good lord the bugs are just stupid and game breaking and that's why I'm giving this a thumbs down. Wasteland 2 is a great game, I loved it, i fed it and kept it changed.. but.. 1 damn bug ruined it all. Allow me to go into detail. When i started to play wasteland 2 i noticed roatating loading desert ranger stars on continue and load. They refused to save and all these other things and gave it that damn bug. Hours passed and still searching for my saves and no fix I can find for it. TOO me this is gone on long enough. When it comes to gameplay story, Wasteland 2 is great IF YOU CAN GET IT TO WORK RIGHT. If anyone even cares to read this.. or care, let me know because.. until this game is fixed fully from bugs.. I'm done. I am done with this game and it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. ""I can not fight anymore."" "

												If you're looking for a turn-based RPG, it doesn't get a whole lot better than this.  The game has many minor flaws - most of which are UI-related - but the world and writing oozes character and sucks you in.  There could also be some mild balance issues, but I'm not entirely convinced they're all in my head and I'm just rebelling against the CLASSIC system in Wasteland 2, compared to the SPECIAL system I'm used to from Fallout and Fallout 2.If I had any one desire, it'd be deeper, more interesting combat - especially given how common combat is! - but while it's not going to match XCOM: Enemy Unknown in that area, it's not *bad*, either.Wasteland 2 may not appeal to everyone, but if you're interested an old-school, turn-based CRPG, this'll scratch that itch for you.

												Wasteland 2 is very much defined by your expectations of it - on its own, or as a sequel to the original Wasteland, it stands proud and incredibly successful, with a rich storyline (mostly) and fun gameplay, leaning more towards combat than dialog and choices, but still having plenty of the latter two just the same.But if you expect Fallout 1/2 depth, or its balance of combat and choices, you shall be somewhat disappointed.My advice? Take the game for what it is, and enjoy the ride. 'cause it's a great game, with a fantastic game world designed and written into it.			"

												I regret every single overpriced buck i've spend for this game and everytime i think about it, i just get angry.Save yourself that experience.Story is shallow, characters are shallow and it feels like there are only 20 character portraits. (Nothing beats creating your character, writing a 2500 word biography for her only to recruit an NPC 3 hours in the game that has EXACTLY the SAME portrait)Turn-based combat is non-existant, you basically shoot and shoot and reload and heal until the enemy is dead.You know the game: ""I kick you in the nuts, you kick me in the nuts""? EXACTLY that's how combat in this game feels.-no movement required-no use of cover required-no tactic required-no use of terrain or height required-no ""let's make a plan"" required-no ambush required-every combat skill but ""assault rifles"" is useless-everybody can throw grenadesSeriously, i am a die-hard fan of Fallout 1 & 2 and would have been happy with basically the same game with enhanced graphics or some nice effects. To this day i cannot understand how the devs could ♥♥♥♥ this up THAT badly.			"

												A huge disappointment.  How did this get 'Game of the Year' award?  Probably because those who gave it that award never tried to beat the game.  The further along the plotline you go, the buggier it gets.  There's intermittent crashing at the Damonta location, but by the time you get to Hollywood, the game is unplayable.  Characters randomly transporting all across the map, quests that get stuck or become impossible to complete, with most players getting past the location by killing everyone on the map as the only way to 'complete' the location.  Unlike Fallout 1 and 2, you can't ""skip"" a town's quests and move on.  If you can't complete the quest, the game is permanently stuck.  There are so many times I've gone across the whole game map, only to find out that I need to talk to some obscure, random NPC at some location just to ""complete the quest"" and open up a new location.  Frustration, frustration, frustration.  And the game's plot completely lacks all of the dark humor, the biting social satire, and the open-ended adventure of Fallout 1 and 2.  Disappointment.			"

												When I first heard about Wasteland 2 I was excited the game was getting excellent reviews and I bought into the hype. After playing for a few hours saving Highpool I felt really burnt out which isn’t something you want your game to do. There is just too many meaningless fights and the quests are the most boring nonsense I have ever encountered most were broken at the time which greatly ruined the game for me.The main problem with the game is its gameplay I love turn-based combat but not when it takes 20-30mins per fight it just isn't fun. It still doesn’t have that element that makes combat satisfying that will have players coming back and investing hours into your game. The story is uninteresting, companions have zero personalities along with its countless bugs, forced story choices, stupid AI, no strategy required, useless game mechanics or terrible controls.Overall I would not recommend this game I had to force myself to finish it and don't understand how it is getting a Game of the Year Edition. Wasteland 2 is just mediocre at best Fallout 1 & 2 or Jagged Alliance are by far superior and I wish I could refund this game.			"

												This game is one of the best RPGs ive ever played... it's what Fallout 3 should've been. Well, I'd prefer a real dialog system instead of keyword, but still they managed to pull the keyword system off pretty well. The story is interesting, tons of side missions and choices throughout the game. The Combat is turn based, which is a big bonus in my books, especially because they pulled that off pretty well too. - Plenty of humor to be found as you travel the wasteland too :PI'm currently on 30+ hours, and I dont think i've seen even half of what the game has to offer yet.It's basicly a mix of Fallout meets Jagged Alliance - yet combat aint as advanced as the last mentioned - If you like RPGs especially the old classics - Post apocalypse games and Turn based combat - You'll love this...Support the developers, Buy it now!

												I REALLY wanted to love this game, but the combat rolls were just too unforgiving. It seemed like no matter how many points you'd put into a skill, it would still miss the majority of the time. I had one character with skills which led to his ""chance to hit"" being about 79%. Yet, he would miss his attacks about 3/4 of the time. While the world, story and conecpt are all great, the infurating unreliability of hitting in combat proved to be too much to overcome. I've got no problem with difficult games. I DO have a problem with feeling cheated though.			"

												I played this during it's ""free weekend"" and here are my thoughts.It is very reminiscent of the old Fallout games in graphics, gameplay, story, and sound/music (1, 2, and Tactics: BoS). So if you enjoyed playing any/all of those, then you'll probably enjoy playing Wasteland 2 as well.That having been said, while I did enjoy playing Wasteland 2 for free, I think I'll wait for it to go on sale (25%-50%) before I buy it, and just play the old Fallout games in the meantime.

												It's a very good and fun game! There is much to explore and story is very interesting. Difficulty suits even more experienced players. Characters are real too and you can do things your own way. It is much the same feeling as original Wasteland and like welcomes you home. Real classic! You won't be bored ever with this!			"

												I have barely scratched the surface of Wasteland 2, but numerous people have been asking my opinion so I figured I would post a ""first impressions"" review.I came to Wasteland 2 as a Fallout 1/2 fan. The kickstarter was the first time I had heard of Wasteland so I didn't know what to expect. All I knew was that it was a combat heavy turn-based strategy game set in a nuclear wasteland. Based on the fact that ""Toaster Repair"" is a useful skill made me it assume it had a healthy dose of snark as well.When I started the game I found out it was both what I expected and entirely different. The interface was more or less exactly what I had expected. The descriptive text and conversations were a lot more detailed than anticipated, but still lived up to expectations. [WARNING: This game has swearing.]The fact that the interface was as expected made it seem easy to jump right in and start exploring. Wow, was I wrong. The content and difficulty were another beast.From what I've seen thus far the overall tone is best described as “Dark Attitude”. The rangers aren't lights in darkness, they are flawed individuals who find themselves in the roles of peacekeepers. Its not a game where you get thanked for helping, its one in which those you help will gripe about it taking too long to get there and generally be jerks. Fellow Fallout fans should be prepared for a very different tone. Contrary to what I expected it was not easy to jump in. I had chosen a party of pregenned characters, thinking they were relatively balanced, and was proven very wrong. This became very obvious in the Ag Center and led to me restarting. Chance to hit was low, ammo usage was high, and eventually I was running around punching everything with characters spec’ed for ranged combat. If you don’t explore everywhere and carefully manage your ammo, you are in for a hard time. Don’t forget your shovel, safe-cracker, and toaster repair expert!Despite, or perhaps because of, the difficulty, I find myself continually thinking about the game and wondering what is next. If you like turn based combat and don’t mind having to work for victory it is worth getting. Just don’t go in expecting a Fallout clone because its an entirely different game.			"

												 Doing some reviews today and wanted to add my ""positive"" voice to this.      As has been said many times it's the spiritual successor to Fallout 1 and 2.   It retains the top down, tactical approach to gaming that old school fans of fallout remember. But let's be fair, this isn't fallout and so judge it accordingly.It's a modern version of the top down RPG.   Like the old D&D Goldbox games or Baulders Gate, you create a team to tackle an unknown threat to Arizona.      It does retain the open world quality and your choices on who you help do have consequences in ""the end"" (wink wink).  While I will recommend this game, I do acknowledge there's something of a feeling of it could or should be more.   That may have more to do with the kickstarter funds available and just how much game you can make for a given budget.   Still, as you can see by the hours spent on this game (roughly 200) there's plenty of stuff to do to get your money's worth.     One nice thing is that you do have options.    For example, hacking enemy robots to gain a numbers advantage for your team.   Or you can play your conversations Hard ♥♥♥, or Smart ♥♥♥.      Of course witha 4+ many team, you can have enough character builds to try out all these options while still having a unique characters compared to something like Fallout 4 where you level up so much that you basically create a person with ""every"" option and they cease to be unique at all. Personally I enjoy the idea of playing sides against each other and squeeking out those unique ""perfect"" resolutions if you're willing to try (and retry) all the options.   Based on that, I felt some pangs of dissapointment when it appeared the game design intentially forced me to choose one or the other even though ""both"" options were clearly visible and should have been an executible choice.       Visually it was passable.   It would definately been nice to have more unique artwork, or skipped that completely for more player face/body models.    Again it feels like going back to the 80's when the D&D games would reuse the same visual art work to represent mutliple people.      It's a minor criticism but one of those things that helps to pull you out of the experience.       All in all, if you like top down, tactical, RPG gaming with consequences for your actions, and you have 20 bucks (summer sale) give it a try.    Hopefully InXile will have pulled together enough money from this first forey to do a more expanded, enriched world with another Wasteland title.    Kind of how Fallout 2 expanded beyond Fallout 1.

												An RPG in the classic styling.  One of the more fun turn based RPG's i have ever played. The combat is decent but to me the game shines for it's story, and the way skills work are well done.  I'd put this game up there with any of the top RPG's i have ever played, especially if you are the sort of person that likes topdown, party based games.  Learning how to build a team is key, but there are guides around for that. Over all i'd give it a solid 8/10. My reasoning is there is always a bit of room for imporvemnt, like greater customization. It also could use a few more deeper choices or branching story lines, but it does have many already so it is more nit picking thatn a flaw. Id really love to see a wasteland 3 down the road, or another style game using a similar system.As far as polish goes, i have yet to have a single crash, or encounter a bug that stopped a quest in over 100 hours of play. It would seam like they have ironed out the early bugs quite nicely.			"

												I like this game.  Please read further as I try to form paragraphs and make relevant points.Probably the biggest compliment I can give this game, this is as close to Fallout 1/2 as we are going to get anytime soon.  There are lots of weapons/skills/stats and character development.  The post apocalyptic atmosphere is well done.  The game has dozens of hours of content.  The game was compelling enough for me to play it to completion.While the game is a positive experience overall, I have a few nitpicks -- The UI is a little clunky and limited. The balance between weapons\skills\stats could be better e.g., Assualt rifles are generally better than other weapons in most circumstances.   Finally, the skill checks encourage save scumming like no other game I have played in recent memory. Best Regards, (the)King of Save Scumming			"

												Well this is a good game if you are reading it in 1999 and you do not have big expectations (or any at all).To be perfectly honest this game is cool because it was done by original authors of Fallout and you have this cool Fallout vibe all around. It has decent combat system that is both tactically feasible and fun.But after 74h of playing and finishing the game let me send big FU to the authors.This game is terribly undone. There was not enough time given to story, terrains, graphics etc.So you play the game and all the time you hit the wall of freaking poverty of this projects. Terrains are the same, photos of characters are duplicated, models are poor and variety of quest solutions is narrow.You feel all the time that not enough work was given to make this project stellar. So the project became shhhh.....			"

												I like old-school rpgs and I am a fan of the Fallout series, so buying Wasteland was a logical choice for me. However, it took some time till I was able to enjoy it. I guess, it takes some time to develop an interest in the story and its NPCs. Furthermore, you need to spend some time with character developement, so that you have a competitive party at the beginning of the game. If you don't want to repeat my mistake, read through some character building guides. My first two game starts failed due to my poor attribute/skill choices.			"

												Supported Wasteland 2 in kickstarter and I am happy i did. That great feeling I had when I used to play Fallout 1 was back and it reminded me how great games used to be. That doesnt mean the game is perfect. There were some bugs that were a PITA but with each patch they made the game better. Not just on solving bug issues  but making it better as a whole.Battle mechanics are great and every problem has more than one solution. All in all a true rpg with lots of dialog and options and a solid turn based combat system that  will provide some decent challenge.			"

												As you may have noticed I played it only for like a 20 hours, which can make this ""review"" less legit. Or, maybe more legit.I backed this game on the Kickstarter, but after few updates I had this bothersome feeling that it won't end well. And it didn't, IMHO.After 20 hours, I didn't experience any memorable event or interesting quest. Not a single one.After 20 hours, I didn't visit any interesting location or fight any enjoyable battle. Not a single one.There is just nothing interesting or enjoyable in the game. There is no atmosphere. It's a post apocalyptic game, and there is no atmosphere. I mean come on, how is that even possible? Even Failout 3 had atmosphere FFS.The dialogues are more often than not boring or unnecessary. Characters are unmemorable, generic, boring. And the game is hideous. I don't care about the graphics, but I honestly can not think of uglier game I played in past decade. There is a lot of skills, that's nice. But most of them are completely redundant. There is 25 thousand skills for different kind of weapons. But no skill for throwing ""weapons"". So you have lvl 7 assault rifles skill and 80% chance to hit. And you have no skill with throwing grenades but you'll always hit the exact spot.When you want to open a safe, you need a demolition skill, disable alarm skill and safesomething skill (You don't always need all of them, but a combination of them more often than not). You need to switch between them and repeat until you are successful. I have to say that I enjoy the thought of having many different skills for different occasions. But not this huge number of unnecessary skills.I don't like the combat system either. When a melee enemy comes to you and you have a firearm, you immediately gain huge penalty and you have like a 15% chance to hit. So you have to run and shoot, which is just unbelievably stupid. And he will come to you in one turn without any problem.When you have 3% chance to jam your weapon, the weapon will jam every 5 turns. When you have 87% chance to hit the target, you will miss 2-3 out of 5. When you have 18% chance to hit the target, you will hit 2-3 out of 5.The game is throwing huge number of enemies at you most of the time, so the fights are long and boring. There is no excitement there. None what so ever.I honestly can't find a single nice thing about this game, so I won't waste my time.			"

												Just finished this game, I will say I had to start a second playthrough, skills are important and characters with dumped intel really suffer for skills and things to do.  So after reading a few guides I decided to start a second playthrough.  With a better rounded party and more skills to get involved with challenges it made for far more interesting gameplay.Dialogue - only certain characters are voiced and then rarely, but this is more than made up for by the excellently written character dialogue and conversation pieces.  Some very excellent post-apocalyptic sarcasm to be had :DGame play - loved it, obvious comparison to other genre staples aside, the game has a really smooth challenge curve, very rarely did any fights feel easy.  Keeps you thinking and planning.Storyline - Excellent, particularly enjoyed the way the post ending wrap up is handled.  Thank you to Ehrgeix for recommending this game to me!			"

												Wasteland 2 is not, perhaps, a great game. A thousand tiny things swirl around inside it, each bothering me a bit; like the aribitrarily obscure solutions to some puzzles.But whenever I play Wasteland 2, those problems melt away. I love it. It's one of my favorites, actually.It's very much like the early fallout games crossed with Fallout Tactics (which I thought had lots of promise but didn't play well.) It's descended from Fallout's grandpappy, too, which makes for nice continuity nods if you played the C64 original.Wasteland 2 is a squad based RPG largely set in the ruins of post-nuclear Arizona. Your squad of 4 Desert Rangers set out to find the meaning of mysterious radio signals, and uncover a sinister plot that could end the world a second time. In practice, the plot is a bit flimsy, but it provides a decent core for the weird people you'll meet in the wasteland-Pistol Packin' Priests being my personal favorite.Besides combat, which plays out nicely, you'll need a wide variety of skills to traverse the wasteland-Conversational skills to talk your way to the better solutions, brute force to smash walls, computer science, toaster repair and so on.I find myself having a hard time coming up with more to write. Please, if you're here take the time to watch the videos above. My time spent should tell you that I'm no casual when it comes to this game.As much as I love it, the price is pretty steep right now. Wait until it goes on sale. It's good, but I don't think you'll get your money's worth at full price.			"

												Wasteland 2 Director's Cut is an isometric CRPG where you lead a group of 4 player characters that you create (or you can take premade characters), level up, and control and up to 3 additional NPC followers that you level up and control. The story is the continuation of the original Wasteland story from the classic original game that won numerous game of the year awards when it was released back in late 1980s. Like the original Wasteland, Wasteland 2 has received numerous awards and accolades, especially in the RPG category.The Director's Cut version of Wasteland 2 improves graphics from the original Wasteland 2 game, but even with improvements the graphics are functional but not particularly exciting. I did notice a nice increase in the number of voiced comments by NPCs that bring out more of their personalities and morality. The view is isometric and combat is turn based. You will spend most of your time in this game doing one of these things. - Moving from place to place- Talking to NPCs to receive and solve quests- Fighting turn based combats, including random combats as your travel from place to place- Digging and opening stuff- Managing inventoryThese elements combine to create a game with lots of content that will take 60-80 hours to complete if you don't skip content. That said this game does become a grind at times as combat, movement, inventory management, and talking to NPCs can become tedious at times. I found that I stopped bothering to pick up inventory items to sell because dealing with the inventory management wasn't worth the money I would get from selling it. I also found things like digging up mounds of dirt with a shovel to be a very tedious mechanic and stopped doing it and stopped opening chests that didn't promise high end items to avoid the time it took to complete these tedious activities. That said, there's a good overall story and some good side stories, and some interesting and tough combats (how tough depends on the game difficulty you select - if you play on Rookie, you probably won't be challenged by the combat). There are also lots of different ways that problems can be resolved that impact the final outcome and the ending you receive. This also provides some replayability because you can take different paths through different parts of the game. Overall I enjoyed Wasteland 2 DC, and am recommending it. It was clearly a labor of love for the developers and I appreciate the fact that many of the original designers came back to create this sequel over 25 years later. My guess is that people who played the original Wasteland game (as I did) will enjoy this updated version of the game that continues the original story. If you never played the original game, and you're judging this game on its own merits, my guess is it will be a mixed bag that some will enjoy because it's a solid CRPG and some will not because they find parts of the game too tedious. If you generally like isometric, turn-based CRPGs, I would recommend you buy and play this game, but if you're not sure wait for it to go on sale. If you like fast paced games or more of an ARGP experience, this game may not appeal to you. "

												Definitely worth it.  It's definitely a spiritual successor of Fallout 1 and 2 in many ways (kind of funny, seeing as how Fallout was a successor of Wasteland) - even the art style reminded me of the pre-rendered cutscenes in F1, 2, and Tactics.  The gameplay can get a bit frustrating with the absurd number of jams and critical failures that seem to occur, but once you get into it, it's really fun, especially since it forces you to rely on a balanced squad rather than maxing out every useful skill for one guy.  There's enough choices for three or four thorough playthroughs, too.Definitely recommended.  I do'nt think I've managed to sink this much time into a non-open world RPG for a LONG time.			"

												Old-school to a fault. Buggy as all hell, even in its Director's Cut form - and this is basically what stopped me from finishing it. The way the game is designed makes you think that you can really solve many quests in oh so many different ways, but your creativity is unlikely to be rewarded, as approaching a task from an angle not intended by the developers may run you into bugs\unfinishable quests. It is also very long, and with the problems mentioned above, plus the turn-based combat making things even slower (and I do normally enjoy turn-based combat), it becomes a drawn-out slog. Waste of time, only for fans of the genre so hardcore as to not care for the (utterly unpleasant) pain that this game brings alongside its intended experience.			"

												Billed as the spiritual successor to the original isometric Fallout games, the Wasteland 2 that we have today is the result of 3 years and 3 million dollars' worth of work. And it shows:The new graphics are based on an innovative new rendering system that builds characters and environments using nothing but jaggies, bringing to life a rich and vibrant world of faded browns and greens. Despite the 3D graphics, the bold choice of camera angle in the game restricts your view to only a tiny rectangular area of the game world at a time, at times feeling like the top-down perspective of the 1988 release - something that should go quite well with inXile's nostalgia-based marketing. In essence, they've managed the herculean feat of combining unattractive low-budget 3D graphics with a visually uninformative, claustrophobic old-school style, and the results speak for themselves.Which brings me to the next point I wanted to discuss: the interface. Now, I love games like Darklands and Dwarf Fortress not because of the sheer breadth of possibilities and amount/variety of content that they offer, but because I'm a masochistic chump who enjoys the feeling of eyestrain, befuddlement and constant annoyance. In that sense, Wasteland 2 was perfect for me as a game in that regard - as it's managed to combine the obtuse, archaic interface design of those aforesaid games with the gameplay of a straightforward and mediocre RPG. I was worried that the Director's Cut might excise this feature from the re-release, so imagine my relief when I started the game and found it nearly impossible to buy or sell items! Folks, this wasn't even something that was a problem in the original release - you can tell that they really went the distance here.But, when you get down to it, all of that stuff is just window dressing when it comes to an RPG. The two things that really matter are the gameplay and the story. Where's Wasteland 2 stand on that? Well, the gameplay's your standard fare - you click on guys that you want your guys to shoot. There's also enemies that explode on death so that four guys with clubs isn't the most optimal party. That's the extent of the tactical gameplay.Roleplaying-wise, Wasteland 2 is very limited. Your party members are all interchangeable, and your communicative options are extremely limited as a consequence. For the most part, skills don't really factor into things beyond being used on objects to get extra loot. Your party does go around resolving conflicts and righting wrongs, and there's even a handful of world-affecting decisions you can make. It's got some interesting bits of world-building and story elements, and I feel that the story is genuinely interesting, if unexceptional - after all, as my friend Manco says, fight one megalomaniac with a messiah complex and you've fought 'em all. As an aside, you can tell how unimportant the characters are by the fact that there are only about four portraits per gender by default (and only two genders? inXile could stand to learn a thing or two about cis privilege I think) but I'm willing to excuse this because you can play as the Madoka Magica crew if you import your own portraits.All in all, Wasteland 2 is extremely disappointing. For all the hype it's gotten, it is ugly, limp and flaccid. Out of all the more recent RPG releases, Divinity: Original Sin has funner tactical combat and Shadowrun: Dragonfall has a much better story. That said, I kind of liked it - I don't really regret backing this game, despite my disappointment, and I enjoyed the time I spent playing it. However, I still wouldn't recommend it to another human being, unless they're also the kind of weirdo that feels the need to play every isometric cRPG in existence, in which case they probably wouldn't even listen to me if I told them not to play this game.Also, the music's pretty decent.Overall, I'd give this release an outrageously disgraceful 7/10			"

												I pre-ordered this and I really really wanted to like it. Unfortunately there is not a lot to love. I know with the onset of roguelike RPG's there seems to be a consumer market for old-school difficult games but there is a fundamental difference between difficult and inconvenient. Wasteland 2 isn't that difficult it is just extremely inconvenient. Spammy and monotonous battles on the main map, no useful fast travel for getting from one area to another, and writing that, while definitely serviceable (sometimes funny), just doesn't stack up against other major RPGs. The combat is boring as hell, the upgrades system is weak and uninteresting, and there is little depth (though they can be interesting) to the few characters you can pick up that do have characterization (the main group you use is a blank slate with zero characterization). When you compare this to Kickstarter RPG's such as Pillars of Eternity there is just no comparison. Pillars of Eternity (which I am using as a comparison because it is also a kickstarter) is just a fundamentally better game.  Sure the graphics are crap (what do you expect from a kickstarter game?) but the plot, characters, upgrade system and combat is infinitely (haha pun) better. This is not a horrible way to kill time but there are just a lot better ways to kill it.			"

Early Access Review
								 I'm not a big fan pf paying for ""early access"", However, being a huge Fallout fan, and loving everything post apocalyptic, (well most everything, if its done well I should say), I went ahead and paid the 60$. I'm not unhappy with my purchase, sure there are things that need fixed, its a beta that should be expected. But, you are able to see where the game is going, what is being done, and how its all getting put together. All of which I find very enlightening. I'm very excited to be part of the beta, and I'm really looking forward to the finished product. I think people will be rather surprised and satisfied with Wasteland 2 once its complete. If you don't have an extra 60$ burning a hole in your pocket, then wait till the finished game comes out, it won't cost as much and you'll get the finished game. Its not like its an MMO so the beta people like myself won't be getting any type of advantage over you. But, if you do have some extra cash and feel like investing in a good game, (it is tax return season), then getting in on the Beta might not be a bad idea.			"

												I paid $10 for it and I feel ripped off.  Your 95% to hit is really about 40%, and the levelling system is ponderous at best. As others have said, the voice acting is atrocious.  The game plays better without it, but that doesn't help all that much because the text is boring to read.  The movement is slow and lanky.  It really ruins immersion when I'm bored and watching my guys move ponderously slow.  This game has too many serious flaws to be worth playing. The levelling system is seriously just painfully bad. You get 23 attribute points, and you get 2-5 skill points depending on how many of your attribute points you put into Intelligence.  You can't raise your attributes later on.  So if you put half your attributes into intelligence, then you cripple your combat skills so you can get enough survival skills end-game. First skill level takes 1 point, 2nd takes 2, 3rd takes 3, etc. You have 4 characters and you can get an npc.  You will need to level 10 non-combat skills to open doors, see traps, upgrade weapons, etc.  Another few skills if you want to get good use out of your medical supplies.  If you're a big fan of games like these, check out the Avernum line of games or X-COM: Enemy Unknown.     You can get Avernum on sale for $1-3  and it is far superior.			"

												I arrived at a town and found a girl stuck on a tree, Had Chisel kick the tree with Brute Force.The girl fell down and broke her leg. My medic performed surgery to fix the leg. Girl: ""Bye, gentle cripplers.""I talked to a guard saying I fixed the leg of a girl who ""fell from a tree"". Guard gave me 50 scrap.Best 2-minute sequence in a game ever!10/10, would gently cripple again.Especially with all the nice little improvements and the unbelieveably better atmosphere and graphics of the Director's Cut.

												EDIT for Enhanced Edition:Still buggy and unoptimized. Buy it if you are a patient person and the price drops to 10 EUR. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------According to devs, it is finished and they are just fixing bugs (the final patch will not invalidate saves, but it may damage them - release date is 19.9.2014). So, the time has come to make a judgment (preliminary since I did not finish the game, yet).Well, it is a difficult to decide, if I should recommend this or not.I will judge based on playing a lot of computer games, especially role-playing ones, but tactical, TBS, RTS and plenty more, too. First of all, I consider Fallout 2 with Restoration Project from Killap (I bow before this guy) as a kind of standard. I did play the original Wasteland, all Fallouts (F1, F2, Tactics, F3, Vegas).Right at this moment, this game is a disappointment for me (because I had very high expectations). The combat is comparable to Tactics (FT being better for me, but it is a matter of taste) and the role-playing part is worse than F2. It's a mixture, but it seems to me that the focus is on tactical combat with some RP decision making.It is not a bad game compared to what is produced these days. I just hoped that it would be so much better. There are some things – even in combat – that take away the immersion for me. So, if you liked Tactics, go for it – but not for the current ridiculous price. If you like more role-playing I would wait till the game is modded (fingers crossed) and there is a sale.Graphics is OK, nothing groundbreaking, but it does the job.Audio is OK, there no catchy tune in my mind, yet – but it corresponds to the setting.I would like to note that there may be something along the story that will change my mind. I will update after I finish the game (I will also go into more details about those little pesky things like the enemies with infinite ammo; they don’t drop stuff they were using in combat, etc.).

												After finishing the game (70 Hours) here is my verdict.Gameplay/Gameplay is one of the most aspects that drive my judjment towrd any game, the more solid the gameplay and polished the more i invest my self with it.The battle system doesn't offer much of creativity or presenting a new ideas, compering it to XCOM Enemy Unknown which has a simillar battle system, though the latter is better in that aspect.The AI in this game is highly underdeveloped, enemies with ranged weapons would charge towrd you despite that it will hinder thier accuracy and hit chances and they don't seem to use the environment In their favor that much, like cover for instance.The difficulty spikes seems to be absent most of the time regarding that you know what you're doing. I have't encounter any impossible situation that hinderd my progress. All of the hard encouters is doable with a will excuted strategy ofcurse.Nice and will implemented skills system that add a decent and rich experiance._____Graphics and Sounds/I don't usually mind graphics in games too much, but I do agree it gives a nice boost to the game experiance.Graphicly the game is not emprassive at all, varrying between a poor characters design and a moderate enviroment design.yet there is some nice areas that have some depth on them.The sounds generally is fairly good, but the game lack variety in the soundtrack department. _____Story and Writting/Likable strory with some nice twists and a bold and brilliant writting.The strongest features in this game is the writting and it's quist line.The game Intelligently combine decision making with your team's skills to progress through the game, making every playthrough a different experince.It sometimes present a deep and philosophical ideas but somehow faild to present it properly._____The technical sideUnfortunately the game doesn't excel technically, starting with massive frame drop and graphical glitches.In the first half of the game the frame rate average at ~90 FPS then drop dramatically in the second half at average of ~35 FPS (680 GTX OC).A lot of the time the game won't responds to mouse ckicks when initiating skills command.____ "

												This is NOT a review of the Director's Cut. I'll get to the ""why?"" later on.Let's start by saying that I bought WL2 not long after release without looking into it too much... Everyone was praising this game, reviews were all positive...At the time it suffered some (*A LOT OF) bugs, some of them gamebreaking. So I had to put it aside for some time. When I took it back, the bugs had been fixed (at least the ones that plagued my playthrough), so I went on...The game wasn't as good as I expected it to be, but at the time I needed something to relax after more action-oriented games, and this one, for some time, suited my needs.It quickly bored me though. It was super repetitive and combat was so boring... but I wanted to see if, progressing through the game, things would have changed.I had to stop again when I read about the upcoming Director's Cut: better graphics (wow that was needed!), reworked gameplay, perks, quirks, body parts aiming à la fallout... oh and CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!! That's what I needed! A relaxing game that could be played on my big tv while lying on the couch!So I waited. And waited. And finally it came out.So going back to the opening of my review, why isn't this a review of the long awaited DC? That's quite simple... because I didn't had the chance to try it yet.CONTROLLER SUPPORT (my top feature): moving my guys is impossible.They do half a step at a time. Animation is broken and movement is slow and clunky as hell. I google for a few seconds and see that I'm not the only one experiencing this.They say that turning the graphics to minimum settings resolves the issue.IT'S TRUE! IT WORKS NOW!Just, the game, which already didn't look good, looks even worse now.Ok, nevermind, let's ignore graphics and let's enjoy all the amazing improvements this version introduces...CRASH TO DESKTOP.Ok, nevermind, let's reload and try again.10 minutes in, CRASH TO DESKTOP!AGAIN AND AGAIN!And googling around I see that I'm not the only one. And it's not the only bug. for example, a known issue concerns dismissed followers who, instead of going back to base waiting to be recruited again, just disappear...At the moment I don't even want to try any workaround as I personally think such release status is unacceptable even for an indie/small team game.I'll sure wait for some updates (they already had one out, but it did just address the zoom level of the camera as far as I understand...)TO ANYONE THINKING TO BUY THIS:The price is high. Too high in my opinion. If you really want to get this mess I advice you to wait for a 50% sale, at least.But keep in mind: in less than one week Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced edition's gonna be out and I think it will be a much wiser purchase.Otherwise you can stick to this buggy-1998-looking-mindless-turn-based-combat-no-magic-no-combat-skill-no-real-options-besides-shooting-and-hoping-to-hit-even-if you're-on-95%-hit-chance game.EDIT: in 1998 games looked better than this one. Yes, Baldur's Gate, I'm thinking about you. I MISS YOU!			"

Some of you know that our own indie After Reset[afterreset.com] was born in the moment when we simply got tired of waiting for a true old-school Fallout 3 (Van Buren), in the moment when we understood that no one other than us, the gamers would do that. For a long time we were left with a very skeptical mood toward Wasteland 2… And it lasted until last week, when we got its release version on Steam.Guys, it turned out to be very interesting! I.e., this game, of course doesn’t have anything in common with either Fallout 1&2&T, or with After Reset RPG… But it doesn’t even have to be like them, or even be a classic RPG. It has its own interesting style/setting/mechanics/gameplay… In general, I personally don’t understand what exactly its secret is, but it’s really cool and fun to play. I played all weekend without stopping (and there’s no end or border in this game), and I’ll be very happy to back Wasteland 3!One nuance: two times in the beginning I thought of deleting the game after creating a character (a sentiment I’ve heard from plenty of gamer friends). I really didn’t like the character portraits, and I don’t like to play as a big faceless group. But Brian Fargo has slyly provided for the ability to load your own portraits and delete the others besides your own character from the group. We’ve prepared a character portrait pack from After Reset especially for you: http://indiedb.com/games/after-reset/downloads/after-reset-rpgs-custom-avatars-for-wasteland-2.I’m sure that even if you’ve had doubts, with our pack, Wasteland 2 will sparkle with fresh colors for you! You have to play it; the game is really worth it!- Richard Nixon, Black Cloud Studios, http://afterreset.com "

												Is Wasteland 2 up to spec?  No, sadly, it is not.As a squad-based RPG, it feels more like FO:Tactics than Wasteland.  There is a storyline, but the actual roleplay suffers from the lack of a central character.  You end up with less of a Fallout-style Jack of All Trades and more of a set of specialists that feels stale.The game also seems unfinished, with many bugs still present and most problems have one real solution and a bunch of approaches to it.  The conversation choices are just garnish and a lot of interactions will result in being attacked without a chance to explain or talk it out.  Prepare to be frustrated by a game that looks more modern, but lacks depth (plenty of breadth, though).It's been covered in other reviews, but here are the basic issues with this over-specialization:-You have to constantly switch between party members for each task (lockpicking, safecracking, defusing, disabling) and wait for each to have a small loading icon to complete the task.  The delay between selection, the poor controls, and having to swap between them makes it tedious.  All for an old teddy bear, a used polaroid, and some scrap metal (not a joke, this is the kind of loot you will be seeing a lot of).-Success at these skills yields XP, but only to the party-member who does it.  This means that your demo guy will be getting a lot more, as almost everyone in the wastes seems to have the knowledge, supplies, and desire to trap everything.-Some weapons types are so situationally specific as to be obnoxious (looking at you shotgun and heavy weapons).  Others have handicaps that don't make sense (an assault rifle suffers a penalty to hit when a target is adjacent, which the AI exploits by rushing a group of heavily armed people with an axe).-You have to micro-manage prior to combat to ensure that your weapons are optimally employed, but it is often a matter of getting interrupted by the enemy spotting you (no, there is no ""sneak"" option either) and having combat kick off prematurely while you awkwardly select and move your personnel.-NPCs (to include hire-ons) have a tendency to go rogue, ruining your carefully-crafted team composition and plan.  This usually means rushing out of cover and often shooting past teammates, hitting them in the process.  Tag-alongs (like animal friends or story characters) are always in this AI pattern, making you leave your positions to take the heat off of them.Now let's talk about design.-Levels are often open areas with little or nothing to do in them.  A few stashes (with locks, tumblers, alarms, and traps... whee!) or cliche'd NPCs and a lot of walking in-between.  You keep looking, using your perception skill, to try to find SOMETHING there, but the return is rarely worth the effort.-The AI.  It's horrible, devolving into people with guns rushing into range and often sharing cover with the enemy (in some cases, side-by-side).-Difficulty.  Harder levels just mean more HP and armor for the enemies and higher levels required for defusing, unlocking, etc.  Just a waste of time, as it makes the game tedious and not challenging.-Combat is disappointing.  While they did add ""headshot"" as a choice, the fights seem to be somewhat formulaic and the level design does not make for interesting cover-based shootouts or flanking.  It feels somewhat stale and would have benefitted from the location-based targeting of the Fallout series.  Also, the incidence of shooting friendlies is too high, making it a common occurence when AI starts rushing.  APs are too few to attempt to run around and you really don't have many options or any selectable skills to make it tactical.-The UI is clunky.  Rather than have selectable portraits at a fixed point, when you open the inventory/skill screen, it pops up a new set.  Baldur's Gate did not suffer from this issue, so why move in this direction?  When you open your skills screen to level up, the bars don't always load and you have to scroll to force it to do so.  There is also a delay when opening this screen, despite the relatively simple nature of its display.-The engine has issues with mouse-based selection, with items blocking your click with a transparent ""hit box"" (this happens with both terrain and mobs).  There are also times when the game does not register a click.  Not a deal-breaker, just makes the game feel less polished.-Movement honestly feels worse than in Wasteland.  I preferred the grid-based precision that the original had to the click and watch a throng of morons push past each other.  The ability to set up formations would be a welcomed solution (again, Baldur's Gate had this...).I'm disposed to complain, but here is the up-side:+The game seems pretty long and there are a lot of locations to visit (even if their maps are too bland).+There is a weapon mod system in which you can recover parts of a weapon (though it seems odd that it's random what you get).+The conversation system shows you what skills you would need to select what options, setting it up for future play-throughs in which you can make informed decisions regarding new NPC skills.+No crashes to date.  Despite some clunkiness, they seem to have made it very stable.+Some elements of the original remain and it is kinda neat to see how things have changed since.+The millieu is interesting, if limited.  There remain a lot of quests, both cliches and refreshing.If you liked Fallout Tactics, you will be right at home.  If you like Fallout 1&2, you might be a little underwhelmed.  If you're looking to recapture that Wasteland feeling...  Well, it's there in some storyline nods, but the gameplay has changed significantly.The sum is greater than its somewhat-flawed presentation.  You will get your money's worth if you stick with it, but there will be moments of aggravation.			"

												One of the best games ever and an instant classic. If you love Fallout 1 and 2 and just feel fallout 3 and the new fallout 4 missed the mark, then this is the game for you. If you liked Fallout Tactics, despite it not being considered Fallout canon, then you will really really really love this game. I have played wasteland 1 back in the day and I have to say this game follows through perfectly. I beat wasteland 2 once, then realized the storyline, as with fallout, is affected by my choices. Once GOTY edition comes out, I plan to beat it several more times. I rarely do this with games unless they are topnotch. This game does NOT disappoint.			"

												Pros:Great game, fun to playhumor can be a bit off sometimes, but its all over and pretty good usually.large party, 7 after recruiting... with many choices. Customization ++captures the experience of being a desert ranger pretty well, rather than just wearing the title.Modding community, of which I havent checked out yet... but thats always a plus.Cons:Buggy, very buggy.... I switched over to the Directors Cut version, which is where I am encountering many bugs, some of which lock up the game or some other effect that causes me to shut down the game and load, losing as much as 10 minutes at a time... which isnt much until you consider how OFTEN these kind of bugs happen. In a single sitting, expect it at least 5 times.I cant speak for the original version, but its much less buggy if I remember correctly.Then theres unbarable lag in certain areas... I can reduce my settings to make it work... but, ♥♥♥♥... I play the most graphically demanding games on ultra settings, and for some reason this kind of game which isnt graphically impressive in the least bit is causing me trouble? No, this game needs to be optimized BADLY.Despite the flaws of this game, I still recommend it highly.			"

												Disclosure: I backed this with $50 during the KS campaign.As a huge fan of Fallout 1 and 2, Wasteland 2 has been a great enjoyment. Whilst I think the game could certainly use a little more polish (there are some minors bugs and balance annoyances to address), the quality of the writing and content is extremely high.I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys story driven RPGs with a strong focus on both choice and consequence, and grey morality. I hope both Wasteland 2 and Divinity Original Sin are just the start of the return of the classic CRPG.			"

												Let me get one thing out of the way first: I do recommend this game, I think it's great and it makes me feel like I'm playing the original Fallouts again... BUT. I had very high hopes for it initially, I wanted it to be a worthy successor to Fallout 2 and it just falls short in comparison for several reasons.The first thing I noticed is that the locations are graphically very busy but their size encourages to view them with the camera zoomed out all the way. This sometimes makes it hard to make out items of interest like NPC, chests and doors, I often find myself scanning the screen with my mouse, hoovering over everything trying to find something I could have missed. It's often also hard to see how high a given structure is or where are the characters allowed to walk, this is also due to the camera rotating freely and the levels not being designed to be viewed from a certain fixed perspective.My second gripe is the dialogue system, there are no dialogue trees and instead you always have a list of topics a given NPC can tell you more about, this makes talking feel much less impactful. I do love however that there is not one but three talking skills that might come handy at different times, hard-♥♥♥, smart-♥♥♥ and kiss-♥♥♥, each of which unlocks different replies that might change the outcome of a conversation.Another thing is the level design which often feels streamlined with one path leading you from start to end of a level. This is not always the case and there are some great non-linear locations, but I feel the Fallouts did a better job at this.Lastly, I don't really feel there are that many impactful choices in the game, NPC interactions often just lead you to the one expected outcome and 12 hours in I think there was only one meaningful choice I had to make.Still it's a very solid game. The combat is pretty deep, with positioning playing an important role. The skill selection is awesome, every one feels very important and comes in handy more often than not. There is an element of crafting, you can apply upgrades to weapons or strip them for parts. Trying to optimise your team build to cover the whole spectrum of skills and to be effective in combat is fun in itself, and you can always ignore some skills and concentrate on others (for example you don't need lockpicking and safecracking much if you know how to use explosives or brute force). I also like how non-initial party members always have a chance of going 'out of control' during combat and shooting an enemy of their choice instead of letting you issue orders, this effect can be mitigated with the leadership skill.All in all I don't regret backing it on Kickstarter and I haven't played such a good RPG in a very long time, but still it could have been much more.EDIT: After finishing the game I have to admit that there is indeed quite a lot of interesting choices in it, the longer you play, the more of them you see. I highly recommend this game if you enjoyed Fallout 1/2 and Torment.			"

												If you like the fallout serie, the turn by turn combat and 80h+ RPGs (Think baldur's gates), youre going to love this game.Weapons balance isnt perfect (i have to try a fan-made mod yet though), some skills are weirds (like you need to train a skill to bash a door, no matter what strengh you have), but these are probably the only flaws i found in this game after 100 hours to finish it.This game and Divinity : original sins are the 2 best rpgs i played this year. The witcher 3 might be on this list soon though.			"

												This isn't Fallout or even like the original Wasteland but still packs hours of solid RPG fun.I gravitate toward games with similar setting since while I enjoy RPGs, I'm not usually a fan of fantasy settings most RPGs are in. So I certainly have a built in bias for this sort of game. I still think people would generally find the game to be worth their time due to solid story, good mechanics, and generally good support.The game isn't flawless of course. It does have a bit of balance issue in regard to class and weapons, but you can say that about 99% of the games really. I personally found the combat system interesting, building on the Fallout style turn-based tactical combat and adding new elements like speed. Though I think thrown weapon aspect was bit too simplified. The character creation also is a bit on the simple side, lacking a bit of depth and true specialization.All that said, I don't think none of the negatives really prevented me from enjoying the game throughout the playthrough, but I can see it being a more glaing negative if you're a fan of hard-core RPGs.

												This was the year of the RPG and this was one I was really looking forward to. A strong pitch which felt like it laid out realistic goals, along with a spokesman who was hitting all the right notes. Yet what they delivered was so very bland. A combat heavy game with an incredibly shallow TBS component, one where it felt you did little more than maximise your damage each turn and terrain had little to no impact. Compared to Shadowrun Returns/Dragonfall, which had built their entire editor around creating good combat layouts, this was weaksauce.More than that though, the characters and story were dull. You have a team of nobodies, which would be fine if you had a strong combat system to back it up. The personalities you do collect are at a Baldur's Gate 1 level, and less memorable than those. Not one of the NPCs, party or otherwise, stands out.It just all came together to form a rather dull experience, and after a while I found I just sort of stopped playing. I couldn't find anything to motivate me to push on. That the primary mystery is spoiled during a joke death scene was just the icing on the cake.It leaves me worried for Torment.			"

Early Access Review
								OK, this shows promise and as a fan of the first Wasteland I really like the walk down memory lane.The first few hours of game play were,however, a bit frustrating to say the least.***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***So you get this mission to check out a radio tower. The problem is if you don't go there straight away and roam a little you trigger this new quest line of either going to Highwater or some agricultural station. Your 'boss' tells you that these calls have priority over you initial mission, so off you go!Problem is, you automatically fail one of them. While you're exploring some hydro-plant which is about to fail you get this desperate radio calls from the other mission, how they're overrun but you can do nothing about it as the hydro-plant is about to explode. Moreover, prior to the power plant mission you get some side quests which ALL fail if you don't do them first. Basically, I saved the town's power plant from destruction but the grateful people of Highwater kicked me out of town because I did not kill the bandits first, found a dog and put out a fire for them. Consequently, the wrong person gets the votes to be the new mayor. He's all in with the bandits and tells me to get the hell out of town.Basically, after six hours of game play I'm a total failure. Is this a feature? I don't know. Maybe this game is about priorities but the jumps in the quest system seem contrived and lack immersion this way. Non-linear is OK but if you simply say 'If you don't do missions A,B and C before D then they must have failed!' is a bit sloppy in terms of story-telling to me.***END SPOILERS***Apart from that you pretty much get a product as advertised: An isometric sequel to Wasteland 1. It is all there! The setting, the desolate arid lands, the radiation zones, the bandits and mutants and all those old-school turn-based combat fights. The skill system is almost pen&paper-like but does the trick. The item system is working as intended. I really like how easy you could set up hot buttons and point and click your way to skill checks and interactions.I did have a hard time getting used to camera controls and setting up teams of party members but that might be my inexperience at work here.Bottom line: As a fan of the original Wasteland, you will not want to miss this, but the game does confront you with certain constraints you might not consider acceptable in a modern open world setting.But what do you get if you deduct the fandom? Not sure about that at this stage of development. I will restart the story with my utter and complete failure in mind and update my verdict.As for now I think you get a better chunk of post-apocalyptic America for your bucks from Fallout 3/New Vegas games.We'll see.......

Early Access Review
								The good:++++ Incredible artwork (portraits, areas, ... )+++ Good writing: dialogue, storyline++ Impressive game Atmosphere: created by the music, the in game artwork/colours & mature environment.++ Game for adults: doesn't shy away from credible violence like seen in Mad max movies or a little bit of controversial violence and adult themes++ A lot of nice variation in environment locations (official ones)+++++ Originality (Tons of good original ideas: like the mad monks f.e.)++++++ The only old school RPG released at this date. It s not hard to be the best when you re the only one competing for the title, but despite the lack of competition for being the best Old school RPG the game is pretty damn good at becoming something as memorable as the Fallout 1 & 2 games where for me. (Not talking about Bethesda s version of Fallout as that is clearly a different game: more an adventure game like Oblivion). Fallout 1 & 2 fans will feel right at home, not having played wasteland 1 I can not speak for Wasteland 1 fans.The bad:---- Combat turn based isn't as good as in the latest Xcom game, could use a lot of improvement. But this isn't the focus of the game, so that s ok. ----- Random encounters not always as good. But I guess these can be improved later with patches to improve them.------ Learning Curve: Hard to figure out for new players how to build your characters: f.e. in the build screen it isn't obvious that low intellingence will cap the progress of your surgeon skill/ other skills or that strength lvl 4 is needed to wear certain types of armour. You will need several tries before you will figure out what is a good party and what isn't and which attributes go well together with each other and with which other skills. Maybe that s why this game has a manual: but to be honest, I never read the manual for playing a game (I try to figure it out on the go)It would be nice to see in a blink of an eye which attributes affect which skills and how. Or how f.e. group charisma has an effect to inviting new companions.			"

												This is the real Fallout 3 to me. This game has its flaws (some of the mechanics), but greatly compensated by what it does well (just about everything else). Old school is a good way to describe it.On a side note, I have to say I'm glad about Inxile's way to handle things. No DLC crap, free upgrade to the Director's cut for people who already owned the game. This is how it's supposed to be done. Thank you, Inxile. "

												Wow, what a game! From start to finish it just kept getting better. Even now it is still worth the money in my opinon. There is some serious playtime in this game as well and some genuine replayability. A whole varierty of choices to make throughout that have genuine consequences and when you finish you get a detailed summary explaining how your choices affect all the areas you have interacted with through the game as well as your own team. Even if you aren't a fan of this this genre please have a go, I don't think you will be disappointed. Looking forward to number 3 now :-)			"

												If you like the old, isometric turn-based strategy games such as the original Fallouts or the original Wasteland, then you will most likely enjoy this game. If you haven't played those, but enjoy games such as Shadowrun, or XCom, there is a good chance you will like this game. The story is good, and the gameplay is exactly what I was hoping for.			"

Early Access Review
								(probably Spoilers)My hours may say I've had 66 hours but I'll be honest and say about 6 of those hours are from falling asleep due to playing this game non-stop. Are there bugs, yes, but from what what I noted they were minimal and most have been address if not noted on the many dev forums. Let me say this, Wasteland to me is a breath of fresh air to me in regards to gaming, I'm a fan of the original Fallout 1 and 2 and will admit to have never playing the original Wasteland. This game left me wondering something about myself, I've never really been able to get into Turned based combat RPG save for a few. For instance I can't get into any of the X-COM series...There's nothing wrong with the games, Maybe I just like post apocalypse more than aliens I guess. Every time in this game I had an idea about, I wonder if i can do this, the answer usually was yes, could I avoid contact with damn near all the wild life, due to animal wispers ability, damn near. Did it pay off to be skilled in toaster repair, sometimes. Finding out I could reprogram robots instead of fighting them everytime sure helped. On almost every instance I encountered someone the game has an option for the pasifits. Did I kill A LOT of people and things, oh god yes. But along the way the game has left you with so many options by the time I hit the ""endgame"" I had over 8 followers with me. I guess I can get 10 somehow, But from what I've seen I've gone over the entire map. But that's fine for me, I've seen everything however, not in EVERYWAY I can see it. Some of my crew were idiots who could take more than 4 steps in the game and were total meat heads, BUT could punch you in half and just walked around were the most perceptive of my crew. In the end I had a very Niave boy, a drunken hobo (who activily stole liquor from other crew members), a mutant horror that loved candy, a man who  Inever found out who is is other than I think a robot speaking in latin phrases and a goat that gave my animal lover a buff along with the people I actually created.Yes there is still room for much improvement which I can almost be assured is coming in the next couple weeks. Would I love to see body part by body part targeting. More story, more things to do, yes, but I must remember this is a ♥♥♥♥ing wasteland, so to want a heavily filled wasteland is kinda oximorinc. It's great for what it is now. and I can say for my money equalling now $1 for every hour I've played. I'd say yes totally worth it, also knowing that where I left off in the game it's whats known as the half way point. Holy ♥♥♥♥ I can't wait. Hell I'd pay a subscription to keep a steady flow of this, to find more of america or the world for that matter. GG guys thank you for making this!			"

												Full disclosure: I backed the Kickstarter and I've played during the beta.Wasteland 2 may look a bit iffy on the graphics end and there are some bugs that haven't been fixed yet (although I haven't seen anything gamebreaking yet) but quality can be found in just about everything else.This game is basically made for anyone who was a big fan of the old Fallout games (1 and 2) and possibly the first Wasteland game that came out in 1988. You take the role of four desert rangers who have been tasked with traveling to different areas in Arizona to help people in need in a world where nuclear war has taken place and is now... well, a Wasteland. The world is ridden with radioactivity, punks, fanatics, cyborgs, the list goes on.Wasteland 2 is a roleplaying turn-based strategy game. You have the ability to move about as either a group or split your team members up for tactical advantages. For example, mabye one of your team members is a sniper and you want that person to stay behind and pick off the enemies while your mid to close range characters take the front line. Be careful though since this game has friendly fire.As you start you get to create your four characters in a typical roleplaying game fashion. Place stats, choose skills, names, looks, etc. It can be very tricky to pick the right skills for each character because there are many skills to choose from and you won't be able to pick them all and still be able to use them all effectively since there won't be enough points for you to distribute for such a run. You will quickly notice that there are occasional obstacles that will require a quite high level in whatever skill is needed.One of my favourite aspects of Wasteland 2 is the text that is constantly being displayed in the lower right corner of the screen. Just like in the Fallout games, it details your surroundings, people you meet, objects, etc, just as if it was being told by a very witty game master in a pen-and-paper roleplaying game. Wasteland 2 has lots of black comedy, and I'm a sucker for comedy in games. I generally don't read most flavour text in video games, but in Wasteland 2 I'm willing to make an exception.All in all, I'm glad to see that Wasteland 2 turned out the way it did because it proves that Kickstarter can work as long as you crowdfund the right projects. Anyone who played the older Fallout games or Wasteland 1 will most likely be very happy to play this. I would go as far as to call this the real Fallout 3.GOTY 2014.			"

												I'd like to write a review, but I can't. I've just finished a 50+ hours adventure. For hours I've been staring at digital avatars created after my friends. We fought together, had fun together, some of us even contracted STDs. We want all across what used to be USA to save the world. We've bled and nailed the villains to the cross. We've spread the names of Desert Rangers all around.It was 50+ hours long trail of blood, whisky and laser beams. Now I feel empty. Now I want to go to sleep.GET THIS GAME.

												This is by and far one of the best games I have ever played, and I have played them all: BG 1/2, Icewinds, Fallout 1,2 tactics,  countless other titles I cant even recall at the moment. This is what Fallout 3/4 should have been. CPRG at its finest, great story, immersion in the plot, outright difficult to start. Not a huge amount of story changing decisions but still a good share of them. I have replayed this game twice, and likely will again.			"

												This game has been marketed on a lot of hype that is by large not true at all.Blatant lies about what the game contains and its features start from the trailers you can all see.The promises about destructive environment and infinite diversity of enemies are just blatant laughable lies.What that comes down is one or two small boxes you can shoot per fight, and barely a dozen different kinds of enemies, most of which are really mindbogglingly unimaginative.The more you go into it the more of PR lies you will discover.Game mechanics:Any Party you create will have ALL of the skills available in the game. There is no diversity or difference to parties anyplayer will create.You will get so many xp and levels and skill points that you will be able to cover everything you might need.In addition to that several skills are just superficial skill bloat, where what can be called a unique skill was simply split into several ""different"" ones.Some of those you really dont need at all, some only need a few points invested over the whole game, some are just pointless filler. If your team of seven rangers takes all of them - you will be bale to pump them all to levels more then sufficient for the game.The setting:There is no actual Post Apocalypse at all, its just inane, incoherent circus painted over with superficial PA ""graphikz"" and backgrounds - none of which play any deeper role in anything you will experience. Save one or two locations that are flukes in the overall design. It is true that Wasteland setting is a zany kind of post apocalypse, but that does not have to mean it should be cheap, superficial, incoherent and frankly speaking - stupid.There is no scarcity of anything in the game. In fact the gameworld has more stuff in it then our current civilization has.What you cannot find - you can easily buy -and you can get as much money as you want due to random encounters and other content available.All the factions and groups you encounter in the game are just ordinary everyday types of groups that were just put inside that incoherent circus backgrounds presenting itself as post apocalypse. There is about two exception here too - but those are mistakes and flukes, rather then what should be the norm.Writing:There are two general streams of writing in this game.The first are verbose dialogues and descriptions you can read in the dialogues, text box in the Ui and so on, but they dont really influence the design of quests and stories and events, nor the choices and consequences of the game. That kind of writing is nothing but a background noise to whats actually going on. Unrelated.Then there is the writing as design of the quests, areas, locations, characters and all and any choices and consequences, which is best described as continuous insults to intelligence, common sense and good taste. It is all incredible cheap schlock that most of TV soap operas actually surpass in quality.The game does not have anything else to balance this bad content. It is in fact all there is in the game.The fabled Reactivity:Is a constant stream of horrible inane schlock scripted sequences and events you cannot affect in any way. Here are some of the examples:- Whatever you choose between Ag center and Highpool you will get the same gameworld consequences for it.- Angela gets angry at you for shooting or killing civilians all the time and even leaves the party if you do, but kills some poor innocent trader for a completely nonsense reason - and that doesnt affect anything. And you cannot do anything about it.- Ralphie the idiot is drowning two meters from the dry ground (and he is actually standing in shallow water but they darkened it after i laughed at it). Next to that ""lake"" is a witness who rats on you if you try to help but choose the wrong option, but he never goes to help ""poor"" Ralphie.His Juliet doesnt try to help him but runs away to a completely empty area of the map - because thats where your team will magically arrive. Angie tells you how you must go and save him but if you just leave and dont do anything she doesnt react at all. And if you shoot the idiot yourself neither she or Vargas the telepathic wizard comment on it - but if you try to help and pick the wrong option they both berate you for it. Vargas is apparently stalking you all the time through the radio - only not. (dont ask)But if you do ""save"" Ralphie he and Juliet immediately go to a explosive rigged bicycle for more stupid schlock moments. (designed by the boss himself i hear)- Scotchmo (a companion NPC) attacks you if you try to dig the only unmarked grave in the graveyard, which is where he buried his wife recently.... and thats the only grave without a name or any marks on it. Right? Just so you try to dig it, then kill Scotchmo - then reload because the situation is completely stupid.- The ranger that sells you cheap weapons in the Citadel has a sister who had been ♥♥♥♥♥ because of his debt and now she is in hiding from that ♥♥♥♥♥♥, a stupid single schmuck who is supposed to be scary because they called him Pit Bull.So now the brother who is a ranger in a citadel full of high level rangers (dont ask) - is selling cheap malfunctioning weapons to...get the money...so she can pay not to be kidnapped and ♥♥♥♥♥ again by a single stupid bandit.... while her brother is a ranger in a Ranger Citadel full of high level rangers...(dont ask it hurts the head).- There is a woman in the prison area who is sick and begs you to KILL HER. You cannot do anything about it with any of your skills. Your forced schlock choice is to kill her or to do nothing so she dies. And then nothing happens.- There is a woman in Titans Canyon area that gets her legs blown off in an explosion and she begs you to KILL HER or LEAVE HER ALONE!!! - because thats what people who just got their legs blown off tend to do, right? You cannot do anything about it, your medic and surgeon can just stand there, suffering through the blindingly stupid schlock as you do.The main plot:Is the same unoriginal garbage as it was in original Wasteland. The evil robots want to kill everyone.If you try and play for them - you will just get force killed after a few minutes. Because.When you get to California all that happens is that the game resets and you just go through same stuff you were doing in Arizona.It first forces you into some pointlessly huge and completely empty ""base"" location, where all the high level rangers were killed by some stupid small doggies, and then you cannot leave that location until you go around and kill all the stupid doggies and plug some stupid holes in small walls around by clicking on them - and until you go and visit one of the two remaining rangers DYIIINNGG AARGHH. Of course, you cannot do anything about it with your skills.Then you go around collecting bags of cat liter... fixing radio towers and shooting stupid robots and cyborgs naked, since wearing any armor makes you take much more damage then without - versus energy weapons.The combat:Is a fairly simplified turn based that is as actiony and quick as possible in its mechanics. A few weapons may feel useless but nothing too bad there.Its huge problems come from horrible encounter design that repeats itself through the whole game and relying on enemy HP bloat of gigantic proportions to create a false sense of difficulty. Compared to beta, nothing changed at all except enemies were given three to four times more of health points.  The additional smaller bugs and the laughable armor design only serve to degrade it al even more. Enemies have no Ai whatsoever and its all one looooong repetition of always the same stuff.All locations and maps for combat are drowning in incoherent false cover props. Too much bad stuff to write all of it... out.			"

												Just as a warning, this game starts off extremely frustrating. Ammo management can screw you over in the opening hours and you can easily make some mistakes in skill allotment that further set you back early on if you don't know what you're doing. I probably have 8-10 skill points I've completely wasted just because I wasn't sure exactly sure what to expect, which is sort of a bummer, but it is nice to have some consequences to your decisions.Some boss encounters are also really annoying, and can waste big chunks of unsaved progress. No spoilers or anything, but more than once I've just randomly had someone who I thought was a friend turn on me in the middle of a conversation and lay waste to my unprepared guys. Some auto-saves before these points would really be appreciated.That being said, once you get past the first 3-5 hours ammo is much easier to acquire (buy/loot, safecracking skill is very useful here) and you get much better and more diversified weapons, and the combat really opens up. Additionally, the world is interesting to explore. Great setting, great characters, and a very diverse set of areas/locations to traverse. It isn't afraid to be dark/macabre, which is a nice change of pace from more recent post nuclear war RPGs... The game does feel a little low budget, which is understandable given how it was made, but it's been fine as far as stability. I can't recall any crashes.Overall, a very good game. Frustrating initially, but when you get your hooks in it's a ton of fun. I was not expecting at all to sink this much time into it.			"

												This game would be entirely worth playing if it weren't for all the bugs. You'd think with so many people willing to give their money to someone for an unfinished version of a product, the completed version would at least be playable. Other than the bugs, most notably the complete inability to see in some seemingly random areas, the game is probably a 7/10. It's sad to see such a lack of polish bring this game down.			"

												Wasteland 2 - a game that completly flew under my radar til it was discounted on the last Steamsale. Having played all FallOuts up til New Vegas with the Exception of Tactics I was genuinly interested how this game would work out. That and I'm a huge nerd over CRPGs, still considering Baldur's Gate II the best RPG ever developed. GameplayThe game is played from an Isometric perspective, with a typewriter on the right side describing the locations and subtitles. This game has ALOT of reading, so when you are no fan of that you should take that into consideration. Only a few important characters are voiced and your PCs are  mute all the time (Sadly we can not make our own basic voicelines like in Baldur's Gate, but hey atleast we can use our own portraits). You traverse the locations in realtime while the Worldmap has a water limitation and combat is turnbased. It is pretty much reminscent of FallOut 1&2 before the series became what is today. You travel through Arizona visiting the different locations and working towards your way to uncover a sinister plot.Story Warning: Heavy Spoilers ahead, read at your own risk You create your own Rangersquad, consisting from up to 4 Rangerrookies, with different talents which you will more or less all need in the Wastes. Rangergeneral Vargas then sends you to investigate the murder of one of your fellow Rangers paired with the quest to investiagte strange radiotransmissions coming from behind the great radioation wall to the east. While the games plot starts superstrong, it will degrade over time and if you hit Los Angeles later it will drag on longer than it should (Felt for me like it). As soon as you know who Mathias is and what is behind his ""war"" with Dugal the plot becomes more or less predictable and the end feels a bit unsatisfying. The proverb ""The journey is the reward"" pretty much sums it all up. Also for a game that starts strong in meaningful choices and their consequences it als degrades in that regard. There is no evil playthrough possibility and if you try to side with Mathias he will blow you up with a nuke. (I refer to FallOut here where the Master was more than happy to add you to his army) So you are pretty much forced into a Good-Guy-Role.It was not a bad plot, but it started way stronger than it finishedGrafics, Sound& MusicThe game was made in the Unity-Engine and is certainly not the prettiest one, but it does the job and all locations are unique and memorable. The sounddesign is well done and paired with the games music it can feel downright creepy at times, the perfect feeling for a post-apocalyptic game.All in All if you liked the old Fallout-titles or you are intrested in CRPGs Wasteland 2 is definatly worth a look, even if it can feel downright clunky sometimes yet it was modernized in the right way and I will definatly see forward to a 3rd installment			"

								Let me put it this way: it took 62 hours of playing before I decided to take a break from it, and I haven't had it but a couple of months. If you like old school turn based rpg stategy, such as Falloout 1 & 2, old X-Com, Jagged Alliance series, Balders Gate, Planescape: Torment (and somebody needs to gtf on with rebooting Torment, that game was !@#$ing GREAT!), you're going to want this in your collection. The story thus far is pretty damn good, in my opinion, voice acting is well done too. I think it looks great graphically, and I run a mid range gaming comp. Buy it now and help them make it great, or buy it on release, but get it. Seriously. Just understand it's a beta build and treat it as such and you will enjoy it if you like this kind of game, the bugs are not that bad, except for a couple I'll note below. .The random encounter battles as you travel on the world map are a little small in area, which makes combat down and dirty and  fast, if you're playing anything but Rookie difficulty. That can be a pro or con, depending on what you like and your play style. Feels cramped to me on the majority random encounter maps. It takes away from the strategy aspect when you're pretty much at point blank range in most of your battles, which are pretty lethal to begin with. BUT, they are still fun and it's extremely satisfying when you win by the skin of your teeth. The big battles are hella fun!Not so much a con and probably a bug, but DO NOT dismiss characters on the world map. At least not Angela, if you have her. I did and unless she's supposed to be gone, she's still out in the Wasteland where I left her. Hope I left her some water, I tkink it was close to a water source, or her and Ace are gonna be meeting again real soon....she's not in the Ranger Citadel either. If you take that kid you save from drowning into your party, and go back to the Citadel, leave him at the entrance or don't let him be with you when you go in, a conversation fires off between him and another member of your party when you go near the museum and you'll be stuck there, in the conversation, with no choice for a response and no other choice but to reload, and that's the only game breaking bug I've found so far. The UI could use some tweeking, status effects are hard to determine visually on quick glance; I had already played many many hours before I noticed the tiny consussion icon above the character portrait for the first time. Other than those issues and some very minor stability issues that are probably more related to my rig than the game itself, any other bug I've come across, hasn't been anything major. I emphatically recommend this game, it has the potential to be one of the best titles of it's kind in a very, very long time.			"

												I've just finished this game after more than one hundred hours on it and it's one of the best RPG I've ever played for different reasons.The main reason is that, as a player, you have to make choices. Some of these choices are not easy and, more than that, they have consequences ! Another reason I liked this game is its humor : not for all audience, for sure, but I loved it...In short, a great game which considers the player as a mature person. It's so uncommon these days... That's why it's so refreshing.Vincent - Palaiseau - France.-------Je viens juste de terminer ce jeu après une centaine d'heure passées dessus et c'est l'un des meilleurs jeu de rôle auquel j'ai jamais joué. La principale raison est que, en tant que joueur, vous devez faire des choix. Certains de ces choix ne sont pas faciles à faire et en plus de cela, ils ont des conséquences ! Une autre raison pour laquelle j'aime ce jeu est son humour : ce n'est pas le genre d'humour que tout le monde apprécie, c'est certain, mais moi j'adore.En bref, un grand jeu qui considère le joueur comme un adulte. C'est tellement inhabituel par les temps qui courent... C'est pourquoi c'est si rafraichissant.Vincent - Palaiseau - France.			"

												This game is great, but before you buy it be sure you understand its a turn based game If that doesn't bother you or sounds appealing to you this game is for you otherwise put your wallet away and move on. the full release came and went and i'm still enjoying this game. Most if not all the bugs i noticed from the early access are gone and a few things have been tweeked to improve the gameplay. Overall the game is great in my opinion and the gameplay itself is excellent.			"

								I am so happy this game exists. It really does its best to return the game industry to what I personally consider the golden age of video gaming. Icewind Dale, Fallout, Baldurs Gate, Wasteland... So, so happy they did this! I need MOAR Brian Fargo!			"

Early Access Review
								 Ok so I really want this to be a winner in the long run. It is so damn buggy it's stopped me playing. I only hope my $60 will go towards cleaning up the end product and make it all worth while. I mean the story is great as I'd expect. The concept solid as ♥♥♥♥ but the combat is just ok. Skills are questionable. This is after just a few hours playing the game. I think the first 1 or 2 were spent wandering aimlessly in the waste as I had no concept of how to change camera angle let alone WTF the water gague was and how to refill it. So I finally find an oasis... I AM, FROM 1988, A FAN OF WASTELAND! ON THE APPLE II NO LESS AND I AM NOT HAPPY. Get it together guys, I know it's beta but $60? I can't even get it to full screen on windows 7. I love the story, the puzzels are great, the combat is ok but the skills and stats etc?? Did the first 3 missions which were kind of fun. The patchy loading is really annoying as is the lack of a full screen view. By highpool mission I'm a more than annoyed. I really hope the completed game is less patchy, has better graphics, more dynamic feeling turn based combat and is more imersive then just getting a portrate box with text and voice over. Maybe just some facial movement ie their lips move when they speak, expressions??  So yes I do recommend this game, if anything to give the developers more cash to polish the end product. If this is pretty close to the finished article there are going to be many dissapointed fans of the original. At least I can play the original if I have the time to indulge in nostaligia... for the price not really worth it. In the long haul if the game get's a serious overhaul and some much needed improvements then I will be a happy camper. If not, well that is $60 I wasted. If your a fan of the original, can overcome some serious glitches and bugs and annoying status effects that appear to have no cure (the plant infection WTF, even if it only last until the relevant section of the game is completed I think) confusion (expected from any beta) and a hefty price tag well this is for you. I look at it as a donation towards a fantastic end product. DO NOT DISAPPOINT ME PLEASE!!! "

												There's something about Wasteland 2 which just does not click with me. I grew up with Fallout and Fallout 2 so RPGs of this style aren't anything new to me. But, Wasteland 2's story, characters and world just seem incredibly mediocre. There was no pull for me. Combat was semi-interesting but otherwise not too involving beyond positioning properly and utilizing each of your Ranger's skills with the appropriate weapon at hand.The game is hideous. There's no other way of putting it. Fallout 1 & 2 look better than this muddy depressing mess. There's post-apocalpytic style but then there's just plain ugly. The conversation system was fairly well done however with your given list of topics as well as 3 different kinds of conversation skills to gather more information or influence an NPC beyond just the standard way. This just seems like more of a proof of concept rather than a proper finished RPG in the way of past RPGs. I didn't have a single feeling of ""what's around the corner? what interesting quests am I going to run into in the next area? Who am I going to meet and what kind of conversations am I going to engage in?"" throughout the handful of hours I put into it. A feeling which is prevalent in Fallout 1 & 2 which I still play to this day. I stopped because I simply was not having fun.			"

												There should be a word that combines grind and slog so I can use it to describe Wasteland 2. In the before time, there was gaming, and whatever it was, we don't remember it now because in the intervening decade and some, we grew up and so did gaming. We learned that telling tales of ""how hard game x was"" to be far more entertaining than actually doing it. We learned how to design levels and create meaningful narratives and games that were fun to play, not just fun to have played. Oh, and we learned how to find voice actors. Wasteland 2 is probably faithful to its spiritual predecessor. I wouldn't know, because I wouldn't play that now either. The bones of a decent tactical rpg are there, but the level designs don't reward you for making use of them. Similarly, the bones of a good story rpg are there, but the disconcordant voices muddy the experience. Much like, ""an arrow to the knee"" cried out for a mod to stop, Wasteland 2 needs some serious fan love to be worth playing. Until the need to wander around the desert, grinding out raider encounters to level up is gone, I suggest you give this a pass and stick to New Vegas.			"

												This game is not good. It's one of the worst modern RPGs I've played.  The graphics are bad and the art design is uninspired. Many of the environments are hideously repititious. The camera controls poorly. The RPG aspects consist of ensuring skill points are dumped into a couple of specialties in order to pass checks in conversation dialogue and opening locked boxes.In combat your options range from: Shooting, Crouching to Shoot, and Reloading. You can also hide behind arbitarily designated cover positions. If you've played XCom or Divinity: Original Sin you know this style of Turn-Based combat, and what you'll find here pales in comparison. The AI of the enemies is basically nonexistent. They will run at you and shoot you or they will run at you and stab/bludgeon you. Upping the difficulty seems to only increase the Bullet Sponginess of your foes.  Since you have extremely limited tactical options there's basically no point in playing on anything beyond normal unless you enjoy reloading quicksaves.Combat initiation is wonky. You can attempt to arrange your characters behind cover beforehand, but this process is extremely janky and you'll probably inadvertently trigger combat before you intended to.There are no real characters. There's a Native American companion who has a bow and is really good at sharpshooting. She talks a lot in ham-fisted stereotypical fashion. Oh and she also has a skill that allows her to Tame Wild Animals.  There's a gruff commander. He is gruff and old. There is a ranger who is sad that another ranger died. The entire thing feels completely perfunctory.  I got about four hours into the game and had yet to decipher what the game was supposed to be about beyond meandering from fetch quest to fetch quest.One storyline involves doing a bunch of quests for some townsfolk. One guy's house is on fire. One guy's dog is missing. The waterpumps aren't working.  If you help the people in these quests, the townsfolk will elect a good mayor. You know she's good because she's nice to you. If you don't do the quests the townsfolk elect a bad mayor. You know he's bad because he's mean to you. There are virtually no consequences in either result. If you enjoy this kind of compelling, interactive storytelling this game is for you. "

												Notice: My review states that I do not recommend this game because of inXile Entertainment's exceptionally scummy behavior during the ""inXile vs The Alien Wasteland"" incident (Google it for more details - basically, inXile used copyright laws in a frivolous way to bully a small indie developer). If you are in any way conscious about the future of game development, I implore you not to buy the game or any of the other Wasteland games. (If you are desperately looking for a post-apoc RPG, have a look at Underrail!)To other reviewers: due to a Steam glitch, you have to review Wasteland 2 DC by posting a review to regular Wasteland 2. That also means you have to install and play that for at least 5 minutes too if you haven't already. (This is why it seems like I've only played a couple minutes - my real playtime is ~50 hours right now.)For the sake of honesty, I am also going to write up a brief summary of the good and the bad points of the game itself. Wasteland 2: Director's Cut is a post-apocalyptic RPG about an American militia organization named the Desert Rangers who try to uphold law and order in Arizona after a global nuclear apocalypse, as well as the events of the first game (which, as explained very soon in the game as well, involved stopping a crazy scientist and a malevolent AI). You lead a party of four (or less) Rangers on a mission to find out about the circumstances of the death of another Ranger. This party can later gain up to three additional followers, up to a squad size of seven. These followers (of which there are plenty, so you'll have to make choices as to who you carry along) have the slight drawback that they can ""go rogue"", i.e. ignore your orders and do their own thing each turn (this can be mitigated), but are otherwise perfectly functional player characters.Sounds like a lot to manage? It's not as bad as it sounds. The character attribute/skill system is simple enough, though it can feel overwhelming on a first playthrough. However, W2 DC does provide a default squad - you can roll with it on the normal (""Seasoned"") difficulty level on a first playthrough and do alright (at least I did). The tutorial system is adequate and explores the various elements of the game well enough that you probably won't feel lost after the first 15-30 minutes. Combat may seem a bit punishing at first, but if you explore enough, the game rewards you pretty soon with a ""crutch"" follower, who is quite a bit stronger than your characters at that point and will help you get through the first few areas. (Though I also have a minor quibble here: this very same follower will eventually leave you, so if you thought they were a solid fixture on your team and rely on them for a critical skill, you may suddenly be left with a gaping hole in your team after they leave. You are subtly warned that they might only stay while your team are still greenhorns, but the warning is too subtle in my opinion. Most other followers do stick around once they join you, though, unless you make a choice that pisses them off big time.)Speaking of choices, this game does have its fair share of ""choices and consequences"". Like most games that advertise this, this game does not deviate too much from its major storyline either, and the choices only have flavor effects or some minor gameplay effects at most. This does not mean the C&C system in the game is necessarily bad - I'm just telling you what to expect. Your choices do shape the world, even if not all of them have a significant effect on when and how you win the game. In keeping with the gritty theme, often you are forced to choose between two bad outcomes or may not be able to  stop a certain kind of evil at all no matter what you do, but at other times you can help the wasteland become a better place.The various factions in the game are interesting, many of them are well-developed and have engaging characters. Unfortunately, the main plot is a bit too railroaded for my taste - the game is designed with the assumption that you are going to be a Desert Ranger through and through, identifying with them without question and opposing the main boss. There are some interesting nuances to the ideology of the main antagonists, but the game does not explore them sufficiently. There are alternate endings where you do not do what the Rangers expect you to do, but they are unsatisfying to say the least. The side quests are actually more interesting than the main plot IMO.Regarding game balance, the game is balanced well enough that you can do a first playthrough on Seasoned (the default, normal difficulty level) with just the right amount of challenge, not too much frustration, but not too easy either. I think you might conceivably be able try a blind ironman first run as well, if you are so inclined - though I'd probably recommend  Rookie for that. The game is not a roguelike though, and it isn't designed for endless replayability - I think that there are about 2-3 playthroughs' worth of material in the game (provided you like it enough to replay it), and no more, so I'd advise against blind ironman play. One positive I'd like to note is that unlike quite a few CRPGs I've ever seen (the worst violator being Age of Decadence), this game - at least on normal difficulty - does not need extreme minmaxing to succeed, and you *can* start with suboptimal builds and still perform well enough. You can even branch out into a lot of non-combat skills and still be strong enough to be able to fight, and the game is forgiving enough that you can make drastic changes to your skill focuses over the course of 5-10 levels if you take your team in the wrong direction (my characters were around level 40 by the time they completed the game). For example, if you realize you desperately need the Lockpicking skill and forgot to take it on any of your characters, well, you'll be missing some containers for a while, but you aren't hopelessly behind and will probably still be able to max it out if you aren't too late into the game.The interface and user-friendly aspects are generally good - there aren't a lot of really inconvenient/frustrating functionalities I've found, carry weights are not a huge issue, useless junk items that have no use other than sell value can be sold with a single click all at once... not much bad I can say here.If you care about that sort of thing, the game is also LGBTQ-positive. Well, I haven't seen any T, but they might exist without you realizing it, y'know? There are quite a few openly gay characters though (mostly minor, but a particular married lesbian couple will help you out in the final battle if you help them out before). I've also found at least one crossdresser (in a town which is famous for its extreme sexual libertinism, to the point of being ruled over by a sex worker - and they are actually one of the nicer communities in the game, certainly compared to their main rivals) and hey, the game does technically allow you to have gay sex, though nothing is shown on screen - so if you're looking for smut, don't get your hopes up.As a minor bonus, you can dress up your character in one of many different outfits found throughout the game world - this'll affect the appearance of your toons in the game world and on the character screen (though it's only cosmetic), and since any worn armor doesn't actually appear on you, this functionality isn't made obsolete as soon as you want to put some armor on. You can put really indecent clothes on your females, or have your men walk around in a pair of hold-up stockings, or even dress them up in a way that's actually intimidating and/or practical (but why'd you want to do that?!). It's a fun little minigame you can entertain yourself with while you are shuffling your inventory around.Overall verdict: avoid, for reasons stated in the very beginning. If you do not care about punishing dodgy business practices, then I'll let you judge based on the rest of the review.			"

												A brilliant game from Brian Fargo and inExile. This guy knows how to make a good post-apocalyptic role-playing game, as evidenced by the first two Fallout games, and this one is no exception.This game has been getting a lot of negative reviews and I felt that I needed to post this review to help counter that. Although what inExile are doing regarding the copyright infringment case over the 'Wastland' name is bad, I feel that leaving bad reviews on an otherwise good game is like leaving a bad review on an Amazon item because the shipping was slow.

												Damn it.This is such a strange game for me because I want to love it....but...  it just feels ...old and dated...but intentionally. Instead of making a modern game that followed the core design principles of the of late 90s RPGs... they made a game that looks and feels 15 years old....with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ interface and terrible graphics. With that said it's not a bad game, there is a lot here to like, especially if you long for more complex mechanics.... But it does feel like a real missed opportunity.

Im sure this will appeal to many people though who enjoyed the initial fallout series or original Wasteland .Keep expectations reasonable and it may provide days of fun .I continue to come back to this game every couple of months in hopes that it will grab my attention and make me want to continue it to the end .

												Isometric RPG's are back and as good as ever! If you ever played and enjoyed the original Fallout games, or even the Baldurs Gate series, you absolutely owe it to yourself to try Wasteland 2. Successor to the original Wasteland, and spiritual Successor to Fallout 1&2, Wasteland 2 delivers a fantastic story, great voice acting, a compelling setting and the brilliant isometric RPG gameplay you'd expect from the old classics.My only real criticism is the poor graphics. They're not terrible, and I can understand that they didn't exactly have the AAA title budget, but they're just not up to the stellar standards set by the rest of the game.Overall I would highly recommend this game to any fan of the old school RPGs, as well as gamers looking to find out what all the fuss was about. Welcome back, Brian Fargo, Chris Avellone and everyone else involved in making this amazing game. You've been misssed!			"

												Interesting, fun game, much in the spirit of the Baldur's Gate games and the original Wasteland. Old-school, pretty long and reasonably hard, with focus more on gameplay than on graphics. Plenty of choices, lots of possible ways to outfit your party, no ""right choice"". You can play as you like, and are actually encouraged to do so. You may very well be locked out from several parts of the game through your choices, but that tends to happen anyway, whichever choice you make. If you really want to see everything the game has to offer, you have to play multiple times, and fortunately the game makes that a viable option as different playthroughs will feel differently.So I recommend this game on its gameplay merits, but I have to warn new players for the fact that the game, at the moment of this writing, still seems to be in the beta phase. While it has officially been released a month ago, there are plenty of quests in the late game that may still get into an unresolvable state -- this is a consequence of the fact that the player may go anywhere he likes, and thus may get into areas that are quest-related without having got the quest in the first place. There are also quite a few bugs left which may cause a forced reload. So my recommendation is: if the style of game appeals to you, get it (preferably in some kind of sale), but wait with playing until the bugs are ironed out. It looks like the game will get a major update soon, considering that Steam has made it clear that achievements will be added.			"

There are some glitches and bugs here and there and some of them are very frustrating (i.e. you can loose a character forever). Combats are fun. Turn-based with system of covers. Only thing lacks is aiming system like in fallouts. Story is great with some twists and turns and giving you lot of choises to make. Completed the game in one breath.

												[This review is NOT for Director's Cut, it is for Standard Edition - Director's cut only adds to this]If you like post-apoc games, this might be for you - especially the very patient, more old-skool users who have LOTS of time on their hands...No really, I mean lots of time, sometimes, a bit too much honestly.  In-case you don't get it PATIENCE MUST BE ONE OF YOUR VIRTUES, otherwise completing this game WONT be.Load times are quick [1-6 seconds on SSDs], gfx are okay (for this year, could be better...) sound is appropriate including periodic voiceovers that are well done and music that is quite fitting and will make FO 1&2 players feel right at home (Mark Morgan).  Good job getting the Fallout music man to come back.Went through and got the repeaters, and then had to go to the Ag center, to do the next mission, and the whole while I'm doing this, another outpost is claiming it's getting clobbered, and now I'm poisoned, and don't have a clue what to do.  You feel a bit helpless, and at fault, and not entirely in a good way, but that may have been just me.  There is entirely too much going on at once and I'm unable to concentrate on this mission enough to solve it, while still having to go to another place after this is done.   First hour or two went pretty smoothly, hours three and four I'm out of ammo, there's entirely too much ammo management for me to put any more effort into it so in most of the battles half my guys were without ammo and getting massacred by rabbits on easy (well almost).May want to invest in some unarmed skills at some point, just keep in mind to save enough skill points to get your gun skills up too or you won't hit ANYTHING.Will eagerly be waiting for Fallout 4 as this definitely is not Fallout... not 1 not 2 not any of them.  Too much inventory juggling - that was the icing on the cake and I'd have rather eaten the plate whilst I tried to figure out what to do!  A shared inventory screen would have been a wonderful invention with individual character inventories being limited to slots guns, armor, trinkets, etc.Pass this one up until you've exhausted the fallout series as of late.  It can be a good game, but you will struggle to afford enough ammo unless you loot everything and take every last bit of junk you can scrounge.  There is a barter perk but it brings at most 10% discount/10% bonus on bought/sold items.  It's not that this game is bad, it can be very unforgiving and hard to keep your guns loaded let alone hit the target until your gun skill is maxed.For those playing on a RADEON video card, I can attest that there isn't much gfx issue at all sans the water-building interior in Domonta - a little bit of flickering, but can still play fine.  You're only in there for the duration of one battle anyways so regardless, it won't be too much issue.  I have updated my review a bit, after playing 30+ hours (it is a long game, I'd say im half-way through it), and it feels like a touch of fallout tactics along with fallout 2.  I'd have to say that players who enjoyed the late-90s playthrough of Fallout 1 and 2 will feel at home here in the setting - all the way down to accidently nuking some religious cult - oops... heh.  Though I will say you can with assuredness tell that this is the first-go-round for some of the people creating the game, it is NOT shoddy work by any means.  There is much fun to be had here, and much humour to snicker at if you have the patience.   This isn't DooM, this isn't run-and-gun and blast through everything with reckless abandon...this is it's own game.  A 25-40$ USD price-tag seems appropriate here, and I think most people would be satisfied with the game for this.  That being said, it isn't nearly as crashey as Fallout 3 and New Vegas were out of the box (or possibly even now years after release), so don't let me sell it short.  Watch some videos, read the reviews and decide for yourself.  Try not to get discouraged before getting to level 15-20 or so with your characters, as it gets much more rewarding when you can actually afford ammo AND hit the target in battle.  I would also mention on this last note that the age-rating for this game applies to both the violence and the difficulty mentally that you may have if you lack extremely good problem solving skills (teenagers barring some ingeniously crafty ones may have trouble).  Good luck.Recommended to take a field medic-surgeon, weaponsmith, locksmith/safecracker, and someone with keen perception and good with knocking down obstacles with you on your first try, you'll get more characters in your party at a later date if you so choose.  You still won't be able to do everything your first time.  This game for most will be good for more than one play-through.Just buy up all the ammo & health-items you can afford, seriously.			"

												Interesting, fun game, much in the spirit of the Baldur's Gate games and the original Wasteland. Old-school, pretty long and reasonably hard, with focus more on gameplay than on graphics. Plenty of choices, lots of possible ways to outfit your party, no ""right choice"". You can play as you like, and are actually encouraged to do so. You may very well be locked out from several parts of the game through your choices, but that tends to happen anyway, whichever choice you make. If you really want to see everything the game has to offer, you have to play multiple times, and fortunately the game makes that a viable option as different playthroughs will feel differently.So I recommend this game on its gameplay merits, but I have to warn new players for the fact that the game, at the moment of this writing, still seems to be in the beta phase. While it has officially been released a month ago, there are plenty of quests in the late game that may still get into an unresolvable state -- this is a consequence of the fact that the player may go anywhere he likes, and thus may get into areas that are quest-related without having got the quest in the first place. There are also quite a few bugs left which may cause a forced reload. So my recommendation is: if the style of game appeals to you, get it (preferably in some kind of sale), but wait with playing until the bugs are ironed out. It looks like the game will get a major update soon, considering that Steam has made it clear that achievements will be added.			"

												I recommend this game with some very strong reservations.I downloaded and played this game during the free play period.  The game is definitely dated - they don't make games like this anymore.  This is both a good thing and a bad thing.  The game had a good story (from what I could see) with consequences for taking action in one direction over another.  None of this modern “follow the yellow brick road and if you die you pick up where you left off,” and “don't forget to mash the buttons in the correct order” crap.  This game will punish you for making poor decisions.  Don't invest in certain talents?  You will fail missions.The game also chooses to use an isometric design for how you view the world.  This makes it awkward to control the camera, and often times puts you in positions where your character can see further than you can because of the angle of the camera changes as you zoom in or zoom out.  It made controlling the characters difficult at times.Like many others who wrote reviews, I played the game and sought to purchase the game while it was on sale, only to be notified that I already owned the game.  Now that the free play is over, so is the sale price.  I guess that means that it is time to wait until it is on sale again.			"

												Freaking RIDICULOUSLY good...so far.  My biggest gauge of a game is how obvious it is that the devs gave it the love it needed.  W2 got enough love.  It's immersive, comprehensive, engaging, its world is deeply responsive, and it's as funny and cheezy as needed.  The expected micromanagement side of things took some getting used to, but it's not too much and it's solidly designed so you can get some good speed going with the interface once you get used to it.As far as criticism, the only things I've noticed so far after 100 hrs are minor.  For ex. when your level for a skill is below the minimum for a task, it'd be nice if it told you how many points you're under the minimum instead of just ""this is impossible"" (which makes me think it's actually impossible regardless of level).  I've only got a handful of other minor beefs (like dialog sometimes being stale vs a situation).  The biggest beef I've seen so far is that in some situations it's not obvious from what you're given what to do next.  In every case of that, peeking at hints online make me go ""ohhh you dumbass"".  It's still minor.  For a game this mechanically complex, that's a freaking huge success.Great work inXile, keep em' comin'.			"

												Isometric RPG's are back and as good as ever! If you ever played and enjoyed the original Fallout games, or even the Baldurs Gate series, you absolutely owe it to yourself to try Wasteland 2. Successor to the original Wasteland, and spiritual Successor to Fallout 1&2, Wasteland 2 delivers a fantastic story, great voice acting, a compelling setting and the brilliant isometric RPG gameplay you'd expect from the old classics.My only real criticism is the poor graphics. They're not terrible, and I can understand that they didn't exactly have the AAA title budget, but they're just not up to the stellar standards set by the rest of the game.Overall I would highly recommend this game to any fan of the old school RPGs, as well as gamers looking to find out what all the fuss was about. Welcome back, Brian Fargo, Chris Avellone and everyone else involved in making this amazing game. You've been misssed!			"

												Amazing game with great post-apocalyptic atmosphere. It's hard to play some times, but game is forgiving if you made wrong characters or spoiled them. There are some glitches and bugs here and there and some of them are very frustrating (i.e. you can loose a character forever). Combats are fun. Turn-based with system of covers. Only thing lacks is aiming system like in fallouts. Story is great with some twists and turns and giving you lot of choises to make. Completed the game in one breath. To all who played Fallout 1 & 2 I strongly recommend ti play Wasteland 2			"

As an RPG it reminds me of Baldurs Gate (sacriligiously i never played the early fallouts). But, all good on that front. Character creation is a bit unforgiving for first timers.

												A very compelling, classic, post-nuclear RPG with highly satisfying turn based combat in between. Wasteland 2 got a pretty cool flair to it, rough and sometimes weird characters. Lots of text, which you actually have to pay attention to - really nice to have something like that amidst the dozens of games requiring nothing of you but to look at the minimap and the HUD telling you to what to kill and how many of them. Pretty good integrated tutorial function, which holds your hand if you want to but you can also just go ahead and figure out most of the mechanics by yourself. Either way works. Skill system is deep enough but not overly complex and the story kept me hooked most of the time. The only thing that is not quite favorable are the graphics - and that is coming from someone who usually doesn't give a rat's ♥♥♥ about the looks of a game. And I'm not talking about polygons or explosion effects. It just seems a little bit too blurry in some scenes, the colouring is very desaturated and without a lot of contrast, sometimes making it hard to spot certain things like crates or objects related to quests.Other than that, if you like the style of games like XCOM, the Fallout series, maybe even S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (even though that's an FPS) you might just dig Wasteland 2.			"

												Ok, so to start off, this review is the very first I have ever written.  So if it's wack and unorganized, please forgive me. Also I couldn't log more than (I think 7 hrs). I got it during the free weekend offer, but didn't really play it until much later.Now on to the review/thoughts.I have never played any top down (Isometric(?)) Rpg's, EVER. This is also the only reason I've never played Fallout 1, 2, and tactics. The top down view wasn't really the thing I thought of when it came to an rpg, and I never really thought they would be enjoyable, that is until Wasteland 2. This game is so F****** awesome!!!I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this game. The lore, the story, the characters, the setting, and how it was paced. The Mission in the beginning with the two towns was nerve wrecking. I kept trying to save the other as fast as possible but never succeeded. So when the game says your choices cause ripples that change everything, it wasn't joking.  Honestly, I don't know what else to say. I really enjoyed the game, and after this I'm going to buy it when I can. As well as, check out underrail, and the older Fallouts. If you like Post-apocalyptic settings but not too big on the top down perspective, I suggest trying out Wasteland 2. You may be suprised at how much you'll enjoy it. 10/10 would buy on sale - because I'm broke :D "

												Simply put, this is the best isometric Post-Apocalyptic RPG ever, and I daresay it holds its own against 1st person PA RPGs as well. It's very faithful to the first Wasteland, and plays like a very highly polished version of Fallout Tactics with the intricate storylines of Fallout 1 and 2. I will be playing and re-playing this for years to come.			"

												To be honest with you, the moment the character creation screen pops up I thought I was in for a huge disappointment. The whole design is just ugly as hell. You try to customize a character to your liking but they all look like sewer vagabonds. The combat is simplistic for a turn based game and weapons are not consistent to their values. But I got over this problem quickly once I discovered the perfect party setup for every battle. NPC character portrait is an immersion killer because it feels like they're only using a dozen portraits to cover all the NPCs in the game! It would have been better if they just skipped with the portraits for minor characters. I mean how can the most important character in Hollywood have the same portrait as half of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the game?In the end, my patience prevailed though as I found myself engaged to the story till the end. There are no easy routes for the big quests and finishing them feels like an achievement. The whole Wasteland itself is quite vast and there is plenty to do in every location.So I guess overall this game has a lot of technical and design flaws but if you can get past these problems, you'll find an engrossing story and gameplay.I give this game 7.5/10Director's Cut: Even with all the flaws, this game was still the most fun I've had playing RPG in a long time, and now with the update, almost every aspect of it has been improved. Most importantly is the visual presentation. This game now looks 3 times graphically better. There are new cinematic sequences too which added to the already rich environment. Wasteland 2 is now very near the total package. I say very near because the combat I feel is still a notch below other turn based games like X-Com. With that in mind, this game in its final form is a 9/10.			"

												A truly bad-♥♥♥ game, the old Fallout sort of bad-♥♥♥ (supposedly the same as in the first Wasteland, haven't played it, I know, shame on me). Very sarcastic/ironic/sardonic. The storyline itself is pretty straightforward but engaging. Not a very 'free' game, but enough to let you feel guided instead of restrained. The best parts: the atmosphere, and the arsenal (yes, it is pretty much combat-oriented).			"

												This game is awesome. It's challenging, complex, rich, funny, and detailed. If you keep the game in zoomed out isometric mode the graphics are immersive and vibrant. There's a lot of blood. The sound effects are fantastic. If you liked the BGs, IWDs, Fallouts 1 & 2, and so on, this is the game for you. Easily the best CRPG experience I have had in absolute ages. Blows trash like Dragon Age out of the water. I stayed up until 6am last night playing. Haven't done that since BG2. Only criticisms: The NPCs are a little thin. Combat could be more dynamic.			"

Early Access Review
								If you like tactical games, post-apocalyptic worlds, guns, critical thinking, even if you enjoy dungeons and dragons; then I suggest you try Wasteland 2. If you like the world of Fallout, you'll love the world of Wasteland. Not to go into too much, but its from the same developers of the original Fallout games, joined by some of the creators of the newer versions of Fallout. As of now, the game is still in beta but is scheduled for release soon, and yes, I'll admit, the price is a bit steep for now, but I'd suggest it once it releases, and the price drops. You get a few added things if you buy the DDE, but that's for you to decide if its worth it. The game itself is interesting. There's a lot of reading, remembering key words, critical thinking (should I send my team in fighting? Or should I try a more diplomatic approach?) and storytelling. Quests and advancement is a little lackluster, but not bad, and every choice has a consequence. Graphics are decent, sound and music are stellar, and some of the game (easter eggs, dialogue, and random loot) are a little corny, but not bad. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys any kind of Role-Playing game.			"

Early Access Review
								I purchased Wasteland 2 many months ago. At that stage it was the seed of a brilliant game, but a seed that clearly implied the tree it would become. Wasteland 2 is for me the evolution from the original Fallout I had hoped for, even as the subsequent Fallout games were wonderful surprises. Having dipped my toe in again recently, far closer to the ""finished"" product (what really is ""finished"" these days?), it's staggering and heartening to see the attention this game has received from its developers... not just attention, but passion, polish, depth, style and love. When ""final"" release hits, I fully intend to drop everything I happen to be doing, even if it causes a kitchen fire or a traffic accident.			"

Would have been a lot easier if I knew this before, I had a dog runnign with me many hours and many missions where I tried to keep it alive all the time ... and it was only planned to bring him back in the same town where I found him ^^ "

												Took 90 hours to beat but this is a case for an RPG to have been better off having less content than offered. Besides that this is a great return to old-school fallout 1/2 type games with great writing in some parts and memorable characters. Combat is meh but it can be imporved upon as well as character customization. The ending kinda just happens even when you clearly see the end in sight because the last few hours is a linear gauntlet so hard to the point where I had to finish the final battle on rookie difficulty. Overall Wasteland 2 is by far an enjoyable experience with dozens of stories to tell each time you replay the game and I gladly await the game of the year edition update and wasteland 3 (although Fallout 4 hype is still ♥♥♥♥ing strong here).Graphics: 7/10Gameplay: 7/10Writing: 8.5/10Story: 6/10Replayability: 8/10 "

												Never played a CRPG before unless KOTOR can be counted.  Picked this up after listening to TotalBiscuit describe some of his first impressions of the game and couldn't be more happy with it.  This game is really well written and I find myself looking forward to reading everything in the game from the main story dialog to the random junk flavor text.  Can definitely see how the styles and themes inspired the Fallout series and am looking forward to completing this game so I can start on the first Wasteland game.			"

												Not a Fallout. Not even really an rpg unless you consider a billion of supersimple fetch quests to be hardcore roleplaying. (you can complete most of them without actually going and actively fetching ♥♥♥♥) This doesn't stop game from having stellar wirting and great atmosphere though, they really put a lot of work into descriptions, world building and dialogs (as simple as they mechanically are). This is probably the most text heavy game I played in a while.Gameplaywise this game is more in tune with Xcom:Eu (combat system is nearly completely lifted from there) or Silent Storm Sentinels or hell, even Jaggged alliance 2 - combat and squad based tactics are the real meat of the game It's definitely not the deepest game in the genre, but it manages to be entertaining for the most part of it. (I do wish weapon balance and variation were much better though)Overall I'd say the game is a really rough gem with a lot of flaws but it had just enough redeeming features to keep me interested.P.S. Don't invest in charisma or luck. They do nothing.			"

Early Access Review
								The fact that this game was made at all fills a corner of my heart with great joy -- Games like these (turn based rpgs) of good quality are often far-between, and I have no regrets playing this one. Very true to the wasteland of old, part of what I love is how you don't need to have played the ancient classic, but if you have it breathes life into many facets of the story. the gritty feel is spot on, and the skill system and character building is intriguing -- though perhaps not as fun as fallout series. It is interesting to note that Wasteland is THE game that inspired so much that came after it in the post-apoc rpg genre... so it is interesting that when it's sequel finally arrives, some of it's successors have already pushed the horizon beyond what it appears (thus far -- haven't finished yet) wasteland 2 will be able to take us. The ""robots rising from the ashes of the past to take back the earth"" premise has been done so many times since wasteland 1 -- at least twice in the fallout series alone, I'm kind of sad that wasteland 2's synthetics seem to be shaping up to be more of the usual as well... still, I can't write out the idea that this is a red herring as of the time of this review, but lets just say I'd be slightly sad if it's not. Wasteland 1 was revolutionary in almost every respect -- for Wasteland 2 to rise from the ashes, like the numerous armies of robots of whch I've spoke, only to not deliver something new would be unfortunate. Otherwise, great game -- solid RPG, great story, great mechanics, great atmosphere/world... nuff said.			"

												Welcome to the glorious wastes of Arizona with nothing but old school RPG turn based combat and a plethora of cross roads to travel. This was a game I had been watching from the early beta days but decided against diving straight in and waiting for the ""final"" version of the game to come out. On that note before continuing, I use the term ""final"" very loosely.The first half of the game is fantastic. Hands down one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a while. Refreshing real choices with actual consequences. Multiple choices and decisions to be made at every corner ranging from simple attire, to devastating lesser of two evil choices that affect the rest of the game and years to come following. Great character creation allowing role-players to enjoy a world the can fully immerse themselves in. This and so much more awaits you.On the opposite side of the review this game is not without short comings and issues. The second half of the game is anything but complete. More than ever this is a game that you save often for and making 100+ individual save files. Major quest lines are riddled with bugs and plot holes the size of the grand canyon can be found more frequently than not. While I still enjoyed the vague idea of the second half of the game, it was a disappointment after how amazing the first half was. Another big issue was balancing. Take this bit of advice. Sniper rifles/ assault rifles/ shotguns and energy weapons are the only good guns in the game. The rest are terrible. If you enjoy turn based RPGs and an apocalyptic theme this game is for you, while I may have listed some off putting downsides especially for the second half it is still worth playing. The first half of the game does such a great job and the curiosity you will have to see how things turn out will help you through the issues of the second half. I finished this game 100% including a run on the higher difficulty in 158 hours. Well worth the money. 8.5/10 "

												As I am not really experienced in writing reviews, but since I just completed the game, l would like to share my experience with others whom are still deciding to buy it or not. I am dividing it in several stages: Character Building, Storyline, Combat and Gear.==Character Building==I found it really challenging to build a team that would last me through the whole game, just because there are too many skills to choose from for only 4 characters of your team. I had to make a new game 3 times to find out that it's actually better to leave a couple of skills out, which you will find on other followers (even better progressed) later on in the game. - Rose for example has a really high computer skill and handgun skill.-  Apart from the skills I think there are limited but reasonably enough faces and clothing to choose from to make a pretty random team. EDIT: After I made new game on highest difficulty, it came to my surprise that I could use me old rangers again, still having all the skills and abilities from my previous end-game. Knowing this I can reccomend new players to start and complete an easier difficulty and then use the same experienced (veteran) rangers on higher difficulty to make it easier! Changed my rating from 7/10 to 8.5 after knowing this.Rating 8.5/10==Storyline==Depending on the choices you make, the storyline will change in many, many ways. Sometimes it doesn't turn out the way you want, and you can't do anything about it because of one of your previous choices. I quite liked this because it makes making choices more difficult and you will have to think ahead to make sure everything turns out ... o.k. Dialogues are sometimes crazy long, and very tiring to read it all. You will be clicking a lot. Mind you, read carefully. Sometimes you will need information in order to make the right choice. Having an advanced speech skill will also come in handy to unlock several special dialogues which will help you get things easier.The main story takes you and your team into the wasteland of Arizona to plant a couple of radio repeaters on several radio towers and re-establish broadcast range for your fellow rangers at the Citadel. During this mission you will stumble upon a lot of people whom need your help... or do they? You decide.After going through a lot of trouble to get the radio going again, you will fly to Los Angeles, where you will have to clear the name of the Rangers and bring good to the people of LA. You will soon notice that you're not the only one trying to gain power in LA and find yourself in conflict with several organizations that will stop for nothing until they have it. Make the right choices to make the right alliances and save the world from extinction.Rating 9/10==Combat==Combat is pretty much the same throughout the whole game.. this doesn't mean that it’s boring though. You will have a limited amount of action points per character, depending on your skills. Both moving and shooting will cost action points so use them wisely. Some combat phases can be really challenging because of the environment you're in. Gain advantage by seeking higher ground and make sure that you get a lot of cover, it will definitely save your life multiple times. A higher combat initiative allows your team to act more often in a battle and will surely come in handy when you fight 10 baddies at once.  Rating 6/10==Gear==You will be happy to know that you will be able to choose from a lot of weapon types to use. And you can even put modifications on them! A big variety of weapons and weaponmods allow you to create your own personal weapons of mass destruction. The only thing I found disappointing was that you will be using the same weapon for a long time until you proceed into a new area. They are also pretty expensive in the shop. Make sure that you make the right decision on bringing the guns you find with you, or turn them into scrap metal to sell.There is also a lot of clothing to be found in the wasteland. You will stumble across the weirdest hats, shirts and pants which together make an even weirder outfit. Make sure you try everything on!Rating 8/10-------------------------------So after having said all of this, I would very much like to recommend this game to people who like a game full of adventure, mystery and action with a lot of choices and plot twists. The overall rating of this game for me concludes:7,9/10A few extra tips:* Save a lot!!* Always reload before battle!!* Stock up on ammo!!* Take cover!!* ENJOY!!Mr. Grey*			"

												   I downloaded the game over the free-to-play weekend, and I'm hooked.  It reminds me of why I used to love playing computer RPGs, particularly turn-based games like XCOM and Fallout 1 & 2.  The writing is funny and quirky, and there are just an incredible amount of easter eggs that reference the developers' obvious love for sci-fi, fantasy, pen and paper role playing games and late 20th century pop culture.  Just about every item, including the massive amount of different junk items, has a tongue-in-cheek description if you take a moment to click on them.   Some people seem to be complaining about the combat system, but it's pretty standard for any good turn based tactical game.  I like the fact that you can position your team around a skirmish utilizing high ground and obstacles for cover.  It's a nice, nostalgic change of pace from the real time combat that basically every game utilizes now.   I haven't gotten terribly far into the story, but it appears that every decision you make ripples outwards and affects how the rest of your play experience goes.  Feel like desecrating graves, shooting dogs and leaving a smoking trail of destruction behind your every move?  You're free to do so if that's what amuses you.  Your skill at picking locks not too great?  Blow open the door with some dynamite, kick it in, or just blast it open with a shotgun.  If you can't disable a trap, just have a tank open the crate and soak up the damage.  There are multiple ways to solve just about any problem you encounter.  I love that feature.  In most games, I feel like I'm missing out if I can't open every locked or secret door in the dungeon.   I probably wouldn't have stumbled across this game if it weren't for the free preview weekend, and I'm so glad it was featured.  It's not 100% perfect, but I'd give it a solid 8/10.			"

												Pros - It's a game straight out of a better timeline where games such as Fallout, X-COM, JA2 etc's publishers held onto the rights and kept making them in the same style into the mid 2000s.  I mean, at this point if you're the type of person who likes this sort of thing, anything further is totally redundant, just go and buy it now.Cons -Pretty much exactly the above!  Some of this is down to it being deliberately guided into a retro style of game through the beta, some of which is down to not having an immense production budget.  It's more like someone found a portal to a better universe's ~2007 and brought this game to ours through it, rather than a 2014 remake.			"

												Best of the turn-based RPGs I've played this year.This tickled my turn-tactical bone in the same way X-Com Enemy Unknown did. Now that I've played it through I enjoyed the general story arc, it felt like you were bringing law and order to a land full of people clammoring for it. Gotta love the Star Trek-esque takes on alternative societies as humanity claws its way back from the grave.It isn't perfectly open ended, but you have a lot of freedom to accomplish goals. I ended up doing a lot of quest lines backwards by outright murdering individuals .. which inadvertently solved quests later. A lot of times you're forced to take 'sides' in conflicts between factions, but you can just obliterate both of them if you so choose. In certain cases that may even be desirable, we're talking about some odious people here.The gameplay is pretty solid. Investing in social skills heavily can pay off in several questlines later. There's plenty of skill objectives in every map, making it feel rewarding if you invested in something as seemingly irrelevant as Toaster repair. The various weapon types all feel useful in different ways, forcing you to seriously consider if items are up upgrades to your playstyle or not.Terrific RPG.			"

Early Access Review
								Wasteland 2 is to Wasteland what X-Com: Enemy Unknown is to X-Com: UFO Defense, and so much more. It is more than just a refurbished classic with updated graphics and interface; it truly is what happens next. I recognize people and places I knew when I first explored the Wasteland; old teammates are now grizzled veterans in positions of authority, landmarks are still there, just as I pictured them… and sometimes even better. I can see where my trials and tribulations helped the people of the Wasteland… and where my hard fought battles did not matter after all. It's nostalgic, new and exciting all at the same time. I highly recommend purchasing this game and enveloping yourself in post-apocalyptic Arizona again, or first time. You won't regret it!			"

8.5/10 ""Well Wasteland/Fallout is finally back."" Wasteland2 is a 3D top-down open-world post-apocalyptic RPG with turn based fighting mechanics. During the nuclear world war in 1998, human mankind ""finally"" managed it to almost extinguish itself. Those who survived the catastrophe, had now to face the surroundings of a brutal post-apocalyptic environment. It is 2102 you are a ranger of the citadel, which is the last resort of hope for the people. Can you make the right decisions, safe the ones who cry for help & don't kill your own squad, probably not...Pros:+ great implementation (exploring&turn-based&rpg) + great atmosphere+ great gameplay+ great writing+ very good sound&ost+ very good story+ very good ui & ai+ good voice acting (when available)+ okay graphics+ the decisions+ the difficulty+ merciless! & great by doing thatCons:- still some noticeable bugs- travel map could be better- camera angles' ain't the best- too less different parts in character creation=> it's still great to create your own ones- you've to read a lot (for the ones who mind...)Enjoy WASTE(land)-(Fall)OUT!

												In short, this game is excellent. However this is coming from a gamer who still replays Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of steel and owns both Xcom: Enemy Unknown and its expansion. I love my squad based RPGs, turns or no. And I love the post-apocalyptic setting even more, it has always been one of my favourite areas to tread, and with Wasteland 2 I have tread far and wide, nearing the end of this game I am already looking forwards to re-rolling on Ranger difficulty for many more hours of frustratingly amazing gameplay.Many people complain that this game is too hard, and that they have to restart multiple times, but I have not restarted a single time, nor have I encountered many bugs aside from the occassional camera glitch (Exactly 3 times in 50 hours of game play). I am still playing through on my first squad roll and loving every bit of it! The love you put into your squad before you start playing is the basis for everything that comes after - Remember that.

												Let me begin by saying that Wasteland 2 is not like Fallout outside of the post-apocalyptic theme, and a few design choices. Wasteland 2 is a great game, but it is not as good as Fallout 2. The game is a good squad-based RPG that reminds me heavily of those old Fallout games, though. And indeed, I love this game much the same. There is a variety of ways you can solve most of your problems, and because of that, this game has consumed what has to have been over 10 hours of my life already. There are some problems I have with the game. And if this game were made by any other unknown indie developer, I would have rolled my eyes and moved on. But this game was made by Brian Fargo, with help from several other veterans of good old RPGs that we knew and love, so this makes me disappointed at a few design choices.1. A few skills are a bit too divided. Unnecessarily so. Why is Safecracking and Lockpicking two different skills? Why not just make Safes harder to lockpick? Why are Blunt Weapons and Bladed weapons separate? What was so wrong with a general ""melee"" skill? Why is there a skill just for modding weapons? Who in their right mind would put skill points into Toaster Repair? While some skill divisions made logical sense -- obviously, in a squad-based RPG, a generic ""guns"" skill would be broken, and speech is basically divided into what you want to accomplish with words (Reasoning, Seduction, or Intimidation). But I honestly think Weapon Modding should have been covered by Mechanical Repair, and Safes should fall under Lockpicking.1a. And while I am at it, what is the point of the Demolitions skill outside of trap disarming? All explosive weapons are disposable, one-use items (REAAAAALLY dislike, by the way), and none of them are affected by your skill at handling explosives. Instead, grenades and bombs are handled XCOM: Enemy Unknown style -- click where you want the bomb to go and the character tosses it, with little chance of error. Now, I loved XCOM, but what the hell? No grenade launchers with appropriate ammo? No rockets for your LAWs and RPGs? No mines? (well, the ENEMY can place mines, but you can't). No C-4? Why have Demolitions at all, outside of defusing the numerous (frankly obnoxious) traps inside every other box of loot?2. No Stealth mechanic or skill. This hit me pretty hard when I realized there was no stealth in the game, because I am all about conflict avoidance in RPGs. I am the kind of guy whose priority in Fallout New Vegas was getting my speech to 100 -- the fewer bullets I fire during a quest, the better. Not to mention there were several situations I ran into that practically BEGGED for the usage of stealth, and yet, it simply wasn't possible. Aside from that though, the game seems to be doing well in the ""cause and effect"" aspect that many RPGs sorely lack. There are tough decisions you will find yourself making as you journey across the wasteland. The best solutions that benefit everyone often require large amounts of skill in the required talents -- Unless you specialize your rangers, you aren't going to do many great things. It's a good RPG. And honestly, it has me hooked. But damnit, I DID expect better.I do recommend it though, despite its flaws. The game itself is good, it's just that I did not expect to find the flaws I did from veterans of the industry. If you liked Wasteland, and you liked Fallout 1 and 2, check it out. Of course, I must stress this -- it is NOT Fallout. Don't get the game expecting Fallout.			"

Early Access Review
								The fundemental flaw in the YES OR NO recomendations in steam reviewing platform really starts to ♥♥♥♥ me off when you review Early Access or alpha build games.  The problem is like many alpha and early games the changes that can and will come can drastically alter your entire experience.  In some cases an entirely new build may completely destroy what you got use to over the last 5-6 months of playing.Wasteland 2 I waited until it was on sale for, 60$ price tag was justified by not spitting in the faces of their kick starter backers, and I do respect that.  Was the $40 (on sale) I paid to play this game a few months before release worth it?  I would say yes.  While not an MMO and i won't get points for getting to x, y, z before anyone else, it still is a really solid return to classics.It shows that classic systems implemented correctly into newer engines can play really nice together.  Now I must admit i don't remember much if ANYTHING from the original wasteland, but I do remember Fallout and playing that.  This game feels more at home with an isometric Fallout (to me at least).  It plays really well, but for some it can be described as ""too slow"".Wasteland 2 doesn't hold back on a classic experience by giving you a bunch of tools at your disposal, and giving you the freedom to resolve conflicts your way.  Save a few game breaking bugs (again early build beta), the game is overall really solidly done.  Now while playing I felt like I have in most RPGs eventually your character becomes a hoarder and you are able to basically buy anything without it having it hinder you in any real significant way.For being survivors of a wasteland these guys sure as ♥♥♥♥ stockpiled the ammunition up.  It became overly easy to have an abundance of ammunition, also after recruiting 3 extra characters ontop of your 4, you become a small wrecking crew that is essentially an unstoppable killing force.  There are moments that will give you some pause and trouble, but for the most part i was able to breeze through the content without too much trouble, hell barely even used my medic skill yet continued to skill it up.Despite this, as you progress you start to want to ♥♥♥♥ with the wasteland's inhabitants more and more.  From the Rail Nomads and their rediculous fued, to the Red Skorpions in the prison, even the lowly little Wreckers.  All in all the game presents itself well, plays well, and has a story that is interesting enough to keep you wanting to play more.I do recommend when it releases, but I would not recommend the game for $60.  There is speculation if the game will be 25$ - 40$, and I'd recommend around those prices, but for just playing early on / few extras the $60 is up to your own budget.  A solid and promising title, with a good amount of polish and a hopeful final push before release date this could shape up to be an amazing title.Also the promise of the mod tools after release is a killer bonus as well.

												Wasteland 2 is a very good top down view RPG with a great sense of humour. Your choices make a difference to the world around in you ways few games can claim. Simply recovering a nuke can wipe out entire areas of the game making it impossible to do those areas. Shooting a guy can make enemies out of friends, can get you labeled a murderer and warned by the rangers to stay clean or become an outlaw you self. Your choices matter here. Just one thing.... this game really makes the graphics card GPU heat up. My system rarely goes higher than 60c on the worst games, this game takes it to 80c. So best not run  it on a laptop.			"

Early Access Review
								Wasteland 2 is in the later stages of it's Beta as I am writing this review, so please bear that in mind. The game is not without a few glitches here and there but is largely playable and IMHO massively fun. The rich game world, interesting RPG elements and turn based combat make for a good time all around. I have played through the Beta more than once and if you'd like to see my 'review' in detail you can check out my LPs of the game on my YT channel - rgnmal.Its a thumbs up from me folks, I do not believe you will be disappointed. If you are a fan of Wasteland or the Fallout series, you are going to feel right at home here.			"

												I have no experience with the classics of the cRPG genre, as I am a bit too young to have been good enough at video games to enjoy them during the glory days (25 now), but let me tell you something: This is the best genre of video games ever. No questions asked. I don't care if you have never played this style before, please pick up this game along with Pillars of Eternity. Honestly, these two games, which apparently aren't even as good as the true classics, destroy every modern game when it comes to storytelling, character development and lore. You really feel like you are a part of the world and that your actions are changing things. If you don't like to read, well ah, I guess Call of Duty is on here somewhere, but if you're even moderately intelligent, enjoy great storytelling and atmosphere, this game is for you. Don't be intimidated if you haven't played the classics. This is a fantastic game for rookies or vets.			"

												This was a great game and exactly what I was looking for. Good choices, a bit text laden in places and some balance issues in skills and weapons but the only reason I haven't given it another playthrough after completion is the free upgrade to GOTY edition that's heading out sometime.

Early Access Review
								Well as a fan of RPGs i couldn't walk away from this one. I mean this is a real hardcore, oldschool RPG at it's best! Early access brought on us many bugs, glitches and many times after another patch game would not run... but, now it's made a whole, there are some minor fixes left so what will Wasteland 2 can give you?Graphics: Decent. It's not masterpiece in graphical state, but it's not the polygons that make game looks, it's artstyle. And it's there! You think Wasteland 's a big sandbox? With some rubble piles here and there? Destroyed houses and cities? yes all that, but also plenty more! Gen labs, terrariums, farms, villages; there are enough places and variety to feel like home (if you're a fan of postapocalyptic).Gameplay: True oldschool. Do not touch this game if you're JRPG\console raised or school lad\lass. You probably feel lost, because game require brains to play. From Charecter creation to Wasteland jorney. You allowed to create up to 4 charecters, and will meet some more on ye joprneys, team can be 7 people max. And it is important what stats and skills charecter posses. Many times to find alternate root or to unlock secret, or simply to snoop around you will need some particular skill; One charecter will not be able to be master of everything, so think, do math... still you will probably will have to start game all over after first 3 hours. Stats btw are connected, so if you want fast or strong charcter you will have to sacrifice something in order to build that charecter. So it's important to understand what do you want, not blindly jumping into a game (stats btw can not be increased with level up, only skills can. Though you will find little trinkets here and there that will amplify particular stat). And the most awesome of all -- you can write your own biography for charecter! And use random avatars! As the game starts, well it's you standart RPG; World map, quests, exploration, fights... but with a certan twists here and there. For example, while wondering through the desert your charecters will need water and rad protection (or they will die) water can be refiled in Oasis or on base still you need to plan ahead. Combat can be very hard, or simple (depends on your charecter combatant skills and difficulty level), there are a variety of enemies and some of them can be really chalenging, or will require a certan tactic to defeat. Finaly a lot of secrets, alternate roots, quests that go against each other: Right from the begining you will have a choise to save X or Y and this WILL, I repeat WILL affect game, not like in JRPG or modern adventures. No, you WILL suffer the consiquences of ye choise... High replayability value. Music and Sound: Musik is... well it support atmosphere still you will probably won't even notice that it exist. Sound on the other hand is great.Final verdict? If you love Fallout 1 and 2, if you love oldschool RPG that require brain for play, if you hungry for challenge and want game that will give you freedom while restricting you gently. This is Wasteland 2 lady and gentleman: a game that every hardcore player and every oldschool gamer must own.			"

												Instead of telling you stories of what games that are similar to Wasteland or not, i'd simply tell you in short diary-form what you will encounter in your first 15 hours. Decide if that's your cup of tea or not.(This is from the point of view of a late-adopter that waited until release (except some 20hrs sneak peak) to dive into this. I have not read any forums/guides/walkthroughs or whatever. No spoilers!)- Read about all values/statistics and their interdependency. Think about what your group should be able to do- Best group ever! Will rule the wastelands!- First larger mission. Got stuck. Should have read the NPC-Dialogues. No pretty quest-pointer taking my hand. Ok, like in the old times now!- Walk into a fight feeling like a boss. This group can't loose! Got my ♥♥♥(es) handed over some seconds later. Bad lizards! Half the group is wasted, no ammo left, no medipacks to heal.- OK, Reload! No problem!- Lose one dude more this time- Start all over again. Thinking about lowering difficulty this time. Ego wins. If anyone would see that...- Walk into the next fight. Prepared you are! Fighting skills maxed, you have! Such clever, much thought, wow!- Survive the fight, come to the conclusion it was stupid to NOT have secondary skills too.- Restart. Lowering difficulty to match my...skills...noone will ever know!- Got a perfect group now! Everythings equalized. Should be efficient!- Met a new groupmember. Cool. Made 4 of my chosen secondary skills redundant. Still some others missing. DAMN IT!- Restart. FOR THE LAST TIME!- Clearing everything of <SPOILER WOULD BE HERE>. Except that one door. Need a skill i haven't covered. DAMN IT!- Should i restart? NO!- Screw that door. Oh there's another door i cannot open. DAMN IT!- Fights become controllable, i guess i start understanding. This is fun!- A Bossfight. Dead in some seconds. I suck at tactical combat. Time to admit it.- Finally did it. Piece of cake! Hard but doable with luck. I had luck.- Open next door, critical failure. DAMN IT! - Reload last savegame. DAMN IT! Before the boss. Forgot to save afterwards. DAMN IT!- Died again.- Time to write a devastating review! REVENGE!Do i recommend it? YES! Though it's really not everyone's cup of tea and quite anachronistic. Is it worth it's full price right now? Considering such epic failures like, e.g. Archeage, that are selling for like €144,-. Yes it's worth these 50,-Already put 15 hrs into it, and only scratched the surface i guess. "

This game, although I am not far into it, is a ton of fun; the gameplay is a far cry from what I am used to playing but the diffferent experience this game gives me is really refreshing.

												I recommend this game, but there's a few problems. basically, I had to open a walkthru to figure out a few quests, and I should never need to do that. and honestly, kinda tired of turn based combat, there's no way to crank the combat speed up to instant, so a lot of the petty overworld battles drag on. after the game removed one of my best party members in an unscripted story event, I actually downloaded a save editor out of frustration and gave myself a stack of free weapon mods and a ton of ammo. I feel like that is a flaw in the game design when I am suddenly and unavoidably crippled like that.that being said, this has a lot of charm and a good story. the final battle even rewards me for all the people and towns I saved, which is a great reason to take a lot of care when making decisions. I really loved being part of a well organized group of post apocalyptic vigilante lawmen right from the start, going on call and sniping monsters with my specialist team of tacticool operators.it's not a perfect result but at least they cared about the game. still, would have been better if I had the option to let scotchmo set off that nuke (oh, you mean I actually could have but didn't get any indication? that's not good).this is from someone who gave a positive review to fallout 1, 2, 3, nv, and 4. it's good to see someone putting in the work for a proper rpg.

												This game hates you.Loot aquisition is just horrible.  Make the best damn thief around, max out your skills and you'll still fail opening locks, safes, etc.  If you're so inclined you can save before and reload if you fail and try try and try a-frickin-gain.  I don't feel like cheating so I don't. At one point you get ambushed by a cyborg death squad that shoots you with energy weapons. It's crazy difficult.  The recommendations from the message boards: Before going into this situation strip off your armor.  Well grand. The game should have stopped in Arizona.  California is alright, storywise, but the game mechanics shatter.  Maybe it's a balance issue, who knows.  It feels like they wiped out your skills and reset them to zero due to the difficulty being so over the top. EVERYTHING in California is a Herculean skill difficulty.A lot of games really build up and reward you for the time spent, but no, not this game. THIS GAME HATES YOU.			"

Wasteland 2: Director’s Cut is an isometric, turn-based strategy RPG set in post-apocalyptic Arizona. It follows the exploits of the Desert Rangers, a group of self-appointed peacekeepers who make it their business to settle disputes and protect the innocent from the horrors of the new world. Unfortunately, the Rangers have fallen on hard times of late, losing the trust of the common folk, and must work even harder to preserve their once glorious name.The game is an excellent update on a classic RPG experience, placing you squarely in the harshest of settings with a more benevolent role to play than most other “post-nuclear” game experiences with an excellent and open world exploration and battle system, as well as deep character customization and a dynamic, ever-changing story and world experience.Wasteland 2: Director’s Cut is very open in terms of story and flow, and will almost always provide a unique experience based on your party choices, in-game decisions, interactions with certain groups, and success in handling problems for the citizens of your jurisdiction. Each game is going to be a completely different experience based on the party you choose, simply due to the access or restrictions you’ll have from the skills your party possesses.THE GOOD- Immersive world packed with lore- Great world exploration- Excellent turn-based combat system- Deep character customizationTHE BAD- Bad camera control- Looks outdated in places- Crams a lot onto the screenDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

This by all accounts is an excellent game...in overall i would strongly recommend it especially if you are a sucker of those old classic RPGs and with winter sales coming and going you can easily enjoy it more by getting it on discount. *MICHAEL BAY directed the last part of the game "

												The director's cut version will say ""Director's Cut"" on the title screen.  If you didn't read the news, you probably have the old version.  The director's cut version has information on how to play which appears on the right side of the screen in tabs, which one clicks to get the information.  The only thing I didn't know how to do was swap equipment but it is easy: one way is to drop and drag onto another character's portrait.

												I know this game is in no way linked to the fallout series, but obviously there are direct comparisons to the first two fallout games, and possibly tactics as well.  A lot of players have commented that it brings back the feeling of the old fallout games, but I can't agree with them.  The greeat thing about fallout 1 and 2 were the intellegence and humour of the games, and also the sense of progression.  The quests and puzzles were tricky, but not so much that you got fed up and gave up on them.Wasteland 2 seems to have taken all of the bad bits of the fallout series and left out the good bits.  There's lots of trudging around the wasteland with not much to do.  You encounter vastly overpowered enemies early on, you have to cycle through reams of pointless speach, progression through ranks is slow and painful with little reward at the end, the missions are nonsensical and give you little clue about what you are doing.  The last point is the worst part about the game.  I've trudged about for hours trying to fathom out what the hell I'm supposed to do to complete the first missions.  I ended up being attacked by most of the main characters and having to kill them!  I'm so gutted that I paid top whack for this game, as I really wanted to, and really tried to enjoy it.			"

												I would recommend playing fallout 1 or 2 instead of this game, it starts with your character talking to a ranger, no explanation about who you are or why you're here, he just tells you about the death of another ranger and assumes you're in on the loop, you're dropped straight into the story with no idea who your character is or how they got there. So you and your team of 3 (which you just met without introduction) leave the ranger camp to investigate a ranger's death for you're boss you just met, and for a moment I expected to embark on a grand adventure but dissapointingly the ranger died just a short walk away (along the way you'll have to fight the same 3 or 4 raiders over and over again) The team you lead doesn't say anything to eachother, apparently no one cares who they are or why they're here they never react verbally or non verbally to anything they're seeing or doing. In fact every NPC feels as lifeless as their voice acting, which frankly is dull and boring, understandable had they been reading perhaps the 400th line of dialog at 5pm on a Friday, but it seems they carry the same enthusiasm or lack there of throughout the entire game or at least the first few hours that I've played.After a few hours I began to grow impatient and decided I was going to do my own thing because I honestly don't care about the rangers, or their quests. I thought maybe I can start a fresh in another part of the wasteland, but you can't go walking too far into the desert, oh no, don't go exploring and trying to have fun because then you'll die of dehydration, you need to stay around the oasis' which are conveniently located along the routes to places you need to go, mother nature you sly dog. It's disapointing that there's nothing to do around these oasis' except fight the same raiders over and over which for some may be fun for a minute or two, but you'll soon run out of ammunition and you're party is very fragile often bleeding from a single gunshot until death. Not a problem if you have plently of supplies dropped by the raiders you've killed for no reason, but wait a minute, I can't use it because I didn't go through med school, I needed to spec my character in a particular way otherwise I'm not able to heal. That's alright I'll just go back to the ranger base and get them to heal me up, seeing as I am helping them out by investigating the death of their friend. Nope, they'll let me buy more of the supplies I've already got with the very little money I already have. But it seems they aren't prepared to give me treatment or anything else accept for the odd 'hurry up and do your job' radio message, If only I could somehow communicate to him that our group is very close to dead and would likely not survive another raider ambush. It's puzzling how these characters survived for the 20 odd years prior to the beginning of this game without any decent weapons or currency? Don't think about that you gotta keep focused on the story, about a ranger that was killed by a giant frog when he went for a walk? The only appeal a game like this has for me personally is story and I am trying really hard to find some story here, it's just not happening.			"

												First, if I do not recommend a game, that does not mean it is bad. It is just not so good that amount of money/time one gonna spend is justified to what’s he gonna get.That being said, here is a list of things I found disappointing (list is incomplete and unordered): Repetitiveness of using skills to get random scanty stuff from chests, safes, etc. One cannot know beforehand if there will be random contents in a box or not. It gets boring, and save-loads before each box makes it even more miserable. Unrelated skills and attributes make some of latter inferior. Some of the weapon types are inferior to others by design. One cannot know beforehand (one third of the game it is becoming clear, and you lost about 25 hours already). Some of the skills are not needed to to be taken at all as some of recruits will have them. One cannot know which ones beforehand. So player is doomed to waste either time to restart the game, or read spoilers in guides, or waste skill points which actually needed to upgrade needed skills as difficulty of the game makes a sudden jump up in about half the game. There are not enough locations to roam, gameplay is a bit too linear. If the game has a squad-based combat tactics in it, why do characters walk a crowd and there is no way to choose a formation before the combat starts? Especially sudden scripted combats. No way to revive fallen surgeon. Even paid doctors who rarely happen to be nearby cannot help. Sorry, lad, load your game. How comes leaders of two different towns are both into other men’s wives?Overall it is actually a nice game, which should be recommended to a person who has spare 150 hours of time and desire to repeat one half of a game to learn what should and should not be done at character creation. Maybe GOTY edition will fix some of the issues, but I am not up to repeating this adventure.			"

Combat is terrible, no tactical aspect meaning skill in combat doesnt matter just keep attacking and hoping your guy doesnt miss again.  Where a game like Pillars of Eternity did a good job of giving you challenge but once you hit a wall you cant cross you can level up so you can have a fighting chance Wasteland 2 says just keep hitting that wall till you manage to maybe break through if not then too bad.  This makes the game frustrating in the wrong ways and sucks the fun right out of it. Im sorry but this is one game i cannot give my time to.			"

												I had had high hopes for this game, finally a promising RPG-style, turn-based, post-apocalyptic game. It has been since the fall-out series that I have been waiting for something comparable.So there it was: Wasteland2.I started playing and thought:""This looks nice, this is fun. Looks promising!""Several hours in I was still playing, but something was off. It took me a while before I realised:""I'm bored.""That is the problem of the game. Looks nice (if somewhat unpolished), story line is okay-ish, but the game devolves into endless shooty encounters where the best tactic seems to be: focus fire on one target and then go onto the next one"". You can outflank and stealth and whatnot, but in the end focus fire is the main thing.Bored with all the shooting? Travel to town, here you can only talk and there is no combat whatsoever.Skills and characters are bland. Just dump all points into two or three skills per teammember and over-specialise. NPC's are cardboard boring figures with no depth. Your actions do not have real consequences, it may seem like it, but nuh-uh.It's not a bad game, but it is just very, very boring to play. To sum it up:An okayish game, but bland and boring. Not worth more than five bucks on a rainy Sunday afternoon.I worry about Tides of Numenera, if this is what these guys can offer.			"

												I was looking forward to the game and have waited with playing it until full release. Sadly to me it is a big disappointment and I really tried to like it.I've caught myself trying to find reasons to keep playing the game and just couldn't find any better argument than ""you've paid money for it, now you have to play it"".Everything seems uninteresting, uninspired or plain weird. The characters are boring, the dialogue is lame, the quests feel like a chore. I didn't get any sense of adventure or exploration out of the game - whenever I found something on the map it didn't feel like I've discovered something special, it doesn't feel like it belongs in the game world, it feels like a set piece that's there because later in the game you'll have to do boring quests in it. This makes exploration even more tedious since I can't shake the feeling that I might break the game or quests if I start going where the story didn't tell me to go yet.			"

												I found the game to have serious game design flaws that make me regret the purchase.  May this be a warning to others.First there is way to much useless clicking involved. Seemingly every action requires another useless click. For example: characters don't just level up, one needs to call in to HQ then pretend to read the useless exchange with the caption then click through a series of boring dialog options only then can one go to assking skill points. Seriously I was annoyed by this even the first time around. You have to do this each time a character levels up ...Here is another: assigning an item to a hotkey is not just dragging the item into the hotkey slot, you have to right click the item (even though the help says right-click to use, you have to disregard that) then click the assign hot key then click the hotkey. The interfaces are a little sluggish so you won't be clicking all that fast either.Maps: The maps are tiny, cramped and sluggish. One seemingly needs to always rotate the map back and forth not to miss a detail. There is always another zone to load there is no sense of exploration or adventure.  All the background are prerendered and non mostly non destructible. It is very difficult to figure out quest objectives - some objects are ""indestructible"" until some quest objective is finished but still show up as targetable - so you end up wasting ammo on them. Combat: The game interface is unforgiving in combat - it is hard to tell which character is in LOS of another thus in danger to get into a friendly fire incident. Combat alway seems to play out the same way, the enemy bum rushes you - and because the AI is dumb it has beefed up stats to make up for that. See that big rabbit that you shot four times already - it still has an insane range and attack power and still has the ability to quickly take down a trained well armed ranger. It is just bad game desing.Travel: The map travel is boring and uninspired, who wants to watch an icon moving on a map - there is this seeminly pointless difficulty setting of having toxic fumes appear out of nowhere thus killing your entire party. WTF game design is that?I really tried to like this game but unfortunately it lacks the simplicity and fun factor of old school tactical games such as XCOM or Jagged Alliance.			"

 Great game full of  bugs  Overall a great game. You can spend hours just building your squad, making sure that they have the right mix of skills, knowledge and weapons to survive and conquer. Which really leads you to invest in the team member you build and train. I restarted the game so many times to make sure that I was covering all bases and leaving the right gaps for recruitable NPC's to fill. This has kept me in the first part of the game for a while now. However, having an exciting and deep background story I don't mind going over it again as it allows me to  pick up on things I've missed and uncover new dialogue that I would have otherwise missed. There are more bugs in the game than I would expect from a product no longer in beta. Though not catastrophic, they can take frustrate and take away some of the fun from and otherwise well designed and thought out game. Also the models could use some attention as the seem to lack any real depth or contrast and on that note im also finding the camera system too constrictive in the way im not able change the veiw in all of the directions I would like. Camera snapping to charecters during combat is also an issue, it completely resets veiws and im finding myself having to constantly readjust to get the veiw back the way it was after each charactors turn instead of the black screen it leaves me with. There is also a problem where the terrain and light source seperate not allowing panning of the camera during combat when trying to move a charactor which I was frustrated with a few times. Using ladders during combat can lead to some very interesting animation where you can expect to see the charactor ascend the ladder when it should be descending and just recently my whole world map reset after a raider battle. Although the forums say there wil be patches, by the time they're released I and im sure many others will be onto a whole new game.Although I do enjoy playing the game I also enjoy playing alphas and I think that a lot of the features this game lacks or has wrong feels very similar to an unpolished product that should otherwise be less than $20 and have Beta stamped across it. The only real saving grace at the moment is the depth of story as the game at $40 should look more like $20 in this condition, after all there are games at this price point that outstrip Wasteland 2 in a lot of ways. So would I recommend it? Not at this price. However I do enjoy playing it but would like to see it cheaper until fixed. $40 for a buggy, glitchy game or $40 for X-com? Perhaps more time in Beta and less rushing to push the game onto shelves could have seen an amazing game to rival RPG's its predecessor ""inspired"" but instead, all we really get is a great story full of bugs.I've noticed people hating on bad reviews so I would like to say that this is my opinion of the game if you don't like it then that's yours. Don't be lazy, write your own review.			"

								(English / Japanese review, 日本語レビューは下のほう)Brian Fargo did it. I'm happy that I paid $115 on it(for physical CE).Team based RPG with up to 4 rangers in the team(don't know if you can separate the team that you could in WL1).Combat is AP based, but Initiative decides the action order(not Player team > Enemy team system like FO:T or Jagged Alliance).Graphic is rough(Especially character models) but I believe that's what Unity isn't really good at, and it's not very important thing for *DEEP* RPG like WL2.Bugs? Small UI? Imbalance? It's still beta, get on with them and you can help it making better!Forget Fallout 4 and get it, NOW.あのRPG界の巨匠Brian Fargoの新作。Kickstarterで$115(パッケージ限定版+送料)払った甲斐があった。4人パーティを構成してプレイするRPGだけど、前作みたいに別行動させられるかは不明。戦闘はAP(アクションポイント)制ではあるがFallout TacticsやJagged Allianceとは違い、行動順はイニシアチブで決めれる形で敵味方が入り乱れて動く。今の問題といえばグラフィック(特にキャラモデル)の出来はそこまでよくないが、Unityを使っていること(超グラフィックよりマルチプラットフォーム化と動作速度を優先してるのだろう)や、超ディープなRPGにグラフィックは重要ではないのであまり気にならないか。バグ、小さすぎるUI、ゲームバランスの問題は、まだβだから仕方ない。というか今すぐ遊んでその辺が改善されるよう手助けしよう。RPGゲーマーを自負するならFallout 4なんて忘れて、今すぐこっちを遊ぶべき。			"

												Let all comparisons to Fallout 1 and/or 2 be retroactively rendered null and void with the same nullification applied to all comparisons henceforth. Simply put: if you are looking for an experience like the original Fallouts, keep looking. This isn't any fraction as good as either of them because it simply isn't good at all.I can forgive an ENORMOUS quantity of technical faults. Bugs, bland combat, and graphics that were obsolete 10 years ago simply don't phase me if the less tangible aspects of a game are exceptional. These aspects include, in order: writing, character interaction, and world interaction/immersion (coherence, reactivity and a sense of player agency). Fallout 1 and 2 had these in spades and although no game can touch Planescape: Torment's character interaction, I at least never felt like I was running around with faceless, generic AIs for companions.I should've known by the fact that you create an entire party (versus one player character who represents you) that the most meaningful and elusive elements of an RPG would be missing (the feeling that you're a participant in a world). The difference between Fallout and Wasteland 2 is like the difference between Baldur's Gate 2 and Icewind Dale...except Icewind Dale advertised itself correctly and successfully executed the thing it was trying to do/be.I don't know if it was laziness or simply a lack of skill that produced this heap of a plot, but it feels like it could be either and/or both. At around the 12 hour mark, I hear the radio transmission about becoming immortal, invulnerable, disease free and beautiful...Combined with the mysterious robotic/synthetic threat, the 'faction' known as Children of the Cathedral and the basic ability to put 2 and 2 together, I deduced that the plot was something to do with turning people into robots. Not unlike Fallout 1's Children of the Cathedral being a front for the Master seeking to turn people into mutants who are long-lived, disease free, stronger, faster, better, whatever. That's so much not unlike it, that it's EXACTLY like it. You can't even call that an homage...because homage doesn't mean 'blatant ripoff'.And the writing that everyone is showering in praise? Here's a stool - I mean writing - sample from Wasteland 2: ""A lone road stretches on. A dry wind whips at your back with the sandy shards from decades of lost hopes and dreams."" That's the line of text you get on entering The Prison...which is a former prison now occupied by raiders. So not only is there no visible/audible wind/swirls/eddies/gusts, the other half of the description is hard to connect to a place that housed criminals in the past and present. I'm not sure that I care about the hopes and dreams of murderers...and unwarranted melodrama aside, it's just too lengthy and hard to read...the second sentence should've been broken up into two. Compare this with a description from Fallout 2: ""Before you stands Hakunin, the village shaman. He appraises you with his crazy eyes from somewhere in the world only he inhabits."" Not only is that less cumbersome/awkward to read, when you actually see and speak to Hakunin, you realize that a more perfect description could not have been penned.All I have to say about the music is that I can't believe it was done by the same Mark Morgan who composed Fallout 1 and 2's music. It's as if he couldn't find any inspiration in the material for which he was to compose. No surprise there.The voice work is...serviceable at best and one step shy of laughably bad at worst...but mostly serviceable. I don't know if it was for a lack of space on CDs or for an abundance of sense, but games back in the day RIGHTLY kept voice acting to a minimum. This guaranteed that the voices that were present were of excellent quality. Compare this to the Elderscrolls approach of giving a million characters the same grating voice. Thank christ for the march of technology. There simply isn't a game budget (unless Warren Buffet was involved) to fund quality voice acting for all characters. Wasteland 2 seemed to understand that...but then couldn't cast decent actors for the few voiced characters it had. It also should've voiced fewer characters and hired better actors instead.That about covers all the non-mechanical stuff. And the mechanical stuff has already been covered by everyone else and yes, it's as awful as they say. 5 different skills for opening things. 3 different skills for talking to people. Did there really have to be separate skills for assault rifles and SMGs? Or for bladed and blunt weapons? The more obscure skills yielded disproportionately better results than the generally useful ones, artificially decreasing the effectiveness of reasonable characters. For instance: Hard safes contained the same crap as easy safes but hard toasters contain useful and unique weapons?!? 4% jam rates translate to 6 characters jamming in a row for two turns??? It costs more action points to clear a jam than to reload?!?!?! I can make headshots but I can't target other body parts for at least SOME tactical depth?!?! Enemies can't do more than charge or stay in place? Characters' faces can't have features in 2015???I could've forgiven all of that...if only Wasteland 2 gave me a world I could care about with characters that were more than quest dispensers and text that was better than college level. UGH! Even the first major choice you make, going to Ag Center or Highpool, is so poorly and heavy-handedly executed. HERE ARE TWO PLACES THAT NEED RESCUING BUT YOU ONLY HAVE TIME TO SAVE ONE. MAKE A HARD CHOICE AND THEN LISTEN TO THE DRAMA OF THE SCREAMING PEOPLE FROM THE PLACE YOU CHOSE NOT TO GO TO!!! IT'S BRILLIANT AND IMPORTANT AND NOT AT ALL FORCED! In Fallout, there would've been 5 ways to handle it. 2 with different, gruesome outcomes. 2 different neutral outcomes. And 1 where the outcome was unrelated but important and revealed later in the game (like in the Vault City vs Gecko quest arc).TL;DR Fallout is an experience. Wasteland 2 is just a game. Don't buy this thinking that your Fallout needs have finally been answered. They haven't. Lets just hope Beamdog somehow acquires the Fallout license and remakes Fallout 1 and 2 with added content or makes a Fallout 4...or something...I don't know...I have a Fallout deficiency.			"

												Unfortunately very weak game with some RP and close to none tactical game play. Second disappointment of this year together with Divinity OS. Together they could be good game with 90+ out of 100 raiting, separate it's 45- for each. So basically no tactical gameplay(Brawling starts at first turn in that tactical game with relatively modern weapon, unless you know that there will be a fight and start first - then it starts 1-2 st turn).I wonder how do they get 80+ and community support though, even with rabidly old fan base - there is simply no game behind it.My advice - choose simplest level of difficuly(that doesn't make any difference except in how many bullets you spend), give 2 different weapon and 2-3 different skills to each toon(you have to use all skills to open all boxes), put points into 3 different ways of persuasion(yep, you cant threat on same level you can suck up) - and just RP through it.Will be nice japanese like story, with no - ofc.P.S. There is no point to compare it to Fallout - there is nothing that connects(except postacalyptic thingie) - visuals, tactics, RP - it's better in good oldies. Only reason to spend money for W2(vs other cheaper ways) is for hope to eventually get something worthy. And there is none.Upd. Didnt want to say anything about level of - it puts you into. But then after Alt-Tabing back to game after that review I've got ""impossible"" to open door that was 16% before. And even before alt-tab I couldn't even target second door in line of severals(targetable, if you start separately from them).			"

I much prefer it to Bethesda's rebooted Fallout games, even though I admire them technically, but they just aren't the same. I love the quests, the difficult choices.It's so good I finished one game and started another straight away, despite having Fallout 4 barely started on my hard drive....BUY NOW!FYI Because i previously owned the non Director's Cut my play stats aren't showing up correctly - I'm over 116 hrs with the Director's Cut now :)			"

												This game represents crucial event in RPG world. Specifically the collapse of hopes for a game worth Fallout 1,2 (or Baldurs gate 2 or Arcanum, etc.) to be ever made. Wasteland have no deep character developing system. In fact it is pretty linear. General rule is the further you are in game, the better skill is required. Good thing is that half of them are almost needless.Open world is not so amasing to explore due to small size of it. Although world looks pretty unrealistic and empty, what could be allright for an indie game, but not 6 million dollars game claimed to be great.Tha game is definetly not a marauding simulator. Looting requiers a lot of skillpoints to be spent on coresponding skills. Upon what you have random content of crates and safes. Limited time, eh?There is no expansive net of quests neither complicated requirements for non-combat skills and atributes for this quests. But the worst part of the game is combat. Enjoy.  "

												Made by some of the original developers of the older Fallout franchise (before Bethesda turned it into Morrowind with Guns), this game is solid.  I love tactical squad-based combat and the turn-based system is well done.  Guns feel powerful, ammunition and supplies feel valuable, enemies are scary, and concequences are real.

												In short, Wasteland 2 tells a story about what you cannot do - open doors, chests or safes, hit enemies or talk cunningly. Mostly at the beginning of the game to be fair, but even later on there are several objects to interact with that often cause you to fail critically when using a maxed out skill on them. You then either have to accept this and carry on or load a previous save game and try again.Given the fact that the loot often is not worth the trouble, option 1 should be the way to go (or ignore the possible loot in the fist place), but that's not what I expect of a game. Reloading (and again and again sometimes) is a slow and tedious process. May be I'm not getting the point and Wasteland 2 then is not the game for me, but on the other hand this is a personal review and all about how I like it.There's more boring stuff in it, like quests which have you to visit the same places a few times over without the possibility to quick travel. Given the size and layout of some areas and the way they are connected to other areas sometimes causes you to sit there for minutes and tell your team to go back and forth. That's a way of extending the play time. One I don't like at all. Especially if the quest giver sends you more often than needed to the same place when all that has to be done could have easily been accomplished on the first visit.Personally I didn't care much for the story. Cannot really identify the cause though. I found myself mostly rushing through the dialog options, only scanning for relevant key words to get through quickly - which is a shame because I think the writing itself seems to be fine. But I couldn't connect the the world like I did when playing Fallout 1 and 2 for example. In the end I tried to solve all open quests and finish the story so I could mark this game as completed.Technically I had severe performance issues in some (mostly indoor) areas on my Linux machine and encountered several bugs. The Linux version of Borderlands 2 for example runs much better here.I'm not saying Wasteland 2 is a bad game. Most people seem to like it. But you have to tolerate a couple of things which just annoy me to the point the fun gets significantly spoiled. All in all I'm too disappointed to recommend this game.			"

												DISCLAIMER: I didn't get the memo. I only have the original WASTELAND 2.WASTELAND 2 is a post-apocalyptic game with gameplay elements inspired by the first Fallout games. It's centered around the Desert Rangers, pretty much an untrustworthy police force that still tries to do their job and attempt to surpass their rivals, the Red Skorpions, and solve the mystery of the ranger, Ace's death. This game is not the prettiest, it has okay textures and pretty much the same environment, but inXile pulls a Nintendo and thought laterally with withered technology. Although the environments can seem kinda repetitive, it's a desert with bits of vibrant colors and life that makes every area unique.In terms of story, everybody has some story to tell. The Desert Rangers are the law, constantly trying to help everyone out despite their history. The Red Skorpions are scavengers that tend to do things better than the Rangers, the citizens of Highpool are a big water supply with a dead mayor and hatred for the rangers, and many, many, many more. And if you think it's just some linear solve-a-mystery story, you're wrong. You're the Desert Rangers and you have a job to do. There's even a part where you have to help one of two areas and hear the area you didn't choose quickly go downhill. There's side-quests in dem darn hills and there be plenty. The only real complaint I have is that the quests can be quite vague. And I got pretty stumped on one quest only to find out there's a specific stat for the quest, and that's the ever-so-helpful skill of rapairing  toasters. Difficulty wise, this game can kick your a$# if you're not ready. Guns jam, stats are expensive, and even having a conversation will be tough without certain stats. The combat is turn-based with every character moving around a grid and performing actions with a set of AP (Action Points), every tile you go to takes one AP, attacking takes AP, healing takes AP, even things like reloading and crouching take AP. The game requires plenty of strategy and that strategy isn't just, ""Don't take cover by explosives, unload, repeat,"" and it can make quick work of your team, in other words this game is hard for anyone with a basic, or even no strategy.Overall, this game is tough if you do something without thinking, and it will make sure you know it, but it will still help you out by making the game in a way that takes you by the ear and puts you back in the right direction like how your mother used to.WASTELAND 2 gets an 8/10, and I reccomend it to those who want a test of the brain, and strategy, over.Now for the original WASTELAND...I'll just get an  LGR link. P.S. The third video (on the store page.) has gameplay from the LGR review of the original WASTELAND, watch the LGR review and look at the third video. It'll give you a kick.			"

												Ok, so I guess I'll give a quick review of this game.To start with: I've never played Wasteland 1. I'm a huge fan of Fallout series however. I consider Fallout 2 to be better than Fallout 1 (I'll get back to it in discussion of Wasteland 2 later on), and I've played both F1 and F2 about 5 and 10 times each respectively. Also I don't like Fallout tactics, that game is just below average, imho.Now, on to Wasteland 2:  It's not a game that I will be re-playing once I'll finish my playthrough. As you can see I'm 45h in the game, so I guess I'm  getting towards the later part of the game (my chars are lvl 25s right now). The learning curve in this game is pretty steep. The first ""real"" assignment that your rangers get (well, one of the possible assignments) was downright hard, with some tought combat, spars med supplies and a lot of cursing, when one of your rangers died towards the end of a long combat. To be honest, I almost dropped playing the game, because of it. However, after you overcome those 10 or so first hours, the game does open up. You get to visit more places, do more quests, grind some levels, meet new recruits, build your party and become an unstoppable force that steamrolls through anything. The locations that you visit are OK, some of the are interesting, some of them made me yawn.Quests don't always have a ""good"" ending, and there are situations where you no matter what you do, ""stuff"" just happens. Characters - well, your core party of 4 rangers can be either pre-made (an option I never used in any of the games, where you can craft your own characters), or created from scratch. You can even write their own ""biography"". The additional members of the team (you can have up to 7 members in your team) are acquired throughout the game. They have their own personalities, set of skills and quirks. I found some, to be more interesting than the others, and some can/will bail on you during the game, if either your leadership perk is low, or certain events happen. NPC's are all over the place, but they do their part, and some can engage with you in hillarious conversations.Gameplay - essentially the game is a mix of X-COM and ""old"" Fallout. Quests have multiple endings and solutions. You can travel the global map and visit locations a-la Fallout, the combat however is just like x-com with your characters having a certain ammount of APs determined by states that they can use per turn.Tone - that's why I've mentioned my F2 over F1 preference in the beginning of this review. Basically F2 had way more dark humor and the overal tone of the game shifted compared to a more ""serious"" and ""dark/brooding"" F1. Wasteland 2 is somewhere in between those two games, imho. The tone is darker than in F2, but you can still find some good laughs here.Enjoyment - overall, I think that inXile did a good job, for their first project. There are moments, where the game feels like it's ""crawling"" at a snail's pace, but there's plenty to enjoy here - you get an overal alright combat mechanic, a decent ammount of locations to visit and quests to complete, lots of dialogue, multiple resolutions to the quests. Basically what I expected when going into this game.Score: If nothing will change by the time I finish the game, I'd say an 8 is a fair score.Why won't I re-play the game? it lacks that unique Fallout charm. It has it's own charm, but I guess it's not enough to hold me for a second playthrough. "

Early Access Review
								i'll give u warning first, guys. because people tend to only read a review halfway through and the review, so i.ll say the cons of this game. since it's a beta, it has ton and tons of bugs everywhere. even though the devs are working really hard to fix them (and yes they do! if u played the earlier betas u'll notice) but still if ur system is on 32-bit windows then i FORBID u from buying this game for now. because u'll get CTDs like every 5 minute.the game itself is very nice and complex. if u ever played fallout, u'll notice many similarities between these two, like the skills, or how things work or maybe the lore itself.the gameplay itself is very, very challenging and u can do many approach to do ur quest. a living and vivid world, that is changing with ur every choice u make in the game. i can't say much about the graphic but i assure u, once u play this game u wouldn't care about the graphic anymore.

												What a game. one of the first Kickstarter successes and the first of a return to the isometric top down RPG's of the early 2000's.Wasteland 2 follows on from Wasteland a few years after the end of the first game. You play a group new recruits out to investigate the death of a fellow Ranger, but get sucked into something much bigger.It doesn't quite have the depth of games like Baldurs Gate, but the humour it gives, the world it portrays and the character you meet are really diverse, from your lowly farmer to the suicidal mini-nuke cult thing who's name escapes me!If you grew up with BG, or IWD, this is very good return to those nostalgic days.

												First off, If you're born after the early 80's or discovered gaming late in life this game is probably not for you. I tried wasteland 2 (not directors cut) during the free weekend. I fondly remember the first fallout- and baldurs gate games and this is just like them. People have been bashing this game as slow paced and un-imersive but I disagree. Its slower paced than most games today, yes, but this is how it used to be with action rpg's all across the board back when. Its not un-immersive, you just have to immerse yourself as there's no great visuals to suck you in. There's so much to discover just by not skipping dialogue. The game made me feel nostalgic and I had many recollections of past games in the genre. Totally worth it for ~15-20$ just for that 'blast from the past' feeling! I'll definately get it when the price is right. One con is that the weapon balancing seems off. There's a heavy bias towards assault rifles but in the whole this is a minor issue.			"

												An excelent Wasteland 1 sequel. If you except Fallout Tactics then this is as close as you can get. If you expect Fallout 1 or 2 then you have the wrong expectation.It is nonetheless a dark disturbing tour of a post apokalyptica, one can only say: lucky are those that died.They created this world and atmosphere so well that there are places that just make you full of hatred for the injustice seen.A very told tale that emphacises your characters to be not just brutes but rather smarty pants for the wastes are more dangerous for fools.

												OK I almost never write reviews and played this game mostly in offline mode, but seeing the mixed reviews just made me angry. This game, like many cRPGs only gets better as time wears on. Many people hear ""oh it's like fallout? must be amazing!"" then realize it was like FO1 & FO2, not the shooter sequels. I quite like the new Fallouts, and New Vegas is my favorite Fallout ever, but this a cRPG through and through. If you want a cRPG this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ masterpiece. If you enjoy this I recommend Pillars of Eternity.			"

												As a kickstart backer, and an admirer of interplay/blackisle games, i cant recommend the game. The game doesnt feel complete, deep, open world or tactical at all. it is quite linear as there are only few places you can go at a given time. it isnt tactical as all you can do is basically shoot.it is nothing close to fallout (which I have to compare it to, naturally).rather than listing all my disappointments, since I agree with many points of some negative reviewers here, i will just compare the fact that, i have completed fallout-2 multiple times with different builds, choices, etc... but I have completed Wasteland 2 only once and uninstalled it right away. (although the story was okay-ish) the game is just plain boring somehow. i didnt even get excited when my whole squad leveled up... no perks nothing special, just pump up your existing skills for harder checks the game will throw at you.

												Wasteland 2 is the first of hopefully many games made for people who like proper RPGs and not (just) explosions and chain bikinis.It's an old-school RPG, meant to be played with thought and investment, but not so much thought and investment that it'll scare away newbies. Basically the best game of the last 4 years, hands down, even though it's not without flaws.Of course, any gamer worth its salt will have played, finished and enjoyed plenty of critically bugged and flawed games, because, in the end, a bugs can be patched, crappy design can't. And Wasteland 2 is a diamond with a couple of rough edges, at most.Brilliant.			"

												The Pros: This game is dripping with atmosphere and has some amazing writing. The core gameplay mechanics are solid, and it ultimately delivers on exactly what it promises.The Cons: The 'annoyance factor' is pretty high. The game is filled with things that aren't prohibitively terrible, but just make you sigh and roll your eyes constantly. The weapon jamming mechanic adds nothing to gameplay and exists solely to be a pain in the butt from time to time, the camera often gets stuck behind things and makes seeing certain interactive objects very difficult, the game does not automatically reload weapons after battle, combat often feels kinda slow-paced and janky, etc, etc. Like I said, the issues with the game are not dealbreakers, but there are a lot of things here which just seem downright bad from a design perspective - many of which would have been fine ten or fifteen years ago, which is the era of gaming Wasteland 2 takes a lot of its cues from - but are just not acceptable by modern sandards.  It's still a really good game and again, I'd recommend it just for the atmosphere alone - they NAILED that aspect in particular just about perfectly. But it feels like they could have done better.

												Pretty simple actually: if you liked the classic Fallouts - go for it. 50s switched for 80s, more goofy - think along the lines of ""A Boy and His Dog"" and ""Damnation Alley"" rather than ""Dr. Strangelove"" ;)If the combat system appears shallow, try higher difficulty settings.

												As a fan of Fallout I've waited a long time for a game to live up to its legacy, finally the game i was waiting for showed up, only had to wait about 20 years ;)I never did play wasteland one back in the day but I've since seeing where it all started made me to step back into the same world.Wasteland 2 has your standard fallout 1/2 combat system, with a bit of classic xcom. It's turn based and dependent on your stats and placement and a number of other factors. when not in combat you can move your party around real time. I find the compromise perfect for giving you enough control in fights while not slowing down the game too much.I'm very happy with the game and recommend it to anyone who likes this style of RPG.

Early Access Review
								Just playing the beta, but my god, it was time to have a Wasteland / Fallout (1 or 2) type of game in which the developer does not hold your hand pointing you to go from arrow to arrow, no Sir! This is a game for a true armchair general, utilizing turn based combat; the gentlemen's way to fight. Including full 3d top down violent depictions of violence of the murdering of your fellow men. This is the type of game in which you take your time to plot your next move. Not Run N' Gun, but Think then Shoot. this is going to be a huge timesink for me. And i'm already in love with this the same way a piggie loves his mud.			"

												My first night playing the final version of this game I found myself up past 3am. This hasn't happened since the Mass Effect series and Skyrim. The theme of Wasteland 2 is consequence. This is very much the same as Wasteland 1, but more pronounced. Everything you do has consequences, not just the little things like missing a target on the battlefield or epic things like the survival of mankind; though, those are certainly there. Your choices decides what individuals, factions, and settlements survive. Who you help affects who will help you in turn and even make new enemies. Despite the natural technical limitations of any scripted game, inXile has managed to deliver a game that provides a near a living, breathing world as I've ever seen. Even if that world is a radioactive wasteland rasping out what could be its last breath at any moment.There is a certain level of complexity to the game, but the character system (attributes, skills, equipment, and combat) is simple enough that you can grasp them quickly. The reason for this complexity quickly becomes apparent as you find you can use different skills to try to get around the same obstacles, offering you multiple approaches to the same problem.This freedom cascades in all things: how you build characters, how you approach encounters, the soluitons you choose, and the direction you take. Where there is a certain amount of gating (e.g. you must have these rad suits to safely proceed), you are free to explore, ignoring missions and quests as you like. This exploration can be quite rewarding as you find shrines and caches, but it can also get you in trouble as you face enemies more powerful than you. Again, consequences. Enemies don't ""level"" with you; so if someone's too tough, just come back later. There's still some bugs, sure, especially once you leave the desert for overgrown marsh of LA, but none of them are game breaking and I'm sure they will get shaken out.			"

												Ok, so I guess I'll give a quick review of this game.To start with: I've never played Wasteland 1. I'm a huge fan of Fallout series however. I consider Fallout 2 to be better than Fallout 1 (I'll get back to it in discussion of Wasteland 2 later on), and I've played both F1 and F2 about 5 and 10 times each respectively. Also I don't like Fallout tactics, that game is just below average, imho.Now, on to Wasteland 2:  It's not a game that I will be re-playing once I'll finish my playthrough. As you can see I'm 45h in the game, so I guess I'm  getting towards the later part of the game (my chars are lvl 25s right now). The learning curve in this game is pretty steep. The first ""real"" assignment that your rangers get (well, one of the possible assignments) was downright hard, with some tought combat, spars med supplies and a lot of cursing, when one of your rangers died towards the end of a long combat. To be honest, I almost dropped playing the game, because of it. However, after you overcome those 10 or so first hours, the game does open up. You get to visit more places, do more quests, grind some levels, meet new recruits, build your party and become an unstoppable force that steamrolls through anything. The locations that you visit are OK, some of the are interesting, some of them made me yawn.Quests don't always have a ""good"" ending, and there are situations where you no matter what you do, ""stuff"" just happens. Characters - well, your core party of 4 rangers can be either pre-made (an option I never used in any of the games, where you can craft your own characters), or created from scratch. You can even write their own ""biography"". The additional members of the team (you can have up to 7 members in your team) are acquired throughout the game. They have their own personalities, set of skills and quirks. I found some, to be more interesting than the others, and some can/will bail on you during the game, if either your leadership perk is low, or certain events happen. NPC's are all over the place, but they do their part, and some can engage with you in hillarious conversations.Gameplay - essentially the game is a mix of X-COM and ""old"" Fallout. Quests have multiple endings and solutions. You can travel the global map and visit locations a-la Fallout, the combat however is just like x-com with your characters having a certain ammount of APs determined by states that they can use per turn.Tone - that's why I've mentioned my F2 over F1 preference in the beginning of this review. Basically F2 had way more dark humor and the overal tone of the game shifted compared to a more ""serious"" and ""dark/brooding"" F1. Wasteland 2 is somewhere in between those two games, imho. The tone is darker than in F2, but you can still find some good laughs here.Enjoyment - overall, I think that inXile did a good job, for their first project. There are moments, where the game feels like it's ""crawling"" at a snail's pace, but there's plenty to enjoy here - you get an overal alright combat mechanic, a decent ammount of locations to visit and quests to complete, lots of dialogue, multiple resolutions to the quests. Basically what I expected when going into this game.Score: If nothing will change by the time I finish the game, I'd say an 8 is a fair score.Why won't I re-play the game? it lacks that unique Fallout charm. It has it's own charm, but I guess it's not enough to hold me for a second playthrough. "

												What I like about this game is it doesn't hold your hand from the start. The character building is deep enough that you have to really think about rounding your team out. For instance you might not want a heavy gunner and an assault rifleman because they use the same kind of ammo, which can be sparse. Every fight requires some strategization, from avoiding triggering environmental stuff to positioning your shotgunners so they don't also pellet the guy in front of them. The game is also difficult enough that I don't feel bad about savescumming. At first I was honestly wondering why there wasn't an ironman mode because that seems to be so popular nowadays, but I see why. This is one of the few games lately that can keep my attention for hours on end. It might not be for everyone but I highly recommend it for people who enjoy CRPGS because so far it's gone toe to toe with the classics and has me curious about Wasteland 1.  "

												A solid return for a beloved series and another title for 2014 that shows the turn based tactical RPG of old is making a comeback in a big way. The original game inspired the Fallout series and with this game they return the the spirit of Fallout 1 and 2 with a party based RPG with tactical turn based combat. Set about 20 years after the events of Wasteland 1 (Its not neccesary to play that game, Wasteland 2 is a stand alone story. Though fans who played it will see various call outs to the original)  You play a rookie in the desert rangers, a group of people dedicated to bringing law and order to the Wasteland. Surrounded by radiation from the war, a lot of people believe the rest of the world is completely destroyed, though a series of strange events that you are sent to investigate indicates that this is not the case and as the plot unfolds its clear that there are far greater threats in this ruined world that wandering bandits.  You have a lot of choice about how you go about things and you can either be a saviour or an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ depending on the choices you make, though if you go to far down the dark side, be prepared for consequences. The world is huge and the large variety of skills you can master means that most situations will have various ways to overcome them, though be prepared to spill a lot of blood as not everyone can be reasoned with or manipulated. The plot is interesting and its fun to see how the designers portray the post apocalyptic world. It also has a suprisingly dark sense of humour and there are quite few moments that will make you smile or even laugh out loud. Despite being set in a Fallout type post nuclear world the game still manages to have its own identity and feel like its own game. I personally love both and highly recommend it to Fallout fans and fans of old school RPG's or post apocalyptic settings. If you are a fan of all three, just buy the game right now, you won't be disappointed!			"

												The Pros: This game is dripping with atmosphere and has some amazing writing. The core gameplay mechanics are solid, and it ultimately delivers on exactly what it promises.The Cons: The 'annoyance factor' is pretty high. The game is filled with things that aren't prohibitively terrible, but just make you sigh and roll your eyes constantly. The weapon jamming mechanic adds nothing to gameplay and exists solely to be a pain in the butt from time to time, the camera often gets stuck behind things and makes seeing certain interactive objects very difficult, the game does not automatically reload weapons after battle, combat often feels kinda slow-paced and janky, etc, etc. Like I said, the issues with the game are not dealbreakers, but there are a lot of things here which just seem downright bad from a design perspective - many of which would have been fine ten or fifteen years ago, which is the era of gaming Wasteland 2 takes a lot of its cues from - but are just not acceptable by modern sandards.  It's still a really good game and again, I'd recommend it just for the atmosphere alone - they NAILED that aspect in particular just about perfectly. But it feels like they could have done better.

												Really enjoyed this game.+ Old-school like post-apocalyptic world-saving :-) (a bit like Fallout)+ large world+ quests with multiple choises/endings+ ~50h for a relatively fast playthrough+ large amounts of lore-text, descriptive texts- large amounts of text :-) If you don't like reading walls of text then this game isn't for you. Very little voice-acting- minor bugs (e.g. lower-tier radiation suit doesn't get thrown away if you get the higher tier; can't sell)- sometimes not enough info for quests given (I would like to see a game which does the questlog like morrowind. A transcript of the conversation.) -> needed to consult wiki for some quests- not the best graphics- could use more diverse audioIf you are into oldschool post-apocalypse RPGs, like to spend a little time to get immersed and don't mind reading text then this is the right game for you.If you want the best graphics and are a fan of 'show, don't tell' -> better get one of the newer Fallouts			"

												Congratulations to the team at inXile, this is truly a masterpiece that makes the former titles Wasteland & Fallout 1/2 proud to be its daddy/grand daddy. I have not had such a good cRPG experience in a LONG time. The tactical combat is excellent overall.There is a slight imbalance in the weapon designs overall, ie. Assault Rifles far outclass the rest, in particular with other burst weapons SMGs & Heavy Machine Guns, both do much less dmg per shot but fire more to achieve a similar result. It means you are wasting much more ammo for the same effect. The bigger calibre Hvy Machine Guns should definitely be doing more dmg per shot (with more armor penetration) than AR, but fire less often, not the other way around!			"

												First off, wait until this game has been out a few months before buying it.  It needs several rounds of patches, especially in the 2nd area.Anyway, it is rare to get a sqad based game ala Jagged Alliance, let alone one set in a post-appocolyptic world.  I did have fun exploring the world despite the bugs. I would rate the combat mechanics as a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10.  They are servicable and certanly can be improved.The skill gain system is quite dull, such as the next rank just adds 6% to some ability (hit with a guy, unlock something, disarm something, etc...).  Some of the puzzles in the game are not very intuitive.  I had to google a few of them, but hopefully if you wait a few months, there will be some nice faqs.  Even after reading the solutions to some of them, they are things I would have never figured out.  For in one area you find a screw driver.  In another room there are some odd looking tiles here and there.  No tool tip, just odd looking.  The thing is, there is no hint that you need to use the screw driver on these tiles.  Even given that, if you use the screw driver on the wrong tile (of the right kind) it tells you that you can't use the screwdriver on that.  So that would lead you to think that isn't the right use for the screw driver.  However there is one tile which looks just like all the rest of the tiles that say ""You can't use the screwdriver on that"" that you CAN use it on, which has the tresure you are looking for.Then there are other objects you find that have NO CLUE as to thier use, but indeed are useful to someone, somewhere.  Here is a hint, the stuff you get out of toasters IS USEFUL to SOMEONE SOMEWHERE.  It may even be useful to someone in another act.Anyhow, you might be wondering why I am recommending this to buy with the above said.  Despite all that, it is a fun game.  I enjoyed the exploration and the story.  I did not finish it because it was too buggy in the 2nd act.  Maybe I will someday because I am curious as to how the story turns out.			"

												As a fan of Fallout I've waited a long time for a game to live up to its legacy, finally the game i was waiting for showed up, only had to wait about 20 years ;)I never did play wasteland one back in the day but I've since seeing where it all started made me to step back into the same world.Wasteland 2 has your standard fallout 1/2 combat system, with a bit of classic xcom. It's turn based and dependent on your stats and placement and a number of other factors. when not in combat you can move your party around real time. I find the compromise perfect for giving you enough control in fights while not slowing down the game too much.I'm very happy with the game and recommend it to anyone who likes this style of RPG.

												Ok, so I guess I'll give a quick review of this game.To start with: I've never played Wasteland 1. I'm a huge fan of Fallout series however. I consider Fallout 2 to be better than Fallout 1 (I'll get back to it in discussion of Wasteland 2 later on), and I've played both F1 and F2 about 5 and 10 times each respectively. Also I don't like Fallout tactics, that game is just below average, imho.Now, on to Wasteland 2:  It's not a game that I will be re-playing once I'll finish my playthrough. As you can see I'm 45h in the game, so I guess I'm  getting towards the later part of the game (my chars are lvl 25s right now). The learning curve in this game is pretty steep. The first ""real"" assignment that your rangers get (well, one of the possible assignments) was downright hard, with some tought combat, spars med supplies and a lot of cursing, when one of your rangers died towards the end of a long combat. To be honest, I almost dropped playing the game, because of it. However, after you overcome those 10 or so first hours, the game does open up. You get to visit more places, do more quests, grind some levels, meet new recruits, build your party and become an unstoppable force that steamrolls through anything. The locations that you visit are OK, some of the are interesting, some of them made me yawn.Quests don't always have a ""good"" ending, and there are situations where you no matter what you do, ""stuff"" just happens. Characters - well, your core party of 4 rangers can be either pre-made (an option I never used in any of the games, where you can craft your own characters), or created from scratch. You can even write their own ""biography"". The additional members of the team (you can have up to 7 members in your team) are acquired throughout the game. They have their own personalities, set of skills and quirks. I found some, to be more interesting than the others, and some can/will bail on you during the game, if either your leadership perk is low, or certain events happen. NPC's are all over the place, but they do their part, and some can engage with you in hillarious conversations.Gameplay - essentially the game is a mix of X-COM and ""old"" Fallout. Quests have multiple endings and solutions. You can travel the global map and visit locations a-la Fallout, the combat however is just like x-com with your characters having a certain ammount of APs determined by states that they can use per turn.Tone - that's why I've mentioned my F2 over F1 preference in the beginning of this review. Basically F2 had way more dark humor and the overal tone of the game shifted compared to a more ""serious"" and ""dark/brooding"" F1. Wasteland 2 is somewhere in between those two games, imho. The tone is darker than in F2, but you can still find some good laughs here.Enjoyment - overall, I think that inXile did a good job, for their first project. There are moments, where the game feels like it's ""crawling"" at a snail's pace, but there's plenty to enjoy here - you get an overal alright combat mechanic, a decent ammount of locations to visit and quests to complete, lots of dialogue, multiple resolutions to the quests. Basically what I expected when going into this game.Score: If nothing will change by the time I finish the game, I'd say an 8 is a fair score.Why won't I re-play the game? it lacks that unique Fallout charm. It has it's own charm, but I guess it's not enough to hold me for a second playthrough. "

												An excelent Wasteland 1 sequel. If you except Fallout Tactics then this is as close as you can get. If you expect Fallout 1 or 2 then you have the wrong expectation.It is nonetheless a dark disturbing tour of a post apokalyptica, one can only say: lucky are those that died.They created this world and atmosphere so well that there are places that just make you full of hatred for the injustice seen.A very told tale that emphacises your characters to be not just brutes but rather smarty pants for the wastes are more dangerous for fools.

												Wasteland 2 is the first of hopefully many games made for people who like proper RPGs and not (just) explosions and chain bikinis.It's an old-school RPG, meant to be played with thought and investment, but not so much thought and investment that it'll scare away newbies. Basically the best game of the last 4 years, hands down, even though it's not without flaws.Of course, any gamer worth its salt will have played, finished and enjoyed plenty of critically bugged and flawed games, because, in the end, a bugs can be patched, crappy design can't. And Wasteland 2 is a diamond with a couple of rough edges, at most.Brilliant.			"

												As a kickstart backer, and an admirer of interplay/blackisle games, i cant recommend the game. The game doesnt feel complete, deep, open world or tactical at all. it is quite linear as there are only few places you can go at a given time. it isnt tactical as all you can do is basically shoot.it is nothing close to fallout (which I have to compare it to, naturally).rather than listing all my disappointments, since I agree with many points of some negative reviewers here, i will just compare the fact that, i have completed fallout-2 multiple times with different builds, choices, etc... but I have completed Wasteland 2 only once and uninstalled it right away. (although the story was okay-ish) the game is just plain boring somehow. i didnt even get excited when my whole squad leveled up... no perks nothing special, just pump up your existing skills for harder checks the game will throw at you.

												I played Wasteland 2 Directors cut on the recent free weekend as it was on my wishlist and was pleased with the game play overall. The world seems open ended but has it's linear quirks to deal with.Pros:Story premise was engagingGood customizationGood mix of real time / turn based playTrue RPG feelCons:Lacks tutorial insightGraphical detail adequate but not stunningVoice acting is mediocre, story averageI would recommend purchasing this item on sale. $40 seems a bit much for its age and quality.

												Despite it's flaws, Wasteland 2 is an amazing RPG and a great follow up to it's predecessor. While inspiring Fallout, it plays more like Fallout Tactics, Jagged Alliance or even XCom by focusing on turn based team tactics. It has a few rough spots, which have been mostly patched, but glitches still pop up once and a while. There is a fantastic sense of exploration in the first half of the game, despite the second half feeling quite linear. The progression is slow and steady and a good story develops. If you'e a fan of classic turn based rpgs, or just a fan of Fallout, it's a great game to pick up, especially at it's lower price point of 40$. Plus as a bonus you get the original, which is still very playable to this day.			"

												So I played this game while it was free for the weekend because the style grabbed my curiosity.The customization for character creation isn't bad, but there could be more to it. I think my biggest complaint is when you use your skills. I lost count on how many times I critically failed on something, when the chance of critically failing was like 1-5% chance. It's as if the percentages don't matter and it's all based on random chance. For example, I had to use computer science to unlock an electronic safe. I had a 98% to succeed, and I failed.....3 times in a row! This happened a lot more frequently, however, with disarming traps. Also this game leans heavily towards the intelligence attribute. If you don't have a high intelligence, it is incredibly hard to level up your characters' skills.Now the good things about the game. The storyline is pretty well done, although there could be more rewarding side missions. I like the play style of the game and the fact that you can move the camera practically however you want. I started the game on rookie, cause I have never played this game before, and it was still pretty difficult, until you got the hang of it and became OP.With all of that said, and I probably could have added more to both pros and cons, it isn't a bad game. Is it worth more than $20? No way. That's the most I'd pay for it. But it is a game worth buying. Just get it when there's a deal for it.			"

												Played it on the free weekend, convinced me to buy(Quick summary) - it's pretty much modernized fallout 1 and 2 if you liked those or didn't like the dated visuals but liked the gameplay like me, this is something you'd enjoy(Actual review) - As a person who loved fallout 3 and new vegas I was inspired to look back at the original games and buy them, but after about 5-6 hours couldn't stand the dated graphics any longer, they simply aged horribly. Why am I mentioning this you might ask? Well, this game is pretty much the old fallout games brought into the new age and while it's visuals arn't super impressive compared to many modern games, they get the job done and it runs with a good framerate. This game has tons of variety in weapons, weapon types, skills, etc. that makes each character feel unique and useful (although i'd recommend having mulitple people with the surgery skill so you don't have to reload cause your healer went down and died because nobody knew how to use bandages). Some cons with this game are that the camera can occasionally bug out when dealing with walls and that it suddenly has a massive difficulty curve once you reach the prison but overall it has good gameplay and systems and the devs knew what they were doing. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys both strategy games and adventure games with a post apocalyptic feel.if i'd be forced to give it a numarical rating i'd give it a 7.5/10, it's not perfect by any means but it's damn fun			"

												Fantastic! Beautiful graphics and superb gameplay, not to mention the vivid and rich story. I never played the first wasteland nor even heard of it but watching the devs videos and posts, this seems a great homage to the first wasteland game. It's refreshing to see Devs working so hard to produce a game that gamers WANT!It's also refreshing to play a game where YOU have to keep track of your missions and solve them by yourself, rather than having and giant cursor saying ""This is your objective"" or ""Go here to advance"".This game does not hold your hand.

												A great post-apocalyptic RPG experience that is just as fun as many Fallout titles. Good quests with divergent choices invite replays, and the overall atmosphere quality and enjoyable combat support that. Wasteland 2 suffers at times from a lack of polish and a lack of balance, but a new update addresses some of the former, and a few restarts (or a guide) will help you with some of latter.			"

												Having spent more than 200 hours with this game I can fairly confirm that this is a masterpiece and if you a fan of turn based tactic combat you shouldn't miss it. Or if you fan of Fallout theme. Personally I think that Wasteland 2 surpassed the original Fallout series in terms of gameplay complexity, variability of items and characters development and it's on par with it predecessor in fields of quests creativity and openness of the world. Having said all that the game isn't without flaws which are mostly quest bugs related to the insufficient testing of the last episodes of the game, namely Hollywood area. But I believe those will be fixed fairly soon. "

This was unecessary and felt like a waste of time.Overall great game ! Would recommend to anyone who enjoyed Fallout 1-2, Jagged Alliance or X-com type of game.			"

												I have just finished Wasteland 2, and thought this the perfect time to write a review.Honestly, I was very close to marking this game as not recommended, and I will explain this first. The game boasts that every player has a unique gaming experience but I truthfully do not believe this, quests and side quests are so linear that it is very easy to predict their result and I have never played a game where you gain a huge chunk of experience every 5-10 minutes, it is very easy to level up. The level cap is 50, my characters finished on level 48, levels 38 onwards are useless as there are not enough quests to warrant the skills needed from levelling. Finally, and most importantly I was really really disappointed by the last 5-10 hours of the game, it was hugely rushed and it was so blindly obvious as to what was going to happen.Now onto the good bits, and why I have decided to recommend this game. The world of Wasteland 2 is very open and after completing the first quest you are very much able to just wander off and find your feet. The biggest perk to me was building my own team of 4 very contrasting rangers, but as others have said honestly most weapon types are useless by the end game, I had 2 assault rifle users and 3 snipers including an NPC. The inhabitants of Wateland 2 are lovingly built and the game does have alot of dry humour which I found quite refreshing, and once again as others have stated, all NPCS are very down to earth and honest - most people are dead, life is ♥♥♥♥, everybody is fending for themselves, they hate rangers regardless of what you decide to do. Dont pick up this game expecting to be some end game hero of the world like BG1 and 2. You will always be jerks according to most of the population.This is what I loved so much about Wasteland. It is a very honest game and for this reason, very realistic. You can craft weapons, if you are not strong enough for body armour you are useless in a fight, you have to reload your weaons or you go in to the next fight with empty magazines, weapons jam and bullets are expensive, barter skills do not help significantly, I could go on. These are just a few parts which I loved. This game does not hand feed you, it kicks you out of the door and if you can't disarm that bomb or unlock that door or patch up that wound then you don't get some silly perk to be able to do it, you have to come back when you are stronger.I could write paragraphs and paragraphs, but in the end Wasteland 2 is very realistic and the story line is gritty and substantial. The graphics are not great but this is more than made up for by the amount of in game material to keep you busy. Overall? 7/10.			"

												Well, a solid 41 hours later leaves me with a rather lacklustre sense of achievement, and a general confusion and frustration with how long it took to end. The lack of tactical options is frustrating - to say the least. Definitely an improvement over similar modern titles in the like of XCom, however compared to the classics the tactical options still fall tremendously short.I also have trouble seeing past the walls of text - in the end, I just didn't care. I didn't care about the characters, I didn't care about the storyline, the game just left me with a general sense of ""meh"". The throwbacks to pop culture were initally funny, but dragged on and ultimately became just another ""meh"" moment.The skill system became trivial towards the end of the game, where there were more than enough points to go around.Difficulty curve? The ""difficult"" part of the game is scaled by opponent health, which, after carrying around launchers for most of the game, quickly disappeared. I think the ""hardest"" part of the game was working out which option to choose, which in itself is another attempt at ""grey"" decisions. Spoilers ahead;I saved the AG centre. I never saw ANY repecussions in the game world for not saving Highpool, besides a slightly different map and a shout-out at the end of the game, trying to guilt trip the player because of a choice they could do nothing over. If I'd saved Highpool, I probably wouild have received the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.I also defused the nuke in the canyon. The monks disappeared? No cares whatsoever - I never saw any repecussions in my game, except for a slightly different map on the way out of ♥♥♥♥-central. Overall, a very solid ""meh"" out of 10.Didn't care about the story, didn't care about the characters, didn't care for the combat system. Not even sure why I finished it, but I did. So that's something.			"

												With tons of lore and plenty of content, I found my self pouring hours in to this game. Wasteland 2 may not have the best graphics, but for a game on a budget, it did pretty good. The game definately does things better than some games that came out in 2014. However, there are a few bugs. Such as characters not wanting to follow where you tell them to and your mouse disappearing, but usually these can be fixed with a quick restart of the game out return to the main menu. I found myself laughing at the little things in Wasteland 2, as well as reading it's what seemed like endless lore, doing it's numerous side quests, and replaying the game to see the affects of the choices I did not make in my first run. In all I give Wasteland 2 a 9/10 since there are some bugs that need to be fixed and the character customization could use some work ( the characters look pretty bad and ugly close up), but in all the game is really fun.

												Wasteland 2 the sequal to the 1988 game wasteland first off this is the beta version so my review is of the beta so when the full game comes out it will be way better. But first off this game is going to teach you one thing life is hard and your going to get hit to the ground and kicked in the gut this game aint forgiving party members will die forever if you let them and ammo is a real problem at some points so if you are in for a kitty land adventure no you will only get MASSIVE ACTION AND RTS !!!!!!!!!!.But with every game glitches and probs. I have run into strange lag spikes npcs not talking and some other problems and also game crashing but this only happened once and runs almost god like on my pc. So yea i would recommend this game 7-8/10 i think maybe when full release 9-10/10			"

												Crowdfunding done right!!!   This was one of the best gaming experiences I have had in a very long time.   The level of detail that went into the story made for an extremely immersive experience.   While some people may not be a fan of the genre,  overall,  this is a must buy.I will caution you, I ran into a bug towards the end of the game.  Despite my efforts I was not able to fix,  and decided to move on.   I will not post any spoilers,  but I will say it happened in the Hollywood area, which is around 80% thorugh the game.Despite the bug,  I soldiered on and had a great experience overall.  I want to give the game a five out of five,  but the bug that I encountered was extremely frustrating.  While I am sure that this will be addressed in a future patch,  because after doing some digging on the internet,  I wasn't the first person to encounter it.Having said that,  I will be making my way through the game again, (after the next patch is released),  as there are so many choices that impact the game, I want to go through the game differently and see how it all plays out.Very good game,  but would be absolutely amazing when the bugs are addressed.4 out of 5.

												In my opinion one of the best top-down games. It remembers me at the beginning of my early gaming experiences in the first fallout parts. Maybe I fall in love with this game cause I grew up with titles like the x-com parts and fallout. I hope there will be more games in this style in the future.			"

												It was a bit hard to get into, but as the story develops and as you learn more about mechanics, possibilities, the way NPCs react on your choices and actions, it gets very addictive.Director's Cut improved the base game quite nicely too, there is close to zero tedious micromanagement now which was bothering some players in the base-game (not me though, I liked that I had to choose the properly skilled character to perform some actions). It has its drawbacks, but overall I think it deserves a recommendation.			"

												The best thing I can say about this game is I had fun the whole time I played it.The team you make will define how you play the game. Where some other strategy games force you to rely on one ally to win every battle. here each person has a role to play and the skills truly do matter as to how you will overcome challenges. There are so many differnt ways to complete each objective.  The voice work is also really well done as is the Leveling up system. Hard to find a negitive thing to say about this game, Just fun the whole way through.			"

												I bought wastland 2 while it was in beta. I loved the game from the start, and actually wanted to support Brian Fargo.It was a great experince playing the beta to the finished verison. Of course any major patch would break your saves, but it's that type of game where you want to restart a few times anyway, more so to play with your Characters stats. I will say a lot of people have wrote about the game not being very tatical. There is some truth to that, there aren't too many cases where you can strage your characters for a fight, most encounters are just a straight up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ contest. A couple of hours just exploring the wasteland and looting will turn you into one tough ranger. In the start of the game it seemed like there would be a lot of choices that would directly effect the game. Basically there is only one major choice to be made in the game and really only effects which character your going to pick up as a side kick. Some of the weapons don't hold much value, such as rocket launchers. Generally before you can use one the baddies are  on top of you already, or it's just not worth using. But it's interesting that you do have to have  players who are better with riffles than lazer weapons, which is part of the tatical portion of the game. Basically each Character should be very well rounded with two different weapons, more so till about 30 hours into the game. You can't have everyone using the same ammo. Half the game takes place in AZ and the other half in CA. CA is interesting because things just get very strange. In any post nuclear war game youe expect raiders and mutant frogs, but crazy nuns? I wish the AZ portion of the game had more of the odd ball encounters you ran in during CA. The Characters in CA are more interesting as well as the plot.What I don't understand is the water movement system. In the first half the game you need to refill your canteens which isn't a big deal. In the second half, the concept just stops. It's minor, I'm not sure why I'm even bringing it up but it seemed like a major portion of the game but slowly got scaled back. I had a lot of fun with this game, like fallout you play for the story and the ride, not so much the end result. It does have a lot of replayability, but as I said I played it from beta which meant I had several restarts. It does let you import your characters that you have progressed through out the game when you finish. A lot of the skills overlap, and there is more than one way to open a door generally. I paid 60 dollars for the game and got a little over 230 hours of pure enjoyment of the game, it was worth every penny. I just hope they make a wasteland 3 or a DLC to the game. One thing they should add is being able to make your own rangers at your base even after you started. I think that would be a fun concept.			"

												Bbbbbbrilliant!I won't lie, I was a huge fan of the first Wasteland, so this was kind of a no-brainer for me. THEN AGAIN I was a huge fan of Diablo 2 and Diablo 3 was a pretty huge let down. Same with Master of Orion 2 to Master of Orion 3. Sequels sometimes suck, but this one totally didn't. As a game, it's pretty unforgiving, and I like that. You screw up and don't have the right array of skills, you'll pay for it. (on a side note, bring 2 people with the surgeon skill. Any level, doesn't matter, just be sure one can revive the other) Not paying attention to your ammo stores? You'll pay for that too. Murder some random civilian? Depending on who, where, and when, yeah that'll bite you pretty hard too. Most things in the wastes want to kick your ♥♥♥ or some reason or another, so you kind of have to stay on the ball. Normally I'd complain about the lack of explanation and tutorial, but I feel like they built this game to be like the games of the 80's and 90's where you sort of were thrown into things and just had to figure them out, and in spite of getting the crap kicked out of me repeatedly, I appreciate that here. On a side note, you don't need to play the first one at all to enjoy this one. It's been many years and I don't remember much from the first one, and I still had a blast with this. On another side note, there are a crap ton of 80's references a lot of folks won't get. Hell, I'm pretty sure I didn't even get most of them. My most successful arrangement so far went something like :The heavy - bladed weapons / shotguns. Obvious muscle skills. Hard ♥♥♥. The B&E sniper - exclusively sniper rifles. Safecracking and alarm disarming, etc. Kiss ♥♥♥. Auxilliary surgeon. The leader - SMGs / Energy weapons (huge in the late game). Leadership, medic, surgeon. Smart ♥♥♥. The gunner - AR / Heavy weapons. Demolitions, survival, miscellany. For NPCs on both play throughs I turned one into a second sniper (two snipers is devastating), turned another into a second melee / shotgun guy, and the last was kind of open. Go forth and turn people into blood sausages!			"

												I've been playing Fallout 2 since I first bought it new in 98' and never got the chance to ever play Wasteland, although I was aware of it and its profound influence. I picked up this game as soon as I could afford it and have fallen in love with isometric turn based combat all over again. I first played this on my off the shelf HP desktop with just a factory AMD A8-6500 using integrated Radeon 8570D graphics. This game played well with decent performance in all situations without measuring FPS on low settings. I since have added a GTX 750 Ti and can play the game maxed out and it is running over 60fps in all situations. So with my A8 barely on par with an Intel i3, anyone can pretty much enjoy this game on low end systems. Graphics: 10/10, it is beautiful and is what you would expect from a Fallout type universe. Combat: 10/10, some nice features that remind me of FO Tactics, familiar and easy to grasp.Gameplay: 10/10, much like Fallout games there is lots to see and do, side missions and quests, hidden things, locked or blocked things you can't get to until you level up or gain a perk. Good replayability. A major tip for new players: Make sure when building your squad you incorporate certain skills. This is not like Fallout games where you could master all skills throughout the game such as demolitions, lockpick, traps etc. This game forces you to equip characters with these skills or they simply will not be able to be utilized at all until you have a character possesing that particular skill. So if you start your squad and nobody has lockpicking skill, you will not be able to lockpick any doors at all until you acquire someone that does have the skill. If you like Fallout or the genre, you will not be dissapointed! Price has consistently dropped over last few months, I paid full price and would again.			"

												An excellent game, a truly spiritual heir of Fallout 2.It's challenging, and while in my opinion the opening plot is not very immersive, it soon catches up and with its great, fallout-like gameplay (not the bethesda pewpew one, i mean the real fallout gameplay) you'll be soon wanting for more level after level.The combat is fun, never repetitive, and your choices affect how the game develops.Absolutely a must have.

												Crowdfunding done right!!!   This was one of the best gaming experiences I have had in a very long time.   The level of detail that went into the story made for an extremely immersive experience.   While some people may not be a fan of the genre,  overall,  this is a must buy.I will caution you, I ran into a bug towards the end of the game.  Despite my efforts I was not able to fix,  and decided to move on.   I will not post any spoilers,  but I will say it happened in the Hollywood area, which is around 80% thorugh the game.Despite the bug,  I soldiered on and had a great experience overall.  I want to give the game a five out of five,  but the bug that I encountered was extremely frustrating.  While I am sure that this will be addressed in a future patch,  because after doing some digging on the internet,  I wasn't the first person to encounter it.Having said that,  I will be making my way through the game again, (after the next patch is released),  as there are so many choices that impact the game, I want to go through the game differently and see how it all plays out.Very good game,  but would be absolutely amazing when the bugs are addressed.4 out of 5.

												It's a bit hard to get into at first as it goes back to alot of conventions of older games and you have to really pay attention to figure out what to do. But arizona and california feel like living breathing worlds and everything from combat to characters to storytelling is engaging and deep with a wealth of choices that aren't just good v. evil. The sense of humor is absolutely fantastic, it's never completely overbearing or annoying and it doesn't get in the way of the more heartbreaking moments and I feel it serves a great contrast, you will absolutely find yourself laughing out loud from time to time but you will also find yourself possiby tearing up at other moments. This game isn't heavy on hardware and I honestly feel that even though I'm only 20 hours in every single person who has a pc should at least try this game. This is an absolute MUST play for all pc gamers and lovers of all forms of art.			"

												Amazing Game. The original was the inspiration for fallout. This game is so in-depth that i'm drowning in gameplay. The feeling of having Miley Cyrus and Gabe Newell in the same party fighting along side each other as rangers of the wasteland is indescribable. The thought of killing infected, overgrown, man-eating death plants makes me want to chew my fingers off in excitement. Every choice you make has an effect on the story and changes the world around you so don't go muffing it up or you'll feel stupid.			"

												First what I liked:Pros: -A lot like fallout 2, which was really great I haven't played a game from start to finish like this since I can't even remember. Probably fallout. -Combat was really fun, weapons were enjoyable, deaths reminded me of fallout in a good way.-I enjoyed the vast world, and exploring.Really a great game, butCons (in my opinion)Spoiler alert.-First I have to mention the crashing, there was so much of that. I've never played a game with quite so much crashing and errors.-Where are all the secrets? I found a lot of hidden boxes and stuff like that, but truely awesome secret stuff I found myself constantly looking for and not finding.-No vaults? That was my favorite part of fallout, and yet no vaults to be found.-No mystery. You pretty much always know your objective, what is going on, with no twists to be had for the most part.Again I found myself wishing I would stumble across something epic, something amazing that changed the way I thought about the game. But no, just more of the same, kill move on, kill move on. I would definitely like to see mystery like the classic fallout games. You never knew what you were going to find at the depths of a random cave in the middle of no where.-No special encounters. Sure you would encounter a passing trader, no fun, or a shrine that gives you a quote and a skill point, but I long for something more, don't you guys remember how amazing it was to see that lightning bolt in fallout 2 and discover something completely random, and truely amazing? I kept waiting for those to appear because they are so interesting and again, are full of mystery. -Really cool followers. You guys remember the deathclaw/super mutant followers, as well as ghouls and various other creatures.  I didn't see anything remotely that cool, just a bunch of humans and of course there is the animal caller perk, but that wasn't really that cool either, the extent of the creatures you could control was so limited.-More weapons, and make them more difficult to come by, I remember in fallout 2 you were SO stoked to get your first weapon, finally a shotgun, or pistol with just a few rounds of ammo. It was incredibly more difficult then wasteland in that way. And that made it so satifying to finally start picking up some of those high end energy weapons near the end of the game. Gatlin laser mini gun, damn that thing was sweet.-No end game content, once you beat the game that's it. I would have loved if you had followed the fallout style and let you keep playing, maybe even adding in new locations and changing the areas based on what you found during the story line.So in conclusion, I hate to compare you guys to fallout so much, because the game was really nice, and fun. But you yourselves set the bar by comparing yourselves to fallout. I was expecting so much more from this honestly, and I finish the game a little dissapointed. I would still recommend the game, but I hope you guys read this, and step up the bar with wasteland 3, which I will buy, but again I really hope you raise the mystery factor, remember a really good story line leaves you with a few questions unanswered even by the end, always guessing and wondering what could happen next. It's that mystery that is the driving force, and without it, it feels like just point and shoot, continue. Most of the time I found myself skipping a lot of text because it was just so plain, and didn't really have to do with anything interesting, or ""out of the box"" type of thinking. Also the voice acting was not my favorite, I found myself turning down the volumn often, because it came off kind of cheesy honestly, and I understand it's a indie game but with the money you guys had, I want to see some serious skilled voice actors nail their rolls and really make you feel emotion.Sorry for all the negative feedback I hope you take it from a constructive perspective, I'm not trying to bash you guys I just want to see this game further embody the fallout genre.

												This game is amazing. It is what inspired the Fallout Series. Its like XCOM and Fallout had a baby and made this. Open world with tons of weapon customisations. I cant even talk about it cause i would literally take forever to explain what i like about this game... Which is EVERYTHING! Best game i have played in a long time. More developers need to take a page out of this game, get back to the roots of core RPG and story telling. All games dont need to be gloss and glamor.			"

												This game is super good. Combat is like X-Com light and is servicable but pretty simple. The story and world is pretty generic, but there's a ton of stuff to do and things to read, with over 800,000 words total (!).  The game really rewards exploration, as a result, it's very nonlinear and there are a bunch of secrets. There's a lot of cool faction stuff, plenty of choices that determine the fate of each area, and a pretty insane level of detail to boot. Probably the best Kickstarter game I've played yet.			"

												Phenomenal. This is what happens when you let talent of the likes of Brian Fargo and his dream team of writers and designers (and Mark Morgan) create the game they wish to make: a love letter to classic CRPGs full of rich descriptive text and atmosphere, amazing depth in options, laugh out loud ridiculousness, and several truly chilling moments. In an age of gaming where we've grown tired of pressing the win button, Wasteland 2 throws hundreds of possibilities in your direction and doesn't even pretend to try to hold your hand, allowing you the joy of discovery and surprise as your decisions often leave no clear cut winners. You'll often find yourself under-equipped and struggling to keep your party members alive, tossing those last few rounds of ammo to a teammate and praying for their 35% hit probability to go your way after enemies have left you devastated. And right when you think you've gotten the hang of things, new scenarios will put you firmly back in your place. Wasteland 2 is a shining beacon of what games once were, and a sensational example of what they very well can be today when the fans - and not profits - come first.			"

												For what it wants to be, it does everything right. It's an experience you could only get back in the day, with no handholding, no bottlenecked storytelling and no fast-travel. The combat is interesting as well, but with limited options. You can end up in situations that require changes in thinking and I like that. You will act differently when you are in a tight corridor againt snipers and shotgunners or vs Honey Badgers on a plain field.It got boring after a while, I played this game while it was free and I don't feel like buying it. The thing with this game is that you have to invest effort for the game to really shine; that means it isn't for everyone. You have to like reading a lot, and the plot took too long to develop so I have lost interest. You can read back on the log if you missed something, but you won't get an arrow pointing at the objective.The tone is very Fallout-y, as in, horrible and hilarious. the writing is good, in the dialogue and in the pop-ups that show up in the environment to set the mood.

Full disclosure: I am close friends with some of the developers of this game, however - I do not feel that this compromises the integrity of my review.I grew up playing the original Fallout, and other isometric-ish RPGs on the infinity engine. I've always had a soft spot in my heart for them and I honestly did not think I could ever return to that feeling.A friend picked up Wasteland 2 for me prior to release - I had my reservations when I started playing, but those went quickly out the window.Sure, it is said you can never go back to paradise -but you can come pretty close.I've just recently had the chance to finish my playthrough of Wasteland 2, the time and fun I've had from this title easily justifies the cost. However I don't think that is what I should leave as the primary point of the review.I am not one who enjoys replaying games, especially ones driven by a central narrative. I rarely find games that truly capture my attention and interest these days but Wasteland 2.. Well lets leave it at the following point:After completing Wasteland 2, I immediately wanted to reload my mid game save and play back through again with a different approach and playstyle to see how it affected the outcome of the game.I've not done that since the 90s. :)Loved this game, my game of the year for 2014.

												Review as of 10/21/14 (and you'll understand why I included the date shortly)In brief, Wasteland 2 is a mostly-awesome Kickstarter (TM) funded game tainted by some very bad decision making.The game picks up where its predecessor left off, you are recruits for the Desert Rangers, a peace-keeping force in a post apocalyptic Arizona.  Your peace-keeping activities involve what you, the seasoned gamer, might have come to expect of the genre:  mutants, barbarians, and insane robots.  Where this game shines is in how it utilizes these very typical post-apocalyptic tropes to portray some very realistic and human settings as well as very real consequences for your actions.This is the most interesting development of this game.  Typically role-playing type games cater to the completionist crowd by making most every quest available and completable.  Wasteland 2 rejects this model forcing the player into branches of decisions and consequences which make other outcomes and objectives inaccessible.  Complicating this new quest model is that these decisions are never simple.  It is not a matter of choosing to save one good guy or one bad guy.  Instead the game asks you to decided from among two terrible choices.  Save this murderer or save this ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  The game gives you the option to sit on the fence for most of the quests, however, this comes with its own (often terrible) perils.Where this game also shines is in the little details.  Specifically the writing and music, both of which are excellent.  Even the voice-acting is mostly well done.  The game also plays like a sort of love-letter to the video game communmity.  This makes perfect sense as this game would not have been possible without the financial support of the fans of this community.The little details is also where the game falls apart.  The GUI, graphics (the world map), and combat mechanics all leave something to be desired.  Where the game falls apart is the entire last 25% of the game.  Although the game was delayed by nearly one year from its original date, and although it enjoyed a great deal of free beta testing from the Steam Early Access Program, this game was rushed to market before it was polished and complete.  The game literally falls apart at the seams in the last 25%.  This lack of polish creates nonsensical dialogue choices which makes the quests  broken.  Even worse is that the final encounters (those which shoudl be the most emotionally impactful) are broken.  In one I had to manually attack the boss to force a battle.  The final encounter is a simple matter of hacking and slashing your way to victory.  I wasted one attempt looking around for a secret way to complete the encounter and eventually realized you are simply supposed to blow everything up.  This unfortunate final encounter is partially a result of the boring combat system, partially a lack of imagination, but primarily the result of a game which should have been delayed by another year.It is easy to say this from the arm chair of course.  In another year the game probably would have run out of funding or the audience would have moved on.  InExile has been releasing rather huge patches every week since the game came out, however, one wonders how much a skeleton crew of developers on bug-fixing duty can really accomplish.  Each patch has thus far read like a bible but this game needs a church full of bibles to make the last quarter not suck.  I included the date because perhaps a year from now, if churches full of bibles, materialize, I coule recommend this game.  As it stands I only recommend the first 75%.			"

												At 130.5 hours, I still haven't beaten this ♥♥♥♥ing game. This is the first time since New Vegas I actually pursued the side content actively and I love it! The Ranger customization really gives you a sense of connection to your team and there are some really interesting NPC characters you can interact with, some can even join you in your mission.The game itself is quite fun, holding simple, yet fun, turn-based combat combined with a well paced leveling system, a wide array of different skills your characters can spec into, and writing that you can tell had a lot of love put into it. I can tell the devs of Wasteland had a lot of fun and enjoyment with this game, returning to the roots of classic video games with their encouragment of exploration and higher difficulty. Overall, I'd say this game is worth your time. Though with any game it may take some getting used to. This is very different from the typical video game that comes out these days, retaining it's old concepts of exploration, branching paths, missions that can be failed without a game over (most of the time) and even have worse consequences than a game over, and requires you to manage who is talking with whom when you have a charisma guy in your party. It's still fun, and if it's on sale you should go for it.Also you can repair toasters to get random ♥♥♥♥ out of them. You can also pick up ♥♥♥♥ and sell it for lots of cash. 10/10			"

												In my opinion, this is one of the top 10 crpgs ever made.  It has everything I look for in a crpg - party creation, good chargen and chardev, lots of ways that your skills interact with the environment, good combat, good story, great characters (like the kid that follows you around in the California base, Chisel, etc).9.5/10The only cons for me are -Would have liked 5 or 6 character creation instead of 4Too many and too much leveling that kind of makes the character development less meaningful.  A level cap of 20, 25 or 30 with slower leveling would have fit better IMO3d does nothing and adds nothing to the game but annoyance.  A fixed camera like PoE, Dark Sun, FO, etc, would have been my preferenceThat's it.  And I am well aware my cons are not really shared by the community at large.  Honestly, I did not believe inXile was capable of making a crpg, never mind a rpg I that is in my top 10 (and I've been playing crpgs since the mid-late-80s.  I am really looking forward to the new Bard's Tale from them now too.			"

												Just started to play this game and not ventured to far, but my opinion changed from ""what a poor game"" to ""Hey, pretty solid succesor of Temple of Elemental Evil in post-apocalypse"". Yes, this game is not like Fallout, Baldur's Gate or X-com. In my opinion this game is ""Troika-style"". Interesting dialoges, fun and wierd humor (head-butted in butt by goat D: ) turn-based combat not very tactical, but challenging and rewarding. Many skill-checks (you will never know what you need on the next turn), points of interest is interesting and different loot is good to find. One bad moment so far: custom characters are far more weaker than pre-made ones or NPC that can join you.  "

												A true Desert Ranger, what a journey it was to become one. Wasteland 2 has captured the essence of computer role playing games, the best indicator of which is the giddyness you'll feel when you think about doing another playthrough. It has an astounding wealth of good writing in it, so many encounters, quests and dialogues that are simply joyous to experience. The best thing is, that so many of these things can play out differently, depending on your party and your actions. A reactive world with a deeply emotive story.On your adventures through the sands, towns and cities, the game accompanies you with amazing music and visual style. The art and sounds immerse you, creating an atmosphere, that is both truly gritty in its post-apocalyptic splendor and darkly humorous with countless references and jokes. It's a world you want more of, a world you want to experience and are constantly thrilled to see what comes next.Combat is tactical and bloody, you will be able to attain all kinds of weapons, hilarious and deadly, and the death animations with the combat action descriptions make it purely Wasteland. Thoroughly enjoyable action from beginning to end. Different playstyles are well taken into account, playing with a bunch of melee bruisers or a squad of dead-shot riflemen, it's all equally satisfying. Though let's just say, that my favorite remains pummeling four raiders into red mist with a single well-placed burst from an automatic shotgun. Brutal and awesome.You will be creating characters of any variety you wish, and you will fall in love with them. The attribute system, skill system and a cool variety of cosmetic customization are a joy to tinker around with. As you play the game you will learn more about how the game progresses with the type of characters you've created, or NPCs you've recruited, and you'll be excited to try out different things next time. It's a game that keeps on giving.Do yourself a favor, if you've liked the 90's cRPGs, and play this game. It has been a long wait, but we finally got a game worthy of being up there at the top, with the best cRPG classics. Many games fail to deliver memorable moments, but this one, just like the good ones before it, has you fondly thinking back at the great things you've experienced with it.			"

												Overall I would recommend this game. BUT. it severely lacks in my opinion good story and atmosphere. I never felt captivated by the story like I did coming write off of Shadowrun. The text also was so small and hard to read even with it set to ""large"" I felt like it was more of a nuisance reading the bland material than it was worth especially when its on this typewriter styled display that does nothing to add to the game. The gameplay itself was alright. Not the best turn based game I've ever played but I had a lot of fun with it even if it lacked actual options other than headshot and ambush which you cant even really use unless you stack your attributes for AP. The guns were awesome! Even knowing a lot about guns in ""reality"" I had fun with them even if they had a lot of mistakes such as the SPAZ shotgun is actually an AA12 in your character's hands.I really enjoy Fallout and this helped my Fallout4 anxiety a lot. Random encounter maps are all boring and pretty much the same I think there was honestly like four different maps.7/10 needs work but i enjoyed it and just wanted to leave some constructive criticism. Would support the devs again!			"

												I am only 10 hours in and I am already beyond addicted! The kickstarter guys did NOT phone this game in (unlike another kickstarter game I won't mention *cough* *Shadowrun Returns* *cough*). This is the kind of game that will make you long for a return to actual RPGs and will remind you of why you fell in love with the genre in the first place. The character generation is so in depth! You have your basic stat setup (Str, Spd, etc) but all 7 of the core attributes work beautifully together. But where the game really shines is with the plethora of skills that you can choose from. You get four ""core"" characters and can recruit up to three more in game. I really like the 7 member squad, I don't like it when games limit you to only 4 or 5 members. I also am really impressed with how well the designers worked in making all of the skills actually useful and not just the combat skills. There are plenty of traps, locks, safes, alarms, and more that will make it essential to have a well rounded team with all of the proper skills to effectively get the most out of every environment you visit. Additionally where many games fail when it comes to ""dialouge"" skills--there are three in this game--and each one offers some very nice perks. The setting is nice, but does not offer much of anything new to the whole post-apocalyptic setting found in many games today (I do concede that the original game--to my understanding--spearheaded this type of game though). But it is still a fairly well written story. Also, I admit I don't know how often this will happen in the game, I have already came across a choice that has acutal in game everlasting consequences.

If you are a rookie but are tired of the cookie cutter action ""RPGs"" and would like to try something different, then at 30 bucks this might be the game for you. I will warn the rooks out there that there may be somewhat of a learning curve, but once you get past that you will finally see what all of the fuss from us older gamers is about.			"

												Wasteland 2 is a decent CRPG, Game is worth playing especially if you loved the old Fallout games and wish Van Buren was real. The character creation is intimidating at first, but the manual will explain things. For the most part it avoids having any single attribute as a dump stat, although charisma and luck come close. The skill system could use some work. Three dialogue skills is two too many, and a lot of non-combat skills are just various ways to open loot crates, although there are several cases where high repair or demolitions are needed to progress in a quest. Strangely, your attributes only affect your derived stats - the majority of which are sadly hidden from you - but have no effect on your skills.Combat is a huge part of this game, and while it is fun it's also rather simple. It uses a turn based system similar to Fallout, but you get control of each member of your party. There's an ambush attack similar to overwatch from XCOM which is pretty useful, but there aren't any aimed shots except for headshots, which are pretty boring. The weapons are seriously imbalanced, with assault rifles becoming really good about 1/3 of the way through, and godlike in the end-game.The quest design is decent; there are a handful of major quests in both areas of the game that are pretty complex and fulfilling to solve but the majority of them are short and combat focused. The quests in the first half are more polished while the back half feels rushed and incomplete.PROSThe game successfully incorporates tips and training pointers as you progress early on in the game. Rather than have to go through boring tutorials, you learn along the way. Absolutely loving the Ambush option available when you encounter enemies. Makes for excellent strategy and placement and forces you to consider approaches for maximum benefits as you encounter enemies later on.The Unity Engine is nice looking, with details in landscapes.The game is realistic in that you need to be prepared to take on encounters by having clear lines of fire along with readied weapons. Shooting an enemy who's in front of another friend isn't a good idea...A planned approach with players who have specific perks like lockpicking, etc are beyond valuable early on in the game.The devs have a wicked sense of humour with very colourful language all-around in the game...CONS-When you are investigating in real-time an area, I find the map option lacking. There is no map function already built into your display. You can alternate to the map by pressing 'm' but I'd rather have it as part of the overall picture itself as you move your characters around. -Some of the penalities associated with shooting are not realistic. I have one merc crouched while another one behind him is standing up firing with a rifle and he still manages to friendly fire the guy in front of him. Stupid, and the devs should have taken this into account.-Some of the shooting mechanics are way off. I have a merc with a rifile crouched who cannot take a shot at an enemy who is diagonally across from me. -The AP for rabbits is ridiculously overgenerous. They can scamper across half the screen and still carry out an attack. -The enemy AI seems to have crazy high AP...-No regional Pricing for India I need to wait for a year to buy at suitable price.

												To start I might already mention it as many before, as a person who enjoyed a lot first 2 fallout games I do enyoj this game very much. Why?1. It  has enjoyable and clear CHARACTER CREATION, you choose and make your crafted characters to fit a specific roles. If you like some theory  crafting then you will enyoj crafting your own core 4 characters, if not you can choose the presets. thought it is not as complicated as the ones in fallouts.2. The actual COMBAT is more like the one in Xcom thought not as thight and combat orientated, still enjoyable with potential of some annoyances which comes of how the combat starts(I might have missed something) but as far I know combat starts when you hit enemy or when enemy spots you and attacks you unless you construct a character so it will always see enemy way before hi sees youand can realiably set up fights for your team. Also some unclearances about field of wiev if you use high cover. For some maybe combat would be slightly too boring, which has a higher chance of happening if you are playing on the easy difficulty.3. The ingame GRAPHICS might not be as good as some might want them from 2014, it varies from place to place. 4. The interactable Characters, NARRATIVE, NPC dialogs, impact of chouses in quests and dialog choises is there, and creates great feel of emmersion.I havn't finished the game but as far I have goten to I would say that they have nailed everything about this section, even the voice acting that is there is very damn good(and I have to mention that in the old-school spirit most of dialogs are in text mode only) also the humor is pretty good. 5. Seems that they have fixed most of quest bugs during beta (havn't experienced any bugs this far).TO SUM UP  If you love the RPG and general story side of these kind of games (like fallout games), if you like tactical turn based combat with randomness aspect, if you like crafting characters (making your own roles) some theory crafting this is THE game for you.

												A blast to the past! A great game, often thought as to be very similar to the old Fallouts. Group management and turn based combat are what is key in this game. Quests are everywhere, and as a ranger, it is your duty to fulfill what you think is best for the people. The combat is quite nice, and the quests are interesting. I never got to finish the game, but I would still recommend it. Alas, it's has almost no replayability, due to the quests being quite limited and story line only going down one path. Still, it's fun. Would recommend for people who want to play an old Fallout style game.			"

												I am only 10 hours in and I am already beyond addicted! The kickstarter guys did NOT phone this game in (unlike another kickstarter game I won't mention *cough* *Shadowrun Returns* *cough*). This is the kind of game that will make you long for a return to actual RPGs and will remind you of why you fell in love with the genre in the first place. The character generation is so in depth! You have your basic stat setup (Str, Spd, etc) but all 7 of the core attributes work beautifully together. But where the game really shines is with the plethora of skills that you can choose from. You get four ""core"" characters and can recruit up to three more in game. I really like the 7 member squad, I don't like it when games limit you to only 4 or 5 members. I also am really impressed with how well the designers worked in making all of the skills actually useful and not just the combat skills. There are plenty of traps, locks, safes, alarms, and more that will make it essential to have a well rounded team with all of the proper skills to effectively get the most out of every environment you visit. Additionally where many games fail when it comes to ""dialouge"" skills--there are three in this game--and each one offers some very nice perks. The setting is nice, but does not offer much of anything new to the whole post-apocalyptic setting found in many games today (I do concede that the original game--to my understanding--spearheaded this type of game though). But it is still a fairly well written story. Also, I admit I don't know how often this will happen in the game, I have already came across a choice that has acutal in game everlasting consequences.

												Overall I would recommend this game. BUT. it severely lacks in my opinion good story and atmosphere. I never felt captivated by the story like I did coming write off of Shadowrun. The text also was so small and hard to read even with it set to ""large"" I felt like it was more of a nuisance reading the bland material than it was worth especially when its on this typewriter styled display that does nothing to add to the game. The gameplay itself was alright. Not the best turn based game I've ever played but I had a lot of fun with it even if it lacked actual options other than headshot and ambush which you cant even really use unless you stack your attributes for AP. The guns were awesome! Even knowing a lot about guns in ""reality"" I had fun with them even if they had a lot of mistakes such as the SPAZ shotgun is actually an AA12 in your character's hands.I really enjoy Fallout and this helped my Fallout4 anxiety a lot. Random encounter maps are all boring and pretty much the same I think there was honestly like four different maps.7/10 needs work but i enjoyed it and just wanted to leave some constructive criticism. Would support the devs again!			"

												I liked it from the beginning... it should however be noted that this game is a slow burner.Fallout 2 was one of my favs as a child, so I'll use it as a comparison despite the fact that WL2 isn't a Fallout game. I like the Wastland 2 soundtrack, though it maybe a bit avant-garde. It makes more use of ambiance, instruments that embody complex harmonics and lean arrangement, then it'll juxtapose those tunes with some driving electronic music for combat sections. FO2 had the same thing going for it music wise and even the newer Fallout games employ some very non-traditional music when the radio isn't on. I don't think there were any original pieces in the FO series that you would hear the mailman whistling. Also, if you haven't seen it, watch the movie The Stand. I think a lot of the original music from that movie, particularly the slide guitar portions, directly influence a few tracks for the Wasteland and Fallout games.Combat, if we're comparing this to older Fallout titles, is an improvement overall. It's not as much as an improvement to as say Pillars of Eternity made upon the formula of games like Baldur's Gate, but Wasteland 2 is still less clunky and requires less fuss than the FO 1 or 2. Combat can get extremely intense though. You will be confronted with situations that require tactical engagement and that might get you through threadbare. The real draw of the game for me is the story. There is a sense of intrigue from the beginning and you're there to hunt down answers. Along the way you meet some characters and the interactions feel meaningful. Also, a lot of areas of the game are chockful of macabre grim darkness and despair, which appeal to me greatly.I say give it chance. Some of the things about the game are hella sketch especially those godawful 3D character models and the optimization is poor for what the game is, but it's got a great aesthetic and the story should keep you wandering the wastes to solve the mystery.

												This game is unique.  In the parlance of our times, its 'genre' doesn't really exist anymore.  Once, there was a time in gaming when titles did not have to contain certain genre tropes in order to be easily classified and immediately accessible.  So you would do well to consider what this game is, and what it is not, and adjust your expectations accordingly.This game is fan service of the highest order.  The original Wasteland game lives and breathes inside of this one.  This is the master class on how to update a title with current technology without sacrificing the spirit of the original.  If you loved the original Wasteland, you may buy this title immediately without reservation.  It will blow your mind.  This game is for you.  They made it for you.  Praise them, and thank them for closing the loop. We have come full circle from our gaming origins, and we may now rejoice in exploding our foes like blood sausages.However, it is important to note:THIS IS NOT A TACTICAL SQUAD BASED RPG.  This is an update of a title from an era of gaming where, due to technical limitations, it was difficult to even render your party members as seperate icons.  So obviously if you are looking for compelling, deep and complex tactical turn based combat (as I often do) then there are dozens of other titles that do it better.  Its just not a priority for this game, this game is about narrative, it is from a time when narrative was king.  Comparisons to X-Com and whatnot are missing the point.Anywho.  The writing is brilliant, the world is vibrant, the nostalgia is soul shattering, the humor is mature and hilarious.  It didn't make me feel bad about myself the way Fallout did.  If narrative is your jam, you're gonna love it, the wonky camera won't hamper your enjoyment.  If you're under 30, be warned you will have to click your mouse more than you're used to.Franchise reboots are for suckers.			"

My shots were hitting and the game ran solid. If you like the feel of games like the original fallouts or underrail then you'll like this, if this is your first game that you are getting that is like this then I suggest using preset character builds that the game gives you and to play with the controls a little to see what button does what.

												Ratings: 9.2/10 Wasteland 2 is great, even at the current condition state the game is right now. RPG Turn-Based Strategy Game, one of those games that are yet to amaze you. Though the high price, the game still seeks true content it contains. Getting to create your own characters (Rangers) with specific skill abilities, traits, and more! The maps are fantastic, I'm still exploring one map for over an hour looking for treasure, supplies, etc. It took me over 30 minutes just to create 4 characters so I can organize my team. The missions so far are good, the given content is exceeded over good, but great. Kinda hard to play, but I will get along because of the deep gameplay it gives. Though it's difficult to start at first, you will learn it soon enough as I am. The game isn't perfect since it contains some bugs, but it's still worth it. Didn't buy it for full price yet it's still awesome.			"

I've long had Wasteland 2 on my wishlist, just never got around to buy it. Finally I have a chance to try it, and I really like it. Howver, it's a game that I need to play for many many hours to really have a good idea about it, but in the few hours I've tried it, it seems like a quality RPG with a good combat system (even if I personally am not too fond of turn-based combat), nice graphics and an interesting world. I think I'll finally give in and buy it. The Free Weekend has removed any doubt I had whether it is a good game or not (I think it is!).			"

												Let me tell you about Wasteland 2.I was out on a mission after having managed to strike a truce with a potential enemy who'd already flattened my crew more than once. The guy who tried to land the Desert Rangers in trouble with them is scared for his life because I dobbed him in as the true culprit - even after he helped me put things right, even after I said I wouldn't. He runs off to get his scaly mates all wound up and ready to make trouble.I think about it for a split second then headshot the stupid bugger. He can have his little hissyfit, but there's no way he's stuffing up this unexpected and welcome truce, Not while my sniper's rifle is loaded.Then I realise the effect this game is having on me. I'm horrified with myself. I rationalise the decision: the guy was too dumb to live; he'd have only got more innocent people killed; he was trying to covertly start fights he couldn't finish; at least if I put him down like this the other mob wouldn't torture him to death or something. I'm even more horrified at the rationalisations. I wonder if the game even has an event path for what I just did. Would his friends jump me next time because of a bug, or did he need to actually make it back to his friends to trigger that situation? Would there still be a truce when I got back? Did I really take care of the problem? The problem. Huh. That problem had a name. And friends. Possibly a family.This game is getting me to play like an amoral hardcase for the first time ever (usually I do my best to be a good guy) - and I simultaneously love it and fear it for that. Not because it's fun but because everything is a moral grey area, every success has a bit of failure in it, and it's rare for everyone to make it out alive and unscathed.10/10			"

												I'm about a dozen hours into the game and as a fan of the early Fallout games, 'Wasteland 2' totally nails the small-scale tactical feel of Fallout combat (I never played the original Wasteland). Like the Fallout games, there are multiple ways to approach every situation, and your dumb meathead party member can be as useful as your pointdexter electronics nerd, if used right.All the environments are very detailed and each city is unique in terms of design, though the brown / green colour palette gets a bit boring after a while. Totally suits with the theme, so can't really complain too much about that.On top of that, the writing is pretty solid, with a lot of references to previous games and easter eggs as you'd expect. No Richard Dean Anderson though. Boo!Basically, if you loved the Fallout games, you'll really like Wasteland 2. If you hated them, I don't think this game will change your mind. But then, I'm pretty sure this game wasn't made for you anyway, so that's fine :)			"

												For those of us still haunted by that fateful choice in Highpool on your Commodore 64, here is your chance to make amends and end that 30 year reoccuring nightmare...Not gonna take away from Fallout. Great series in it's own right. I missed suma ♥♥♥ laude by .02 thanks to Fallout 3 being released 2 weeks before finals exams of the last semester of my senior year at university. Yeah, that's how much I love this series.  However, the original Wasteland had a style of humor and storytelling that was unique for its time. In the early days of computer gaming, it was the first RPG to get the player emotionally involved. Every game afterwards tried to replicate this. Though they were great, they couldn't replicate it to the degree of the original. This game is the true successor to the original. It doesn't fail to deliver great storytelling and that twisted sense of humor. Not going to lie, the game has its share of issues with gameplay. (e.g. quests outcome bugs) but the devs are addressing them in a timely manner.  For those who don't require mindblowing graphics to experience a good story, this is a gem of a game. It won't dissappoint.			"

												This game demands patience, managemant, and strategy.  This is something most people who are giving this game bad reviews don't seem to understand.  Despite what other people say, this is not a linear game; as a matter of fact it is far from it.  Right off the bat I have attempted to kill every single good NPC that I have encountered but only managed to kill 2 before dying due to my low level.  There are many ways to finish missions, grab loot, and tackle obstacles as well.  While it can be time consuming to learn how to balance out your squad properly and do managemant, especially coming from a guy who didnt grow up in the Fallout 1-2 era, the reward is satisfactory.  For those who got into video games in early 2000s, this is simply later Fallout with more stats and strategy.  Get this game while its on sale.			"

Every once in a while you get tired of being treated to fancy schmancy cinematic spectacles and just want to relax with a nice trip through a fantasy world where you have freedom over how your adventure unfolds. You enter an abandoned building and find out that the interior power generators aren't working? No problem, you have a guy for that. You stumble across some nasty wasteland creatures? No problem, you can create a tough guy to fend them off and better increase your party's chance of survival.The trick with these types of computer games is, even if they seem shocking at first glance with all the menus and text; do not overthink things while you're playing. Get lost in the world, don't be afraid to be a little creative, and have fun!			"

												This game demands patience, managemant, and strategy.  This is something most people who are giving this game bad reviews don't seem to understand.  Despite what other people say, this is not a linear game; as a matter of fact it is far from it.  Right off the bat I have attempted to kill every single good NPC that I have encountered but only managed to kill 2 before dying due to my low level.  There are many ways to finish missions, grab loot, and tackle obstacles as well.  While it can be time consuming to learn how to balance out your squad properly and do managemant, especially coming from a guy who didnt grow up in the Fallout 1-2 era, the reward is satisfactory.  For those who got into video games in early 2000s, this is simply later Fallout with more stats and strategy.  Get this game while its on sale.			"

												When I first played this game, I was going in not playing the first, never playing the original Fallouts that came about after the first Wasteland, so I had no idea how the game would play. I am please to say that I love this game. The turn based combat is easy for everyone to understand, but has enough of a varience that you can't all specialize, else you will fail. The story has choices that matter, you are just a small force, you can't save everyone so the choices are tough without giving too much away. This post-apocalyptic game is one of my all time favorites, up there with the Fallout series and various zombie themed games like State of Decay.			"

												I love this game as much as I love Fallout 1 and 2 (and 3 and New Vegas). Fallout 2 is still my top favourite of them all (being the first game I played in the Fallout universe), but Wasteland 2 is close!The story, the humor (both black and white), the irony, the mockery, the stark raving mad characters, the problems that can't be solved in any ""good"" way no matter what you do? All wonderful!Sure, there are plot holes (can't mention any without spoilers), the way active skills like lockpicking, disarming, safecracking etc work can be seriously frustrating time consumers and the UI is a bit cumbersome, but I can easily forgive that.It's the only game I've ever started a second run of immediately after completing the first, being especially fun since I could continue using the veterans from the first run. Over-powered in the second run? You bet, and I'm loving it, eventhough I raised the difficulty one step (to Ranger).Solid entertainment, lots of fun, I highly recommend it!I'm having fun hunting achievements now. :) "

												Combat is a lovely turn based combat system. If i could compare it to anything it would be Xcom enemy unknown 2012, only more forgiving. Character use is heavy in this game and your choices early game can affect you quite a bit late game if you dont know what you're doing. It has nice easter eggs and throwbacks to wasteland 1 and a few hints to fallout, be it wasteland 1 was a basis for fallout 1 as they were made by the same company at the time. Mind you this is game is in a different universe but hovers just ouside the barrier of the 2.			"

												This game in uninspiring and tedious even given the fact that I did not complete a fraction of the side quests.  The narrative and graphics are subpar and the game is only recommended for fans, or those with a high tolerance for reading lots of text and navigating poorly programmed inventory screens.  This game reminds me of how far we've come with rpgs and how much we not take for granted in the genre.  Sometimes the good ol' days were not that good.   Really hated the fact you had to manually reload after ever fight and that you had to drag and drop weapons into the inventory of your weaponsmith to mod.  There is alot of tedious inventory management in this game and I have played Fallout 1,2,3,NV.			"

												Not great, but easily good enough.Wasteland 2 is a throwback to older RPGs with the text-heavy story and the turn based combat. Look, it's easy to pick holes in the game - it was launched with quite a few broken quests, the weapon balance isn't good, the combat options could be more plentiful - stuff like that. Perhaps the main storyline isn't that compelling for some folks though it was fine for me.In short there are a lot of things it could have done better. It's certainly not perfect. But I enjoyed it enough.There's 50 hours of gameplay here and most of it is old-school RPG fun. Questing, combat and exploration are all central parts of this game and they're all done well enough that the overall experience is great. I quite liked the world and the atmosphere and that kept me going during some of the duller times. In addition, the devs have done a great job of updating and patching the game. I went to play it again with the newer version and made it about halfway through before quitting. So in my book it's not a great game but it was enjoyable enough to feel like I got my money's worth. So if you're looking for some old-school RPG fun, buy this title. It may not be the GOTY, but odds are you won't be disappointed.			"

												First off, I love this game.  I recomend it highly, it was worth my 60 dollars to play it in the early release it is definitely worth the 40 dollars it is now.   It has come a long way since the Early Access review that I did, so I am updating it now.  This game plays very much like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fallout Tactics (minus the real time option).  In it you will create 4 of your own Desert Rangers and then head out into the wastes and explore, and either clean up the wasteland or kill everyone and thing in your path.  Along the way you can recruit many extra characters to your cause, each with their own personality and traits, up to 3 may travel with you at any given time. The difficulty of the game varies sharply depending on how you choose to play it.  Early on most enemies you fight will be much weaker than you are, however you are not forced to play the game in any linear fashion and as such you may wander into areas with much stronger enemies than you are prepared to face (not that you can't win but it can be brutal).  The ability to go where you want and do what you want flows throughout the entire game.  You can sweet talk people into giving you what you want, threaten them (with the proper skills) or if that fails shoot your way through.  Wall in your way?  Use a grenade.   Person make you mad?  Shoot him, or don't.  Raiders take over a town?  Negotiate or kill them it's all up to you and how you want to play.  Most choices have concequences further down the line, some amusing and some well down right destructive, even when you think you are making the right choices nothing is ever black and white. You will collect all kinds of weapons and armor, and most weapons can be customized by stripping down others for base parts.  Everything from WW2 rifles to futuristic laser weapons are represented each with an optimal range, armor penetration and rates of fire.  In battle many of your enemies will show up with different kinds of weapons, often enough you can kill them an take it for yourself.  The various enemie types also force you to prioritize targets: Do you kill the big guy with the sword made out of the one way sign (yes, they really are swords made out of sign posts and one way signs) attacking your medic, or do you take out the guy who is still too far out to hit you but is charging with grenades that will hurt everyone?  Oh and friendly fire is a thing, don't try and use a shotgun from behind your own people. Character progression is handled in an RPG like fashion with skill points gained at every level and ability points every 10.  You can be a generalst and do a bit of everything but nothing well or you can specialize each of your characters (highly reccomend you do) into different things.I broke my basic team into:a) Sniper / Lockpicks / submachine gun - gave me nice range and something when stuff got closerb) Sniper / Perception / Kiss A** / Submachinegun - can see traps still shoot far and sweet talkc) Heavy weapons / Safe Cracking / Assault Rifle - HMG to mow down eneies - rifle to consere ammod) Energy weapon / First Aid / Rifle / demolotions - can remove traps and is the field medicThen I picked up and kept in my party ae) A drunkard shotgun specialist whom I also turned into the groups weaponsmith (because drunks make the best weapons right?)f) Lady scientist who can hack any computers and is handy with a pistol (and later rifles)g) Young kid who's life I saved,  he started with brawling and ended with rifles pistols and the ability to talk to strange animals. I built my team knowing that I would go to a specific place and pick up a particular npc.. how you create your team is entirely up to you and playing around with different builds is half the fun. - Pros -- Great turn based combat.- Easy to understand mechanics- Fun!- Lots of humor built into the game- So many different ways to resolve things in the game- Ability to break your own missions through poor choices (and sometimes good ones) requiring some creative solutions to be used to move on.- Solid strategies will win most fights.  Using cover, hitting clusters of enemies with a grenade etc.- Ammo doesn't grow on trees, making conservation of rounds part of the strategy.- All different kinds of weapons with all kinds of pros / cons built into them.- Not all weapons are a straight forward upgrade, sometimes you just have to try them out.- Each person can only carry so much weight, there is no way to be Rambo and run around with 1000's of rounds of ammo and infinite first aid kits. - Cons -- Did I really just wipe out an entire town on accident? Oops.- Random battles can be major easy or completely overwhelming.  Luck plays a part.- Bah stupid AI won't stop throwing grenades at my clustered people.- Drunk bugger keeps going rogue on my party and getting himself shot to pieces.- Some fights, more so early on can be extremely difficult to get through.  The first boss fight was really bad for me as my squad was almost dead and did not expect the guy to attack me since we were talking at first- Ammo can be hard to come by in the early game, forcing you to either use weapons your team isn't skilled for or to spend all of your money on nothing but ammo instead of armor / weapon mods / first aid kits etc.			"

												It's a good game that any CRPG fan should have in it's collection. I love the perspective, the combat and reactivity. The one thing I would really like to see in the future are more complex quests. Fallout New Vegas had really great quests with multiple solutions. I think that the brothels and other sex related objects or locations are overused. The main story is also mediocre, but thank God for a lot of side content. In the future I hope for a more polished experience, with less bugs, less akward annimations , better story and more complex quests.			"

With that said I got this game only a day or two ago and i already have 13 hours into it. This is probably one of the most unique, and exciting games i have played in a long time. This game isn't like every other game going ""hey.. you see that over there? shoot that"" this game gives you options, this game makes you make hard decisions on almost everything. ""Should I fight these Raiders? Do I have enough water to get there?

												TL;DR- This game is amazing as far as RPGs go. The tactical combat is challenging and rewarding. The storyline is solid and  cohesive. As someone who didn't play the original before I got it along with this game I feel that the devs did a great job at staying true to the original while making a wholly playable and engrossing sequel, paying homage to the players of the 1st game while not entirely alienating their new market. Simply one of the best role-playing games I have had the pleasure to play in the last decade.Wasteland 2 made me feel like I was playing Fallout-Advanced Edition. Yes the post apocalyptic genre may be reaching its saturation point, but to pull it off with the style and flair that the devs did with this game is truly a feat that others should feel beholden to match in the future. Back in my day *takes a slug off of a clay jug marked XXX* players used their imaginations to fill in the holes that graphic and framerate left empty and Wasteland 2 managed to bridge that gap with nuance and gusto. I felt for my characters. I lovingly crafted their skills to conquor all that the wasteland had to throw at me. I was treated to inside jokes, 80's humor, and a difficulty that suited my playstyle (played on hard difficulty). If you're looking for a great tactical RPG, this is a sure bet. If you're looking for a storyline that will keep you playing to the end, start clicking the buy button now. Dim the lights. Crank the speakers. And sit down for a while and witness true RPG entertainment at it's best.			"

												I can't in good conscious recommend Wasteland 2 as a finished product. It's too lackluster and has a few major issues. It plays fine, and I will probably continue playing it even after I write this, but there's two main issues at the time of writing.The first being off is the god for saken prison. Ran by raiders with no redeemable factors that turn people into slaves only be disguising them as workers. They do nothing good, everyone that you come across will say you can be the savior, march right up to the leader, and kill him, simple task, right?Apparently not, once you get there you run into a plotwall. Two turrets at 4K health each(To put that in perspective, 20ish hours in my characters only have 125ish health). Okay, fine, just bring out heavy weapons. Wrong again, they have a stupid high intiative, and a stupid high amount of action points. They fired 5ish times each, doing 300 damage per bullet. Good luck getting your party through that.Even if you *DO* manage to kill the turrets, there's apparently accounts of impossible-to-defuse landmines that 1 hit kill party members.Why is this happening? I'm not sure, but if I had to guess, one of the team members working on wasteland felt so proud of their plot twist they decided to make sure everyone can only expirence the plot twist like that. So you just have to go 'welp, i know these guys beat and enslave you, but hes's got deus ex machina backing him so we can't do anything till the game says so'The other issue is just hour 10ish. It becomes out-of-ammo gun-jam simulator. You won't have enough ammo to get into skrims, or if you do, you'll be cutting it close and it'll just be fustrating. Then when you do have ammo, your gun jams. A lot. I'm not sure how complex a double barrel shotgun is, but i'm pretty sure it's not prone to the amount of jamming it got.Now for the nitpicky stuff. Somethings just outpace your levels, but that's fine, maybe I shouldn't be rushing through the content as fast as I was. Another issue is just not being able to interact with the world. There's a girl who's (perpetually) dying, constantly groaning into your radio, asking for some one named Elroy. You can find her, confront her. But even if you're the best doc of the entire world, you can't help her, only shoot her. It may sound super nit picky, but not even given the illusion of choice sucks. I couldn't try, I could only mercy kill.There is good htngs, the game is close to being a perfect masterpiece. Combat is actually alright, atleast mid game. Things start getting faster, combat is quick but a bit tactical. It could benefit from a few small tweaks. Flanking, some more cover options, and a change to friendly fire calculations(Not as bad as fallout 2. Damn it Sulik, give me that gun.) The characters are alright, followers feel human as they comment on the scenery and situation where applicable, instead of being a silent moving turret. They have their flaws, they have their benefit, but not so much so they become a god send or dead weight.Over all the game feels... unpolished. It feels as if I'm playing in a beta, which I'm not. If it gets changed, or the mod tools get released, I'm sure this game could be something fantastic. But at the moment it's simply okay.			"

												Wanted to love this game. After many, many, restarts and partial playthroughs I just ended up calling it quits. Played FO1 and 2, and Tactics when they were first released and they sit high on my list of ""fond of old games."" This, I did not care for at all. Enemies zerg you (that's the extent of the AI). In FO Tactics they at least had the sense to flank you, take cover, hide, runaway, switch weapons appropriately, etc. You'd think that would be something we'd see in the 21st century. Not here. They run at you or shoot, then you shoot back, repeat. The stat system is broken (not using that word as a euphamism or perjorative, there are stats that matter and those that don't. And your stats don't effect your skills at all beyond intelligence).  There are only a few viable builds to complete the game. The skills are so convoluted and could have been easily reduced by half. For instance you have: Alarm Disarming, Lockpicking, and Safe Cracking. Is there any reason these couldn't be under one skill instead of three? No. Then you have: Hard A*s, Kiss A*s, Smart A*s, Barter, and Leadership, aren't these all subsets of a larger skill like persuasion/speech or based on charisma? Well, no, not in Wasteland 2. Why are they convoluted? Probably to compensate for a game design that allows for so few actions in game beyond ""kill person in this manner"" or ""successfully interact with this object for a reward."" Weapons and armor have arbitrary penalties that exist only to impose penalties. For instance, did you know that an ""assault rifle"" loses all efficiency at five feet and  a board with a nail in it works MUCH better? I didn't know that, but after playing WL2 I do. Further energy weapons do lots of damage to you if they hit your armor, but if they hit your bare skin they don't do much on any damage at all. Logic! It's the guise of strategy, not actual strategy. It's strategic like rock, papers, scissors. This game has a lot of heart. It tries very hard an certainly has charm. Yet I've played browser based games with more depth, complexity, strategy, and sophistication. Really wanted something to take me back to those first days playing FO1/2 and Tactics. Instead it's better to just play those instead of WL2. Or, if you really want a strategy based around functional abilities, gear (that you build or collect), multiple means of achieving you goal, and competent AI go play XCOM Enemy Unknown/Within.I want my money back.

												This game is a little to hardcore and unforgiving.  Even on the lowest difficulty setting its easy to find your characters out of ammo and with no scrap to buy more.  I gave it the best attmpt I could before i grew tired of the turn mechanics that ultimately result in dead party members from low skills or lack of ammo and before anyone says use melee, that just results in seriously wounded characters that once again die from thier wounds.  Trust me even on the easiest setting its wasnt uncommon during my game play to have characters with only 46 hp crit for over 30 dmg in one hit by an enemy.  Id hate to see what the harder settings numbers look like.  If you want a turned based game with shooting and some melee thats a lot more fun then this play XCOM.  Its the same game but smoother and more enjoyable in my opinion.			"

												Not being a fan of the original, I wasnt as excited by the prospect of a sequel as a lot of other people. However I am a fan of the genre and generally like RPGs of any type if they are well made so I thought Id give it a shot. This game IS well made, but thats about all its got going for it.There is something about this game that just doesnt do it for me. Ive just played through Baulders Gate and Shadowrun Returns and compared to them, this game is flat and boring. I have no interest in the story line and the quests themselves are too dam long and boring. Theres no clear sense of what to do next and if you do things in the wrong order, you end up having to back track all over the joint.Traveling the wasteland is a pain in the ♥♥♥. Requiring you to stop at these stupid oasis to replenish your water supply is unnessecary and adds to the boredom. I know it was part of the original game, but that doesnt make it a good idea.Games that have voice acting are fantastic, it really adds to the atmosphere and gets you into the game. This game has voice actors, but they only some NPCs use it and only with what they first say. I understand the fact you cant give every NPC a voice sue to space constraints, but those that do speak should speak every line. Im a bit mad at how much I actually paid for this game. If your thinking about getting it, wait till a sale when its like $5 or below. Otherwise your just wasting your money.			"

								I can't wait for this game to go final. The beta has been fun playing so far and I can't wait to experience the next build.  The original game was a great bridge to drag me away from the D&D worlds of SSI and got me to look at other RPG venues.  Led me to Starflight and XCOM.The game mixes nostalgia with the new.  Great way to bring back the originals starting party and to refresh the memory as you forge ahead with new rangers.			"

								May 1st 201459 hours on record, not 24.I've been playing Wasteland 2 for a while now and figured I should write a review. I hardly ever write reviews but I feel that this game deserves it. When i first bought it (a week or two after release) the game was buggy to say the least. A bit boring during combat and the story was dry......then the patches started rolling out. The game became beautifully designed. The artwork is amazing, the combat feels solid and easy to use. The story feels like a true rpg. I'm getting to know my characters like I did in Fallout and Skyrim. I was really excited when this game hit Steam and I had high hopes. Still being in Beta and being apart of the process has been amazing. I have enjoyed every patch and have no complaints. I can wait to see what it's like once it's fully released. If you have any doubts about not liking this game wait until full release, but if you want to buy it now and help the dev's create a game more to your liking this is the company to do it with. Thanks for reading!Feel free to message me with questions about the game if you feel like getting the average player's more in depth review. -Dantehood			"

												I’ve only played the Original Wasteland game very briefly a long time ago, however I’ve spent countless hours playing the pre-Fallout 3 Fallout games on PC which were inspired by Wasteland. Now I’ve played Wasteland 2 for around 7 hours, it’s not a fast paced game, this has only been enough time for me to complete one of the first main missions.- Overall I was very happy with the game, personally it was awesome to see a modern Fallout-like game with a traditional isometric view and detailed text descriptions of everything seen and done in the world.- However I found that I spent way too much time having to loot one loot container after another as well as sometimes fighting identical enemies repeatedly.

In the character creation the graphics aren’t very appealing. However when you actually play the game you don’t usually view things so closely.-----Generally the actual graphics looked good in my opinion. But personally I’m satisfied as long as it’s a competent modern three-dimensional adaptation of Wasteland and an adequate improvement compared to the two-dimensional Fallout titles.-----What I was really impressed by was actually the textual description of entities and objects in the game. They provided more interesting details about everything you see.-----I also really liked the text dialogue that my companion expressed during combat rather than being mute. It really made the character seem more alive.-----Most of the character models looked fine, especially humans who featured a lot of variety. But I really got tired of seeing the same unimpressive giant bunnies again and again.-----There were also a couple of locations which I was not impressed by. One area was just a big empty square. While another fenced you into lanes which I don’t think fit well into a world that I believe should feel very open.-----But I was really impressed by many of the other environments that I saw. I liked how you could rotate the view, this would reveal objects you couldn’t see previously.-----Many environments looked handcrafted and irregularly shaped. I think this platform has a lot of potential even for other games with a fantasy theme.I liked the character attributes and skill system. However the benefits of investing into some attributes didn’t seem worthwhile. Likewise investing in combat skills seemed to suffer from strong diminishing returns.-----I set out to play this game in an unusual way. I didn’t want to micromanage a squad. So initially I took only one ranger. This didn’t work out so well initially.-----So after playing for an hour I started over and I redesigned my starting character. This time I created a more intelligent character so that they could multi-skill and thus take on multiple roles.-----Early on there is a high level character who you can recruit named ‘Angela Deth’, I took her along with me because going solo with a low level character is actually very difficult. So the game almost let me play the way I wanted to because I didn’t have to take a whole squad.-----I don’t mind the turn based combat, but it’s one of the reasons the game is slow paced. I knows it’s more traditional. But I would have preferred a real time system where you could pause and redirect the action.-----Occasionally my companion would go out of control in combat and make actions without me directing her. How do I make her do this all the time? I’d rather my NPC teammates were more autonomous. I don’t want to have to tell them to do every little thing.-----Outside of combat for the first several hours that I played, I couldn’t move my characters individually for some reason. So I wasn’t able to rearrange my character before entering combat-----This was a bit weird. I don’t know why this happened but eventually I was suddenly able to direct them individually.-----In games like this I feel compelled to search every nook and cranny in a level for loot. Especially because you really need to do so in order to scrape up enough ammunition to fight and enough medical supplies to survive.-----I know it’s a post apocalyptic game and scavenging may be the ‘thing’ to do. But I think I easily spent half of my seven hours of game-play looting and managing my characters’ inventories. That was tedious.-----Why do I have to ransack the property of people who I am supposed to protect? How do my characters carry all those guns and where do they keep them, just to sell at a vendor?-----I wish there was a better system for acquiring better gear. Perhaps credit towards an interchangeable load-out based on each characters rank and experience levels?So yes, I definitely have my gripes about this game. But I was very happy to play it. This game proves that Fallout 3 didn’t have to make the shift to FPS. Not sure that I will have more time for Wasteland 2 though.-----I’m happy that the price has come down. The previous $60 price tag was a major reason that I had not purchased this game quite some time ago.Click here for my YouTube gaming channel			"

												If you loved Wasteland, Fallout 1&2 this is a must to play! ALOT of text/story in this game tho so prepear yourself to sit and read alot. If you hate reading you can skip most of it unless it's for a quest. You can easily get lost if you didn't read properly. :PAlot of fun details, books, items and the enviroments are stunning to look at. I find myself zooming in all the time to read small posters etc.Turn-based combat system, wich is pretty easy if you're not used to it. I find most of the ""matches"" really easy but I've been told it gets ♥♥♥♥ HARD at the end of the game so I'm prepearing myself to hoard like crazy. Might tell you that just like Skyrim and Fallout this is one hell of a hoarder game! I cry everytime I  have to drop a ♥♥♥♥♥ because I can't carry them all. You can also have sex and get STDs and hoard Furries! :'(There is a reason why alot of sites/magazines/players belives this was the game of the year 2014! 10/10			"

												Not as good as Wasteland 1 and not the spiritual Fallout 3 that many Fallout fans wanted, but it's a good role-playing game. In hindsight, as backers, we shouldn't have expected inXile to deliver an amazing game; inXile hadn't developed an RPG since the Interplay days more than a decade ago.inXile learned a lot developing this game though. Signs of ambition are all over the game, with tons of reactivity from the start. But as the game progresses, you notice that many things seem to scale back in quality. There is less reactivity, and eventually the random radio chatter stops. This is more noticeable in California with the ranger HQ and the big cities. Santa Fe Springs has a relatively large map but it's never used. Hollywood in particular promises greatness if only inXile had more money and thus time. Quests can be tackled largely out of order with plenty of dialogue options to form alliances fake or real, but it's ruined by bugs or even perceived bugginess. It's definitely rough.We already know Wasteland 3 will not try to be a 100 hour game, and is instead aiming for something along the lines of Torment: Tides of Numenera which is supposedly around 40 or 50 hours. Considering the original Fallouts and Wasteland were only around 20 hours each and how unpolished the later areas of Wasteland 2 were, I think this is a good idea.			"

								Being pretty much a hardcore fan of the Fallout, yes including Bethesda's versions (strangely, I've grown to love them). Before getting your hands on Wasteland 2, be warned that you are not purchasing a game. You are purchasing an opportunity to watch and interact with a highly anticipated (at least by me...) pre-release game program that would hopefully become an amazing experience. I highly recommend investing your hard earned cash to the developers of Wasteland 2 as I very much look forward to their success.			"

												At least on my Macbook, this game crashed quite regularly (every 15 - 30 minutes). I had also problems with the graphics, sometimes only flashy colours remained on the screen. Although the graphics are not that special, my cooler was running on full power all the time. This game is definitely not optimizied for Mac OSX. Personally I think this game is well suited for everyone who really enjoyed wasteland 1, but for all others I wouldn't recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								When I played the beta of this game in 2013, I was not impressed. I was frustrated with the UI, the art direction, the scripting, and the way combat was weighed. I played the original in the late 1980s, and loved the surreal and unforgiving world it created.I came back, this month, hoping that the issues I'd complained about had been fixed. I genuinely love this series and was pessimistic about its survival. I owe the devs an apology--the beta I've played this month has been everything I could have wanted (though I could always use more toasters and mutants, if anyone is listening).I can recommend this game to fans of the first game, as well as fans of dystopian and apocalyptic games. However, it is distinct from other entries in this genre, including the often-cited Fallout series. Closer to the roots of such games than the more recent entries in the apolcalyptic genre, Wasteland 2 is tactical and played from above your party's head. You can pause between turns, and sometimes you'd better think about it first.It also has the charm of being more appropriately unforgiving--it's the !@#(*% apocalypse, the stakes are high, and I APPROVE of punishing button mashing and careless playing.Know your save file, love your save file. The game saves less often than you might want it to, so you'll want to stay on that yourself.Your characters will have to specialize, and no single character will be able to be everything. You will want to think hard about how you want to allocate specialties. It is very possible to make in-game mistakes that kill you and your party instantly, though you'd have to be pretty oblivious to make them. If the button says ""do not push me,"" do no--actually, if you push it, you deserve what you get. The wrong comment to the wrong person can touch off wars between groups, closing whole story sections to you. The appropriate choice in dialog is not always obvious, and the best choice is not always available to you, without specializing.Depending on your level of difficulty, making use of the ability to create ambushes and lead people into them will become very useful, as is developing a character able to scout ahead.The game is still being developed, and has some on-going and minor technical issues, including an optimization problem I ran into on my rig that required me to turn down the refresh rate and render quality considerably. From reading the forums, this problem is not exactly common, but happens often enough to merit mention.The half of the game available for play right now also seems a bit short--I'm hoping that the final product will be much longer (gimmie!)It's hard to evaluate a story when you're missing the denouemont, but to this point, it has a familiar and interesting arc. Given the development, I'm fairly confident the finished product, based on the skill I've seen, will have been worth backing the project.A word of advice: do not buy this game expecting Fallout: New Vegas, or expecting a completely open, huge world filled with 1950s kitsch, naivete, and classic sci-fi allusions. Expect, instead, a world hemmed in on all sides by radiation and death, with the disaffection, paramiliatry themes, and violence of the 1980s. The devs have done a particularly good job of recalling the first game without simply recreating it.And devs, at the risk of spoiling something, the Brothers patrolling the mountain pass are just about perfect. If there's any fear close to our current, collective hearts, it's contamination.			"

												Summary of the game:1)No tactics in combat. Usualy your team just 5 man cluster run into enemy and start shoting enemy their hp hit zero.2)The storyline is plain as railroad,  most of quest even deny logic to push you some to consiqence.3)Ambient sounds are horrible, during the HighPool mission i had to endure: screams, moaning, gunfire, explosions, alarm sounds for half an hour, until i turned off the sound.There isnt enough good thing in the game to outweight its design flaws to keep me playing it. Definetly overpriced WasteLand of money.			"

												While it's worth the 25+ year wait for it, it's not without its flaws. If you are reading this then I'm certain you've read at least a couple of the other player reviews of this game, if not official reviews from IGN, PC Gamer & the like.  Many of the reviews equate this game as being a ""tactical RPG"",  I would classify it more as an RPG with some (note emphasis) tactical elements, there's a difference.  Like in the ""golden age"" of PC RPGs, you create your inital squad members, you can recruit up to 3 others, making a total of 7.  There are quite a few NPCs to recruit also, each has their own reasons for being on your team.  Depending on your actions it can be quite temporary how long a potential recruit stays on your team.  How you mix & match your PCs & NPCs can be quite interesting. Like the PC based RPGs of yesteryear, once a character dies, they're gone forever, so save often.  The game does not hold your hands on things, some of the clues in certain quests are down right obtuse & depending on the difficulty you set it at certain other things... well you'll see for yourself.  Is the game ""pretty"", nope.  Is the story something I've not seen before, nope on that also.  But this games does give me something I see too little of in RPGs these days: choice & consequence.  Most of the consequences based on the choices are also not readily apparent, they have a small ripple effect that may not be seen for hours down the road; are you seriously about to reload a save from 2 or 4 or more hours ago when the consequence of such a decision is happening so far down the line?  I seriously doubt that, which is another thing I like, you have to think on most of the choices here; ""How will doing X bite me in the rear?"" is something you should really consider.  I did one playthrough, it took me 120 hours to finish, I had a blast in exploring & finding things.  I intend on another.  Just 'cause I liked it though & felt it a fitting sequal to the original, it doesn't mean that I'm blind to the weaknesses of the game.  In most cases I hope what I wrote n the weakness column is considered & fixed for Wasteland 3, should the franchise continue.SrengthsChoice & ConsequenceBig & long game reminiscent of the games of yesteryear.  Does not hold your hand, it's a thinking persons game.  Either have a decent memory on certain quests or use the notes system provided, you'll be glad you did.  Dark humor a-la the original Interplay Fallouts, but more subtle.  WeaknessesUI not as tweakable as I'd likeThe character customization could be way better. While I didn't expect it to be anywhere near as pretty as Divinity Original Sin, I did want my characters to look somewhat like the pics I imported to represent them.  A lot of the portraits & random areas were reused.  The battles also felt repetative after awhile, the latter being the fault of a really bare-bones tactical aspect (no called shots on body parts other then the head, no sneak skill).  I would've liked a few more optional quest areas like the Mine & Rail Nomads. Some areas were really big, I would've liked a waypoint option.  For better & worse most of the Skills didn't relate to the statistics of the characters.  At least to me they didn't feel this way.  HaasGaming wrote it best:  ""If you are patient and give Wasteland 2 the time it needs to show its potential, it will be a tremendously enjoyable experience. Time definitely worth investing."" "

												I looked forward to this game for a long time, and will admit that once I got it did not fall in love with it and so have put very limited time into it, so take my game experience with that grain of salt.  Many people have clearly loved it, and so maybe you will too, but I feel let down and consider this a title that for me has lived up neither to its hype or even to its promises.Clearly a lot of care and attention to detail went into crafting this game, as well as a long process of interacting with the community during development, and I am impressed with the features.  That they did not add up to a fun and immersive experience for me may have been primarily due to a dislike for the camera handling.  I found early on that I preferred a wide view most of the time, but the camera handles poorly for that.I also believe that the bar was set reasonably high for visual quality, but again I feel like the look achieved was not equal to the sum of the components, and possibly that has to do with the Unity engine.I have generally good feelings that Fargo's team was revived by this project and has leveraged the enthusiasm for this revival to  continue on with new projects as well as encouraging other developers doing interesting projects, but otherwise am not too excited to have been a day 1 kickstart supporter.Some 32 months after the project was officially funded we have not seen the mod tools kit that was promised.  I realize that Fargo was honest in projecting that mod tools would require further time and it will probably come someday, but at this stage of the game's shelf life I'm about ready to declare that a broken promise.  This may seem like a moot point since I haven't cared much for the game, but it is disappointing nonetheless.			"

												Is this game worth it? I would say maybe. The game has really its own charm and if you like turnbased gaes it's really not half that bad but imo it doesnt live through its combat system but through the story and setting and some funny easter eggs.Unfortunately the parts of the combat system aren't that well thought out. The weapon types later have incrementle upgrades and all you do is just upgrading the specific weapon type your character uses. The fights dont require real startegy even though i played on hard (very hard is the highest difficulty)Even though this is the director's cut in which they revamped the combat system it still  kinda falls flat and unfinished. Another negative would be the graphics that are not that well optimized unfortunately.But if you like a post apocalyptic sory with some lore behind i still think that you will like this game.THis is more like an appetizer for Wasteland 3 which got announced and hopefully it will be more thought out in the combat aspect.THis game shows the potential wasteland 3 has but ofc this game never reachers those heights.

								I love what I have played of the game and glad it has finally come to fruition. I have been waiting many years for this game to be finally made and what I have seen and played it has been worth it, being the original Wasteland on the Commodore 64 was one of my favorite games next to Ultima Series and a few others(Mars Saga,Sentinal Worlds etc). I am and always will be a Ranger at heart!!!			"

												So, if you take the term 'CRPG' really seriously and enjoy getting in fights about how modern RPGs aren't 'real' RPGs, and you wish it were still the late 1990s, this is a great game for you and you don't need to read the rest of my review.On the other hand, if you enjoy isometric party-based RPGs but also might like to see some progress from the last 15 years or so of gaming history, Wasteland 2 is kind of a letdown precisely because of how stubbornly it emulates the UI fiddliness of Fallout 1/2.  Get ready to remember which party member owns a shovel, switch to them, activate the shovel item, and wait while a progress bar fills up, every time you want to dig something up.  And this isn't just shovels, it's *every specialized skill*.  You're not realistically going to put together a party with more than one girl or guy who knows Safecracking or some other random ♥♥♥♥, but the game will never let you just click on the safe and have the one Safecracker open it.The maps suffer from a similar level of fiddliness.  You will have to memorize where in town that random questgiver is, or come back from a fetch quest to wander all over wondering where his shop is among a town of identical-looking dwellings.  No quest markers is fine, I don't think that the player should have telepathic knowledge of where stuff is ahead of time, but when you're looking to turn in quests (and the characters would already know where shopkeeper X is) it's just a hassle.  Isometric design also means that the level designers hide crates in places where you need to rotate the camera to find them ... which is fine, but after a while, it's not clever, it's just irritating to have to rotate the camera every time you enter a new room or potentially miss out on loot.I could go on with examples of the weird sort of micromanagement that Wasteland 2 requires of the player (there are many more), but you get the point.Bottom line, it feels like a game that came out in 2000, not 2014.  If you're fine with this, go ahead and get it (but you probably already did).  If you're not, and especially if you haven't played Fallout 1/2 to death, there's really no reason to play this instead of Fallout 1/2.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm fairly new to the whole Turned-based strategy game genre at which I only played Shadowrun Returns, XCOM, and Divinity: Original Sin and now Wasteland 2. So with my experience out of the way now I might as well get on with it!Wasteland 2 has not been regretted at all for an early access purchase, as to where I will be spending a lot of my time playing this game when the game fully releases! I feel that a lot of gamers anymore lose interest into these games, because it's not action 24/7 but I would say that these games now have got my attention and this game has taken over my life so far!Pros:1.) The environment is very detailed where it doesn't look pixilated at all and from that shows the time it took the developers to give a great Post Apocalyptic experience.2.) The variety of skills to master in at which can change a lot in the future of game play from Toaster Repair, to being a Kiss ♥♥♥ to survivors. These will keep you thinking on which will be best for each character and from that can alter what your character can do.3.) Character creation is very generic as to any other RPG element, but there's nothing wrong with that at all! Create your own character and make him/her a minigun wielding badass! But if you're not comfortable with creating your own character (or squad), you have preloaded characters to choose from at which have their own specialties for you.4.) The combat system in the game can be very tense and frustrating (in a good way)! Every combat you encounter has you looking for anyway to wipe out your enemies as fast as you can from breaking through their coverage, to flanking them with your sniper. Every battle is definitely tense from where a simple 80% or above chance to hit still will miss (most frustrating thing in the world!!!!).Cons:1.) A few minor glitches in the game which is common for a early access game, but some are still effective even though you reloaded the game before that glitch happened.2.) For my perspective and for anyone else who isn't too familiar with Turned-based strategy games, I had to restart the game a couple times as to where I screwed up and once you screwed up, you might as well restart and fix your mistakes. It may not seem like a con for others, but to me it's kind of frustrating to be restarting this game just to get it right.Verdict:I highly recommend this game for when it comes out, or even if you would like to play it right before it comes out! As for anyone who is considering buying the game full price, I would say that you wouldn't be disappointed in this purchase and would be looking forward to more hours of this game! "

												RELEASE VERSION UPDATE: Initial beta/backers review found after.This is it. This is the big one. For many people, this is one of the most anticipated games of the year - the great inspiration for Fallout, the driver of classic RPGs, the callback to a genre slowly reviving. One of the first big huge Kickstarted games. After two years in development, how does it hold up? Spoilers: it holds up damn well.Wasteland 2 is a classic RPG in the style of Fallout 1, 2, and Tactics. In fact, the original Wasteland was the inspiration for the Fallout universe, and shares many similarities and concepts with Wasteland. You take control of four fresh-faced Ranger recruits, sent out on a task to make yourselves worthy of your badges. What ends up happening is a journey across Arizona, and then some.The game starts off with character creation. You can choose to create your own Ranger from scratch, or pick a pre-made Ranger from a list. The pre-made characters are alright, but for most people, you'll want to make your own customized Rangers. You can distribute attribute and skillpoints as you see fit, change your Ranger's physical appearance, and even stick in his/her own little bio and a custom portrait.After setting yourself up, you end up in the Arizona wasteland, right outside Ranger Citadel. You are greeted by General Vargas, a veteran Ranger and an old character from Wasteland.  Another Ranger vet, Ace, has just died in action, and you and your team are sent out to investigate his murder and finish his mission as a trial. Succeed, and you all become official Rangers.At first glance, one can immediately note the biggest downside to the game - graphical fidelity. While I personally feel that the graphics do not detract from the game, and in fact works to further the atmosphere it sets about creating, it is easy to see that the game is not about the shinies. Its easily trumped by Divinity: Original Sin in terms of fidelity, but that is not to say the game looks bad. It is simply objectively dated, even for a Unity-based game. Performance also leaves something to be desired - on a GTX 765M, the game hovers at about 40-50fps, sometimes dipping below to 30. Whilst expected for a new release, it certainly does not look like it should be choking up a moderately good mobile GPU as far as it is.  However, the graphical style the game takes is very immersive - you have varying environs, from lush greens to barren browns, and everything in between. The wasteland feels desolate and real.Wasteland 2 is set in an isometric, top-down view. You control your Rangers overhead, order them around by clicking in the world. There are two world types - the main world, showing you Arizona and the rest of the area, where you go around between smaller local maps, looking for oases for water, and avoiding rad clouds, then the local maps, which is where you explore, do missions, talk to people, shoot people, all that good stuff. Combat is turn based, engaging when you run into hostiles or turn other people hostile by shooting at them/having a negative interaction. Characters take turns in commiting actions, with each action costing certain Action Points to do. Your characters can use a slew of weapons, from going in fisticuffs, to heavy armanents such as bazookas and heavy MGs, all of which can be skilled up. Positioning is key, with certain weapons being effective at certain ranges, and cover helping you avoid damage. Damaged Rangers can only be healed up with medkits, pain pills, and trauma kits if they bleed out. There is no idle healing, which means every fight has to be planned, and you have to have enough supplies to last.Overall, I feel that Wasteland 2 offers a refreshing jump back into cRPGs, bringing the spirit of post-apocalyptic games from the past well into the 21st century. If you love turn based games, old RPGs, post-apocalypse settings, then you'll love (or absolutely hate - in a good way!) Wasteland 2. Give it a try._________________________________________________________________________________Wasteland 2: One of the first gigantic projects on Kickstarter, the revival of an era, the granddaddy of Fallout, the great leap back for inXile.Is it any good (so far?) The short answer:  yes, yes it is.Wasteland 2 is one of the biggest, most high profile projects funded through Kickstarter – indeed, funding for the game came after Double Fine Adventure’s own successful Kickstarter. The game raised roughly 3,000,000USD, well exceeding its goal of 900,000USD.The game follows up on Wasteland, which was the basis for many elements in the Fallout series. Many elements seen in Fallout can be seen here – radioactive wasteland, Rangers building up a civilized society, raiders, tech-fanatics, militant religious fanatics are all present in the game, clearly showing how much it influenced other games later on.Gameplay is very much Fallout like as well. You explore the world with your party, with the world map being just that – a map that you navigate your party blimp through. Movement is dependent upon your water supply – you lose water, you die. Thankfully, there are hidden oases all over the map, giving enough opportunities to refill water to quench one’s wanderlust. In local areas, one goes about with the whole party, with your selected member doing the interactions. Conversations follow a keyword system – anything you observe in the environment might pop up as a keyword for characters in the locale, while some words in conversations can lead to further inquiries as well. Some conversation options require certain skills to be at a certain level, and can lead to clearing certain obstacles in a peaceful manner. Combat is turn based, following an AP system similar to, again, Fallout. On this, I cannot say much – I’ve only played less than two hours, and so far, the early mobs were easy enough to wipe without having to worry about cover and positioning. Even then, I did take a noteable amount of damage, and would probably lose my party members if I continued to do so.Wasteland 2 runs on Unity – so far, in this current beta build, there are no graphical options to speak of, besides resolution and an overall graphics preset. Setting it to Fantastic with an i7-4700MQ and GTX 765M, the game looks fantastic – it pushes Unity to the edge. However, this being a beta, performance is not spectacular – fully zoomed out, FRAPS was showing around 24fps to a max of 30fps, which is barely passable. Dropping presets down to standard did not help performance, so I am assuming this is a “beta is beta” issue, and will be patched before the actual launch.Is Wasteland 2 worth your time right now for 60USD? I would say, yes – if you can get past the beta-ness of it (you’ll have to download and print the reference sheet as there isn’t much of a tutorial in game), it is a good sign of the return of cRPGs and TBS games with rich narrative and an open approach to quests. While it wouldn’t hurt to wait, if you’ve been on the fence on it and can’t wait, it’s a solid game beta.			"

If you're a big fan of the fallout series this is certainly the game for you. And there hasn't been many lately. Wasteland 2 is what I like to call old school RPG. The early access seemed polished enough to be considered ""a game"" in contrast with many early versions around.It uses unity engine but delivers a good amount of graphical detail. The most important dialog have voice over which stands out in an indie game. There's a lot of complexity to keep you entertained, you can fully customize your squad.			"

								After half-hour playing with the character creation and then a good solid 90 minutes of play I am impressed with the game so far and am very much enthusiastic about seeing the end product. The gameplay is very similar to Fallout Tactics and the Jagged Alliance games, which I reckon suit it immensely, and they have retained the feel of the original Wasteland with the grim tones and occasional quirky humor (gotta love using the Smart A$$ skill to befuddle a bunch of raiders in a certain set encounter which allowed me to pass by and set up an ambush ^_^) so that is scoring top marks with me.The only downsides so far are the occasional bugs (for one, doing alt-tab to chat with a friend who asked how the game was resulted in a crash - ironic!) which one can easily forgive given that it's still in Beta; plenty of time to chase up those issues.So in the end I'm giving it 8.5/10 and highly expectant of giving top marks for the final release.Now time for me to dive back in and get to saving what's left of Arizona; it's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it...

								Has the feel of Fallout 1 and 2 but is very unforgiving. Character models and animations are decidedly 2001 quality but you don't need much to get the feel of knowing a crew. You can edit everything about your custom characters, even creating a backstory and skills to match. If you like the old tactical RPGs of the past, give this a try.			"

												Hello all. I've been playing this game for several hours now and just completed  first mission. To be honest. Wasteland seems like a lot of Waste time. Just read a little before you commend. Believe me when i say that i loved Fall out series. I started with part 2, wich is actually allmost a complete copy ( graphic wise) of watse land 2. Come on guys!!!! A rlly nice budget trough kick starter and you give us graphics like that. PLS.Graphics compared to games anno 2014 , hell even anno 2005, are way, way , way better than thisIt hurts because i rlly care. Bought this game beta stage, almost a year ago......  Portraits do not fit the chars u play or npc's in-game.Music pretty dull and much of the same. Sound affects, not so good.OMG dont get me started on the combat.... The system works fine. Just some good old fashion tunr based action, BUTSPOILER ALERT               SPOILER ALERT        SPOILER ALERTbut you got chance to hit in %. Ok.... you might think, but in-game this means that even when you get a 75% ( 75% is crazy high, you need to lvl up big time before you even get near it ) chance to hit, you probably gonne miss 3 out of 4 times still (percentage is iI guess based on rolls). This does not include weapon jams, and the fact that if surrounded by 2 mobs, your caracter feels pressured and get's a 20% debuff on his hit chance. And you got to reload every once in a while 2 . Not to mention that ammo is F^%&^%% scares and if you do find a shop that sells , it's a lot of money to buy new.SO..... adding all that up. Get your team in a fight and from all 40 shot's fired, you will probably hit about 8 times and killed maybe 4 out of 5 mobs. not a joke. So in the mean time you wasted a lot off ammo and a lot of time before the next encounter.It is frustrating my brains out........I WANT THIS TO BE GOOD!!!!So to be honest, (sad face) maybe i'm gonna play a few more hour's, but honestly, I think i'll just pick up a nother game.Dont buy it. (sad face)/cry			"

												*sigh* Another day, another crushing disappointment.So look, the combat is uninspired and boring. Now, it isn't bad because the options are limited, it's bad because it's design is so shallow abd the tactical options are so very few. Fundamentally combat boils down to two options: Click on target to attack or run away, not exactly deep or engaging stuff. The story is reasonably good, at least from what i've seen, but the dialogue therein emits the overwhemingly pungent aroma of particularly strong cheese. Graphically the game doesn't look too much of an improvement over fallout 2, indeed the low poly character models are just all kinds of wrong in a game being released in this day and age. Some might give Wasteland a pass for being an old school game, i'm not one of them, whilst I agree that graphics aren't everything, when you're trying to create a game like this, atmosphere and immersion are fundamental, having my eyeballed flicked every few minutes by those low res, low poly models and the peculiar animations does not lend well to the mise en scene when it comes to creating a convincing narrative. The graphical fidelity is something that struck me almost straight away and remains the elephant in the room the entire time, it's incredibly jarring and blows away immersion from the outset, the lack of atmosphere in the game is truly disappointing considering it's a game that would have benefitted exponentially from some sense of environmental depth of scene. The other aspect of this is that the animations are so poor. The way people hurry about is deeply unnatural, and indeed combat animations are every bit as unconvincing. This all adds to the game's lack of depth and continually smashes any sense of immersion to pieces.There's a whole raft of smaller things that bug me too, for instance, the lack of a day/night cycle, which even the original Baldur's Gate had, which could have added a much needed layer of depth to that chronically boring combat - creatures that only come out at night, reduced visibility, the need for different tactics at different times of night. That's just one example of the smaller things, and before anyone dons their majestic white armour and starts foaming at the mouth, consider this: The investment level was huge so far as crpg games go, so why exactly does the gameplay feel so shallow? You cannot honestly tell me it all went into the sparce voice acting or the fmv sequences, and it's abundantly clear that it didn't go into the engine, so what gives? Where did the money go?Still, all told, by far my biggest gripe is how low rent the game looks and plays. Fargo set out to make an old school game, and whilst he has achieved that, unfortunately, I suspect in literally doing so, he has failed to take full advantage of modern technology and game design techniques. Like so many dinosaurs of the industry, it seems he too has failed to adapt, just because you're making your vision does not mean that you should shun the good that has come from the advances in both technology and the games industry at large. What irks most is that this was a game with a £3m development budget, for a crpg it should have been absolutely jawdropping with an investment like that. That, above all else, is what makes Wasteland singularly disappointing, and also raises some rather pointed questions about just where the hell that £3m went, because it sure as ♥♥♥♥ doesn't look or feel like it went into the game itself in any truly meaningful way.Larian came out of left field with an absolute stunner of a game this year with Divinity, maybe i've just been spoilt by it and can't look at Wasteland in the same light when you hold the two side by side, but to be honest, when you look at what Larian achieved with a budget a fraction of the size of Wasteland, I can't help but feel that Briand Fargo, for all his good intentions, was taking the ♥♥♥♥ when he released Wasteland into the wild. Divinity is now far and away the market leader in the crpg market, and not because of a huge budget, because the guys and girls at Larian had the kind of vision and sense to use what they have available to them to the absolute best of their ability. I can't help but feel that not only was development time on Wasteland squandered, but also kneecapped by Fargo's single minded determination to make something 'old school'.the tl;dr boils down to this: if you're a fan of Wasteland 1 or the original Fallout games, and can look past a distinctly shoddy game engine, then you might find something to like here. Otherwise, wait for a very significant sale, or just take a pass altogether and play Divinity or Xcom instead, both are vastly superior alternatives that do what they do a good deal better than Wasteland ever can, or I suspect, ever will.

								Spectacular. A wonderful mashup of Xcom: Enemy Unknown and Fallout 2. I can't wait for the full release.That being said, I don't know if 60$ is a fair price for an unfinished game - fun though it may be - but I'd happily pay 35 or 40 for it even a decade from now.			"

								Has the feel of Fallout 1 and 2 but is very unforgiving. Character models and animations are decidedly 2001 quality but you don't need much to get the feel of knowing a crew. You can edit everything about your custom characters, even creating a backstory and skills to match. If you like the old tactical RPGs of the past, give this a try.			"

Early Access Review
								After half-hour playing with the character creation and then a good solid 90 minutes of play I am impressed with the game so far and am very much enthusiastic about seeing the end product. The gameplay is very similar to Fallout Tactics and the Jagged Alliance games, which I reckon suit it immensely, and they have retained the feel of the original Wasteland with the grim tones and occasional quirky humor (gotta love using the Smart A$$ skill to befuddle a bunch of raiders in a certain set encounter which allowed me to pass by and set up an ambush ^_^) so that is scoring top marks with me.The only downsides so far are the occasional bugs (for one, doing alt-tab to chat with a friend who asked how the game was resulted in a crash - ironic!) which one can easily forgive given that it's still in Beta; plenty of time to chase up those issues.So in the end I'm giving it 8.5/10 and highly expectant of giving top marks for the final release.Now time for me to dive back in and get to saving what's left of Arizona; it's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it...

Product received for free
												First of all I did not play the original Wasteland. But when I heard that Brian Fargo, who is responsible for the best games in the world (Fallout 1 and Fallout 2), wants to make a Wasteland 2 I was immediately interested. I bought Wasteland 2 but it waited a long time before I found the time to play and in the meantime a Director's Cut edition was published, which I received for free.This game is not Fallout. But it is an awesome game nonetheless. It combines the RPG with tactics game (with more tactics element that RPG) but in a better way that Fallout Tactics did it. The game is hard. The combat is challenging and you always have less point in the skill that you need to use right now.The plot is good with some nice plot twist at the end of the game. I was surprised as it all turned out. I enjoyed the grim future of the post-nuclear wasteland. People are struggling to maintain a decent life and you cannot help everybody. Sometimes you must choose who will live and who dies. And there are a lot of mad inhabitants (just as in Mad Max series and Fallout series you could tell that something in the radiations affects the brain cells). As I love a post-nuclear setting this was one of the best example of this unfriendly world.The graphic could be better but for me it is not a major issue in a game like this. But it is done in a way to emphasis the dark world you are playing and that was done great. Personally I think that there could be more portraits. The sounds and voice acting are satisfying. Adrian Gordon wins the award for the best performance, he was outstanding. Just listen to his 'RAIN JERKS?!'. And last but not least the music. For me it was excellent. It caught the climate of the game perfectly. And I recommend to listen to the 'Cries of a Dead World' by Miracle of Sound (it is in the credits).It is not the best game in the world but I rate it 9/10. Play it. Play it now!			"

												The only reason I am glad that I never played the original Wasteland was that I would have had to spent 25 years knowing that I waiting for this.  Instead, I even missed the Kickstarter shomehow and this was a glorious surprise that I only had to anticipate for a few months.  Bravo.  Long live turn-based tactics and post-apocalyptica.			"

								This is a great apocalyptic RPG game.  Decisions you make actually matter and can effect the outcomes of missions.  The setting and NPC's are interesting, the character developement system is logical and works, i'd use your own personal portraits to give a better feel for your guys.  If your reading this and it's still in developement stage, i'd wait for official release before purchasing, but otherwise if your an RPG fan in general, this is right up your ally.			"

												Colossally overrated. -Most skills are just keys to open up different kinds of boxes-The game is a tunnel with only one way forward. You need all the skills to open all the boxes along the way, and that's it.-Sometimes, but not often enough to matter much, the tunnel branches for a moment before it merges again.-Characters are simplified and have personalities as thin as cardboard. You'll find more character depth in most FPS titles than this.-The animations are unfinished and lazy.-Combat looks and feels as real and visceral as your average MMO title.-There's a lot of dialogue, but very little of it is meaningful in any way. You just click through it all and move forward in the tunnel.-In fallout 2, playing a character with vastly differing stats changed the entire game experience and modified the plot. Here it changes your action point amounts and HP.In short: This is not the worst game out there, but if you want to play your next fallout 2, keep waiting. It isn't here.			"

								This is a great game so far, don't let the indie adjective fool you. It is well polished, designed and executed and does not feel like a basement/garage made game at all. Character creation and customization is everything you'd hope for, for a Fallout-esque game. The combat is interesting and dynamic, feeling much like the original Fallout series and Xcom series. I don't usually shell out such positive reviews, but this one deserves it.I've played a lot of other games on 'early access' that were 'indie' and this one easily surpasses all of the others I've tried. Give it a go, you won't be disappointed.			"

												Not a very good game, really. Maybe a ""FAIR"" game. DIfficult to control gameplay; difficult to see around objects-- a visibility problem which also changes with zoom level. World not as intuiative as I'd like (much time spent searching by cursor pixel by pixel & meanwhile the clock ""seems"" to be running, many people but few interactions, & so forth).Bugs in the graphics (almost as bad as bugs in cereal). Bugs in sound (the ""box"" elevator looses sound for a few secs, for eg); it's also noisy with some ambient sound while others aren't loud enough.A lag down to ~1 FPS (well, you can count/time frame changes) that's random but frequent & which shuts down gameplay completely (even ESC -> SAVE & other menu selections lag terribly at this point). One might ask: what good is a game that can't be played? Bugs aside: it's the difficult UI that's the main problem. Remember TotSC games from the late '90's: UI was simple, effective, INTUITIVE!. WL2 needs to go back (virtually) to that tech level & redevelop to standards. What a bother, you say? Well, it's all All ALL about gameplay, I say. I'm hoping the GOTY edition fixes it up, at least the bugs & visability. Signed ""i7-4790k/z97/32gb/r9-290x/1440p/ssd/fobiggles""			"

												A truly disappointing experience..It boggles the mind, how the developers managed to secure triple the budget of Divinity Original Sin yet come up with such an unpolished mess of a game. I am a huge fan of Fallout 1 and Fallout 2, and this game fails to deliver on every single factor of what made Fallout 1 and 2 such instant classics. Character skills are only there to give the illusion of variety, when really a locked chest will yield the same or sometimes WORST loot when compared to an unlocked one.Combat strategy is extremely straight forward, there are no skills whatsoever, all characters just shoot. Cover is very buggy, an obvious stone slab that seems to provide cover may actually not provide any benefits whatsoever(you have to go into combat to find out what actually IS cover)Storyline is linear as well, giving the illusion of an open world but will only allow more exploration once a criteria has been met.Quests MUST be done in a certain order or you will fail..  The *hard* choices that the developers promise seemed forced. There isnt a single hard choice that feels as though the options are justified, the game always makes you feel like you are just as dumb as the characters involved when better options are clearly out there.A very unpolished experience overall and a major disappointment, my search for a true fallout sequel continues...

												Fairly ordinary game, certainly not deserving of Game of the Year.  Poor graphics aside (which frequently don't match the text in the game), the combat is pathetic and two-dimensional (really crappy ""cover"", rarely can you get a position above your target, and everything kicks off before you can actually get yourself some good cover), and the game is pretty boring overall.  IT often crashes/runs super-slow for no apparent reason.  It's ok as a filler whilst waiting for the next Fallout or Elder Scrolls (proper RPG's)  but certainly don't pay more than like $20 for it.

Early Access Review
								When i first took a look at wasteland 2 i was suprised because i never thought Inxile was going to make a brand new sequel to wasteland 1 which was one of the best strategy based post apocalyptic rpgs of all time. It was 44 euros, but i thought ""why the hell not"" and bought it. When i first started playing i was shocked, there was so much frame drop and the game crashed when i attempted to exit the primary area of the game, i was very dissapointed BUT WAIT. I heard from the support of the game that there was an upcoming update that was going solve all the crashing issues and many more things. A week passed by and the update had finally been released, it had fixed 2,000 issues, such as bugs, glitches, and even added new structures and maps.I started up the game and i was blown away, there was no lag at all and the graphics where stunning. They had even added a store to the primary area, i exited the place and there was no crash, ""that is what im talking about"" and so the game went on with no bugs or lag. This goes to show how dedicated the wasteland 2 team is to assist their fan base in their problems. Im usualy not into giving a rating, but as i once said ""why the hell not !""8/10,thanks for your guys attention.			"

												Wasteland 2 is... interesting. Built on a flimsy engine with stilted voice acting more common in games almost twenty years ago, Fallout this is not. It's not bad, per se, but it's not good. It's a game you pick up in the bargin bin, or during a Steam Summer Sale and enjoy it, beat it and never play it again.After about two hours the lack of atmosphere, debatable story and uninspired psuedo western apocalyptic setting (snoresville) I uninstalled. Not because it was bad, but because I have a LOT better games to go play.Good if you don't have anything else. Otherwise? Just pick up A Fallout entry. They have more soul, humor, darkness and cohesion as a whole. Chris Avellone is infamous for his hokey, stilted writing and this game is no exception.Save it for a rainy day.			"

												I have mixed feelings on this game:First, I really wanted to like it. A lot. I loved the original, warts and all, and given that this was an indy effort, I was willing to put up with some rough edges. Because unlike a lot of games today, this one is a challenge! Ammo is scarce, combat is hard, decisions haunt you. I liked that part. I loved that part.BUT THE GAME F***ING CRASHES SO OFTEN.I literally cannot get through 30-60 minutes, sometimes even more like 10-15, before the game crashes out. It's not like this is a new product, it's been out for a while, and this is really kinda unacceptable. After 12 hours, and 15 crashes, I just cant deal with it anymore.Too bad... :-(			"

												[Disclaimer: kickstarter backer]Awfully clunky. Really ugly. Totally unoptimized. Bad writing. Unintuitive interfaces. Gimmicky skills, made only to overcomplicate typical cratelooting and barrelpunching. A lot of supernatural shlock. Some rudiments of quests cut or changed since alpha, which contradicts to real solution. Unpleasant stilization, especially ""2d image to 3d"" effects. (Really hate those uncanny things.) Awful american humour, on par with scary movies or american pies.Well at least it sometimes works with eyefinity/surround and not as bad as oblauts. Yet, not as playable.Can be recommended only to the true fanboys of everything post-apocalyptic, even shadow vault or time zero.			"

												This is an adequate game. When I had a lot of free time, I didn't mind investing a few tens of hours to appreciate W2's strong points. Now that I have less time for gaming, there are enough better games that I won't play Wasteland 2 again (although I'll probably reinstall to look at the Game of the Year version).In this review, I'll compare it to X-COM: Enemy Unknown and Skyrim, which seem like natural comparisons for different aspects of Wasteland 2. (I assume Fallout 3 is a more natural comparison, but I never played it.)Good partsWeaponsmithing: Interesting and fun. Deeper than the smithing system in Skyrim but easier to understand.Roaming freely: Exploring in W2 isn't as rewarding as Skyrim, but the hybrid turn-based system combined with exploring makes Wasteland 2 feel, if not bigger, at least freer than X-COM: EU.NPCs: Several but not all NPCs are well-written. NPC interactions add something that wasn't in X-COM: EU, but they're not at the level of Skyrim.Bad partsLack of tension in combat: X-COM: EU's well-designed maps and the soldiers' vurnerability made combat a taut, exciting chess match. In Wasteland 2, the lack of cover, friendly fire (by itself a great addition), and soldiers durability (on seasoned difficulty), made combat an exercise in lining up American Revolution-style and rolling your dice against the enemy. On seasoned difficulty, my soldiers never went down except to friendly fire. Ranger difficulty made combat more difficult, but the outcome of combat never felt like the result of skill or strategy.Mediocre writing: For me, the writing was good enough to made up for the uninteresting combat through the end of the Arizona section. The Rail Nomad camp and Happy Valley set up interesting scenarios. However, the narrative lost momentum after the start of the California section. When the game essentially copy-pasted the Rail Nomad scenario for another level, I lost interest.Skills: More than half of the skills feel like they were added to pad the game and provide a sink for skill points. For example, Skyrim had one skill for picking locks. Wasteland 2 has 5 or 6 skills that serve exactly the same function. What's the difference between lock picking, toaster repair, and brute force? Nothing. Skyrim's two melee combat skills are fundamentally different and highly customizable. Wasteland 2 has 3 melee combat skills that all work exactly the same. Skyrim had one speech skill. Wasteland 2 has 3 speech skills that all work exactly the same. Skyrim has two healing skills (restoration and alchemy) that could not be more functionally different. W2's two healing skills are almost exactly the same (although some of the status effect descriptions are funny). At least half of the skills in Wasteland 2 are unnecessary clones of other skills.Overall, Wasteland 2 has some strong points that are overwhelmed by it's weaknesses.			"

												“Bottle caps?! We only accept scrap.”Greetings to you, traveller! We welcome you into our wasteland with water in our cans and radiation in our lungs!You may not understand our wasteland, you may even fear it. Do not worry, we have all struggled in such ignorance or died of thirst in the desert. To understand what the wasteland is, is to understand the Great Glow. Everything is part of it, but it is the mushroom cloud that expresses it most directly.But, do you not need to seek the next mushroom cloud to find the Great Glow? The answer is no! Look into the eyes of a mutated animal that is about to attack you. See that energy, that life there? That is the Great Glow.  Of course the blessing of the Great Glow is not for free, for nothing in life is free. Study the various wasteland guides to truly understand the Great Glow, the nature of the mushroom cloud, and understand why salvation lies only through their wisdom.  And always keep these rules in mind:1. Tread lightly and carry a big gun and/or stick.2. Every animal with the prefix ‘mutated’ considers you to be its lunch. 3. If your Geiger counter starts going off the scale, you should turn around.  4. The only thing worse than a robot the size of a truck with a circular saw and a laser beam, is a robot the size of a house with a minigun, a flamethrower and half a dozen minions that are coming right for you.5. Toaster repair is essential for a good breakfast.Fun fact: The credit song “Cries of a Dead World” by Miracle of Sound perfectly captures the atmosphere of Wasteland 2. --My rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance:-	Atmosphere-	Combat & Controls-	Details-	Tactical gameplay-	Characters-	StoryBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading: -	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).--Atmosphere: S-Rank(This oddly dressed merchant sports a slight tan, huge arms and legs, a bear belly, and big beard with two white stripes in it.

												I so want to like this game... The story is nice, the writing is good, but the combat is awful. The gameplay is dated, maybe it can appeal to retro gamers or people who mistake boring mechanics with hardcore. There is a lot of boring combats, which is slow and crappy.The hard consequences that the game touted are...subpar so far. Fallout New Vegas felt more alive and your actions had more weight than here.To talk in details about the combat system, think fallout without any combat options (no called shots) and moronic AI. You just trade blows with hard-hitting melee sprinters or eagle eyed ranged NPCs that suffer from a preference to eat lead by leaving cover if someone is next to them. It's turn based, but with no tactics (you could call the cover system tactical if you were very nice) and as such it ends up being slow.The character creation system is poor and having no perks and lackluster attributes leave not so much to the imagination. The skills are varied and made necessary if you don't want to trudge throught the combats.The dialogues are sometimes a tad strange and you end up with some stereotypical NPCs. They try to put a veneer of gray on your choices with cynicism and ""realism"", but it often fall flat IMHO due to the comedic nature of some situations.A lot of the quests are fedex quests made painful by the lack of fast travel, slowness of movement and the ubiquitous boring slow combats. The so-called inhospitable wastelands are filled with oasis, making the presence of the water mechanics... strange to say the least as it never occured to me I could lack water.The ""open world"" is level locked, so even though you could probably go wherever you want, the choices are often limited.If you have most of the skills (and with the 3 NPCs you can recruit, it's easy to keep nearly all of them maxed) you'll be rich and never have to worry about ammo.I understand the devs wanted to cater to the nostalgics of Wasteland 1, but gaming has evolved and some mechanics are better left dead in the 90s.In short, a promising game with crappy combats "

												I guess I had my expectations too high. I was expecting Fallout 3 that-should-have-been, but I got this bland-looking game with tedious combat instead, and a world that is not at all atmospheric neither inhabited with interesting characters.Graphically and technically it doesn't perform too well, and looks average. 3D camera doesn't help the player experience.It could be also that my memories of the Fallout games have been muddied after so long. In any case, Wasteland 2 is not a game I liked.			"

												Wasteland 2 is a mediocre game; gained popularity based on original hit, but with current available RPG games; it does not shine.

Early Access Review
								I honestly can't see how there are so many positive reviews on this garbage at it's current state, i'm honestly starting to believe I may have recieved some ""nega copy"" from the depths that should be played by no man alike.Let me just start out with this; as a fallout 1 and 2 childhood fan, i truly looked forward to this title after seeing it raise about three million dollars. Now if you don't know already, three million creates hype for those who don't even understand the cultural relevance of the first wasteland, so this early release had something to live up to. Hell even the early reviews state that the game is promising, so maybe i'm not the one understanding what the word 'promising' means any longer. See when I think of a 'promising' three million dollar game, I think of an enjoyable yet somewhat bumpy experience at this point of development, not some poorly put together thing called a game that can't function past fifteen minutes without bugs annihilating everything in their path. And the best part, that during those fifteen minutes of play I recieve, even the bugs aside, the game is boring. Nothing, and I mean nothing, compels me to go forward with the lackluster story, the combat is atrociously broken and slow, and the whole experience feels like it was made by two men in a basement with a few connections to decent voice actors who had no idea what on earth they were doing, not a skilled development team with a ludicrous amount of money at their fingertips.But hey.

												When people go on about when FO4 is going to be released, I quickly point out that they shouldn't wait to be disappointed by bethesda, they should just buy Wasteland 2.  This game is aewsome.  Now, its not for those who never played older RPGs like fallout, and its not for those who only played them a little bit.  This game has been lovingly created by and for real CRPG fans.Its not perfect, but then, no huge RPG is - but its so close to perfect that it doesn't matter.BUY THIS GAME!			"

												This game was incredibly addicting, quite honestly. The game was challenging, and it had a pretty detailed story. The only real downside here is that the graphics aren't that great, but for a turn-based strategy game what can you really expect? This is a game I would highly suggest to anyone looking for a post-apocalypse shooter. If you're a Fallout fan, this may very well be a game you're into, as the Wasteland series is actually what the Fallout series was a spinoff of. I can easily give this game a 9/10.			"

												A very entertaining game, if only it had spent an extra year brewing before being served! It's rough round the edges, sometimes the graphics bug out and very occasionally it'll simply present you with a colour cube. Aside from that, the script is great if a little short, and the story engaging if a little simple. Some of the stats do seem a bit wonky, and you can guarantee that all your enemies have twice the Action Points that they logically should have... but it's not impossible to play and it'll take you a few days to power through, or a week of more casual playing. If you liked the original, you'll like this.			"

								So far I am loving this. I have completed the beta part of the game and it is all I could have hoped. It has a great storyline, the dialogue is good, and the choices you have to make can be damn hard at times. This is not one of those RPG's you can just flip through the dialogue, sometimes doing that will make you miss out on options that aren't obvious (or trap you into fights you could have avoided).  The combat is tactical squad warfare and well designed for the most part. I have noticed sometimes the enemies do stupid things but mostly they try to kill you. I would definitely recommend this game if you liked the old Tactical RPGs.			"

												Wanted to love it, but after about 30 hours, I just can't go on. I'm not sure where to start, but the game is just a mess all-around. The combat is boring and unbalanced, and not to mention, just repetitive. I can name a bunch of other games that have better combat, Divinity being a recent example...The exploration is as tedious as it gets...I can't stand the idea of walking into another room and having to disarm 6 more traps and unlock 6 more locks...Just blow me up already and give me the loot! And surprisingly, for everything being so ""overwritten"", (I mean there's a paragraph that describes a puddle on the ground), the story is pretty mediocre. I wouldn't consider it as good as any of the Fallout games. Sad, but no desire to ever return to this one. Maybe Wasteland 3 will do better?			"

												This is an example of when Kickstarter works with a trust established company. I backed the game but didn't play it in early access so my comments are regarding the final release.Firstly the combat is all about turn based tactical choices, the closest comparission would be Xcom Enemy Unknown and Shadowrun (Cover systems, Action points to spend per turn.etc.)You take the role of 4 Desert Rangers in a post apocolyptic wasteland years after nuclear war has annihilated the planet. (Its the original concept to the Fallout series, so fans of that will get it instantly)So far I have sunk over 45hours into this game and only in what you would call ""Act 2"" to avoid spoilers. Think Baldurs gate, Divinity series, Torment, Neverwinter Nights in terms of side quests, loot and rewards for exploration of the world. Story is engaging and entertaining but could be seen as means to an end for the 4 protagonists rather than an epic personal journey. Saying that though, the different stories and factions to discover through the world gives you incentive to carry on into the end game with curiosity. I couldn't stop playing this game, it will make you curious to explore and see what lies south of that radiation well.  "

												An interesting RPG similar in mechanics to Shadowrun Returns with a bit more complexity and scale with less reliance on player-made content. Though not all NPCs are voiced, the ones that are are done decently enough, and unvoiced characters are well-written enough. There's plenty of reference humor to movies and other pop-culture without dating itself too much. Wasteland 2 is great for fans of the post-apocalyptic setting, and manages to capture the struggle for survival just a bit better than the Fallout series, in my opinion.			"

												It is hard to write a review about Wasteland II.This game does many things in a other way, than many player expect it.It is a slow game, it has tactical turn based combat, which slowes the pace of the game down.It has beautiful written dialoges and this dialoges really carry the game, but you need to read them most of the time.So this slows the pace of the game down again.From time to time you will travel the world map, and just stare at your position marker for a time,Overall this game is slow. ANd you need to play it in this slow aproach. Take your time. Read the dialoges, follow the story, make your decisions and shoot the bad guys - which arent that bad, if you really get them to know - most are just another type of crazy :D.This game is well done, but it is not made for every kind of player.I still recommend it.

												+ Branching quests with multiple viable solutions and diverse outcomes.+ The choices you make affect the world in meaningful ways.+ Tons of content with very little filler (unlike Dragon Age: Inquisition).+ Solid writing.- Assault rifles are OP and make every other weapon type seem comparatively useless.- Combat doesn't have a lot of depth or variety.- Game was pretty buggy at launch, particularly the late game (though this may be fixed by now).- Graphics ain't too pretty.- Some skills are overly specialized (like Toaster Repair and Blunt Force).- It's easy to screw yourself over if you don't have a lot of experience with CRPGs.Conclusion: If you enjoyed the first two Fallout games, you will likely enjoy Wasteland 2. If you didn't, you probably won't. Also, if you only care about combat and don't care about things like quest design or reactivity, you'll probably get bored.			"

												I'm currently writing this review through gritted teeth and clenched fists and I'm trying hard to stay objective and clear headed.  Firstly I'm list the positive things.The atmosphere of this game is excellent and it truly feels like a real post apocalyptic world.  Immersed in this environment are numerous choices you must make that really do affect different outcomes.  Many games offer multiple conversation lines that lead to the same answer regardless of what you choose (giving the illusion of a more broad conversation) but in this game there was clearly a lot of thought put into the writing.  The replay value of this game is definitely immense.  I've read different reviews on different sites, and some of the weaknesses others have mentioned about this game, I actually see as strengths.  As an old-school gamer and a big fan of deep RPGs, I'm not looking to have things served to me on a plate.  So having to rotate my camera around, to see chests behind trees or whatnot, isn't a hinderance but actually adds to my gaming experience.Also with the large number of skills and their gradual progression, it makes possible something else I really enjoy in video games; which is revisiting old places with higher skills to make new discoveries.  That's why I always have one character with high perception skills.  Some have complained that combat in this game is repetitive.  I don't agree, I enjoy dividing my party and placing snipers at high points and using high AP characters to lead enemies into ambushes.  That's just one of the many tactics I use during combat.  I could go on and on about the positives.  Now here's the negative:I can't play it for more than an hour without a crash.  The game is extremely unstable.  I've tried every workaround mentioned by inXile staff and not a single one has worked.  I did have the Early Access version (which had the same crash problem) but I uninstalled it before I installed the released version.  Nothing works.  Now I'm just waiting for a patch that will fix these crashes before I can play again because it's really ruining the experience.Another annoyance is the right-click move button.  I need to click an area a few times before the party will actually move there.Other than that, the game is great and I highly recommend it.  I only wish these crashes would stop.			"

												This is old school gaming at it finest, this is video game evolution would have been in an alternate timeline. Instead of changing this game into an FPS...cough...fallout, Brian has restored my faith in a designer making a true evolution sequel. 25yr wait well worth it. One of my favorite games when I was young was Fallout, I played through too many times to count. Wasteland 2 brings back the joy I haven't experienced since. I expect I will be playing through this one several times.			"

												I bought the first version day one after it exited early access, and after 10 hours in I dropped it because of bugs, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ art and not so deep mechanics. Then couple of weeks ago at a game conference I heard Brian Fargo saying that they fixed a lot of stuff in DC… and damn he was right.Directors cut improved and almost every flaw the first version had, except art - it still ♥♥♥♥♥♥. But the rest - bug fixing, game balance, adding additional depth to mechanics by adding quirks and perks.All and all it was a very enjoyable experience and this time around I finished the game.A must have for any iso rpg fun. Fallout 2 is still the king, but what you gonna do:) "

												Played 31 hours in 3 days. 10 hours in to first play through decided I didnt like my setup Main menu'ed and New game.  The Game is amazing the Character creation can take an hour or more trying to fit all the skills your want in to 4 characters you quickly learn you cant have what you want, time to pick what you think you'll need.  While I see alot of comparing it to Fallout 1&2 no one mentions how close the game is to Fallout tactics the combat is almost a clone.  Fallout tactics was also a squad based game with the same Map system for travel.All in all I love the game, Best $40 I have spent this year the replay value is high and it makes me feel like I was a teen again, Playing Fallout on a computer that could barely run doom. ( Edit ) Having Completed the game I feel I should fill out the reveiw Some more.  First The Battle system does get a little bit boring shall I say? but its to be expected in a battle System of Turn Based and Guns in the end you know what is going to happen you'll hit that wall for every shot hits. The AI does tend to simply Rush at you rather than use cover but again to be expected from this type of game ( Fallouts where all the same )  But the story and the choices you make unlike normal RPG they carry a certain weight too them which after the first one or two you make and you realise this you start to question your actions, what to say to the NPC's what the out come might be and how to push it the way you want.  All in All I loved the game it felt Fleshed out and complete to me, I did not see any of the bugs the others have added to their reviews infact the only issue I did was that the Camera locked at one point and I had to Alt + Tab to fix it.  I will Play again, many times. I feel that if you want a game where choices do matter and who you Shoot changes the game this is the game for you.  I look forward to some DLC too. 10/10			"

												Phenomenal, just what I had expected and more.After 50 hours I have finally beaten the game and that with skipping some side quests mainly in the second half of the game, Rarely does a game give you so many choices alot of which are tough moral choices that have very real effects on the game, every NPC except on is killable (The commander in Sante Fe), you can play the game in every way you can think of and killing everyone or betraying the rangers are legit options that you can make and they wont stop you from progressing in the game (they will make the game harder though and I am going to start a game where I am going to kill everyone right after I finish writing this) and dont think killing everyone doesnt have benefits, unlike in other games if you kill a marchant all of what he was selling is takeable.Some people claim that the combat is the weak part of the game but I have to disagree, the combat feels great, it can get annoying sometimes with some extremely hard fights and with some enemies being able to run completely insane distances.The story is well writen and there is not a single ""bad guy"" that fights you because you are evil no one is really bad or good, most of the people in the game are in the grey area, they are all driven by ideology,religion or another motivation and even stories of tiny side quests often have interesting plots and twists.Everything you see is described in a log of sorts in the lower right side of the screen which adds to the over all immersion of the gameNo game comes without flaws though, the game is often buggy mainly in the second half of the game, the game also lacks voice narration and has alot of text which resulted in me skipping alot of text, also alot of times when confronted with a moral question by a so called ""bad guy"" alot of times it felt to me like I can only say that I agree with him or something that sounds like ""What you are doing is injust and we fight injustice"" when I actually didn't really play the good guy, I was very much in the grey area, doing things the rangers don't approve of and even lieing to my command after killing civilians and often avoiding the peaceful solution and dealing with problems guns blazing and there was not really a good way to represent the fact that what the bad guy is doing has no benefit to me, at least in my opinion.Over all this is a one of the best games that I have ever played, everything from the atmosphere to the gameplay is awesome.10 Repaired Toasters/10.

Supports up to 7 fully controllable(mostly) members in your party to explore everything. They say 80+ hours but I played 80 hours already and that was just the pre-release third of the game.

I enjoyed the atmosphere, but you might find it looks a bit cheap depending on your tastes. If you want hours upon hours of content, character building and turn based action, this is a steal.			"

								Fond of Fallout?Perhaps just post-apocolyptic games in general?if the answer is yes then stop reading this and buy Wasteland 2, as a sequal to the precurser to the Fallout series it provides everything one could want from a story and environment with a magnificent old-school game feel to it.

												why didn't i buy this game sooner?i've been following this game for a long time but for some reason i didn't get it on day 1 or when it was still in early access and that was a huge mistake.you know when you hear so many good things about a game (like you read different reviews,you watch some gameplay videos,etc,etc.) but still you can't decide if you actually like the game and want to play it or not,you have this feeling that the game is going to disappoint you,i had this feeling about wasteland 2 because i hadn't played a good crpg for a long time,i mean Diablo III was ok and Dragon Age Origins was a mastepiece but i wanted something like classic Fallout series or even Baldur's gate series but i couln't find a game like them.....and today i started playing Wasteland 2,well to be honest it's not quite the same thing as a game like  Fallout 2 But it's great,it's really really great,i mean for the first few hours i was completely blown away by this game because i thought it's gonna be another mediocore game with basic rpg elements but it was completely different from what i thought it's gonna be.this is what a crpg should look like,this is a true classic and this is the true successor of Wasteland one and Fallout 2.i can just keep talking about how much i enjoyed the game,about the different in-game mechanics and about the dialogs but i don't want to do that,i just want everyone wh osi interested in RPGs try this game and see how polished and well-made it is.one of the best games i've played in the recent years........sorry inXile and Obsidian,i willl never doubt your again.another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review by me,thanks for reading and please support these guys,they're among the few Devs who still care about the users and the gaming community.+oh and i've heard so many good things abou Divinity:Original Sin,i don't have the money to buy it tight now but i'm definietly going to buy it in the future.

												Having played the original Wasteland and every Fallout game released, (Yes, even that one for the X-Box. You know the one I'm talking about), I was pretty much expecting a better version of Fallout Tactics with a deeper, richer story line. The result? I little underwhelming, but overall a good experience.Tight, turn-based tactical combat with a rotatable isometric view mean that other than a few oddities that occur with objects that are ""between the camera and the view,"" the control is pretty solid. The game rewards you for good tactics and positioning with every weapon skill having it's pro's and it's cons. You're not penalized for having a diverse team and the biggest problem of simply having a team of grunts with no real other skills is simply that a lot of side missions will be more difficult, if not impossible.The downside... the story feels a little ""been there, bought the t-shirt."" And not just for a player of wasteland. There really isn't anything in this world that the game presents that genuinely feels original in any way, with the unfortunate majority of the various groups you come across feeling like someone blew the dust off and gave it a new coat of paint. Not a slapdash job though, but a loving restoration with a few embellishments here-and-there. The big disappointment was the final mission/ending. If any part felt like you'd played it before, it was this one. *sigh*Still, an enjoyable game for Hardcore fans of the Post Apocalyptic genre, or relative newcomers. But anyone else may want to give it a miss if retreading familiar ground doesn't catch their fancy.			"

												I recommend this game to anyone that likes a mix of Strategy with RPG elements. If you like Shadowrun I would highly recommend this to you. Especially if you like the Fallout series because the RPG element in this game is pretty much similar. Think Fallout meets Shadowrun.Anyway, before you do start the game, if you're familiar with Fallout, like in Fallout, do some research about stat gains and what it gives, and how those stat gain affects your gameplay so that you know what you can cap early on. Same goes for your skills. Except that when concerning skills, you would wanna check up on what skills are commonly needed in the wasteland to survive. Otherwise, you're going to dislike the game even before you're halfway through with it.My only issue is the formula derived for chances because it seems pretty wonky. For example, most of the times something which is  91% and above and your 1% of critical failure, you would expect it to pass without a critical failure. At most you'd expect just a failure, if not at all. But from what I noticed, it seems this game's chance formula is failure baised. Because even if a high passing rate with 80-90%, critical failure when opening doors and unlocking stuff are pretty damn common for a 1% critical failure.However, if you can live with that issue, then by all means GET THE GAME ALREADY!

												I probably put over 200 active hours into this piece of crap. I spent most of the time disgustingly frustrated with the gross lack of direction.I desperately wanted to love it. I don't think there's a game I've ever played more than Fallout 2, and this seemed to have all the makings of a similar legend made reality. The back and forth is disgusting for some of the quests. The inability to figure out exactly what the hell you're supposed to do to solve many of the quests is maddening. The skill gap between yourself and some NPCs is also unexpectedly obnoxious.When you launch the game and see the Red Boots DLC for $49.99 and you know you're being trolled, it's kind of funny. Until you realize that the entire game is one massive troll job. The developers crapped the bed with the UI. Things that could've taken fewer clicks which you must do incessantly get very old. Inventory management sucks. Selling equipment sucks as well because no one has any money to compensate you. Getting tokens to cash in at base? Useless. You'll find better crap in the wild. Everything just feels as if the developers didn't actually play the game to realize just how frustrating it is.The game could have been finished in 25-30 hours if not for never knowing what the hell you're supposed to do, and if you didn't have to run from one end of a map to another to complete some uninspiring objective. Skip it or wait until it's $4.99 because at 50% off for a Steam sale, you deserve a refund. I paid $39.99 long ago.I paid top dollar for this at release and was determined to see it through to the bitter end. I'm sorry I did.			"

												This is really fun game, when i play this, it just reminds me a of a crossover between Mount and Blade and Shadowrun.The game ""travel"" system is like mount and blade where you take your group on a journey through the wastelands of arizona trying to do all the nobel stuff that rangers do. The problem is that you have to avoid radiation and check your water levels so you dont die of thirst or radiation poisoning. while that may seem easy it can be pretty annoying to have the shortest route blocked by radiation and to take a detour means that you have to waste all your water and you end up with a dehydrated and tired group walking into an encounter. The encounters on the map are about as annoying as pokemon, imagine walking through a big grass field for an entire game of pokemon, imagine how many encounters that would be. EXACTLY! Besides those issues the world map is very well done and contains many other things to find like travelling merchants, treasure and watnot.The encounters are completely random, but most of the time you'll just be fighting either, bandits, animals, etc... but for the others it can be things like merchants, towns etc... so you get the point of encounters.The character leveling up system is interesting, at the start of the game you can either pick from a list of default characters or customise and create your own. it gives a pretty balanced set of skill and ability points to start you8r character on a certain playstyle. At the start of the game it will provide ytour characters with starting weapons based on their skills. To level up simply get enough XP and then use your radio(explain later) to call command, they will says soemthing like  ""CONGRATZ YOU GET A PROMOTION"" then you get the appropriate ability points to use one your character(s).The Radio is a unique part of the game, you use to pick-up sidequests, recieve calls/updates from command, and get issued field promotions. you will just get random transmissions, important dialoge and other watnot from the radio, also the frequency changes by itself so you dont need to worry about that.Combat is much like certain classic games, your characters initiative skill determines what order your turn is in, and works as a top down turn-based rpg. all of your actions require Action Points so it's important to conserve them, any excess points will be carried over to the next mission.not gonna talk about the storie because spoilers mate GO PLAY IT YOURSELF!so yeah...9/10 would kill a raider again			"

												I realize I never made a review for this game, so TLDR: it's good, go for it. Sure it's NOT the sequel to Fallout 2 but it's still good :)The good: Apocalyptic scenery, TBT fights, robots and odd enemies. Good translation (in French).The bad: you always play the good guys, the dark side is pretty limited or non-existent. Some script bugs (but nothing nasty). But what really gets on you is the weapons balance which really really suxx, and that a lot of the skills are useless. I dunno, maybe wait a bit; they're still actively patching the game after all.

												To me, Wasteland 2 feels like Fallout and Baldur's gate/Icewind Dale got dumped into a blender, and the result is a great old-school, hardass (true to the Wasteland name, it is a ballbustingly hard game!) RPG. The game looks very good graphically, and the story is, so far, pretty good. Like the original Wasteland, you have a plethora of skills to choose from -- weapon, utilitarian, dialogue, and the selection of weapons is also pretty good, although if you like energy weapons, I'd suggest waiting before taking points in the skill, as it will take a while before finding some. In short: This game is awesome! If you enjoyed the old Fallout games, and any of the Infinity Engine RPGs, this game is a MUST PLAY. inXile has done a stellar job with this one, and I HEARTILY agree with PCWorld saying this is GoTY of 2014 -- it absolutely is!

												Incredibly immersive character development and plot-- and adequate graphics for even the most shallow gamer. I managed to find a few plot glitches and 1 graphical error, but I'm lead to believe that they will be resolved by the devs in time. It has some roguelike elements, such as the irreversable death of party members-- the permanent results of your decisions, and the cold pain of knowing you could have done better if you had ""only known."" I give it a solid A, being bumped to A+ when the graphic and plot progression errors are smoothed out. The game has some pretty extreme replay value, not to mention huge potential for steam workshop additions, and further additions by the developers.This has to be one of the VERY FEW crowd funded games I've played that wasn't an overhyped sack of crap.

You're not penalized for having a diverse team and the biggest problem of simply having a team of grunts with no real other skills is simply that a lot of side missions will be more difficult, if not impossible.The downside... the story feels a little ""been there, bought the t-shirt."" And not just for a player of wasteland. There really isn't anything in this world that the game presents that genuinely feels original in any way, with the unfortunate majority of the various groups you come across feeling like someone blew the dust off and gave it a new coat of paint. Not a slapdash job though, but a loving restoration with a few embellishments here-and-there. The big disappointment was the final mission/ending. If any part felt like you'd played it before, it was this one. *sigh*Still, an enjoyable game for Hardcore fans of the Post Apocalyptic genre, or relative newcomers. But anyone else may want to give it a miss if retreading familiar ground doesn't catch their fancy.			"

												I probably put over 200 active hours into this piece of crap. I spent most of the time disgustingly frustrated with the gross lack of direction.I desperately wanted to love it. I don't think there's a game I've ever played more than Fallout 2, and this seemed to have all the makings of a similar legend made reality. The back and forth is disgusting for some of the quests. The inability to figure out exactly what the hell you're supposed to do to solve many of the quests is maddening. The skill gap between yourself and some NPCs is also unexpectedly obnoxious.When you launch the game and see the Red Boots DLC for $49.99 and you know you're being trolled, it's kind of funny. Until you realize that the entire game is one massive troll job. The developers crapped the bed with the UI. Things that could've taken fewer clicks which you must do incessantly get very old. Inventory management sucks. Selling equipment sucks as well because no one has any money to compensate you. Getting tokens to cash in at base? Useless. You'll find better crap in the wild. Everything just feels as if the developers didn't actually play the game to realize just how frustrating it is.The game could have been finished in 25-30 hours if not for never knowing what the hell you're supposed to do, and if you didn't have to run from one end of a map to another to complete some uninspiring objective. Skip it or wait until it's $4.99 because at 50% off for a Steam sale, you deserve a refund. I paid $39.99 long ago.I paid top dollar for this at release and was determined to see it through to the bitter end. I'm sorry I did.			"

												I recommend this game to anyone that likes a mix of Strategy with RPG elements. If you like Shadowrun I would highly recommend this to you. Especially if you like the Fallout series because the RPG element in this game is pretty much similar. Think Fallout meets Shadowrun.Anyway, before you do start the game, if you're familiar with Fallout, like in Fallout, do some research about stat gains and what it gives, and how those stat gain affects your gameplay so that you know what you can cap early on. Same goes for your skills. Except that when concerning skills, you would wanna check up on what skills are commonly needed in the wasteland to survive. Otherwise, you're going to dislike the game even before you're halfway through with it.My only issue is the formula derived for chances because it seems pretty wonky. For example, most of the times something which is  91% and above and your 1% of critical failure, you would expect it to pass without a critical failure. At most you'd expect just a failure, if not at all. But from what I noticed, it seems this game's chance formula is failure baised. Because even if a high passing rate with 80-90%, critical failure when opening doors and unlocking stuff are pretty damn common for a 1% critical failure.However, if you can live with that issue, then by all means GET THE GAME ALREADY!

												Huge fan of the old fallouts and Fallout Tactics and Wasteland 2 looked great in the kickstarter. So I threw some money away and was super excited when it came out.Now I play it and it's kinda like bad sex, sure it's a little fun but your wishing hoping it will get good at some point. To make matters worse Randomly she starts talking and wont shut up and other times you have to read her signals when non are given and she gets mad at you for not reading her better.All and all a horrible game. hate the lack of good constant voice overs, plus the lack of any voice at many points. Come on fallout tactics came out like 10 years ago and almost every toon talks as well as the fact the items are far too many and far too useless.Will never recommend this game and never fund another kick starter.

Early Access Review
								Currently I have access to the beta and here are the notes I am forwarding to Inexile.  In general:This beta is stable, more stable than many ""finished"" game releases I have dealt with in the past.  Not one slow down, not one hang, not one crash.  Amazing for a beta.The game is exactly what I wanted.  Something very similar to the old school FALLOUT games.  Lots of dialog, mature subject matter in some places (not suitable for children though no swearing yet), and no funky dialog like you sometimes get with translations from some other language into english.Though I am attaching my beta notes which suggest several issues, I give this game a 4/5 stars in its beta state, and hope beta problems I did find are addressed.  None of the things I note prevented game play.Build #42098#1  Inventory Review (right click on mesh top).  The descriptive text has a spelling error.  ""This laced top will have to fellas tying themselves in knots"".  Might warrant a review of item descriptions for correctness.  Maybe the user community can help with this.#2  No obvious way to transfer items between characters other than tediously dropping items to the ground and having a different team member pick them up.I was wrong with this one.  If you notice the cursor icon when left clicking an inventory item, in the upper left corner is a little white arrow.  This arrow needs to be in the icon window of target PC, the item will transfer to that PC inventory when you drag and drop.  My bad.#3  Fraps keys do not seem to work so getting screen shots does not work.  Was hoping the game would have a hot key for screenshots too.#4  Rotate of camera is not particularly smooth and seems to get stuck at times requiring a continued restart of mouse movement.  This makes working your way through some maps very difficult.#5  Do not see a way to change the angle of view.  One can zoom and rotate but not change the angle of view in order too at a greater distance or less distance.  This is certainly not a requirement and for most will likely not affect gameplay but most games that allow rotate and zoom allow angle change to the view.#6  Pictures in inventory after right clicking to get additional info have jagged edges.  What happened to AA?#7  The overall feel of the interface is not as gritty as I would have liked.  It is difficulty not to compare this game to the likes of Fallout and Fallout2, and I will refrain from doing so as much as possible.  In this case though it is an excellent way to describe what I mean.  The fallout interface had the feel of the game.  This interface does not.  It is too clean and lacks details and imagination.  The interface is functional for game play but could have been far more visually appealing.  I believe this significant because of the amount of time spent in the inventory and character screens so time spent updating these interface elements would go a long way to improving the feel of the game.#8  Either audio is having problems with dialog, or some of the dialog has not been done.  For example, entering Highpool, half the dialog you have over the radio is not audible; you can only read it.#9  9mm and .39 ammo look the same.  Caused me to run out of ammo by accident on one of the PC.#10 Very dissappointing textures in some places.  For example, a raider encounter on the way to the prison.  Looks like some buildings burried in sand?  But are these visuals the best you could do?  They are rather poor, lacking interest and detail.  I am chalking this off to this being a beta with some areas not yet completed.#11. After doing goat hill, and dealing with some scorpions raiders, one of the dead raiders was blinking in and out of existence.  Not a problem for game play but an interesting bug maybe.			"

												I love many things about this game. I dislike very few things.But what is most important is that this game has the wondrous feeling of escapist post-apocalyptic exploration flavor I thought we had lost forever.When Bethesda butchered Fallout III (and although Obsidian salvaged it) -- I had no hope that I would feel the way I did in the late 90s again. I was an impressionable kid, getting owned by floaters and centaurs, unprepared, Sulik bursting like a dumba$$ riddling Vic with holes-- but I loved every moment of it.Wasteland 2 took me to that place once again, especially as you progress through the game, it becomes an old school classic that we were sorely missing in our lives for the past 20 years.This game is an heir to the likes of Baldur's Gate 2, Fallout 1&2 and of course the grandfather of them all, the original Wasteland.Thanks Brian & Co. for the liquifying energy weapon animations. Thanks for the non-linear love this game got. Thanks for all the times you listened to the community and backers. Thanks for sticking to your ideals and not caving in like Bioware at the onslaught of console idiocy. Thanks for Ertan the Satanist.Thanks for returning us 90s kids back to the world intelligent, brutal and immersive cRPG gameplay.			"

												 I don't give amazing reviews of games often. But this is a must have game for anybody who likes long games and likes to use their heads. The story line is just amazing, but I hope you like to read. This game will make you think and punish you if you just want to click through it. Just buy it and play it. Period. Note* I feel like playing this game on easy or normal would not do this game justice. I am playing it on Veteran. Great challenge and I have found myself wondering how I am going to proceed with limited supplies and such. Also, you can seriously ♥♥♥♥ your game up at the very beginning. Characters get perma-death and if you don't have the characters or resources to proceed, this game can become unbeatable. Be smart!9/10			"

												Only partially through it, but having a really good time. Love all the character building options with skills, attributes, weapon choices, etc.  Ammo can be hard to keep on hand, but that's awesome...  it's a wasteland and any such commodities should be very valuable and rare. I'm liking the resource management aspect of it and now being extra stingy on letting any bullets fly. Environments have been great, as are NPC interactions and the dialogue system. It's a different setting for me as well, very fresh, coming from so many fantasy RPG's. Nice job InXile, 2 thumbs up! and looking forward to Torment: Tide of Numenera.			"

												This game is awesome!  It runs fairly smoothly but still a little glitchy at times.  Once in a great while the camera will get stuck in one place during one of my character's combat phase.  That was the biggest and most annoying glitch I have come across.  It only happened a handful of times but I hope it gets fixed in the future.  Some of the quest feel like they need more polish.  Upon completeling certain quest, your choices feel unimportant because it does not seem to have an impact on the world.  My gripes are few and I would recommend this game to anyone who likes games with that old school RPG feel with modern turn based combat and story telling.

Didn't experience anything game breaking--besides 2 crashes--but a few quests mucked up. With the royal quicksave 3-cycle and an enthusiastic autosave function not a lot of progress was lost though. Keep in mind that if you are considering a 100% achievement completion run, you basically need a guide, because a few are easy to lock yourself out of or are amazingly obscure.

												Basically this game is a lot of fun and challenge for the most parts. But lacks some content which made Fallout and other similar games the best.Combat:One of the biggest downs is the non avaible sneak mode. Once your spotted (and you will be at a very long range usually)every enemy near the one who spot you will enter combat. That part is okay i guess, because if you get spotted by an enemy human guard IRL i guess he would scream for help and the other would still be coming because of the gunfire.But usually there is huge open areas which are impossible to sneak through without taking a totally different way which anyhow leads up to a combat situation just from an other entry point. So forget about playing sneaky because there are no stealthboys in this game. And also the hit ratio seems messed up (or im just really unlucky).Questing: I have really enjoyed the quest, its no pointing fingers in this game. You just get a general tip of the whereabout of whatever you'r searching for. It's no arrow pointing you exactly to the location to go. Which is really nice. If you do the ""right"" thing in a questline its a huge chance you end up with better supplies and another follower to your party (which is always nice because combat is unforgiving, if you play on normal or ranger difficulty).Lots of random loot you find will be of interest to various NPC's throughout the world (not the junk items, altho it says in tooltip that you never know who might be interested in a junk item. Still haven't found any use of em)World: Like many others said before me, its too much space with not enough content. And too many preset combat situations when walking on the map from zone to zone. Bugs: With the most recent patch i havent encountered many. Just one where monk suiciders go through stairs and walls.Overall: 6/10 Lots of fun but without enough depth to satisfy you'r RPG experience. Too much sloppy work on character development (like there are only a few of your party members on whom you can customize pants, jacket and hat) Many of them got just preset apperance. "

												Wasteland 2, oh Wasteland 2. I had more than a handful of bugs happen to me. I fought with the camera nearly the entire time of my play through. I understand why some people didn't like it. I felt frustration and almost stopped playing more times than I can remember, but boy does this game have charm. I played in Seasoned difficulty, it was painful but I was careless.If you are looking for another Fallout in the traditional form, this comes the closest. There are a few things I wish I knew from the beginning, things the game doesn't explain. The further you go into the game, the more these are revealed, and yet there are even more unexplained things scattered around the wastes. Things I couldn't figure out. Things no one has. I was a cat thrown into a laser disco. In the brief flashes of light between the waves of shadow, you were sure you saw the grin of a dog. Then the shadows come back, and the figures move, and behind all the masks are things moving to the groove of some unheard music. You know there are other cats around somewhere. But the shadows continue to dance, and it looks like one is following a laser though maybe it is not. And you don't know who is who, and what they want, but you know the only way out is through the crowd and the shadows, or you could just follow the lasers. Though in between the lights, and in between the macabre dance, a few beautiful notes licked at the edges of your perception. You could tell something beautiful was around the corner, and you weren't sure where it was going or where you were coming in but you had to find out, you had to let yourself be engulfed in the dance. The Wasteland dance.			"

												First cRPG I've ever played from start to finish. A wholy engrossing experience with a decent main story and some great side-quests (that are essentially so good and dynamic they become part of your own main story). Lots of customization and ways to solve different problems. The game is incredibly hard in the beginning but if you build a decent team it opens up after a few hours and by the end you should feel like a badass, though never totally over powered. The combat is a good mix of tactics and gear dependency and overall is very satisfying. When an enemys weapon jams just as he is about to kill one of your characters is exhilarating. Tons of weapons and armor along with vanity items and all kinds of other junk. A modern classic in every sense of the word. I bought it for 20$ at a sale and I would buy it for tripple that price. Can't recommend it enough if you can stomach the difficulty and have the time to spare. All around superb game. Buy it, buy it, BUY IT!			"

												While I missed the original Wasteland I got to play every game in the Fallout series. I believe that this game is a worthy successor, albeit not as good as the early Fallouts. It has the same perspective as Fallout 1 and 2, but is now using a 3D engine. The game is a fair bit more combat heavy compared to Fallout 2, but unlike Fallout Tactics has a far deeper role-play element to it.Details+ Character creation is quite deep with plenty of attributes, skills, and derived stats. You get to create four characters at the start of the game and up to three more NPCs can join your group at a time. There are enough skills to make you want to create specialized characters for different purposes. There are skills for using different types of weapons, social skills, ability to perform certain actions such as lockpicking, safecracking, using computers, medical skills, etc.+ Combat is turn-based and has a feel very similar to the early Fallout games except that you get to control a party instead of just one character. NPCs that join your group will sometimes choose to do their own thing if you do not have a character with high enough leadership. You get a certain number of action points to perform actions during a character's turn such as moving, using one of the weapon's firing modes or an item, reloading, and so on. Cover exists and increases both aim and defense of a character in it. When and how often characters get to move depends on their combat initiative.+ Game is long and completing it with all of the sidequests can easily take 60 hours. There are plenty of different locations to explore and while there are radioactive walls that prevent you from going to certain places before you are supposed to in the story line you generally get to decide where do you want to go.+ Story and writing are both solid. A lot of quests have multiple solutions and in a number of cases social skills can help avoid confrontation. Decisions you make will affect the ending and the ending itself will clearly show the results of your actions with slides explaining what will happen to every place you have visited.+ Great ambient soundtrack from the same composer who created music for Fallout 1 and 2 as well as Planescape: Torment and a number of other games.+ While overall graphical quality is quite poor by today's standards and character models especially could use an improvement, I feel like the designers and artists have made the most out of a kickstarter budget.- Most of the loot in the game is completely random and changes on reload encouraging save scumming. It is completely possible to crack a well-protected safe only to find a few bullets in it while a game reload could give you a nice weapon instead. Furthermore most of the loot is broken down into tiers based on location or your place in the story line so there are often points in the game when you know your party is equipped with best equipment possible until you progress further making looting until that point completely unexciting and even becoming tedious with how plentiful containers are. Also a number of items that are marked as junk end up having a purpose in some of the quests.- Some balancing issues make certain weapon types completely useless throughout the game. If you choose wrongly in the beginning you will feel screwed later on.- Due to how plentiful combat is higher difficulty levels require very specific character builds to make the most out of combat initiative and action points in order to progress. If you want to create a role-play party my advice is to stick to the default difficulty level.- The game still had plenty of bugs upon release, especially in the second half of the game. The very last few areas also feel like they have been a bit rushed, but at least the game ending is satisfying.			"

												I'm a die hard Fallout and Wasteland fan. While Fallout 1, 2 (which i consider being the greatest game in history of mankind) and even Tactics and where great games, Fallout 3 and New Vegas where FPS abominations, now worthy of Fallout name. So i've waited and waited for a true Fallout successor. Then i've got Wasteland 2. Am i disappointed? Hell no! Wasteland was father of Fallouts and Brian Fargo was father of both. You can feel his touch in every aspect of Wasteland 2. From wonderful post-apocalyptic setting, through deep development of Your characters, interesting quests and NPCs... ending with what made Fallouts such great - adult, dark humour and morally grey world, which You can shape as You want.TL:DR - forget about Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Wasteland 2 is the true successor of old Fallouts. While in terms of gameplay it feels more like Tactics, all in all it's a wonderful and complex RPG, in which You'll spend tons of hours playing.

Early Access Review
								I've been waiting for years for a sequel worthy of the Wasteland name. inXile is delivering that game.  Even in early access it is   very detailed and beautiful. It's living up to my expectations for a Wasteland sequel on modern game engine and graphics.  I love this game and can't wait for the final release.  At current state it took me about 20 hrs to get to the end of the beta. From what i hear that is only about 1/4 to 1/3 of the content at full release. Also, some content is cut off due to choices. So, that leaves alot of replayability right away. If you love old school RPG and turn based strategy, then get this game. It is going to be EPIC!			"

Early Access Review
								One of my earlier games I love to play was wasteland. So upon seeing this brings back memories and at a instant I really wanted to get this and try out besides Fallout Franchise being one of my favourites.I have play for a while now I am ready for a review. I am quite neutral about this wasteland 2. I felt something is missing as in the past.Pros1) Good depth of character customization.2) Side and main quests3) Good amount of weapons items etc4) Freedom to move around and explore5)Combat system is a pretty challenging. Cons1) Even on rookie levels can be quite a challenge. 2) You cannot go higher a few levels of each character even though you radio or farm till you completed certain quests so its quite restrain. ( BIggest Minus Point for me )3) Encounters are pretty fixed in certain areas example just south of Ranger camp you will always enounter 3 bandits no less no more most times.4) Ammo is so so hard to get and super expensive even in Rookie mode. Also items like first aid etc.5) Once in quest every encounters is crucial as almost of of your members will get injuries at some point and you need alot of first aid to scrap through. Your hp does not recover over time etc.Conclusion: If you like challenging just like xcom2 you can give this a try. However if you are one like me having not much time working and just a old school game where even at rookie stage will provide you a hairgrib then i will say give it a miss. Till now I have only play like less than a day I dun feel so much of interest of playing.  For me a game that cost over $60 I am looking for a game to enjoy and not give too much of difficulty even at rookie challenge.			"

												While the game is good and all, there is a fair warning to be said. If the first half of the game (Arizona) is more or less complete and bug free (at least from my side, there are still a lot of bug for some people), the second half (California) is full of bugs, from minor to gamebreaking. In its current states, the second half of the game is what you expect from an early access, not a release.In this state I can't recommend this game, which is sad considering how good it is in the first half, but the second half of the game can't be considered as finished. And you can blame the devs for it, since we asked to be able to test it, and they refused, arguing their QA team was working on it and it would be perfect.Basically, the more you go toward the end, the more bugs you'll find, and the more likely you will encounter a game stopping bug.Anyway, here the pros and cons of the whole game.Pros :-Lots of story. Expect a lot of talking. This is a hit or miss. Expect more talking than action, unless you shoot everything on sight.-Background. Fallout/Wasteland and their universe are a hit or miss. If you like mad max, you'll like it.-Humour, but not ridiculous. While there are a lot of easter eggs and jokes, mostly about 80' stuff, they are well done, and they are all logical in the universe. There is no joke for the sake to make a joke, as you would be able to see in fallout 2 (the Star Trek shuttle, broken dreams inn,...). -Replayability. There is a LOT of endings and choices to be made. Ranging from small to big. And not only for the main quest, but for every area.-Graphics. While it's VERY ugly when close, I find the game quite pretty from afar, and the places are really well done. I honestly enjoy it a lot.-The possibility to build your own 4 rangers party (you'll be able to recruit 3 more NPC into your party, with their own moral compass etc...). It's basically like Icewind dale, or NWN2 Storm of Zehir for party creation. As for the NPC you can recruit, do not expect Bioware's interaction, they will leave or stay according to your action, and have something to say at various place in the world. Some of them are even granted small cutscene and special interaction, and can help you dealing with something special, but it's extremely rare.Cons :-Currently unfinished. And by that, I mean some area are missing triggers, some NPC are not even named (being generic NPC), and even some area are not done (casino being outside of the building, and an excuse about unfinished work inside for example).-Full of bugs. Including gamestopping bug that prevent you from completing the game. Or less annoying, to complete an area.-Combat system. While I like it, I wish we had a lot more cover and environment to use. So far, having a single place to take cover in a fight is quite rare. Being able to take cover with your entire team is extremely rare.-RNG badly done. The game is basically inciting to savescumming if you want to open chests and whatnot. Only to find 10bullets inside a chest with 60% chance to open with the maximum skill. Why isn't it a straight check instead of some useless RNG ? -Some choices not impacting the rest of the game. Granted, only really happened in the second part of the game which is unfinished, but it's still annoying to kill several patrol of some faction, having them calling everyone on radio to say how evil you are, and still being greeted like a hero in their HQ.-Lack of weapon balance. Heavy weapons are useless, just like shotguns. While Assault Rifle and SMG are usefull for the entire game. And energy weapons being the best weapon for the mid/late game.-Lack of variety in weaponsmithing. While you can mod your guns, the mod only increase in the bonus effect, not in variety. For example, scope only provide better range, nothing else. More choices would have been cool. Also, the heavy weapons can't be modded, making them even less interesting.-Lack of stats balance. Some stats are useless, like luck, giving a chance to earn a small benefit, while another stat will provide the same bonus, with some others,  and is guaranteed. Also, combat initiative is a lot more interesting than action point, forcing you into a build, more than anything else.-Traduction unfinished for any other languages than English. It's not a problem to me (playing in English), but it can be for you, if you are playing in German or French for example.Once I'm able to finish the game, and the various side quests which are currently broken, I'll edit this review.

												Edit for the director's cut edition:One year and a director's cut after, the game still suffer of the exact same problems:  - There was no UI improvement. - There was no character building rebalance: 3 attributes out of 7 are still useless. - There was no loot rebalance: Almost every container use the same random loot list.The Quirks and Perks system feels rushed and unimaginative: most are just small bonus without any effect on gameplay.In conclusion:The DC edition don't change anything meaningfull (sic).Wasteland 2 still feels like a cheap reboot of fallout tactics: it is an ok (neither bad nor good) tactical-RPG. /End of edit4/10Wasteland 2 could be a great game but right now (october 6, 2014) it is rigged with too many bugs and balancing issues. IMHO, this games was not ready for full release.Pros: - Dialogues are well written. - The huge amount of references and nods to the 80s. Cons; - Not much strategy involved in fight, enemy AI is really meh... - A lot of skills feel redundant and artificials (5 of them are just for opening different type of door or container). - Attributes are balanced for min-maxing character, builds with 2 to 4 dump stats are recommended. - Weapon balance is terrible: Assault rifles are OP, Sniper and SMG are OK, there's only one good Energy weapon in the entire game, the rest is garbage.  - Too much randomness in loot and skill success, savescumming will lead you anywhere. - Poor optimisation. For example, any activated alarm makes the game unplayable because of lag. - Bugs: a lot of bugged quests, inventory management problems (clicking dragging fail 2 times out of 3).  - Lack of meaningfull choice: most quests are one-ended and those who aren't generally only leads to flavor consequences. Conclusion: this game need either a huge balancing patch or modding tool.Draegnar			"

												I cant recommend it yet. The Models need serious attention, and its clear that some areas received a lot of love and care in their construction and others are very much still Beta-Playtest blanks; and this is in the intro areas, Im talking about Citadel, Ag Center and Hightower.  Stat, loot and skill balancing needs work, and there's some very *very* clunky and poorly thought out UI choices, which Im unsure of whether they can blame that on Unity or not. Considering the LOD that the Cenega XCOM games, and most recently the *actual* Xcom games recieved, the turn based combat here doesnt seem retro, it just seems amateurish. not being able to force 'combat mode' so you can properly position your people to spring ambushes is particularly awful if you're trying the higher difficulty levels.Admittedly most of my gripes come down to mechanics; but the HardAss/KissAss/SmartAss mechanics ties directly into the players experience of the plot, and to split this out into three stats rather than a single Social check results in the player experiencing their characters as belligirent, smarmy or conniving caricatures, rather than intelligent people making choices. I keep putting the hours in, hoping it'll turn around, but for now Im really rather disappointed: this comes across less like a sequel to wasteland, and more like the original wasteland creators haven't played or written a game since then; and then came out of hibernation, dug out UnityInANutshell and promised all us whippersnappers a good time.

												As a fan of the fallout series I have to say that this game is a let down.  Choosing evil is a non-option.  There are only binary choices, most of which would appear to let you bring everyone together, but either through bugs or design, cannot be done.  The tactical combat is pretty boring, extremely repetitive and easy to min/max.  I found the game to be extraordinarily buggy - some dialogue just breaks, so save before every conversation.  A nice attempt, but not worth the time.			"

												Very enjoyable game. Used pre-made chars for my playthrough which was a mistake as ammo is much harder to find than I anticipated and not haaving any strong/melee chars meant quite a few things are unavailable.  This (and a few choices in-game) made things very hard. Combat is enjoyable and well done even thought its your typical RNG fest.  The only bad thing so far is having to remember quest locations although you can write notes for yourself in the quest log to help.			"

												The combat is really boring, and the only way to exit combat is to kill everything. Even when the enemy is across the map and can't see you, and you are at the map's exit, you still can't leave. So when you kill that faction leader, the entire prison aggros, and you can not leave until everyone is dead -- including those dogs that you just saved. I quit playing right then.			"

												For people who enjoy strategy and rts games like the original fallouts or xcom. This game is simply amazing. Through one playthrough I managed to sink in about 49 hours and still had a bunch of content left untouched. Infact I actually finished the game early simply because I took a wrong turn. So for those worrying about content, worry not. This had more than enough to satisfy you. On the flip side however, there are a lot of bugs in this game and I mean a LOT. All of them are solvable pretty easily but unless you save often I expect there will be countless moments of rage as a very specific quest condition isn't met requiring you to load to a previous save. Although this is beta the bug problem is still very real. But all in all it's still a great game and I recommend you to get it for the chance at spending an hour creating characters that you love and then losing them in the first encounter with wasteland creatures.

												This is really fun game, when i play this, it just reminds me a of a crossover between Mount and Blade and Shadowrun.The game ""travel"" system is like mount and blade where you take your group on a journey through the wastelands of arizona trying to do all the nobel stuff that rangers do. The problem is that you have to avoid radiation and check your water levels so you dont die of thirst or radiation poisoning. while that may seem easy it can be pretty annoying to have the shortest route blocked by radiation and to take a detour means that you have to waste all your water and you end up with a dehydrated and tired group walking into an encounter. The encounters on the map are about as annoying as pokemon, imagine walking through a big grass field for an entire game of pokemon, imagine how many encounters that would be. EXACTLY! Besides those issues the world map is very well done and contains many other things to find like travelling merchants, treasure and watnot.The encounters are completely random, but most of the time you'll just be fighting either, bandits, animals, etc... but for the others it can be things like merchants, towns etc... so you get the point of encounters.The character leveling up system is interesting, at the start of the game you can either pick from a list of default characters or customise and create your own. it gives a pretty balanced set of skill and ability points to start you8r character on a certain playstyle. At the start of the game it will provide ytour characters with starting weapons based on their skills. To level up simply get enough XP and then use your radio(explain later) to call command, they will says soemthing like  ""CONGRATZ YOU GET A PROMOTION"" then you get the appropriate ability points to use one your character(s).The Radio is a unique part of the game, you use to pick-up sidequests, recieve calls/updates from command, and get issued field promotions. you will just get random transmissions, important dialoge and other watnot from the radio, also the frequency changes by itself so you dont need to worry about that.Combat is much like certain classic games, your characters initiative skill determines what order your turn is in, and works as a top down turn-based rpg. all of your actions require Action Points so it's important to conserve them, any excess points will be carried over to the next mission.not gonna talk about the storie because spoilers mate GO PLAY IT YOURSELF!so yeah...9/10 would kill a raider again			"

												I've always been a fan of post-apocalyptic RPG's and tried the original Wasteland many many years ago.  I was excited when I first heard of the sequel, and it did not disappoint! The gameplay is very good, the story really captivates you, the characters are very well made, and every little choice you make affects the overall story.My only complaint would be that sometimes I couldn't figure out how to reach certain outcomes. (For example, I ended up getting an entire town accidentally destroyed, because I couldn't find the entrance of the place I needed to enter, and I left the town)Overall, I think the game is worth the money, and definitely worth my time. I can see myself playing this all the way through multiple times just to see all the different storylines.			"

								10/10 I really enjoy this game takes me back to the old days, like when i would play other (now outdated) team rpg games like this with all my friends. we would have the game open but we each would role play a chracter in our group as we played, its a fun way to make a single player game into a co-op game. Anyways this game has it all compelling story, mix of awesome characters, interesting world with plenty of secrets, and many many more staples of an spectacular game! for sure i wold pick this up now on the summer sale if I didnt already own this!

												Spent first 30 hours defeating first ""zone"" of the game.Progressed all the way to the next world map.Game breaking bug prevented any kind of progress on arrival in new map.Reloaded game, to an hour prior save, same bug happened.Instead of ragequiting for months untill I had worked up the desire to play again (which is what would normally happen to me in this situation with any other game), I shrugged, and restarted with a new party optimized for a wider variety of skills to the detriment of combat effectiveness, ramped up the diffuculty, and spent another 30 hours conqureing arizona again.Made it to the second world map, bug did not happen, the game became 100 times more fun with challenging enemies, interesting dialogue, and a whole slew of new adventures to have that make Arizona's map look like a friggin ghost town compared with Las Vegas.10/10 would glitch again...

												I've always been a fan of post-apocalyptic RPG's and tried the original Wasteland many many years ago.  I was excited when I first heard of the sequel, and it did not disappoint! The gameplay is very good, the story really captivates you, the characters are very well made, and every little choice you make affects the overall story.My only complaint would be that sometimes I couldn't figure out how to reach certain outcomes. (For example, I ended up getting an entire town accidentally destroyed, because I couldn't find the entrance of the place I needed to enter, and I left the town)Overall, I think the game is worth the money, and definitely worth my time. I can see myself playing this all the way through multiple times just to see all the different storylines.			"

												Awesome! If you loved Fallout 1 and 2, this is definitely the game for you. Plenty of content coupled with some weird bugs. Didn't experience anything game breaking--besides 2 crashes--but a few quests mucked up. With the royal quicksave 3-cycle and an enthusiastic autosave function not a lot of progress was lost though. Keep in mind that if you are considering a 100% achievement completion run, you basically need a guide, because a few are easy to lock yourself out of or are amazingly obscure. I did 1 role-playing runthrough and another fairly well-♥♥♥♥♥ achievement run and still missed a few.			"

												Edit after a few more hours of playBacked on Kickstarter with BG2 nostalgia. Too much of a mixed bag for me. - Writing, atmosphere and emotional engagementLet's be clear, that's why we're here. Boy have I missed playing a squad of lively characters with believable, coherent personalities (yeah I'm looking at you Bethesda). You start with 4 PCs and can have 3 NPCs at a time. The writing is good but very unequal from zone to zone, sometimes great, sometimes annoying. - Strategy, tactics and intellectual engagement Tactics are OK but get boring quite quickly. More complexity and diversity would have been nice, like with expanded science/crafting/mechanics skills and lots of consumables and craftable devices to adapt to each encounter (to have something akin to the wizards in BG2). Strategy is annoying. Your choices are too uninformed early on ; for me the beginning was very hard whereas it got too easy after I got the mechanics. Non-combat skills are universally unnerving. They are designed so that you can only get a fraction of the game per playthrough, unless you save and reload a lot, so you are left to pick between playing the game 15 times or reloading all the time. - Design and engineeringI haven't played the beta. The game is fluid and bug free on my 64-bit Ubuntu rig (still looking at you Bethesda). I initially had 1 glitch in 40 hours, but then there was a bug that made me lose 4 hours of play and that's kind of a dealbreaker for me. Loading times could have been faster, and the UI could have been better (more visible highlight mode, unified and codified representation of possible interactions (wasted one real-life hour in highpool because the highlighting of the Surgeon skill is different form that of Disarm), a panel with all the skills from everybody ...). - GraphicsLet's be clear, that's not why we're here. Isometric 3D works for me, other than that, don't care. Sometimes it's too 3D : stuff gets in the way and it's hard to click where you want (whatever). - SoundMusic OK but not memorable - would have loved some epic music. Voice acting sometimes dull, sometimes great, sometimes non-existent.			"

												While I missed the original Wasteland I got to play every game in the Fallout series. I believe that this game is a worthy successor, albeit not as good as the early Fallouts. It has the same perspective as Fallout 1 and 2, but is now using a 3D engine. The game is a fair bit more combat heavy compared to Fallout 2, but unlike Fallout Tactics has a far deeper role-play element to it.Details+ Character creation is quite deep with plenty of attributes, skills, and derived stats. You get to create four characters at the start of the game and up to three more NPCs can join your group at a time. There are enough skills to make you want to create specialized characters for different purposes. There are skills for using different types of weapons, social skills, ability to perform certain actions such as lockpicking, safecracking, using computers, medical skills, etc.+ Combat is turn-based and has a feel very similar to the early Fallout games except that you get to control a party instead of just one character. NPCs that join your group will sometimes choose to do their own thing if you do not have a character with high enough leadership. You get a certain number of action points to perform actions during a character's turn such as moving, using one of the weapon's firing modes or an item, reloading, and so on. Cover exists and increases both aim and defense of a character in it. When and how often characters get to move depends on their combat initiative.+ Game is long and completing it with all of the sidequests can easily take 60 hours. There are plenty of different locations to explore and while there are radioactive walls that prevent you from going to certain places before you are supposed to in the story line you generally get to decide where do you want to go.+ Story and writing are both solid. A lot of quests have multiple solutions and in a number of cases social skills can help avoid confrontation. Decisions you make will affect the ending and the ending itself will clearly show the results of your actions with slides explaining what will happen to every place you have visited.+ Great ambient soundtrack from the same composer who created music for Fallout 1 and 2 as well as Planescape: Torment and a number of other games.+ While overall graphical quality is quite poor by today's standards and character models especially could use an improvement, I feel like the designers and artists have made the most out of a kickstarter budget.- Most of the loot in the game is completely random and changes on reload encouraging save scumming. It is completely possible to crack a well-protected safe only to find a few bullets in it while a game reload could give you a nice weapon instead. Furthermore most of the loot is broken down into tiers based on location or your place in the story line so there are often points in the game when you know your party is equipped with best equipment possible until you progress further making looting until that point completely unexciting and even becoming tedious with how plentiful containers are. Also a number of items that are marked as junk end up having a purpose in some of the quests.- Some balancing issues make certain weapon types completely useless throughout the game. If you choose wrongly in the beginning you will feel screwed later on.- Due to how plentiful combat is higher difficulty levels require very specific character builds to make the most out of combat initiative and action points in order to progress. If you want to create a role-play party my advice is to stick to the default difficulty level.- The game still had plenty of bugs upon release, especially in the second half of the game. The very last few areas also feel like they have been a bit rushed, but at least the game ending is satisfying.			"

Early Access Review
								I recommend this digital deluxe edition to 1) everyone who liked the original wasteland, fallout 1 and 2 or fallout tactics and want such games back, 2) people who like to support crowdfunded games by independent producers, 3) people who want to participate in a beta process.The game is obviously in a beta stadium, but the game looks overall promising. If you want games with tactical, turn-based combat and adult but funny rpgs in isometric perspective with an open world and choices and consequences heres a possibilty to make such a game come true. Big publishers dont seem to want to finance such games. So the gamers have to, allowing the developers to produce a game without restrictions from publishers.You get some digital goodies and the game when its finished. The current beta is also lengthy, at least about 8-12 hours. There are still some major bugs to be fixed, optimizations to be done, some mechanics to be included, and some heavy balancing issues to be solved, but according to inXile the beta should get updated regulary and they also said, they are going to add a few maps to the beta over time. If you want to debate aspects of the game and report bugs to make the game better, you have possibilties to voice your opinion - if you like to.			"

												For people who enjoy strategy and rts games like the original fallouts or xcom. This game is simply amazing. Through one playthrough I managed to sink in about 49 hours and still had a bunch of content left untouched. Infact I actually finished the game early simply because I took a wrong turn. So for those worrying about content, worry not. This had more than enough to satisfy you. On the flip side however, there are a lot of bugs in this game and I mean a LOT. All of them are solvable pretty easily but unless you save often I expect there will be countless moments of rage as a very specific quest condition isn't met requiring you to load to a previous save. Although this is beta the bug problem is still very real. But all in all it's still a great game and I recommend you to get it for the chance at spending an hour creating characters that you love and then losing them in the first encounter with wasteland creatures.

												This is really fun game, when i play this, it just reminds me a of a crossover between Mount and Blade and Shadowrun.The game ""travel"" system is like mount and blade where you take your group on a journey through the wastelands of arizona trying to do all the nobel stuff that rangers do. The problem is that you have to avoid radiation and check your water levels so you dont die of thirst or radiation poisoning. while that may seem easy it can be pretty annoying to have the shortest route blocked by radiation and to take a detour means that you have to waste all your water and you end up with a dehydrated and tired group walking into an encounter. The encounters on the map are about as annoying as pokemon, imagine walking through a big grass field for an entire game of pokemon, imagine how many encounters that would be. EXACTLY! Besides those issues the world map is very well done and contains many other things to find like travelling merchants, treasure and watnot.The encounters are completely random, but most of the time you'll just be fighting either, bandits, animals, etc... but for the others it can be things like merchants, towns etc... so you get the point of encounters.The character leveling up system is interesting, at the start of the game you can either pick from a list of default characters or customise and create your own. it gives a pretty balanced set of skill and ability points to start you8r character on a certain playstyle. At the start of the game it will provide ytour characters with starting weapons based on their skills. To level up simply get enough XP and then use your radio(explain later) to call command, they will says soemthing like  ""CONGRATZ YOU GET A PROMOTION"" then you get the appropriate ability points to use one your character(s).The Radio is a unique part of the game, you use to pick-up sidequests, recieve calls/updates from command, and get issued field promotions. you will just get random transmissions, important dialoge and other watnot from the radio, also the frequency changes by itself so you dont need to worry about that.Combat is much like certain classic games, your characters initiative skill determines what order your turn is in, and works as a top down turn-based rpg. all of your actions require Action Points so it's important to conserve them, any excess points will be carried over to the next mission.not gonna talk about the storie because spoilers mate GO PLAY IT YOURSELF!so yeah...9/10 would kill a raider again			"

												I probably put over 200 active hours into this piece of crap. I spent most of the time disgustingly frustrated with the gross lack of direction.I desperately wanted to love it. I don't think there's a game I've ever played more than Fallout 2, and this seemed to have all the makings of a similar legend made reality. The back and forth is disgusting for some of the quests. The inability to figure out exactly what the hell you're supposed to do to solve many of the quests is maddening. The skill gap between yourself and some NPCs is also unexpectedly obnoxious.When you launch the game and see the Red Boots DLC for $49.99 and you know you're being trolled, it's kind of funny. Until you realize that the entire game is one massive troll job. The developers crapped the bed with the UI. Things that could've taken fewer clicks which you must do incessantly get very old. Inventory management sucks. Selling equipment sucks as well because no one has any money to compensate you. Getting tokens to cash in at base? Useless. You'll find better crap in the wild. Everything just feels as if the developers didn't actually play the game to realize just how frustrating it is.The game could have been finished in 25-30 hours if not for never knowing what the hell you're supposed to do, and if you didn't have to run from one end of a map to another to complete some uninspiring objective. Skip it or wait until it's $4.99 because at 50% off for a Steam sale, you deserve a refund. I paid $39.99 long ago.I paid top dollar for this at release and was determined to see it through to the bitter end. I'm sorry I did.			"

Used pre-made chars for my playthrough which was a mistake as ammo is much harder to find than I anticipated and not haaving any strong/melee chars meant quite a few things are unavailable.  This (and a few choices in-game) made things very hard. Combat is enjoyable and well done even thought its your typical RNG fest.

												Others have said it better than I will no doubt.  If you want a nostalgic walk down memory lane with a well rendered post apocalyptic setting this fulfills that.  There is a lot of great writing, jokes, easter eggs that made the game fun.  The main complaint I have is that it isn't enough for my personal taste between the other large percentage of the game which is shoot, run in circles and countlessly click skills.  I find Fallout to still be a meatier meal for my time.  To be honest, I've only reached about half of the content so far, but shoot, run in circles, click - rinse and repeat is just not for me.			"

												I was skeptical that a crowd funded game with a 60 dollar initial pricetag would actually end up being a solid title. Thankfully, I was proven wrong. I picked up the game for 40 dollars and so far it has been worth every penny.Gameplay- This isn't a game that holds your hand every step of the way, often times you need to think about what you are doing or saying (dialogue) and if you mess up it might give you an undesirable result. Personally, I enjoy it since I feel like everytime i go anywhere new there is a chance to find some need little tidbit or item that normally would not stand out.Characters- While it is unusual to find an RPG these days that allows the creation of a party (only other one i can think of is might and magic legacy), it provides an opportunity to make characters specialize in different fields. For example, I have a hand to hand bruiser that has meathead skills (break, hard ♥♥♥ and mechanical repair (not meathead but the best i could do)). Then another character has sniper computer science and smart ♥♥♥. Another cool aspect is that you can assign characters religion, nationality and even their favorite pack of smokes- who knows maybe there is a little easter egg somewhere if you have a jewish asian etc. Also there are optional companions along the way, which can add 3 more faces (max) to your party.Combat- Being as it is turn base, it takes patience, but at the same time it allows the methodical approach. A lot of people don't like weapon jamming (requires an action similar to a reload), but i like it considering it adds more variability. If you have like Classic Turn-Based combat then you will enjoy this.Loot- I dont like how treasure was dealt with in this game. I find myself normally picking up heaps of junk or 6-7 of the same crappy gun i've been using. It also seems a little odd that there is such an abundance of ammo in an apocalytic wasteland. There are also some hidden items that can be turned into npcs for rewards, so keep an eye out!The World-  The game utilizes a travel mechanic that places the part on a ""board"" in which they have to travel to different locations all the while you can be attacked by raiders and be mindful of your water supply. As for whether the game is open ended or not, I would say yes to an extent. Even though there are optional side objectives, the path always leads you in the direction of the mission. It is similar to the Mass Effect Series as both have the option for exploration and side missions, but the story missions are required to advance.Overall-Have you played Divinity: Original Sin (check)Have you played Shadowrun Returns (check)Have you played Fallout 2 (check)Did you like any of them (check)Then you will love this (check)			"

Early Access Review
								Currently I have access to the beta and here are the notes I am forwarding to Inexile.  In general:This beta is stable, more stable than many ""finished"" game releases I have dealt with in the past.  Not one slow down, not one hang, not one crash.  Amazing for a beta.The game is exactly what I wanted.  Something very similar to the old school FALLOUT games.  Lots of dialog, mature subject matter in some places (not suitable for children though no swearing yet), and no funky dialog like you sometimes get with translations from some other language into english.Though I am attaching my beta notes which suggest several issues, I give this game a 4/5 stars in its beta state, and hope beta problems I did find are addressed.  None of the things I note prevented game play.Build #42098#1  Inventory Review (right click on mesh top).  The descriptive text has a spelling error.  ""This laced top will have to fellas tying themselves in knots"".  Might warrant a review of item descriptions for correctness.  Maybe the user community can help with this.#2  No obvious way to transfer items between characters other than tediously dropping items to the ground and having a different team member pick them up.I was wrong with this one.  If you notice the cursor icon when left clicking an inventory item, in the upper left corner is a little white arrow.  This arrow needs to be in the icon window of target PC, the item will transfer to that PC inventory when you drag and drop.  My bad.#3  Fraps keys do not seem to work so getting screen shots does not work.  Was hoping the game would have a hot key for screenshots too.#4  Rotate of camera is not particularly smooth and seems to get stuck at times requiring a continued restart of mouse movement.  This makes working your way through some maps very difficult.#5  Do not see a way to change the angle of view.  One can zoom and rotate but not change the angle of view in order too at a greater distance or less distance.  This is certainly not a requirement and for most will likely not affect gameplay but most games that allow rotate and zoom allow angle change to the view.#6  Pictures in inventory after right clicking to get additional info have jagged edges.  What happened to AA?#7  The overall feel of the interface is not as gritty as I would have liked.  It is difficulty not to compare this game to the likes of Fallout and Fallout2, and I will refrain from doing so as much as possible.  In this case though it is an excellent way to describe what I mean.  The fallout interface had the feel of the game.  This interface does not.  It is too clean and lacks details and imagination.  The interface is functional for game play but could have been far more visually appealing.  I believe this significant because of the amount of time spent in the inventory and character screens so time spent updating these interface elements would go a long way to improving the feel of the game.#8  Either audio is having problems with dialog, or some of the dialog has not been done.  For example, entering Highpool, half the dialog you have over the radio is not audible; you can only read it.#9  9mm and .39 ammo look the same.  Caused me to run out of ammo by accident on one of the PC.#10 Very dissappointing textures in some places.  For example, a raider encounter on the way to the prison.  Looks like some buildings burried in sand?  But are these visuals the best you could do?  They are rather poor, lacking interest and detail.  I am chalking this off to this being a beta with some areas not yet completed.#11. After doing goat hill, and dealing with some scorpions raiders, one of the dead raiders was blinking in and out of existence.  Not a problem for game play but an interesting bug maybe.			"

												I love many things about this game. I dislike very few things.But what is most important is that this game has the wondrous feeling of escapist post-apocalyptic exploration flavor I thought we had lost forever.When Bethesda butchered Fallout III (and although Obsidian salvaged it) -- I had no hope that I would feel the way I did in the late 90s again. I was an impressionable kid, getting owned by floaters and centaurs, unprepared, Sulik bursting like a dumba$$ riddling Vic with holes-- but I loved every moment of it.Wasteland 2 took me to that place once again, especially as you progress through the game, it becomes an old school classic that we were sorely missing in our lives for the past 20 years.This game is an heir to the likes of Baldur's Gate 2, Fallout 1&2 and of course the grandfather of them all, the original Wasteland.Thanks Brian & Co. for the liquifying energy weapon animations. Thanks for the non-linear love this game got. Thanks for all the times you listened to the community and backers. Thanks for sticking to your ideals and not caving in like Bioware at the onslaught of console idiocy. Thanks for Ertan the Satanist.Thanks for returning us 90s kids back to the world intelligent, brutal and immersive cRPG gameplay.			"

Early Access Review
								So far so good, Wasteland 2 is shaping up to be a great buy but in its current state I would hold off unless you a) like beta testing or b) are nostalgic for Fallout 1+2.The game is much more combat focused than the early Fallout games but its combat system is definitely an improvement over those games. The visuals are also very pleasing and level of detail is nice. Your actions do have consequence to the world and some choices will cause certain areas to be inaccessbile, this makes me think that multiple playthroughs will be necessary in order to experience most of the comabt.Other than the obvious issues associated with being early in beta such as missing or limited content there are some major issues.  There is little feedback for most of the skills and during combat it is hard to tell how many action points some actions cost. There are also numerous bugs and pathing issues that can be frustrating but most won't ruin a playthrough.I would hesitate to buy this game now while it's in its infancy and with its current 60$ pricetag it is a sizeable investment. Down the road when it becomes more finished I would highly recommend this game. Based on the current direction I am estimating that this game will be a very enjoyable RPG.			"

												Finally, after all these years, we get a proper spiritual sequel to the first Fallout games. In fact, Wasteland 2 looks and feels so much like a Fallout game that it took me some time to accept that I had no Pipboy, Vault suit or funny perks.It's a really engaging game with an interesting story (without being revolutionary in any way), with the usual moral dilemmas and multiple paths to complete objectives. And it's great value for money; I personally spent 86 hours on a single playthrough! Granted, I like to take my time more than most, but few games offer me that much nowadays.It's not a perfect game though; the ending is lackluster and the latter half of the game (with one area in particular) is riddled with some rather annoying (but not gamebreaking) bugs. But eh, I guess the bugs is just another aspect  that emulates the good old Fallout games...All in all, I'll definetely recommend this for fans of post-apocalyptic settings, roleplaying games and the Fallout series in particular.8/10 (perhaps even 9/10 if they fix most of the bugs)			"

												This game fills the need of certain people who want games of a niche that existed in the late 90s that no longer exists. The best part of this game is not the visuals, but the descriptions that print out on the dot matrix printer, filling the role of having a GM in a roleplay game describe your surroundings. The Infinity Engine games always had the feeling of a GM narrating a story and it has been sorely missed with the Bioware games that have dominated RPGs directions of late.			"

												The game starts great - many people find it annoying, but I loved how brutal was the game to a newbie who doesn't know how to optimize the characters. Yes, you are unable to open a lot of locks, and you often can't talk the crooks out of doing bad stuff, but it's more realistic this way, and I never got the feeling I was stuck. It only made me want to play again to see the things I've missed. There are other ways to accomplish a goal even if you think you're too low on resources to do it. Combat feels right even if it's less tactical than, say, Jagged Alliance's, and the scarcity of ammo only adds to the atmosphere.On the other hand, the base story is kinda flat, and the game is slightly buggy and unpolished in some places, but there are still enough details to distract from it, so it didn't bother me most of the time. More problematic is the lack of cues for completing side quests, and it's easy to miss important locations/people, or do things in a wrong order. The end is probably the most disappointing part, as the final battles are quite anticlimatic (the badass scorpion robot on the start screen looks like a plush toy and does about as much damage to well-equipped characters). Still, the rest of the game was enjoyable enough to be worth my time.			"

Early Access Review
								This review is based on the early access so I will try to be reasonable with how I feel about the game.The game reminds me so much of Fallout 1 & 2 with support for higher resolution. The graphics are nothing spectacular but it doesnt have to be since the game focuses more on user experience and immersion. Yes immersion! I'm not a big fan of reading especially long dialogs but this game does it well by letting you visualize what's happening in the world via text (type writer) and npc barks. It totally allows you to use your imagination without even realizing it. Yes, there are a bunch of typos that I've noticed which affects my experience personally, but then again it's still on beta. I like the fact that the quest log system does not treat you like a dumb person, unlike Fallout 3 where it shows you on your compass where you need to go. Instead the log gives you details of what you've accomplished so far and what you need to do next. I'm playing the default difficulty (seasoned) which is very challenging and the loot system is well thought of. The scarcity of ammos and health pickups allow you to decide whether you should go back to citadel (home) by travelling which is by the way is very very dangerous, or just keep pursuing hoping that you'll maybe get lucky and find some loot or vendors along the way. There are also a lot of interesting items you may find such as sega genesis console, neogeo, and even a used condom. I think they are irrelevant to the game but it's defnitely entertaining. I probably won't sell them. It would really be awesome if the developers can go even further with it and allow you to give it to a person in citadel to place it in citadel collection room or something, to display your awesome finds.The controls are pretty good, it's could be improved though. But I liked the fact that I can play it with just the mouse, so I don't have to hunch down in front of my keyboard. I can just sit back, relax, with one hand on the mouse. It accomodates old gamer like me who's retired and doesn't have to work and just allow the kid inside me to just enjoy what I've missed when I was growing up working too hard. No more stiff necks and sore elbows. But like I said it can be improved. Also, if I may add, I really like how the cursor system was in fallout 1& 2. I think it's actually one of my favorite and memorable to me that right-clicking changes the cursor behavior to walking or action command. I can't remember if it was double click the walk mode to run but that would be awesome option. instead of holding down shift key.I like that they stayed away from static camera, but sometimes I wish there's an option to turn it back to static camera because the camera can get a little clunky sometimes. When you're tryign to find the travel zone it can get very frustrating, I think the way to solve this is by minimap (starcraft like)  which you can click on an area in the minimap and move the camera to that spot, which is currently not in the game. Speaking of map, I wish they have the option like in fallout 1 & 2 to have some kind of a town map that you recently visited to allow you to just go directly to a certain part of the town instead of walking all the way from the travel zone just to talk to one guy, then walking back all the way again to get out of the town. By the way the first time i took a ride at the crane elevator at highpool i was like, ""Oh cool"", but after doing that for about 10 times I'm like ""Okay..."", then I'd noticed one of my party member was left behind so i have to go through the cutscene again just to get my other team mate. I know it probably took some time and even effort for whoever designed this but it get's annoying especially when you're on the go. I'm not sure if there's vehicles in the game that you can ride like in fallout 2, and if there is it'll be awesome if you can customize it to add protection from radiation and and dehydration and allow a faster travel with options to attack random encounters using a higher outdoorsman skill. Also what's up with kick ♥♥♥, smart ♥♥♥, and hard ♥♥♥? I mean, does it really need to have 3 separate skill for each one? I hope they make this into just one skill, I don't know like just Kick ♥♥♥. I'm kinda glad that it's still in beta, which leaves a lot of room for improvements, I just hope that the deveopers are as open as they should be for suggestions and improvements. And I look forward for this awesome game to get even more awesome.Bottom line is I'm totally recommending this game if you can tolerate grotesque, rude languages, violence, drugs, prostitution, and sad reality of the world to come after the apocalipse.I know I've written a lot already, but I will add some more as I progress with the game.Thank you InXile for making this game.

								Excellent game so far. Very good storyline. I was surprised by the suspense coloring given to the whole thing. The game mechanics are really cool. The world is vast and insteresting. I'd love to have more interaction with NPCs, more side quests, mor enemies. Don't get me wrong the game is awesome, what I am asking is to spice it up a little bit. Maybe a reationship between your biography (with key words) and certain factions could be made. Things that I think the devs should take a look at: a) In closed spaces, the camera sometimes is a pain. b) I get skill points but I cannot get attribute points. In overall, I recommend this game.

												I'm a die hard Fallout and Wasteland fan. While Fallout 1, 2 (which i consider being the greatest game in history of mankind) and even Tactics and where great games, Fallout 3 and New Vegas where FPS abominations, now worthy of Fallout name. So i've waited and waited for a true Fallout successor. Then i've got Wasteland 2. Am i disappointed? Hell no! Wasteland was father of Fallouts and Brian Fargo was father of both. You can feel his touch in every aspect of Wasteland 2. From wonderful post-apocalyptic setting, through deep development of Your characters, interesting quests and NPCs... ending with what made Fallouts such great - adult, dark humour and morally grey world, which You can shape as You want.TL:DR - forget about Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Wasteland 2 is the true successor of old Fallouts. While in terms of gameplay it feels more like Tactics, all in all it's a wonderful and complex RPG, in which You'll spend tons of hours playing. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.			"

												I was hoping for a Fallout2. What we got was... something that tried to be Fallout2 and fell way, way, way short. Part of it is the skill system, part of it is loot distribution, part of it is the linear nature of the story, and map design is also pretty bad. The game can be super easy/trivial on the parts I want to be challenging, and needlessly frustrating on the parts that should be simple. There are no ""multiple ways to solve a problem"" there is one way, except they don't always tell you what that ""right way"" is. The game is a decent time-waster. It's not terrible, I certainly put more time into than other games. But I'm not going to remember it in 5 years.  But this really was billed as a 2nd coming of F01/F02 and it's not. It was a let-down, given the promises.			"

												Like all of the other kickstarter donors, I was really excited about the prospect of this game. Fallout 2 was one of my favorite games and I was craving more. Unfortunately, Wasteland 2 was a huge dissapointment for me. The game was extremely laggy on the lowest settings and the gameplay is less than refined. Many of the skills and items require a guide to figure out how things contribute to the game. I really wanted to play this game but quit a few days in because it was unbearable to play. I'm sure if this game was developed by a major studio with decent resources that it could be very enjoyable. In short, good concept but terrible, terrible execution.			"

												So, I've 42 hours on the clock and am only half way through this game (starting off to california right now). What should I say about this game? Well, I'm 31 years old and this is (PC) gaming like I was used to back in the 90s.- No dumb ""?"" above questgivers- a party which you can create by your own imagination... with the chance to really f*ck up- really interesting world with (comic like) brutality, irony and funny references to especially gaming and apocalyptic movies at nearly every point of the maps- as of now, not the best story in the world, but it fits- sometimes really hard battles (playing on the third of four difficulties)- a few minor bugs, but no showstoppers so far- tons of sidequests and decission to make which actually matter- endless amount of flavor text which is really nice to read, but not necessary for completing the game- unfortunately very rare interaction between party members - some of the larger maps could be disorientating due to size and lack of a useful mapTo sum it up. If you like older RPGs like the Baldurs Gates, Fallout 1 and 2, Arcanum or even the oringinal Wasteland, GO GET IT, DONT WAIT FOR ANY SALE! The developers really delivered what they promised and they deserve their money! Hopefully we'll get a good Addon or even Wasteland 3! For me this is the first true sucessor to Fallout 2!Thumbs up!

												The game was fun however has a huge learning curve in the beginning of the game.  Focus a few characters on specializing on a few skills and do not deviate from that.  With limited points and needing to specialize in everything it makes the game hard.  Also many quests are not clear and no maps telling you where to go makes it harder.

												I am happy to say that this was probably the best game I purchased off of STEAM for the entire year. PROS:~Super rich detail in everything.~Maps are huge. ~Ability to create your own 4 person squad from the get go. ~The ability to have a max of seven people in your party! How awesome is that!?~Lots of guns. ~You can set up ambushes/surprise attacks. Also, attacking from higher ground and behind cover equals PWNAGE! I've even had enemies throw grenades at me from low ground only to have them hit something and hit their allies instead. Awesomeness for sure!~Every single skill is usable unless you don't want to. And that simply makes some aspects of the game much harder. CONS: The game is extremely well done, and the only issues I could possibly have with it are not being able to zoom in on the map display, which can make missing parts of maps an easy thing to do, leaving you wandering back and forth until you get frustrated. Then again, I may not have noticed where I was supposed to go. Either way, it's an extremely minor thing, especially when the maps for most places are quite huge, many consisting of other areas you have to travel to in order to search the area fully. The other thing I would have liked is voice acting for everything. But I suppose I am spoiled like many others these days, where pretty much every game out now has voice acting throughout. Overall, two little things that don't deter from my experience whatsoever.			"

												Wasteland 2 is a party based RPG set in a post nuclear war USA. The player controls a squad of Desert Rangers, whose mission is to protect civilians and maintain law and order, but now an army of robots want to wipe out Humanity, and its up to the Rangers to stop them. I never played the original Wasteland, but I'm a massive fan of RPGs, and I certainly found alot to enjoy in this game.Combat is turn based on a square grid, with each action such as moving, firing, reloading and healing costing ability points, similar to Xcom or Shadowrun. Its very tactical, and you also have to pay attention to factors like cover, line of sight, weapon range and friendly fire. The maximum party size is seven, four of which are created by the player, and the others have to be recruited as you progress through quests. There is a wide variety of abilities to put points into when levelling up. You can use several different types of guns and melee weapons, but also non-combat skills including lockpicking, safecracking, computer hacking, trap disarming, machinery repair and more. These skills are very useful because many quests can be completed in multiple ways, by finding alternate routes to enter a building or unlocking extra dialogue options.The story is really good and there are lots of interesting characters and groups. From drug gangs to slavers and religious fanatics, there's always somebody more crazy in the next town. Many quests involve a conflict between two or more factions and the player has freedom to choose who to support, but you'll rarely find an obvious ""good guys"" faction, more often its a case of ""which is the lesser evil?"". Dialogue is mostly text based, with only the major characters being voiced, but its all well written with lots of dark humour.I didn't encounter any game breaking bugs, but occasionally I thought certain quest progressions could have been better. Like the time I drank from a water well, got infected with a disease, and used a normal inventory item to cure myself. Later I found the town's doctor, who asked me to investigate why the people were getting sick. I didn't have any option to say ""dude, its your well"". The only way to progress the quest was to travel to another town to find a special microscope so the doctor could check out some samples, and discover what I already knew several hours of gameplay earlier.I also didn't like that inactive companions didn't seem to gain XP. One of my earliest recruits was kind of annoying, constantly complaining about literally everything, so I wanted to ditch him. But every new recruit I found after that was several levels lower, and I didn't want to be weaker in combat, so I was stuck with him.Except for those complaints, Wasteland 2 is a really great game, and I definitely recommend it to RPG fans, although genre newcomers would be better off starting with something less complex. It took me 68 hours to finish and I didn't complete every side quest, which is excellent value for money at full price.			"

												This game was made for the likes of me, but why is the combat so simplistic?  It didnt need to be.  I could even live with the combat, but there's little reason to invest in anything other than ""intelligence"" in all of your characters.  Intelligence directly allocates skill points and skill points are everything in this game. It gets a thumbs up for the story and writing but just barely.  Possibly the biggest disappointment for me in 2015, even though this is still a B- game over all.			"

												You have already read the reviews of others and the positive ones are correct about the game. Although I would like to inform you of a few caveats.The game difficulty is well balanced at the normal suggested difficulty setting but starts to break while it is increased. Unlike Fallout Tactics, as the difficulty in Wasteland 2 increases the only change is quantitative. Your aim probability decreases, enemies do more damage etc. but the AI remains the same. Beating a battle set piece doesn't make you feel like you played well it mearly feels like you got lucky over and over again.One last pet peeve. The issue here is the half turn discrepancy between setting up your squad before combat and the first turn of combat. Since you can see battle coming you are able to plan ahead for it by setting squad order but the second battle starts all of your squad move just a little out of place and destroy all chance of strategic combat.

												Short version: this is not a great game. It will not be remembered for years to come as a high point of the genre. It will not spawn remakes and imitators. But it's still good enough, and frankly, if you like your combat turn-based and your texts long and well-enough written, you have no choice this Autiman, but to spend some time playing Wasteland 2.Now, let's dig in to see what went wrong.Character developmentAt first, character development looks good enough. For the first half of the game, you will value every Skill Point you get. Unfortunately, after that it becomes evident that character development is quite limited in Wasteland 2. You can spend Skill Points to get slightly better at hitting enemies. Or opening locks. Or disarming traps. Et cetera. But if you try to make two characters with the same specialization (say, Sniper Rifles), you will develop them in pretty much the same way. There are no ways to make a character unique: no Perks, no Feats, nothing of that sort. Why didn't the developers add such feature to the game, I can't imagine. It's not like it would require expensive voice-acting or even additional 3d models...At the very least, they could have borrowed a page from Shadowrun's rulebook, and give special abilities or bonuses at certain levels of skill. I don't really see a need to give my Sniper 10 in sniper rifles, when all it gets me is a few more percents of To Hit chance!CombatCombat here is turn-based and slightly more varied, that in Fallout 2. This is all good that could be said about it. Lacking abilities, this game offers little in a way of infulening the outcome of combat in dramatic way. This is especially dissapointing after GREAT combat in Divinity: Original Sin.In terms of combat, Wasteland 2 is far behind not only D:OS, but also both Shadowrun and X-Com. This is made worse by strange balance, which allows enemies to mostly negate all your careful placement of characters by running a very long distance in a single turn (this is not a bug: with bug, they had pretty much unlimited running range, now it's just too big).StoryShould you expect a great, thoughtfull story from a game that has Toaster Repair in its list of skills? I guess you shouldn't. But I still was disappointed by a pretty cliche main quest.Another bad mark here is tired trope where heroes take about 15 minutes to solve problems which locals could not solve for years. Negotiate a peace between two warring tribes? A bit of shooting and one dialog. Convince a community to stop ritual cannibalism? Two dialogs! Now, you shouldn't probably make the player feel like they are negotiating for peace in Middle East, but this is borderline insulting.DialoguesDialogues here are all right. Text are well-enough written and I had no wish to skip them.Still, there are to little Skill Checks, and lack of complex trees lead to shallow experience. Compare this to Arcanum's dialogues with Persuasion...WorldPost-apocalyptic games, books and movies are not known for a well-tought-out worlds. They are often seem more like a zoo. ""See here, children, this farmers worship an unexploded nuke; and those town took their god from an old folk song!""Wasteland 2 did nothing to change it. Still, some are turned off by what they consider over-the-top sillines, especially in the very beginning of the game, in Ag Center. I, for one, found acceptable, but no engaging, and the rest of the game is the same. This world does not seem alive, I can't feel anything for it, it's just a backdrop for some fighting, questing, looting and trading.SummaryRiotPixels, gave the game 78% out of 100. I think this is exactly the right score for such a game. inXile failed to make a masterpiece, but, well, it's still a good, playable game. You can spend some fine time with it. Just don't place too much hopes in it, so as not to be disappointed. I, for example, do not regret backing it on Kickstarter, and will back other inXile projects in future. I mean, what's the alternative? How much turn-based RPGs are there every year? Two? Three? Another one is good, even if it's not a great one.			"

												Wasteland 2 was one of those games that really speaks to older generations of games. There are many good as well as bad design features, but overall it's an enjoyable experience if you're willing to put yourself through it. Upon starting up your first game you create a party of four Rangers and can choose their stats and skills, select character appearance options, and write a quick bio should you so desire. Of course, one of the things that is limited by the standards of old crpgs is that you can't play your character too far off the path of the desert rangers, but still the story is interesting and features a lot of unique ideas that might just get you to crack a smile. Now there is a ton of dialogue and text in this game, but of course that means a lot of conversation options come up time after time. You'll find your self clicking things to get them out of the way, and of course sometimes this can get you into confrontations without any clear indications. Since I like to schmooze my way through many of these it was kind of annoying that there werent more options to use the skills associated with conversation, but at least they were there. The combat mechanics were probably the most fun. I played this game at the second highest difficulty on my first try and didn't have too much trouble. There are some frustrating things, like enemies walking 150 tiles across the map straight up to your characters on the first turn and punching them in the face, but so long as you're prepared you can usually deal with this by lobbing out grenades and rockets. That being said, there are plenty of different weapons to take advantage of and they are all useful and unique in different ways. Some character stats are more useful to combat than others, so it helps a ton to diversify your party because the situations that arise require different skills and weapons. Some enemies are tough to take out with light weapons, but easy targets with energy guns, and vice versa. As a piece of advice you will be binding quick save to the key closest to your keyboard hand, and pressing it often. There are times where it is not always clear what you have to do, and if you do them in the wrong order you can get into situations like endless combat for HOURS before you give up and reload. It's truly unfortunate that unorthodox situations do this to the player, as it feels restricting at times. I remember early in the game trying to expedite a mayoral race, and did as many helpful tasks as I could save for one that I could not find. Turns out the doctor, who said he didn't need any help, actually needec you to use your surgeon skill on his patients... seriously? I spent hours trying to figure this out before looking it up. Another gripe is that you will spend hours just walking across maps, for no purpouse other than you're going back and fourth for quests. There are sometimes ways around this that open up after having done enough to open up a quicker passage, but usually by this point it doesn't even matter anymore. You'll experience this enough to come to hate the experience. You'll be getting out your chair to find something to distract you for three minutes while your party walks around, and sometimes you have no idea if where you're going is going to help your quest. Truly this was the most frustrating aspect of the game. Yet another thing, many characters have the same portraits, even important ones at times. I really wish that they had taken the Baldurs Gate appreach and only gave important characters unique portraits. And the portraits, they look like they were painted by a college student. They werent bad, but felt lacking. Sometimes it made the characters you meet less unique, as they just sort of blend into each other. Now it might seem i'm going off on the negative aspects of the game, but these are things you should know before you start playing. It's by no means perfect, but hightly enjoyable. Comparable to Shadowrun Returns, where as shadowrun had a really focused story and an enjoyable simplicity, Wasteland 2 has a very big and diluted feel with explosive chests falling out of the sky and arguably more interesting combat mechanics and a big world.

												It's a decent game and I definitely got my money's worth out of it. However, the game's biggest problem is the excessive amount of combat in the latter parts of the game. The early portions of the game do a nice job of balancing combat with the rest of the content, but the latter half of the game sends you into a lot of fights that are really just tedious. That said, I still recommend the game... but I would recommend getting Shadowrun Returns or Dragonfall if you haven't picked them up before jumping into this.

												Finally an RPG like to good old days! Those who loved games like Baldurs Gate and Icewind Dale will also love this one. At least for the majority of the game. I found my self kind of hoping for an end for the last hours. Because the story, location and more was a bit off. But the 100+ hours up to that point was simply great! The first part of the game was better than the second half all over. But I think that is mostly beacuse you felt so overpowered in the later parts of the game. Even with a harder than normal difficulty. There are a few bugs still left in the game, but not anything game breaking. Like the view suddenly acts up, and you have to reload. But those bugs happens so few times, that it's really not fair to put the game down because of them.If you love old time RPG and don\t mind quite a bit of save and load scumming, then this game IS for you.

												I like the setting, I like story, I like the gameplay, I like the gore, I like the character builder, I like almost everything. But like always there is one big thing what the developers have messed up really bad.There are many Recruitable NPCs who are too squishy concerning their attributes and skills. Some RNPCs (or even everyone?!) don't have the same amount of attributes like your selfmade characters. Why?! I don't know... Furthermore their attributes don't fit to theit skills.And another point... There are still too less RNPCs. Before starting a game, I figured out how I want to play the game. I've read on some community-sites, that you should match your selfmade NPCs with the RNPCs who are waiting for me in the wastelands. With the given RNPCs I am not able to play the game as I want, not so satisfying. There are always some skills missing I'd like to have in my party. For example I'd like to have all three speech kills (Smart ♥♥♥, Kiss ♥♥♥, Hard ♥♥♥) but then I don't have enough skill points to spend on other important skills. I hope there will be a patch who changes it. The combat system could have been much more interesting. It only contains very basic stuff and in most cases the AI isn't very smart. Sometimes enemies are looking for cover but it happens very often that they stand in front of you with no cover. Melee fighters are always rushing to your party, even it is very obvious they won't survive it. Enemies with pistols are also quite stupid. They run to you and try to shoot you, even if you have more guys alive. Riflemen and snipers are smart and take cover and try to get higher positions than you.Anyway, it's a good RPG with many choices and possibilities. I'm playing it currently on Ranger-Difficulty (3rd difficulty of 4) and I must say, it's still pretty fair. Combat is challenging, but you always find enough equipment to patch your guys up.The atmosphere very good, most RNPCs have unique dialogues which are quite funny. All the descriptions you get during the game are also so good. There is very much too read, but it's worth the time to spend with it.So the points which deny a ""very good"" or ""excellent"" are:- too less RNPCs- RNPCs with bad attributes and skill which are not matching the given attributes- just basic combat system- ""bad"" AI (for melle and pistol fighters)Oh, and on ranger difficulty you don't want to miss your outdoorsman-skill. :)			"

												This game allowed me to put skill points in the ""Smartass"" skill. I continued to put points into the ""Smartass"" skill for my entire team, and then tried to save a town from raiders that scored headshots on my Smartass Sniper, killing them, then they took out my Smartass Surgeon since I forgot to get medical equipment. My Smartass Stabber got beat up with a ""Hobostick."" The Smartass Squad Leader got shot after then making a smartass comment.I literally got killed because I was a smartass.10/10			"

												It's a decent game and I definitely got my money's worth out of it. However, the game's biggest problem is the excessive amount of combat in the latter parts of the game. The early portions of the game do a nice job of balancing combat with the rest of the content, but the latter half of the game sends you into a lot of fights that are really just tedious. That said, I still recommend the game... but I would recommend getting Shadowrun Returns or Dragonfall if you haven't picked them up before jumping into this. I found them to be better (more polished) experiences that balance content with combat quite nicely.			"

												OK, I've had it; this game cracks me up.I test all the boundaries, turning over every rock, and the developers and writers have satisfied me every time. I think, ""I bet if I go back and check out this area the same dialogue will be present as if nothing happened."" WRONG. This team has impressed me every time! And all the mature humor, and little odd-n-ends just make this game even more enjoyable. Like seriously, whats up with the rubber toy? And why on that particular character? These things have been making me laugh out loud too much for what could be a serious wasteland survival game. I really read almost every line of text in this game, and look foward to even the descriptions for junk items. This game is challenging, filled with content, and highly enjoyable. Much recommended.

												Well, I recommend the game, but it isn't without it's problems.The story was interesting and the roleplaying was good.  I felt some situations were set up as gotchas, where the obvious choice inadvertently made you a child murderer or shafted you in some way farther down the chain.  That being said, despite a few ""Oh ♥♥♥♥ off"" moments, overall it was a positive gaming experience, perhaps made better for the unknown ramifications of your choices (however much I don't like gotchas).  Several quests chains possessed weird bugs that made accessing the 'best' path counter-intuitive or impossible to achieve, which was annoying after putting in the time and legwork to get those results.  The tactical combat was good, but the pre-battle set up was lacking in interesting choices.  Long range characters were the best, because they can fire at enemies to start a combat, where medium or close range characters could not.  In fact, trying to set those characters up strategically would often cause the enemy to start the battle and get to go first, ruining the 'advantage' of setting up in the first place.  In the end it just made more sense to run up to within long range, crouch the party, and open fire with snipers.When I finished the game I wasn't inspired to play through it again, and I'm not sure that's a shame.

								So far I am loving this. I have completed the beta part of the game and it is all I could have hoped. It has a great storyline, the dialogue is good, and the choices you have to make can be damn hard at times. This is not one of those RPG's you can just flip through the dialogue, sometimes doing that will make you miss out on options that aren't obvious (or trap you into fights you could have avoided).  The combat is tactical squad warfare and well designed for the most part. I have noticed sometimes the enemies do stupid things but mostly they try to kill you. I would definitely recommend this game if you liked the old Tactical RPGs.			"

												This is an example of when Kickstarter works with a trust established company. I backed the game but didn't play it in early access so my comments are regarding the final release.Firstly the combat is all about turn based tactical choices, the closest comparission would be Xcom Enemy Unknown and Shadowrun (Cover systems, Action points to spend per turn.etc.)You take the role of 4 Desert Rangers in a post apocolyptic wasteland years after nuclear war has annihilated the planet. (Its the original concept to the Fallout series, so fans of that will get it instantly)So far I have sunk over 45hours into this game and only in what you would call ""Act 2"" to avoid spoilers. Think Baldurs gate, Divinity series, Torment, Neverwinter Nights in terms of side quests, loot and rewards for exploration of the world. Story is engaging and entertaining but could be seen as means to an end for the 4 protagonists rather than an epic personal journey. Saying that though, the different stories and factions to discover through the world gives you incentive to carry on into the end game with curiosity. I couldn't stop playing this game, it will make you curious to explore and see what lies south of that radiation well.  "

												It is hard to write a review about Wasteland II.This game does many things in a other way, than many player expect it.It is a slow game, it has tactical turn based combat, which slowes the pace of the game down.It has beautiful written dialoges and this dialoges really carry the game, but you need to read them most of the time.So this slows the pace of the game down again.From time to time you will travel the world map, and just stare at your position marker for a time,Overall this game is slow. ANd you need to play it in this slow aproach. Take your time. Read the dialoges, follow the story, make your decisions and shoot the bad guys - which arent that bad, if you really get them to know - most are just another type of crazy :D.This game is well done, but it is not made for every kind of player.I still recommend it.

												An interesting RPG similar in mechanics to Shadowrun Returns with a bit more complexity and scale with less reliance on player-made content. Though not all NPCs are voiced, the ones that are are done decently enough, and unvoiced characters are well-written enough. There's plenty of reference humor to movies and other pop-culture without dating itself too much. Wasteland 2 is great for fans of the post-apocalyptic setting, and manages to capture the struggle for survival just a bit better than the Fallout series, in my opinion.			"

								Anyone who loves Fallout will love this game.  Wasteland 2 is a squad based isometric RPG set in the post-apocalyptic deserts of Arizona.  You play as the Desert Rangers, a group of old west style lawkeepers trying to keep the wastes safe for decent folk.			"

												I like Wasteland 2.  I really do, I just have so many other things that get in the way of finishing my play through.  The Director's Cut offers a slew of minor fixes that make playing the game more enjoyable.  There are a ton of other reviews that will give you a nitty gritty rundown of the features, foibles, and atmosphere.  What I'd like people to take away is that this was developed by a tiny company of ex-Interplay veterans and brought to daylight through Kickstarter.  It is worth mulling that over, because as inXile marches forward we may be seeing a real paradigm shift in how games are made and distributed.  Cutting the third-party publisher out entirely has allowed this game - a labor of both love and commerce - to come directly to us.  We can shed the slimy feeling of lining the pockets of the artificial timeline money grubbers.			"

												Wasteland 2 brings a unique style to RPG games. Giving off a fallout type of vide through out the whole game had amazing easter eggs to find and tons of interesting dialog. The combat was great and simple, Despite the minor bugs involving the camera glitching out durring combat but fixing itself after the next turn. Wasteland 2 state that there is 80+ hours.This may be true for some, yet for me it left me wanting more after finishing the game in under 60 hours. (All quests, side quests, locations, caches, characters, easter eggs, and pretty much everything was achived with a amazing immersive experience.-For me at least in under 60 hours) All and All wasteland 2 brings back the nostalga of the original wasteland and orginal fallouts. I would have to recommend this to everyone that loves the first wasteland and the fallout franchise. Although i would say i was abit annoyed by the fact it isn't open ended in terms of being able to continue to play and explore after the ending credits. I cannot however recommend this at its current pricing. the amount of content is great yet still is lacking in key areas. Best to wait for sales unless its a must have right now.			"

I can't even install it or update it!  Now I am forced to use a work around to bypass Steam's restrictions just to allow me to play the game. Shame on you Valve (Steam).

												For those unfamiliar to Wasteland, this is almost identical to the old school Fallout 1 and 2 games, great if you happen to be in a nostalgic mood. Without the nostalgia glasses however, you may find it convoluted, slow and yourself drowning in so much text, that you could just as well go buy a book to read.Also, from the little bit I've played, it *seems* very linear, the main thing about the post apoc fantasy is that you get rid of the limitations of civilisation and can do dafuq you want, not follow order after order.Wasteland 2: Director's Cut, free tryout weekend, link to my first impression video below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_7RjEy6464 "

												I have too much to say, so...Do you like Role Play Games?Do you like freedom of choice and very involving story lines?Have you ever played Fallout 1, 2 or Tactics ...and if you have, you liked it?This is the best true-to-RPG-heritage I've seen/played/read about, with lots of decisions to make (both obvious and inventive). This is a game you can pick up and project yourself into the game, play it in your style in an open world where danger has become more common than anything else. This picks up where Wasteland 1 ended (I've never played WL1, but trust me, you don't need to). The universe is better than you would probably expect (thankfully this is an 18 title).This is one of those games that you can and will pour hundreds of hours into, singleplayer, having one of the best experiences you've had - beautifully made.Just buy it!!

												Game is great. Thanks for living up to the expectations that I had set of the inXile team during the kickstarter. Really looking forward to Torment: ToN as well.My one... complaint? Eh, contemplative point? Leveling up and how it restores you to full HP from a call on the radio. I like it in a sense from the standard level up -> insta heal, but I feel a full heal lets me game the system a little too much (put members who are about to level up in the front, have them soak damage, level them up). I feel a 25% heal over a 100% heal would've suited the sense of the game abit more, ya'know, survival instinct and all that.But hey, if that's the only thing I'm picking out then the game is doing pretty well ;)			"

												The AI is replete with bugs and are highly inconsistent, making most tactical decisions irrelevant. Sheer firepower is the only thing that gets you through the firefights. Your sniper can be crouching in an elevated position and blocking the only way up, and the enemy WILL run the equivalent of 30 odd action points to circle the position just to stand beside your sniper. Likewise the AI npc follower WILL make the same circuit just to stand in front of the enemy to die. Doesn't help that the AI followers have 1 or 2 bullet shot's worth of hp and can't be healed. Even under normal circumstances depending on the AI's whim and fancy they ocassionally develop a sudden ability to produce more ability points than otherwise deemed possible so that they can come and hug your characters in a loving embrace. The AI npc inconsistency has the potential to utterly ruin your attempt for a perfect quest clearance for at least one of the compulsory quests.There's a general lack of ammunition and medipack drops at the start of the game, so each encounter has to be carefully planned and executed. Unfortunately, in the early parts of the game, much of the available ammunition can only be found in locked/trapped safes/chests/boxes, which require a significant investment into the necessary non combat skills, which affects the distribution of limited stat points for combat skills, further wasting limited ammunition. Not a bad thing in itself, but would require careful planning.A corollary to the above is, on the long run characters starting with high intel and charm will significantly outstrip all other characters in every single way. One of the earliest followers you can get is characteristic of this. Low intelligence results in inadequate points to spread amongst auxiliary abilities, which results in bombs exploding, locks breaking, alarms ringing, bone fractures, skipped conversation choices and blue screens of death, and crucially, low supplies.Other than this, an excellent, excellent game. The story is brilliant and the choices you make in the game have implications and depth, though a number are more akin to morally abstract implications.P.S. There is a hidden choice at the start of the game, though it makes your playthrough a little harder than the standard choices. And remember to pick up the damned shovel.			"

												Takes me back to the golden age. This is very much in the vein of Fallout 1/2, and aligned with the glorious RPGs of the late 90s. The game looks good, runs well, and has a good story. But most of all, you feel that this is a real world that reacts to you and your choices. And I like that they impose some choices on you that dramatically alter the direction of the game, or at least influence a certain area of it. Highly recommended.			"

												Fallout 1 and 2 remain favorites of mine. While the FPS updates of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas were great in their own way, inExile's Wasteland 2 is the true ""successor"" to Fallout's vibe and gameplay.This makes sense when you realize the Fallout universe was created as an IP-claim-avoiding homage to the original Wasteland.Many of the great people that worked on Fallout 1 & 2 have returned to make Wasteland 2, including great work from Chris Avellone on writing and design and the return of Mark Morgan's beautiful ambient music.It's worth noting this is game is thematically dark, with far less of the goofy humor that started to undermine the Fallout series. There's swearing, sex, drugs, lots of graphic violence, and many, many morally ambiguous choices.I haven't even finished the game yet, but I am already planning a second trip through the wastes. Highly recommended for fans of Fallout 1 and 2, Torment, Baldur's Gate, and post-apocalyptic fiction.			"

												Wasteland 2 is a good game, but overall fell short of my expectations. The funny thing is that the mediocrity of Wasteland 2 reminded me how great Fallout New Vegas was and I finally finished my walkthrough of that game, rather than continuing with Wasteland 2. Both games attempt the same thing in so many ways, but Fallout just does it better. The writing, the quests, the immersiveness... Even though I actually prefer isometric RPGs to Fallout's ego perspective, Wasteland's implementation of it has a wide variety of shortcomings. The world feels much more static because environmental objects cannot be manipulated, the different areas are much smaller in size, and the overall level of interaction is much lower.Other downsides to be aware of:- AI is very dumb- Percentage based skill checks lead to a lot of reloading (it probably would have been better to have a binary 100% or 0% chance).- Balancing of different weapon types is off (melee based characters seem weak, assault rifle beats everything)- Battles are not tactical enough (more types of cover would have been nice, more firing modes, more environmental interaction, better system for explosive weapons)In spite of all this critique, I enjoyed the ""classic"" feel to the game and the very post-apocalyptical setting that inspired the original Fallout. Thoroughly enyoable, but definitely not a must-have.			"

												One word... AMAZING.I am just in the start to do this review, about 40h of gaming so far. There are a lot of things to check and alternatives to pursue. Replay seems to be a very good choice to see how different the things will be.It is an old school game, but the start is very good with the film that tell the story.Pros:+ It is a complete different game experience according to the team that you set up;+ the battle is very dynamic and fluid, the NPC addapt to your strategy (I am not saying that the AI is smart, it is in fact kind dumb)+ fun aspects os the side missions and deaths;Cons:- The old school is really great, but some new designs or technology on gaming would be welcome (I am not saying the game is bad or obsolete, but some more films or photo images, perhaps in the portraits would be good);Edited:After 120 hours of game play, it is... AMAZING.Really fun and a complete different experiance based on your choices.The game worth the price and time invested on it.Have fun!			"

												Another entry of the ""CRPG revival"" or whatever. Kickstarter funded old-school RPG games.Wasteland 2 sets out to be a modern take on the old-school style of RPG, and in this it succeeds greatly. Tons of skills, lots of character customization, lots of dialogue options, tons of sidequests, etc. It's well done and overall I had a pretty good time playing it.The combat gets to be a bit same-y near the end of it, but the game was interesting enough to keep me motivated all the way through it. The story was pretty decent, although pretty ""par for the course"" for post-apocalyptic RPGs. I haven't played the first wasteland, but the story is basically the same (from what I can gather), and it's also very similar the stories from the first few Fallout games. Not to say it's bad, but it really isn't anything special.I did the majority of the side quests I found, and there are a lot of easter eggs and hidden things to find. Definitely a lot of bang for your buck without feeling like you're just checking stuff off a list (I'm looking at you, Dragon Age: Inquisition).If you're looking for a game where you can accidentally set off a trap and kill your entire party within the first 30 minutes of the game, then this game is for you.

												Well now, that is something. I had other work to do and I didn't sleep nothing today.Game is great, and better with every passing hour.It's a sequel to Wasteland, but if you never played the original, it feels like a combination of Fallout and Jagged Alliance.There is  sense of direction, the world follows certain triggers, so it is not as open as Fallout was, but there are a lot of choices and changes based on your actions are visible.You have 4 party members plus 3 recruitable NPCs, so specialization is a must. Learn too many skills on one char, and you will not be good at anything.As per main attributes, builds are often similiar - you NEED inteligence to get skill points and you NEED action points to fire guns. Others you can modify a bit (more luck for crits or str for hp for example?).Customization of characters is pretty decent. I chose the difficulty one above the lowest and it seems pretty solid.At the beginning I never had enough cash, later you swim in it.Overall, the story is fun and gameplay very addictive. You travel the world map, clear all the areas you stumble upon.A thing to note - almost no map areas are wasted, there is always something going on, a quest, an npc, a hidden cache, etc.Highy recommended 9/10 for me :)I like this succesfull kickstarter game way more than Divinity: Original Sin.

												I'm really into Fallout series, especially 1st and 2nd and I give you my word - play it. There is no such complex dialogue options as in F1 or F2 but the game is still entertaining, though. A nicely done character development, game mechanics and combat system are really rewarding. I see a lot of negative comments are related to Steam Store instead of the game itself so keep it in mind before your own judgement.			"

												It's strange because I feel drawn into it and I want to play more but there are a bunch of little things that irk me.  A character starts with a rifle, an M1, that should be using 7.62 but it uses 5.56.  Then I find more rifles that use 5.56 but do less damage than a 7.62x51.  No.  Or a Makarov pistol (really nice touch by the way because I own a real one) that uses .38.  No, it uses 9x18.  If it used 9mm I'd let it slide.  The camera sucks but I still want to play more.  Standard fare quests but I want to play more.  However, there are some feel good quests that do make sense for the world we're in.  I like the combat, it's simple but also offers some tactical maneuvers.  Use ambush and draw in the enemy.  Even my melee character can ambush from behind his cover.  Had a couple wipe outs, and a few close calls, I might even up the difficulty.  Friendly fire is a nice feature.Decent variety of character options.  I've got a melee bruiser, a Buddhist Rambo Kung Fu Surgeon, a charismatic lady leader, and a techy bomb thrower.  I enjoyed watching my Buddhist Rambo punch a guy, land a critical, and his entire torso exploded, limbs and head flying off.  Lovely.  Oh and a guy named Richard Stroker....It feels lively, like civilization can be saved.  I like whole Rangers angle, after playing some more I actually felt like my team was making a difference, we were part of something important.  Even saw the A-team which made me smile wide.It's a tad rough around the edges.  Good for a slightly older generation of gamer, there are some very nice tributes I've found so far that a teenager now may not pick up on.  Use some imagination to fill in the gaps and it's good fun.			"

												If you like these kind of game, then yes. Big yes. It has its flaws, but the ending was trully awesome. It felt like i achieved something and i am looking forward to W3. Carry on rangers, carry on...I cant pass this as a comment so i will put it here.: Added after request!True i went short with this, however, if you are interested, i can write more about it. My personal biggest flaw was rushed second sequence of the game. While the different  factions are really nice, it seems to me that there was ment to be much more  and lack of creativity. The known problem of ""i will do this for your and then i can use your radio"" that goes through the whole game. Another one would be: In the first sequence, you can aim for peace between two sides. Guess what, almost same situation is in the second sequence. Its less obvious, but its there.Game can get a little bit tedious after ""some"" time of playing, but thats probably my personal feeling. Also, energy weapons, i think they still dont work in the way they intended. When the only energy weapon recomended by ppl to use is a special one you got from kinda hidden and not so obvious ""quest"" , you know something isnt working.Dont mistake me though, the ""final battle"" was awesome, but thats becouse it happened in first sequence and i got all the help from ppl i helped in the first sequence. Its the rushed run through the second, specially visiting the base of the main antagonists. I feel like lots of dialogue was cut. Thats why first sequence just feels ""richer"" then the second. No information what happened to somebody where there obviously COULD have been something, like a note or a body on surgical table and similiar examples.Its good idea to read some guides before starting your first playthrough. Not gameplay guides, but how to make your party. So you know that inteligence is pretty good, but has some defoult spots, so less or more doesnt make a difference. That some skills are more usefull then others and stuff ect. Or you can go blind as i did on my first try, not with director edition though, but still, that was derpy.I guess this would be all, can add some things if you have some questions.			"

								I spent over 50 hours play testing the hell out of this game and wow with very little money they came up with this I am shocked about how good this is and I never write reviews period.Bad:some stupid bugs game braking bug in damonta where if you blow up the gate and do your mission you will not be able to pick it back up if you leave after hooking up the radio tower.Armor and weapons- idk if the game creator’s don’t wants you to have an op corrector but there needs to be way better armor and weapons so that way you are up to par with even the toughest sob's.merchants - have it restock or at least throw it to normal and easy mode.customizing units- why are they so weird and stiff looking and lack luster there should be a better customizing in the beginning and then some generic ugly looking caricatures and why when I put on steel armor do they not look like the bad mf er atleast look it how xcom did it.lastly why do i even want to help these guys out if there is no point in helping the ncps. They should have some type of territory or buddy system that if you help them out you actually gain something like they best warrior follows you and not just to drive the story plot. So I’m asking not throw flaver text but give me a reason to care about them and not just mow them down.Side note the lag and other dumb issues will in time be resolved so I wanted to keep these out.The GoodThere is a lot in here first. The voice acting is very good from what I expected to be just text and that is it.The different weapons that the game lets you chose and upgrades so that your play style is your falt if it does not work (wish there were more customizing)How realistic this game is and how you can do things is not just because the game says so but makes sense.The attachment to your squad that if the medic dies or sniper dies its back to square one.The way the game is set up. It slaps you around and treats you like a grown man and not like a 3 year old holding your hand.I can go on but if you like xcom and fallout 2 you will love this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Many years ago as a young teenager, I beat the first Wasteland game. My copy was on a couple of 5 1/4's, and my drives were single sided, so there was some floppy flipping involved. And there was the paragraph book. But I cherished that game like no other at the time. For me it was in a class of it's own, way more interesting then the bard's tales or m&m's or wizardry's, with a silly sort of dark humor built in. Blowing up the hotdog stand just about made me pee myself laughing. I was very happy to see it lovingly resurrected as a kickstarter project, but didn't find out about it until I saw it on steam, so I missed out on backing it. So I went ahead and grabbed the steam beta copy. After playing the beta copy for a little while, it is very obvious that this is a very well done game with high production value. The voice acting is the best I've heard in a game in a long time. The combat is satisfying and fair. The ui makes sense. Objectives feel worth doing. You would be doing yourself a dis-service if you didn't pick up a copy of this game.  "

								The game is quite polished now, although there are still some annoying bugs, but most of them can be fixed by restaring a game. Not how it should work; but oh well..I wanted to dislike this game because it was expensive and my first impressions were not thatt good. Mechanics seemed to be clunky, dialogues were cheesy.Now after 24 hours of gameplay in total, I can say that this game is pure genius. PeriodIt so much reminds me of the good old RPG games. I am always thrilled to see a new area, meet new NPCs, get new quests. What is odd because I met such a game years ago is that it will not spoonfeed you the solution. You will need to figure out how to solve things.Maybe my biggest plus for the game is the map editing. Almost all of the maps are interesting with many hidden things, side areas, various ways to approach a combat. Very intelligently designed.Of course it still needs polishing, my biggest pain is that even if I spent countless hours playing it, probbaly the nexy big patch will reset my progress. Also it would be very good to notifiy in game if an area is not accessibe yet. I spent quite a time trying to find out how to get in the prison then I read that it is not available yet...All in all, it is an awesome game, Brian Fargo is still the god of intelligent and quality RPGs.

								If you miss the RPG's of the old days, this game is an excellent one to pick up. It's a more modern view on the old school RPG's of the 90's and the developer does a realy good job of making the story, world and combat interact with eachother.I'll keep this review short. If you're into old school RPG's with tactical turn based combat and enormous costumization, it's worth it's full price.If you're into RPG's and want to try an old school RPG, it's still worth it's full price, although I wouldn't blame you for waiting till it goes down a bit.If you're not into RPG's, well you're missing out on something.

												Another entry of the ""CRPG revival"" or whatever. Kickstarter funded old-school RPG games.Wasteland 2 sets out to be a modern take on the old-school style of RPG, and in this it succeeds greatly. Tons of skills, lots of character customization, lots of dialogue options, tons of sidequests, etc. It's well done and overall I had a pretty good time playing it.The combat gets to be a bit same-y near the end of it, but the game was interesting enough to keep me motivated all the way through it. The story was pretty decent, although pretty ""par for the course"" for post-apocalyptic RPGs. I haven't played the first wasteland, but the story is basically the same (from what I can gather), and it's also very similar the stories from the first few Fallout games. Not to say it's bad, but it really isn't anything special.I did the majority of the side quests I found, and there are a lot of easter eggs and hidden things to find. Definitely a lot of bang for your buck without feeling like you're just checking stuff off a list (I'm looking at you, Dragon Age: Inquisition).If you're looking for a game where you can accidentally set off a trap and kill your entire party within the first 30 minutes of the game, then this game is for you.

rating: recommended at sale price (<20€)similar games: Fallout series, Shadowrun Returns, X-Com (to a degree), some Bioware gamestarget audience: fans of RPGs who want meaningful quests and good dialogueWasteland 2 does many things right but also many things wrong. The biggest problem I have with the game is that it is too long. If they cut out a little bit here and there I woudlnt loose motivation to play this, but after 30h, which is a lot, it kinda got dull.Another big problem is that if you want to open a safe for example with safe-cracking and you have 50% chance of opening it, you can just save the game before opening it and then keep loading the save file and try to open it. Of course you can decide not to abuse this, but the game itself could prevent this easily.But I had a good time with Wasteland 2. I didnt finish it, but thats okay. I really like the combat system which seems simple at first but is really enjoyable in my opinion unlike games like Shadowrun Returns. What I like the most is that you dont have just 2 moves for every character but every character has different amount of action points and every action the character can do costs different amount of AP and every weapon has also a different AP cost. This is a very flexible way of balancing the game and it works.I also like the visual feedback when you overkill an enemy he just explodes or his arms go off or something. The graphics of the game are bad though which wouldnt be that big of a problem if it had a distinct art style but its just dull graphics from early 2000s.The quests are really well designed and feel relevant and the characters you meet are also not bad. However I had some bugs here and there which prevented some quests from getting completed, but those bugs might be fixed now.What is a bad design decision in my opinion is perma-death. When one of your characters die, he is dead forever. The thing is having 1 more or 1 less character in your party makes a HUGE difference, so every time one of your characters die you are pretty much screwed and you have to reload a previous save game. Only place this would make sense is when people who can join your party can die, but when one of your primary characters die it should be game over.And I also dont like how you can make people join your party because as I said it makes a very HUGE difference how many people are in your party, so depending on how you skilled your characters and how many people you find or miss the game is either extremely easy or unfair. In my opinion the game should stick to a 4 character limit and balance the game with that in mind and give you a game over when 1 character dies. What they could do is increase the limit at certain parts of the game and offer you an additional party member or so.

												I'm really into Fallout series, especially 1st and 2nd and I give you my word - play it. There is no such complex dialogue options as in F1 or F2 but the game is still entertaining, though. A nicely done character development, game mechanics and combat system are really rewarding. I see a lot of negative comments are related to Steam Store instead of the game itself so keep it in mind before your own judgement.			"

												An old-style RPG, almost to a fault. I will say, it very much does feel like the logical extension of the original Wasteland/Fallout, had Fallout not gone the way of Elder Scrolls.There's some nice tactical turn-based combat here, but it's not especially deep. Similarly, the story is certianly inoffensive as far as quality, but it didn't really grab me, either. I got some nice nostalgia jolts from the presence of dialogue trees and inventories, but there's also plenty of clunky interfaces and awkward questlines.This is a game that feels out-of-time. It's not pushing anything forward, but it does play more or less like you'd expect a game from 1998 to play. As such, I think I appreciate it more in idea than in execution. And I'll say this much, if you're looking for an RPG that's long like old RPGs used to be, then buddy you will not be dissappointed.With Steam's binary scale, I think this one is more on the ""recommend"" side, but I'd throw in the caveat of ""fourty dollars is perhaps a bit high."" I liked it, but I didn't love it.			"

												Well now, that is something. I had other work to do and I didn't sleep nothing today.Game is great, and better with every passing hour.It's a sequel to Wasteland, but if you never played the original, it feels like a combination of Fallout and Jagged Alliance.There is  sense of direction, the world follows certain triggers, so it is not as open as Fallout was, but there are a lot of choices and changes based on your actions are visible.You have 4 party members plus 3 recruitable NPCs, so specialization is a must. Learn too many skills on one char, and you will not be good at anything.As per main attributes, builds are often similiar - you NEED inteligence to get skill points and you NEED action points to fire guns. Others you can modify a bit (more luck for crits or str for hp for example?).Customization of characters is pretty decent. I chose the difficulty one above the lowest and it seems pretty solid.At the beginning I never had enough cash, later you swim in it.Overall, the story is fun and gameplay very addictive. You travel the world map, clear all the areas you stumble upon.A thing to note - almost no map areas are wasted, there is always something going on, a quest, an npc, a hidden cache, etc.Highy recommended 9/10 for me :)I like this succesfull kickstarter game way more than Divinity: Original Sin.

												You want true Fallout 3? Here it is, no excuses.The buts :1) Combat is rather simplistic, a cover system, ducking, fire mode selection and an ambush option (spend some ap to shoot dudes who come into range next turn, useless imo) might please purists, might annoy if youre used to stuff like JA2 or Silent Storm.2) Simplified Armor system, no more tresholds and jazz. Weapons have a penetration rating (nyuk), resulting damage is normal when the armor rating is same or lower, if its higher damage is reduced.3) Resulting from that is a bizarro design decision where energy weapons do more damage versus a higher armor rating - e.g. a death laser kills you in power armor, but tickles if youre naked. Theres already pages of discussion elsewhere and the devs announced an enemy loadout change in some areas. Its still stupid imo.The bugs :1) Enemy movement AP glitches have dudes stroll ridiculous distances. All thats missing when some guy walks two screens and stops next to your sniper is the Benny Hill music. Announced to get fixed2) The last big hub of the game has an impressive array of intricate, multi-solution quests which are held together by spit and baling wire. Look at them wrong and marvel at duplicate characters, time travel dialogue and other sorts of broken flag funnies. Its almost a metagame in itself not to upset the straining scripting in that part too much. Announced to get fixed - 4/5 of the game are solid, id wager if you pick it up now it should be patched by the time you reach that part.   Heartily recommended despite parts of the endgame being a broken mess (wasnt this early access and ♥♥♥♥?)			"

												It's been a while since a game brought me in. Wasteland 2 is a proper continuation of Fallout 1&2 - a true post-apo world, dark humour, turn-based combat, freedom and multiple ways to solve quests. I had a feeling I play Fallout for the first time.But it's a modern game, so it has great graphics (love the picture of NPCs!), modern controls, team management etc. The only dissadvantage is very large locations, sometimes it takes too much time to discover everything or run for a way out.Great game, if you like post-apo, it's a must-have!

												Wasteland 2 provides a great RPG experience at a good price. For players of the first Wasteland game, it's a must-buy, and newcomers (particularly those who enjoyed games like Fallout 1&2) will find a lot to love.The character creation system is very nice, and while I fretted over skill and attribute points at first, I found that the game is so huge and there are so many different paths to take that you will find a rewarding, engaging, and different story with each party that you form (and you will likely want to play it through with a different setup at least once).The choices you make can have long lasting impact on gameplay, and for that reason it's one of the few (maybe the only?) that I played through again immediately after finishing.It's funny, entertaining, and well worth the price; to top it off it's a great example of crowdfunding done right.

												Ah. Where to begin. Story: The basis is that you are a squad of rookie 'Desert Rangers', part of a type of law enforcement agency looking after settlements in post-apocalyptic Nevada. On your first assignment you're sent to find out the cause of death of another Ranger named Ace, which ends up laying the basis for the first half or so of the game. Early on, you're told to go save one of two critical settlements that are in distress. How silly is this? A tiny squad of newbie rangers being sent to secure a settlement on their own. On top of this, if you visit the settlement you didn't choose, you'll find it destroyed-as if the Rangers couldn't send another squad to help protect a MAJOR settlement, but the cherry on top is upon returning to the ranger base, you're greeted by a team of 'elite' rangers that seem to have been sitting with their thumbs up their *** instead of doing their job. Halfway through the game, the plot shifts from ""protect the people"" to ""suddenly robots""Story Summary: 4/10Lackluster and mediocre. Gameplay:The game is very heavily RNG based. Funny then that the developer decided to pick an engine notorious for having issues with its RNG. It's kind of a 'no way, haha' moment when you miss a 90% chance shot the first 5 times, but you could imagine this soon gets tiresome. This is a really nasty thing, as the majority of actions rely on RNG. 60% chance to pick a lock? You're gonna fail and break it too.2% chance for your gun to jam? Better believe it'll jam every second turn. 90% chance to break down a little wooden fence? Broken leg. On top of this, enemies have ridiculous movement speed making any and all tactical positioning irrelevant because they'll close the distance in two turns. Oh, and to rub salt in the wound, all enemies but robots move dreadfully slowly, meaning if there's more than 6 enemies, you'll have to wait a good 2 minutes between turns. You'll be traveling across the map a lot, and there's not fast travel option for locations already discovered. This can get very monotonous very fast. Gameplay summary: 3/10RNG is awful, tactics are useless. Graphics:Not bad. Not the best, but decent, Graphics Summary: 7/10Okay.Audio: Not too many voiced lines, but the ones that are voiced are good quality. Not much music to speak of, mainly ambiance. It can get annoying to hear enemies make the same grunts turn after turn. Audio Summary: 6/10Meh.Overall:Though it can be enjoyable when you get exceptionally lucky, the majority of the time you'll be saving before each attempt at lockpicking, and praying to the RNG gods that they don't smite you when you dare to try to kill something. Overall Summary: 5/10Buyer's remorse.			"

												I really wanted to like is so I forced myself to finish it.Worst part about the game is that you suffer for the decisions you made withen the first 5 minutes of play for the entire game.  You really need a character with a level 10 in every skill to do well in this game yet you are limited on party customization outside the new game screen.  Fallout Tatics and X-Com have a much better system for this where you simply recruit new characters.  Never really cared about any of the playable characters even though I was stuck with them the entire game. Second worst thing is that this is a split map, once you complete map 1 you cannot go back and pick up the pieces that you missed.  This sucks if you are a completionist.  Not only that you loose one of your best party members that you leaned on for roughly half the game.  I almost quit when this happened.If that isn't annoying enough there are some quests are just plain bugged and are not possible to complete.There is some interesting quests and choices that can be done in this game.  But progress in the storyline is very slow, and grinding at some points. Wasteland 2 is a long game, not because of the story but because of the pacing.Fallout 2 has great story pacing, never a dull moment; Fallout Tatics / X-Com has great squad based combat with ambushes staged around every corner; Wasteland 2 just failed to achieve greatness at either. It is just OK.			"

												While a failure of overambition, and as a result clearly rushed, it is still one of the better isometric RPG's of the past decade.Its biggest failing, and it is one that is common in narrative RPG's which centers on an entire player created party instead of a single character, is that the story simply fails to draw you in.You are just not given a reason to care about your characters as anything other than stat sheets, and as a result the entire world becomes less engaging.The combat is, unfortunately, rather shallow and there is therefore entirely too much of it.Far too many areas are riddled with things to kill, and even the overland map has an abundance of random enemy encounters. There is a good variety of enemies, but when your tactical options are limited to shoot, move or overwatch, that does not matter as much as it should.Various classes do get a few special attacks at later levels, but it is not enough to add any actual depth to the combat. You never find yourself wondering what the best tactical option is beyond what enemy to focus on, or if you should use explosives (aoe).On the positive side, there is a great deal of reactivity in the various quests you uncover and the world is populated by plenty of well written characters. Overall the writing is pretty good, the world is interesting and the art work is excellent.While perhaps not the ""real fallout 3"" its kickstarter backers where hoping for, it is still a great game and definetly worth a playthrough.

												This game is simply awesome! Fallout 1&2 are my best games ever and it seems it will be the same with Wasteland 2. It has fascinating story line, wonderfull turn based combat with tactical depth and great character system. It's a true cRPG unlike dozens of FPS with RPG elements out there. It's what true Fallout 3 should be. Story and gameplay are logical, it has intuitive interface (but needs some tweaking - it's beta, right?), nice graphics and wonderfull music made by Mark Morgan - remember City of Dead or Radiation Storm from Fallout? Yes, it's the same guy. Can't wait for the final version. EDIT:After playing the final product it seems this game is much worse than Fallout. There are too many bugs and illogical decisions that make this game very frustrating to play. Some of them weren't present in early access and some others I hoped to be fixed. <Sadly, they weren't.> edit: They're already fixed!EDIT2:After playing director's cut version I have to correct my previous edit. This game is AWESOME! Annoying things like too short sniper rifle range and too big walking distance of enemies were fixed. Furthermore, I discovered this game is non linear. And I mean really non linear. There's so many different things that can happen. It really has the Fallout spirit and I know what I'm talking about. I'm close to finish Fallout 2 for 20 time maybe, so it's not nostalgia that influences my opinion. Wasteland 2 is simply wonderful.			"

								Gameplay is getting quite fantastic, especially for any Fallout-nostalgic. Was literally glued to the screen for the approximate 25 hours of gameplay that the mid-april version brought. That includes a completionist gameplay, but I probably missed about 5 hours of quest branches that would have to be done on a 2nd playthrough.The graphics are really demanding and game gets choppy on anything but low settings for me. There's also a couple of severe slowdowns caused by alarm effects. Game is quite buggy, getting stuck under ladders, occasional freezes, lost inventories. So you have to save a lot, but you have to save a lot anyway.			"

It is completely functional, with a few minor glitches, but nothing that broke the game or reduced my enjoyment of the game, and I'm sure these will be gone by release. The inventory system was quite basic and the combat was a bit formulaic, but the recent massive update addressed much of this, so my current dilemma is whether to keep playing it as is... and believe me that is really tempting... or to wait and play the game in its finished state to get the full immersion and experience... decisions decisions			"

								For those who loved games like Fallout, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics, You will love this game. So far it is fun, but I do have my gripes about it, one is the interface moving our team around is a little clunky, next would be the character models, these would be fine if it was the early 2002-2004, but with other games to compair it to, these could had been done a lot better they are very well super low poly to the point they look funky. Same with the textures, if we where all playing pc games on say on the first xbox's hardware it would be acceptable but its 2014. I really hope that the art end of this game is not done yet in terms of improvement. But I am guessing its about as good as its going to get visually. The other very limited weight/carry capacity, you do your first set of missions up to the first radio tower,  all of your inventory spots are about full, by the time you make it to the second tower your way overloaded, and a town/vendor to sell to  is far far away... and requires you to go though a radiation field, or go way out of your way around it, if you happen to get into a fight guess what you will pick up more stuff that you really have no room to carry. Hopefully the devs can find a solution to this. Overall great game, but it has many areas of improvement needed, from clunky controls, low polly assets that are almost waving like they are made of water when moving. To the tiny annoyances of inventory and not having a way to offload your loot at more locations besides out front of the ranger station at start of the game.			"

								This game is fantastic. Even in an early-state, it does justice to Fargo's name. It feels like everything Fallout 3 should have been, and more. If you're a fan of the original Wasteland, Fallout 1 and/or 2, and even Xcom, this game is for you.			"

								So far it seems to play a bit better (less buggy) than Krater, but it's single player only.graphics are ... old-ish. looks like a zoomed in torchlight.I know it's pretty deep beta still, i'm having a hard time justifying the $60 price tag so far.Combat is a pain (but so was fallout, and krater) - as in difficult and constantly using medpacks.I really hope the community doesn't destroy this like they've destroyed the other kickstarter/early access games.updates forthcoming as patches are released. Probably august for next update from me.			"

												For a game that is supposed to be focused on tactics, W2's offering are pretty weak when compared to something like X-Com 1 or 2.  It doesn't feel like you are taking advantage of environmental factors, cover, or terrain features very much at all.  Combat degrades into a back and forth ""you attack, they attack"" while everyone is just standing around.  The RNG elements are also heavily implemented and just total sh*t, in my opinion.  Case in point:  On one of the earlier missions you have to fight these giant mutated rabbits, which apparently are so amazing at dodging, your entire squad will take multiple shots at them and totally whiffing.  I had no chances to grind beforehand and didn't see many options to level up my squad's skills so I was forced to reload over and over, hoping for RNGesus to come save me.  It's not as if they even made an dodge animation, just a ""miss"".  At least show the damn things dodging for Christ's sake.  I find the other reviews to be overl positive for this game and found myself wanting to turn it off and delete it ASAP.			"

												Brian Fargo really re-creates the late 90's magic here with the sequal to the original Wasteland. Most will know Brian ran Interplay studios which created and produced the Fallout 1, 2 and Tactics games. Such a shame it was sold...This feels so much like Fallout 1 and 2. The big differences being you are managing a party of up to 6 or 7 characters not just the one. Combat is far more frequent (a little repetitive) but the game has that same post apocolyptic feel with great writing, dark humour, sarcasm and just general wittyness that I remember from Fallout 1 and 2. I feel a little sad that I missed the original Wasteland, I should really get that going somehow and play it too.I have about 19hrs or so in Wasteland 2 and am only up to Dimonta (a place you must visit as a part of several different quests including the main). Now I know a little about what's to come as I've read teasers here and there (without spoiling the story for myself) and because of this I know that this game is huge. Just monstrous really. I think what makes it so big is the fact that there are loads of side quests that really draw the game out and the fact that there is a lot of back tracking sometimes in order to beef up, resupply and then carry on. But regardless of this I find it a treat finding all sorts of new weapons and modifying them to get that awesome assualt rifle bypassing armour by 10-15% with a few mods. I also love all the 80's and 90's pop culture references in there such as Cabbage Patch dolls, MAD magazines, D20 dice, trolls and many more. Those little items you stumble accross gives you a strong sense of nostalgia especially so if you grew up in those periods. I think there a real treat. I won't even go into the ""toy snake"" you find ha ha.The Director's Cut is definitely where it's at. Heaps more recorded dialog and just general performance increases and polish. I wouldn't bother playing the original Wasteland 2 and I don't think you can anymore? The game is also fairly stable with one wierd CTD (nothing in my event logs either) out of that 20 hours. It runs well and for the most part looks ok. I feel like some areas are a little bland and could have used a going over but aside from that the world looks good.Some areas feel a little empty. I know it's post apocolyptic but some more NPC's to engage with would be nice. The writing really shines when you do talk to those few NPC's that can talk. Overall the main quest story hasn't kicked in a whole lot just yet so I can't comment on it.Anyways it's not a perfect game and this is proven in the repetitive combat. There is some advantage to finding cover and ensuring your perks and skills line up to how you want your characters to operate but it's always the same. Battle starts and you find cover and then off you go until the enemy is dead. The AI enemies are good at taking cover and trying to flank but once you've seen it a few times I think you can say you've seen it all. I've heard that there are boss fights but I am yet to reach one so I can't comment on that either.Despite these flaws, the game isn't too bad. Give it a try if you love Brian Fargo, Interplay and the original Wasteland and Fallout series. I think you'd like it. I give it a 8 out of 10 overall.TLDR: Good writing, a little empty with repetitive combat but reeks of pop cultural references from the 80's and 90's that will have you thinking back to those times. Overall not a bad game but not perfect either.			"

												I played for a few hours and wasn't having any fun so I checked the reviews to see what was up. Tons of positive reviews for this game exist, but none of them say anything positive. To me, having to play 20 hours in a game before you start having fun IS ABSOLUTELY MASIOCHISTIC!Additionally, getting party after party destroyed because you are trying to use the tools at hand to make vivid, well-thought, story-driven characters, is also masiochistic. The camera is very hard to control, and you end up not seeing things a lot because of it. The graphics are mediocre. Don't waste your time or money here, just play any Fallout 1, 2, or Tactics. Shadowrun Returns is also what this game should have been like.P.S. This game is worth about $5. If you can get it that cheap then you have succeeded. Otherwise if you are a masiochist, then this game might be for you.			"

												The game play is fun, characters are well written and the quests are a nice change from the standard fetch, kill or escort.  I had fun playing until I got to Hollywood and the game turned out to be a load of bugs held together with spider's web.While the game engine itself is fine if a bit click-heavy, there are some serious, game-breaking bugs in the quests; you have to use a walkthrough if you hope to complete the game.  The problem stems from quest triggers not firing unless some very specific events take place in the right order: visiting one location before another, talking to NPCs in the wrong order, finding an item before being given the quest to fetch it, these will all break the quest line.  Most quests seem to work or you can reload a save from within the last half hour to remedy the hang up, so all goes well for a time.Unfortunately when you get to Hollywood it all goes down the poo chute.  This is part of the main quest line, you can't just give up and move on when it all goes wrong, which it will.  You either have to keep a huge archive or saves or use a walkthrough if you hope to get through the minefield of broken quest triggers.  I did neither, now I have to start over after 70 hours.  There is also no indication that you're doing it wrong, you have to go exploring to find the quests points and it's so easy to explore just a bit farther than you were meant to.Some parts of the game seem to serve no purpose - water for example.  In Arizona you use up water when you travel.  Ok, nice gimmick to make us choose where to go, how far to roam etc.  But oases are far too common, you will never be in any danger of running low on water.  It's not used at all in LA but you still have it weighing your party down.  There's also no way to drop unwanted/broken quest items, you can only store them in a box at the base.The main thing I didn't like is the constant save-reload of every action multiple times: the chance to pass a skill test shows little correlation with the pass/fail rate - I can fail regularly fail 60% and above chance to succeed, miltiple times in a row, but also regularly succeed in a 10% chance first time.  I get really fed up of repeating this stuff over and over.  It reminds me of the 30 minutes I spent playing Fallout 1 and being unable to kill the very first enemy.			"

												This is a good game in a lot of ways. It captures the turn based and RPG elements well. Its flaws are many and deep ,though. The characters and dialog tree are fine, but having 3 different skills to effect dialog is excessive and takes away from the game. Hard ♥♥♥ seems most valuable. The graphics are not anywhere near modern. If you want to see a good turn based game well implemented, check out any of the new XCom titles. They are turn and squad based but look good too. I guess at the end of the day, I think the developers got lazy and cut corners. Portrait Icons, for example, are recycled throughout the game. So the portrait of the guy you were helping in one town is now the portrait of a guy you are fighting, or even a whole gang. Worse, the portraits often have nothing to do at all with the character. Even seemingly main characters have generic or even mismatched portraits. In a game with a limited graphic demand and limited eye candy appeal, those portraits are important to telling the story. InExile just mailed it in on that and many other things after cashing a huge Kickstarter check, and that really lessens the game. Voice acting is limited and really bad compared to any other title I have played in a while. The voices of Matthias and General Vargas, in particular, are horrible. For its current list price of $40, it is not at all what I expected. Expect to be disappointed in a lot of ways, and frustrated a lot of the time in an otherwise fun game.			"

												XCOM was a big favourite for me, so I was looking for similar turn-based tactical games. Wasteland 2 was a disappointment for me, mainly because the combat is very boring to several reasons: - map is not properly designed for the combat, not enough cover (or something which looks like a cover turns out not to be a cover once the game turns into turn-based) in many cases simple open area - enemies have terrible AI, they just keep running towards you, until they are in firing range, then they start shooting someone randomly - melee is useless, most efficient is assault/sniper - no way to properly prepare for a battle, you cannot position your soldiers, because you don't know what is cover, and how the grid layout looks like (that only becomes visible when the game switches to turn-based)So after a while I realized that the most efficient is to use only weapons with long range (sniper/assault/heavy), and being defensive, just wait until they come close enough, and shoot them. Many of the combats was just going into position with the group, crouch everyone, shoot something with the sniper to initiate the battle, then keep shooting the closest enemy with everyone, without moving at all. No tactics, boring like hell. I was really trying to be more offensive, but it doesn't work.Story is OK, but the character progress is boring, you pick a few skills for each character at the beginning, and then just put skill points on those as the character levels up. Lots of the skills are just to open boxes for loot. Graphic could also be better.I played most of the time in offline more, so I played way more than just 0.3 hours.			"

								If you're a fan of old school Fallout games or the original Wasteland, even XCOM and want to play a game to where the developers care more about the game being GOOD (sorry GREAT) compared to appeasing to huge numbers, then this game is for you.The dark humour, the morbidness, the random LOLs and things you just have to be old enough to understand or something you've experienced.  It's almost like this game is littered with easter eggs.  I love it when you snuff the life out of something.  The combat logs are nice too as well.This game is very well thought out, runs smooth, looks great and is great fun.  This game isn't even fully released yet and it's top notch.This game for sure will take up 40+ hours of your time.  Exploring, leveling, questing and messing around.  Do a game being a nice guy, do a game being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, or being a pyscho and just murder everybody and every goat. ....poor goats....One nice feature they also put in is all the different ways you have to access something, IE:  oh a locked door.  I can lock pick it...or..spartan kick that ♥♥♥♥♥ in....or....use lots and lots of explosives....MacGruber would of wanted it that way.If they see screaming goats on the internet, it goes in the game.  It just goes to show the amount of passion and joy they put into this game.I highly recommend if you love this style of gameplay!			"

												After finishing Wasteland 2, I decided to write a review.   If you LOVED Fallout 2, you'll SORTA LIKE Wasteland 2!  If you've never PLAYED fallout 2 and are interested in Wasteland 2, instead; go buy or at least look at Fallout 2, right here on Steam. This game kept me entertained for a solid 60 hours.... and then Hollywood... The buggiest land to exist in all video games, ever.  For the most part, the game is a load of fun (just not Hollywood). Great detail, good pathing on almost all maps and the AI is fairly balanced, if not a little clunky at times....   Wasteland 2's dialogue is sometimes some of the funniest stuff I've read in a long time. The random things NPC's say, etc. The storyline is serious and there's no slapstick comedy or anything like that, no poop jok---- well... okay, there are poop jokes but 95% of the game is serious and VERY well written.  The camera, however, is downright awful and the towns interior maps are hard to keep track of without map markers.  It feels rushed. Like this was supposed to be something much longer and bigger.  They call it the spiritual successor to Fallout 2, yet my one playthrough of FO2 on steam yielded around 140 hours ish. This, only 75.  My number one complaint is the ending credits (what happened to the world after you saved it slideshow)  Even if you complete almost every task in the game, you won't get credit in most cases. The game will go against what you actually did; for example: I made a certain mercenary group become extinct, took over their prison and helped a town they were terrorizing. At end credits, the game had said that the gang I killed were stronger than ever and had never given up that town. -- 4/10 --The hours I've put into it make it worth the cost. If you don't have Fallout 2; go buy fallout 2 instead.			"

Most quests seem to work or you can reload a save from within the last half hour to remedy the hang up, so all goes well for a time.Unfortunately when you get to Hollywood it all goes down the poo chute.  This is part of the main quest line, you can't just give up and move on when it all goes wrong, which it will.  You either have to keep a huge archive or saves or use a walkthrough if you hope to get through the minefield of broken quest triggers.  I did neither, now I have to start over after 70 hours.  There is also no indication that you're doing it wrong, you have to go exploring to find the quests points and it's so easy to explore just a bit farther than you were meant to.Some parts of the game seem to serve no purpose - water for example.  In Arizona you use up water when you travel.  Ok, nice gimmick to make us choose where to go, how far to roam etc.  But oases are far too common, you will never be in any danger of running low on water.  It's not used at all in LA but you still have it weighing your party down.  There's also no way to drop unwanted/broken quest items, you can only store them in a box at the base.The main thing I didn't like is the constant save-reload of every action multiple times: the chance to pass a skill test shows little correlation with the pass/fail rate - I can fail regularly fail 60% and above chance to succeed, miltiple times in a row, but also regularly succeed in a 10% chance first time.  I get really fed up of repeating this stuff over and over.  It reminds me of the 30 minutes I spent playing Fallout 1 and being unable to kill the very first enemy.			"

												I played for a few hours and wasn't having any fun so I checked the reviews to see what was up. Tons of positive reviews for this game exist, but none of them say anything positive. To me, having to play 20 hours in a game before you start having fun IS ABSOLUTELY MASIOCHISTIC!Additionally, getting party after party destroyed because you are trying to use the tools at hand to make vivid, well-thought, story-driven characters, is also masiochistic. The camera is very hard to control, and you end up not seeing things a lot because of it. The graphics are mediocre. Don't waste your time or money here, just play any Fallout 1, 2, or Tactics. Shadowrun Returns is also what this game should have been like.P.S. This game is worth about $5. If you can get it that cheap then you have succeeded. Otherwise if you are a masiochist, then this game might be for you.			"

												This is a good game in a lot of ways. It captures the turn based and RPG elements well. Its flaws are many and deep ,though. The characters and dialog tree are fine, but having 3 different skills to effect dialog is excessive and takes away from the game. Hard ♥♥♥ seems most valuable. The graphics are not anywhere near modern. If you want to see a good turn based game well implemented, check out any of the new XCom titles. They are turn and squad based but look good too. I guess at the end of the day, I think the developers got lazy and cut corners. Portrait Icons, for example, are recycled throughout the game. So the portrait of the guy you were helping in one town is now the portrait of a guy you are fighting, or even a whole gang. Worse, the portraits often have nothing to do at all with the character. Even seemingly main characters have generic or even mismatched portraits. In a game with a limited graphic demand and limited eye candy appeal, those portraits are important to telling the story. InExile just mailed it in on that and many other things after cashing a huge Kickstarter check, and that really lessens the game. Voice acting is limited and really bad compared to any other title I have played in a while. The voices of Matthias and General Vargas, in particular, are horrible. For its current list price of $40, it is not at all what I expected. Expect to be disappointed in a lot of ways, and frustrated a lot of the time in an otherwise fun game.			"

												XCOM was a big favourite for me, so I was looking for similar turn-based tactical games. Wasteland 2 was a disappointment for me, mainly because the combat is very boring to several reasons: - map is not properly designed for the combat, not enough cover (or something which looks like a cover turns out not to be a cover once the game turns into turn-based) in many cases simple open area - enemies have terrible AI, they just keep running towards you, until they are in firing range, then they start shooting someone randomly - melee is useless, most efficient is assault/sniper - no way to properly prepare for a battle, you cannot position your soldiers, because you don't know what is cover, and how the grid layout looks like (that only becomes visible when the game switches to turn-based)So after a while I realized that the most efficient is to use only weapons with long range (sniper/assault/heavy), and being defensive, just wait until they come close enough, and shoot them. Many of the combats was just going into position with the group, crouch everyone, shoot something with the sniper to initiate the battle, then keep shooting the closest enemy with everyone, without moving at all. No tactics, boring like hell. I was really trying to be more offensive, but it doesn't work.Story is OK, but the character progress is boring, you pick a few skills for each character at the beginning, and then just put skill points on those as the character levels up. Lots of the skills are just to open boxes for loot. Graphic could also be better.I played most of the time in offline more, so I played way more than just 0.3 hours.			"

												After 50+ hours into the game, it started feeling like doing homework. 69 hours in, I had a blinding flash of the obvious: I was not required to continue playing. How liberating!It had its points. The combat mechanics were kind of fun. The post-nuclear America setting is always a good time. Some of the subplots were clever. The weapon-smithing was very satisfying.But the downsides were inescapable:* Some of your NPCs are fun, but your main characters are pretty much ciphers. Not very engaging.* The skill system is an annoyance. It is less about making interesting tradeoffs than making sure that you have someone maxed out in each of the 4 different ""opening things"" skills. It is less about looking forward the neat things that you get to do when you go up a level, than that you get to keep pace with the boxes that are inexplicably getting harder to open.* OMG, running back and forth across the map all the time. When I have to have a book sitting next to my computer to occupy myself during your game, there is a problem.* The characters and key items don't stand out well. You're constantly hitting the ""highlight all"" button, spinning around and trying to see if there is some bit of scenery that you're supposed to be interacting with.* It has an encumbrance mechanic. And if that wasn't enough: for many items it won't be clear when you'll find someone who needs it. So you have the choice of carrying it around all the time, or stowing it, finding the person who needs it, running across the g-- d--- map. Again.If you want an isometric tactical game, play the new xcom. If you want that + engaging plot, grab Shadowrun Dragonfall.			"

												This is definitely an old style game, meant mostly for people who loved the first Wasteland, the first two Fallout games, and  generally people that played computer videogames in the 90s. It does seem to try and trade off aesthetic quality for some kind of nostalgia feeling that in a way condones how the game looks and moves on the screen, and how some aspects not only seem rough and unpolished but even not finished.Those that think they're gonna buy an RPG with this game might be let down to find out that this game feels and plays more like a Desperados game than an actual RPG, except the tactical aspect is shallow waters, and moves like crouch and headshot are practically never used: you end up doing a little more than spamming attack on the enemies. There are stats(which, oddly enough, do not affect your skills, so how much charisma you have counts nothing on how good a barter you are or how well you can persuade, and so on), dialogues and choices but the game ends up boiling down to a turn-based shooter, where non combat skills and attributes don't count as much as how many points you have put in your shooting skills.Too many times i felt that a certain situation should have hadthe possibility of being dealt with with wits and a good dialogue, since dialogue based skills are there for the characters, and not just circumstantial fights. You can SOME times select a Hard ♥♥♥/Kiss ♥♥♥/Smart ♥♥♥ answer that will gain you some advantage, but it simply isn't worth spending skill points on three separate things you will be using so rarely along the game. It often feels like those alternative options were not YET implemented, because of time and resources, and not just not meant to be there at all, but that is just a feeling. Which makes some situations kinda awkward to play.. It also needs to be stated that the game needs 21GB of free space on the hard disk, and patches come at sizes of more than 1 GB, which is kinda hard to explain for a game of this nature, since there aren't many cinematics at all and a lot of the dialogues are text-only.In the end, though, the game is ok and even fun to play, especially for those that are feeling nostalgic. It just seems to rely on the nostalgia a bit too relentlessly.			"

It had the great post-apocalyptic atmosphere, good story, funny characters, reasonable arsenal and decent HUD...BUT towards end of Arizona and early in California it started bugging out and freezing. The further I went the more I needed to restart it ( now ~10-20 sec. after which it freezes - 5th location in Cali ). It's completely UNPLAYABLE at this point. I'm running a MacOs version. Don't buy unless major patching happens. Otherwise you'll be very dissapointed after spending many hours and being close to the end but unable to progress. "

												Suffers from a lot of the same problems as other ""1990s throwback"" isometric RPGs, which is to say confusing maps and awkward progression. Expect to get lost a lot (hint: backspace resets north to up), spend a lot of time tramping over the same ground (agian, and again, and again), and getting frustrated when you do things ""out of order"" and turn an entire zone against you (yeah, Canyon of Titan, I'm looking at you).An otherwise interesting premise (it's essentially Fallout 2.5) that would benifit from a lot more polish and the inclusion of some of the ""quality of life"" stuff from more modern games (map markers would be a nice start).

												I'm a huge fallout fan, so this game was highly anticipated for me. I tried playing the classic fallout games a few times, but unfortunately their age made the games far too slow and painful to progress through despite their amazing visual style and overall presentation. I picked up Wasteland 2 to fill that experience I always wanted, but unfortunately it just couldn't do it. Overall, the game is very unpolished, and just doesn't have the fit and finish I would expect from a game that's been in development for nearly three years. Incoming gripe-fest: I can't say too much on the story or progression yet, as I'm not too far into it, but I feel like the game keeps you in areas far longer than you should be in. The Ag center quest took me nearly SIX hours in total, and I don't feel like much was accomplished in that time. The quest system is fairly ambiguous as there are no map markers or anything to even send you in the general direction of a task. I've had bugs make me reload a save from nearly hours earlier just for it to happen again(pathfinding is wonky). The lack of lore is another thing that pains me. The game doesn't go too far into what's going on in the world other than forcing DESERT RANGERS! down your throat for the first hour. Scavenging is weird: there are SO MANY obvious loot crates just sitting around for no apparent reason other than to give you ammo- there is so much ammo that it is never a problem in the slightest. And on the off chance you actually find a hidden safe, for the most part it is RNG, so it is likely you will just find .38 ammo over and over again.The game does have its merits though despite being quite janky. There is a LOT to do, and for content-per-dollar, I'd say you get a lot out of it. So if you're looking for a game where there is tons to do and you can play it for hours on end, this is a good choice. However, if you're like me and enjoy games with a higher quality standard, you should steer clear-at least until the game is well patched. The game is definitely a fallout fan's paradise in concept, but it just can't live up to it for so many reasons. I could rant all day, but in the end the only thing that matters is: How big of a Fallout fan are you?			"

												I was looking forward to this game and I waited until it was released.  I feel sorry for the people that paid 59.95 for something that was then released for 39.95.  I am wondering what on Earth they used all that money for?  It is not the graphics as they are mundane at best even at the highest settings.  The graphic design is amateurish.  Although there are many games that are graphically impressive and the play value is less than satisfying.  Unfortunately this game fails at that as well.  One aspect of the game is it’s supposed to adhere to some kind of reality.  Such as a rifleman being unable to shoot well, if a target is pressing them with a melee weapon or the weapons being old and prone to jams in the middle of combat.  Now one aspect of reality is a human being can see in a 180 degree arc barring any physical problems.  Yet in this game the player has to constantly twist and turn, pan, zoom in an out and mouse over everything in sight so as not to miss anything that is obviously needed to complete the mission goal.  Another sore point for me is the random encounters that occur when traveling on the world map.  Every encounter is on the same one of three possible areas.  Every encounter drops the player at one seemingly random entry point.  The player might reach the enemy in two turns, but the enemy can cross the entire screen and still be able to attack multiple times.   Assuming the player survives, they loot and then get to pan all over the screen looking for the exit point.  There is nothing else in a random encounter aside from the NPCs to be killed.  No random loot, no hidden chests, nothing at all.  So why the busy work to locate and then run to an exit?   And the exit is a Globe of some kind on pedestal.   Forget the boring senseless random encounters, look at the exit point.  Is that Immersion into a game world or what?A word to anyone buying this game if you have small children in the house when you play.  Play with the sound off or use headphones.  I am not prude by any sense of your imagination but this game spews profanity like a drunken sailor on leave at a bordello on the docks.As to difficulty, I can’t put my finger on the problem but boredom comes to mind as well as the old line seen in old adventure games ""you can't do that now""  It doesn't actually say that, but that is the feeling the player gets when you examine a trap and it says 98% chance of success and 5% chance of critical fail and your explosives expert fails 3 times in a row and then it blows up in his face.   Now the % to fail or succeed is the game comparing the traps level to the team member’s skill level.Now, like all games all new teams start out at level 1 and as you gain experience you gain levels.  All standard fair, right?  So how come the first NPC team member you can add to your group is a level 15?			"

								If you're a fan of old school Fallout games or the original Wasteland, even XCOM and want to play a game to where the developers care more about the game being GOOD (sorry GREAT) compared to appeasing to huge numbers, then this game is for you.The dark humour, the morbidness, the random LOLs and things you just have to be old enough to understand or something you've experienced.  It's almost like this game is littered with easter eggs.  I love it when you snuff the life out of something.  The combat logs are nice too as well.This game is very well thought out, runs smooth, looks great and is great fun.  This game isn't even fully released yet and it's top notch.This game for sure will take up 40+ hours of your time.  Exploring, leveling, questing and messing around.  Do a game being a nice guy, do a game being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, or being a pyscho and just murder everybody and every goat. ....poor goats....One nice feature they also put in is all the different ways you have to access something, IE:  oh a locked door.  I can lock pick it...or..spartan kick that ♥♥♥♥♥ in....or....use lots and lots of explosives....MacGruber would of wanted it that way.If they see screaming goats on the internet, it goes in the game.  It just goes to show the amount of passion and joy they put into this game.I highly recommend if you love this style of gameplay!			"

												Video games critic “Yahtzee” once remarked that he didn’t understand single-player RPGs. What is the appeal? With their emphasis on story over gameplay, why not just read a (good) book? Why interrupt the (maybe good) story with some of gaming’s weakest gameplay? Since then he’s likely discovered that there ARE good RPGs, and that good RPGs don’t emphasize story over gameplay; rather they emphasis both. In fact, the only key difference between an “RPG” and, say, a shooter like Half-Life is that in an “RPG” the development of your avatars’ virtual skill is emphasized (via leveling up, getting more powerful items, etc.) over your muscle memory skills.And here we have Wasteland 2, and like most old- AND new-school RPGs, it manages to emphasize neither gameplay nor story.You may at first find this hard to notice if isometric (“old-school”) RPGs are new to you. Even I was smitten. So turned on was I that, a dozen hours into the game, I donated $30 to InExile’s Torment project (OOPS!), to be followed an hour later by Wasteland 2’s depressing emptiness finally crashing down on me (♥♥♥♥!!!). Its gameplay proved to be just drudgery. To get a picture of it, imagine XCOM, but not anywhere as good, and with the saving angel of “reloading the last save” always being available? Now consider that to play without the reload function would render the game impossible to win within a lifetime, OR SO easy (because you can change the difficulty at any time) that there’s hardly any drama at all. Now add to this an inventory system that demands so much of your “play” time (a time-destroying chore similar in fun to data entry, except you don’t get paid). Then throw in the various versions of locked doors and chests and whatnot that all have their own skill trees. I want to underscore the fact that this last feature is neither fun nor intellectually stimulating, and that you need to do it to win the game. If, InExile, you are going to make your players spend a lot of time deciding where to invest their skill points, then at least make the payoff’s worth it. Make it so there are AWESOME rewards for opening stuff—a cool joke, a sexy weapon or armor set that you won’t find from enemies or shops—not just , soon-to-be-forgotten items. [There are also bugs, which, to their credit, they’re continuing to address.]Now for some almost good news. The writing is almost good. Because of the setting—a nuked one—they, like Bethesda, have gone the mostly-serious tone route. There are moments of cruelty in the game that invoke the horrors of real, demonic human beings, atrocities that happen in, say, Syria and the Congo. And sometimes it’s effective. For example, there’s a scene where a character died a horrible death, and as he or she lay dying, he or she told my party to deliver something to another character in some town. Well, I went to this town and got distracted. And many hours later, across the Arizona map away from the town, I thought, “Oh ♥♥♥♥! I forgot to deliver that object!” And I trudged across the game world back towards that town, knowing that it would put me in boring battles with weaker enemies. That is a moment of video game art that taught me something about myself.Moments like these are rare in the game, and the writing is mostly grim for no other reason than to remind players that nuclear holocausts are bad. As for strong characters; I think the leader of the Desert Rangers is named General Vargas. There’s also the Matthias guy. Aaaaand those are all the names I remember from my 50+ hours of playing.As for the plot, it’s an uninspired, boring cliché. To give you an idea of how zero it is, consider this. During the first half of the game, in the Ranger HQ, there’s this nuclear weapon in a museum. And when you press the wrong button, the place explodes and you get a Game Over screen that says, due to there being no Desert Rangers, Matthias and his Robot Army conquer the human race. In other words, InExile do not care about their own story enough to make a truly mysterious (or at least funny) enemy; this of course explains why the plot twists are so pathetically predictable that they basically don’t exist.The NPCs talk a lot of “who is this Matthias person” emptiness, to which I respond, “OH C’MON, HE’S OBVIOUSLY A BORING ROBOT HITLER!”[Robot Hitler, by the way, would be a more compelling, entertaining villain than Matthias.]So if the intellectual bits are rare, and the characters are boring, and the plot is boring, then is it funny?Nope. There’s at least one homage to a famous comedy. But basically that’s it. Visually they could have done many funny things—this is a 3D computer game, after all—but basically we got nothing. What missed opportunities…..To underscore how much these devs missed the mark, consider this: early in the game there’s a place you can opt to rescue from a giant flora infestation. What the developers could have done with this was pit your Rangers against, say, killer salads, aided by giant, banana-toting bananas. But what did InExile do? ZOMBIES! They made it so the plants infected the local fauna, turning them into zombies. Jesus Cliché Christ.As for the graphics in general, it’s black, brown, green and grey. There’s some red for blood. I do like the bullets flying and the body parts falling, especially when said body parts fall because someone hit the person with a blunt object. I also like some of the lasers. And the large robots look cool. Mostly I like the fact that you can dress your group like the Three Amigos. That was fun for twelve seconds.The game also features sound.SCORE: 3/10Back of the Box Statement: “Is there too much happiness in your life?”			"

								This is the game that will push all others into the dark corners of the damned.  If you enjoyed Wasteland and the Fallout series or you have a love for all things Post Apocalypse, this is the game for you!  You will not be disappointed.  You take a group of Desert Rangers out into the Post Nuclear afflicted Soutwest and investigate a possible threat.  It all starts with the Death of ACE.  Those of you who played Wasteland will know who ACE was.  Angela Deth is also part of this game.			"

												I really wanted to like is so I forced myself to finish it.Worst part about the game is that you suffer for the decisions you made withen the first 5 minutes of play for the entire game.  You really need a character with a level 10 in every skill to do well in this game yet you are limited on party customization outside the new game screen.  Fallout Tatics and X-Com have a much better system for this where you simply recruit new characters.  Never really cared about any of the playable characters even though I was stuck with them the entire game. Second worst thing is that this is a split map, once you complete map 1 you cannot go back and pick up the pieces that you missed.  This sucks if you are a completionist.  Not only that you loose one of your best party members that you leaned on for roughly half the game.  I almost quit when this happened.If that isn't annoying enough there are some quests are just plain bugged and are not possible to complete.There is some interesting quests and choices that can be done in this game.  But progress in the storyline is very slow, and grinding at some points. Wasteland 2 is a long game, not because of the story but because of the pacing.Fallout 2 has great story pacing, never a dull moment; Fallout Tatics / X-Com has great squad based combat with ambushes staged around every corner; Wasteland 2 just failed to achieve greatness at either. It is just OK.			"

												Video games critic “Yahtzee” once remarked that he didn’t understand single-player RPGs. What is the appeal? With their emphasis on story over gameplay, why not just read a (good) book? Why interrupt the (maybe good) story with some of gaming’s weakest gameplay? Since then he’s likely discovered that there ARE good RPGs, and that good RPGs don’t emphasize story over gameplay; rather they emphasis both. In fact, the only key difference between an “RPG” and, say, a shooter like Half-Life is that in an “RPG” the development of your avatars’ virtual skill is emphasized (via leveling up, getting more powerful items, etc.) over your muscle memory skills.And here we have Wasteland 2, and like most old- AND new-school RPGs, it manages to emphasize neither gameplay nor story.You may at first find this hard to notice if isometric (“old-school”) RPGs are new to you. Even I was smitten. So turned on was I that, a dozen hours into the game, I donated $30 to InExile’s Torment project (OOPS!), to be followed an hour later by Wasteland 2’s depressing emptiness finally crashing down on me (♥♥♥♥!!!). Its gameplay proved to be just drudgery. To get a picture of it, imagine XCOM, but not anywhere as good, and with the saving angel of “reloading the last save” always being available? Now consider that to play without the reload function would render the game impossible to win within a lifetime, OR SO easy (because you can change the difficulty at any time) that there’s hardly any drama at all. Now add to this an inventory system that demands so much of your “play” time (a time-destroying chore similar in fun to data entry, except you don’t get paid). Then throw in the various versions of locked doors and chests and whatnot that all have their own skill trees. I want to underscore the fact that this last feature is neither fun nor intellectually stimulating, and that you need to do it to win the game. If, InExile, you are going to make your players spend a lot of time deciding where to invest their skill points, then at least make the payoff’s worth it. Make it so there are AWESOME rewards for opening stuff—a cool joke, a sexy weapon or armor set that you won’t find from enemies or shops—not just , soon-to-be-forgotten items. [There are also bugs, which, to their credit, they’re continuing to address.]Now for some almost good news. The writing is almost good. Because of the setting—a nuked one—they, like Bethesda, have gone the mostly-serious tone route. There are moments of cruelty in the game that invoke the horrors of real, demonic human beings, atrocities that happen in, say, Syria and the Congo. And sometimes it’s effective. For example, there’s a scene where a character died a horrible death, and as he or she lay dying, he or she told my party to deliver something to another character in some town. Well, I went to this town and got distracted. And many hours later, across the Arizona map away from the town, I thought, “Oh ♥♥♥♥! I forgot to deliver that object!” And I trudged across the game world back towards that town, knowing that it would put me in boring battles with weaker enemies. That is a moment of video game art that taught me something about myself.Moments like these are rare in the game, and the writing is mostly grim for no other reason than to remind players that nuclear holocausts are bad. As for strong characters; I think the leader of the Desert Rangers is named General Vargas. There’s also the Matthias guy. Aaaaand those are all the names I remember from my 50+ hours of playing.As for the plot, it’s an uninspired, boring cliché. To give you an idea of how zero it is, consider this. During the first half of the game, in the Ranger HQ, there’s this nuclear weapon in a museum. And when you press the wrong button, the place explodes and you get a Game Over screen that says, due to there being no Desert Rangers, Matthias and his Robot Army conquer the human race. In other words, InExile do not care about their own story enough to make a truly mysterious (or at least funny) enemy; this of course explains why the plot twists are so pathetically predictable that they basically don’t exist.The NPCs talk a lot of “who is this Matthias person” emptiness, to which I respond, “OH C’MON, HE’S OBVIOUSLY A BORING ROBOT HITLER!”[Robot Hitler, by the way, would be a more compelling, entertaining villain than Matthias.]So if the intellectual bits are rare, and the characters are boring, and the plot is boring, then is it funny?Nope. There’s at least one homage to a famous comedy. But basically that’s it. Visually they could have done many funny things—this is a 3D computer game, after all—but basically we got nothing. What missed opportunities…..To underscore how much these devs missed the mark, consider this: early in the game there’s a place you can opt to rescue from a giant flora infestation. What the developers could have done with this was pit your Rangers against, say, killer salads, aided by giant, banana-toting bananas. But what did InExile do? ZOMBIES! They made it so the plants infected the local fauna, turning them into zombies. Jesus Cliché Christ.As for the graphics in general, it’s black, brown, green and grey. There’s some red for blood. I do like the bullets flying and the body parts falling, especially when said body parts fall because someone hit the person with a blunt object. I also like some of the lasers. And the large robots look cool. Mostly I like the fact that you can dress your group like the Three Amigos. That was fun for twelve seconds.The game also features sound.SCORE: 3/10Back of the Box Statement: “Is there too much happiness in your life?”			"

								OK...now this is the game. This is the successor to the grand father of cRPGs, the spiritual father of FALLOUT...This is Wasteland 2!The game is still in beta (or early access, what ever you want to call it). It is also still suffering from optimization issues, bugs, and clunky game design.HOWEVER, these things do not hinder the game. In its state, is is solid, and plays very well. It feels like a true port-apocalyptic game, and it can definitely stand up to FALLOUT of STALKER. The story telling is wonderful, combat works and feels great, the atmosphere is just perfect, there is a bit of humor and secrets, many new and unfamiliar enemies, andTONS of customization. You can tactically set up your team and develop them as they level up, or you can build your own character from the ground up. It is just overall a well done project.It is still being developed, and new updates will be coming out for it. The UI will be fixed, it will be optimized, much more will be added...and in the end, this wonderful, promising stone will be polished to be one of the greatest cRPGs done.I know, the price tag is a little steep. But, if you are willing to buy it, and if you are willing to put up with a (currently) incomplete game, and if you are going to commit yourself to giving back to the devs, then it will be a worthwhile purchase. Additionally, this is a great game if you loved FALLOUT (esp. the first 2 and tactics) and Wasteland. Should you buy it? It depends, you might not want to, and you are certainly not being forced to. But if you do, know you are contributing to a constantly developing and promising sequel to a beloved game.			"

												Really good mix between old-school text pop-ups and nowadays graphics, although its not that very detailed. But what's more important in an RPG  is the story and it's a great story. Very large and open world to explore, great characters, fun encounters. It takes a little while to get used to the battles but after that I enjoyed positioning my characters as strategically as possible, deciding to crouch, ambush, attack, reload, reposition etc. I'm in Titan Valley now and already put 32 hours in this game and if you like adventures, nice (not top-notch) graphics, puzzles, a good story and value for money (lots of hours of gameplay), I recommend this one.

								Lost it's appeal. I worked out what it was: There are too many systems. Too many skills and stuff that I can't be bothered with.From the activatable perception skill, ""Positional play"" AI that can see for miles and only knows one tactic, garbage friendly fire, too many gun types (7) and an exclusive skill system - a guy who can pick the eye out of a raider at 25m can't hit a mutant maggot 2m away with a shotgun. Repairing a ""toaster"" isn't the same as repairing another type of toaster. I was brought up on the Bards Tale series, Dragon Wars, Wasteland and Fallout. You can tell instantly that this has the same level of completeness and polish, but as good as that is, amazing amount of detail as it has, it still left me cold. Perhaps wandering round Skara Brae all those years ago with my imagination, squared paper and pencils left me expecting something different. ""Burger"".			"

								Finally broke 100 hours with this gem.  This game is EXACTLY what was promised, and delivers where it counts.  Fans of the original game and the post-apocalyptic genre should eat this right up.  There's at LEAST 25 hours of content in the Arizona portion of the game.  With that being the halfway point we're looking at a 50+ hour game which is more than most games today will give you for the pricetag.  There were no corners cut or shortcuts taken and it's very evident in the late beta.  The game is highly polished and the bugs are (almost) gone!  The expectations are very high for release (Sept 19th?) and I fully believe InXile won't disappoint.  Synopsis:  You are a freshly recruited Desert Ranger in the post-nuclear wastes of Arizona, USA.  Welcomed and rushed straight off to investigate a prominent ranger's death and complete his critical mission, the game wastes no time showing you the harsh and dangerous environment that is the Wasteland.  Through use of skills, combat, dialogue, and cunning, you will forge a unique path through the wasteland and write your own story as a member of the Desert Rangers.  Of course there's mutated plants and animals, killer robots, raiders, cannibals, thugs, and radiation clouds to keep you company along the way.  The Game:  Unlike most games that ease you in with kiddy missions and tutorials, this game slaps you in the face.  ADAPT OR DIE is the theme for the first few run-ins with the bad men and creatures of the wastes.  If you're unlucky enough not to recruit a special friend before setting out, you'll be lucky to survive to the first real location without a ridiculous number of reloads.  On my first playthrough I was losing team members in the first 10 minutes.  Then I realized the coolest thing about this game:  You have to actually THINK.  About Everything.  The combat is highly tactical, and the choices have real consequences.  There's actually no way to do everything in one playthrough.  With each location you visit you'll make decisions that affect the rest of your game.  And the consequences don't show up until later, making your choices semi-permanent (you REALLY don't want to reload and replay the last 1.5 HOURS to fix that dialogue choice).  This is one of the most immersive top down TBC RPG games I've ever played.  It is very much a spiritual ancestor of the Fallout series, but the playability is very much with the times.  You can also have a party of up to 7 members, which is much more than other games have allowed, but furthermore in my playthrough of just the Arizona area, I encountered 6 recruitable NPCs and I know for a fact I missed at least 1 due to a choice I made.  So there's probably upwards of 12-15 characters you can add to your party throughout the game, which is a  TON!  And there's so many ways to do everything!  Locked door?  Pick it, bust it down, or find the key.  Broken robot? Fix it mechanically or hack the cpu.  There's a real sense of reality applying in this world.  If it makes sense, you can probably do it.  I must commend the developers for that specifically, as it's frankly an amazing thing to see in a game.  Also, in many situations you can avoid combat alltogether, or you can choose a side and manipulate the outcome, so there's just as much variation to the game strategy as there is to the skill use.  It feels very complete in the way of forging your own path.  Combat:  The combat in this game is a bit more complicated than your typical tactical turn based game.  Aside from the usual Action Points system for movement/weapon use, you also have to deal with weapon jams, your NPCs going rogue and doing whatever they want for their turn, and rampant friendly fire if you don't watch your angles.  The only way to avoid this (and you can't ever avoid it entirely) is to invest survival points into your weapons and leadership skills to minimize the chance of jams/rogue turns.  Some may find this a frustrating addition to combat, but I find it adds a great depth and believability to it.  To compare the combat to something, I'd say it's similar to XCOM but with more of a Fallout RPG focus, so it's not nearly as hard once you get the hang of it.  Overall this game is what Post-Apocalyptic gamers have been waiting for since Fallout 2.  If you enjoy turn based games and love the genre, it's bound to become one of your favorite titles for any number of reasons.  The story is huge, the choices are real, the combat is deadly.  Do you have what it takes to be a Desert Ranger?			"

Early Access Review
								OK...now this is the game. This is the successor to the grand father of cRPGs, the spiritual father of FALLOUT...This is Wasteland 2!The game is still in beta (or early access, what ever you want to call it). It is also still suffering from optimization issues, bugs, and clunky game design.HOWEVER, these things do not hinder the game. In its state, is is solid, and plays very well. It feels like a true port-apocalyptic game, and it can definitely stand up to FALLOUT of STALKER. The story telling is wonderful, combat works and feels great, the atmosphere is just perfect, there is a bit of humor and secrets, many new and unfamiliar enemies, andTONS of customization. You can tactically set up your team and develop them as they level up, or you can build your own character from the ground up. It is just overall a well done project.It is still being developed, and new updates will be coming out for it. The UI will be fixed, it will be optimized, much more will be added...and in the end, this wonderful, promising stone will be polished to be one of the greatest cRPGs done.I know, the price tag is a little steep. But, if you are willing to buy it, and if you are willing to put up with a (currently) incomplete game, and if you are going to commit yourself to giving back to the devs, then it will be a worthwhile purchase. Additionally, this is a great game if you loved FALLOUT (esp. the first 2 and tactics) and Wasteland. Should you buy it? It depends, you might not want to, and you are certainly not being forced to. But if you do, know you are contributing to a constantly developing and promising sequel to a beloved game.			"

												I backed this one on Kickstarter, mainly because there was a goal set to fund aLinux version and there was only a few games for Linux then. The idea soundedgood – reviving an old classic, something like Fallout, multiple skills andways to solve quests, etc.After over two years of waiting it came. Playing it was tricky at first, due toa 'fog of war bug' on my integrated Intel GPU. It seems the problem was knownfrom early beta but all the developers could say was 'Intel GPUs are notsupported'. Oh… and I thought the game was supposed to be about story,playability and reviving classic. Nothing that should require a dedicatedgaming hardware. Current laptop should be enough. And is enough when theworkaround for the bug is known. But creators would not acknowledge that – buya gaming computer or don't bother us.OK, so with the workaround for the GPU bug the game was fun to play. There weresome game bugs, sometime ruining some quests, but nothing making the gameunplayable. I have played 60 hours… and got bored. 'Dozens of skills' reallymeans 'many different ways to open containers' all the same containers all thetime. It is a game of opening chests and safes. And digging holes.Yes, there is also the combat and combat skills. You need good hand gun orsniper skills not to kill your own people by mistake… But there are also highexplosives, which you need not skill to use at all. Always 100% hit chance,always 100% deterministic effects. How can it be? If not the price andavailability explosives would be the most effecting and safest method of fight.Then come the patches. Some bugs were fixed, often for parts I have alreadyplayed and do not wish to come back. Some features were implemented. And youknow what? Linux is not an equal platform now. Steam achievements wereintroduced two patches ago and they are 'Windows only'. Steam achievements!I could understand, that some advanced graphics or sound effects could betricky to do in Linux, or that handling some exotic controller could beimpossible. But the achievements?!It is not that Wasteland 2 is a bad game or that my contribution was waste ofmoney, but I am a bit disappointed and the game is not worth the 'user reviews'rating it has now.BTW I got bored by Fallout 2 too, so if you really love this type of games you could probably ignore my opinion.

								As a fan of the original Wasteland, I had very high hopes for this game. Overall, I enjoyed the tone, the story, the interface -- and don't have the same criticisms that many others have had.Unfortunately, I found navigating around the world much more cumbersome that I would have expected. I spent a long time wandering around levels looking for the right building, a doorway within a map or the tiny green highlight that showed the way to the next location. So, basically I found myself spinning around and mousing around in order to find the locations I was looking for.In one of the early locations, I found myself having to make many time consuming trips across half of a beaten map to return to the city -- no way to fast-travel straight to it. While I appreciate the return to some of the old school magic, some of the hand holding that newer games do does allow the players to focus on the more important aspects of the gaming experience.

												It might be that I'm missing the point with this game, as I have not played first Wasteland game, but I was expecting a somewhat-Fallout like experience. Instead, I'm forced from the very outset to side with an incredibly-boring faction regardless of whether their values align with my own, and am given no (legitimate) option to go rogue or sign on with the opposition.SPOILERS FOLLOW=============When I accidentally managed to blow up said faction, it triggered a joke ending of sorts, but one that I was pretty satisfied with. Satisfied enough that I won't be going back to the game.			"

												This game pales in comparison to it's predecessor, Fallout 2. Its buggy, poorly executed in art and design and generally lacking in polish. Most frustrating is the ""it's not linear play, but if you don't follow the line you're in for bugs, major bugs"" dissapearing NPCs, arbitrary choices closed off and a jumbled mess inbetween, I tried hard to love this game, played a few dozens hours and yet am defeated by it's schlock. AVOID THIS GAME! If you like this party RPG style, get Realms of Arcania or Fallout 2; both made by the same developers when they were far hungrier and less lax in their testing.			"

												I funded this game at Kickstarter. I have mixed feelings about the result, as much as I try to like it:+ Size of game: Large world, much to explore, long play time. Lots of different, quite large (larger than in Fo1) cities/places. Often they have some politics with each other but usually most quests are done right at the location you are, and some quests are generic get-and-return or talk-to-and-return quests.-  Random encounters: Only fights and traders. Fights, if in the same area, take place on the same single map, same enemies. Traders can sometimes be found, nothing special. Better to skip everything if possible.o Only limited freedom. No real sandbox. No real open world. The game is mostly seen to be linear because you are always locked out of new places unless you progress in the story, a story which is very linear unless you take the ""bad path"" leading to an early-on bad ending. Along the storyline you just do whatever the Ranger HQ tells you to do, at least when it comes to the main quests. You got more freedom to do whatever you want when it comes to how you solve disputes and such, which is nice in turn.+ NPCs: A diverse selection of followers can be selected from to join your team throughout your journeys. Practically no interaction possible with them or between them. They do however often make comments, and rarely cause an event.-- Bugs: The game is definitely playable, but after Patch 4 there are still a lot of major bugs. Especially in the California half of the game. This game was released too early and clearly had obvious issues left at release, and the developers must have been aware of its state. Releasing a game as ""finished"" when it in reality is riddled with bugs, that's a BIG no-no for me!++ Bug-Fixing and Support: The feedback on bug report is fast and they still improve the game a LOT.o Story: While the story is in its essence very interesting, the dialogs are often not. The writing could be improved upon a lot. Aso Vargas is annoying.- Gameplay I: Quite weak attributes and skills system. It seems they did not think this design through well enough. Some skills were also dropped pretty late in development (sneaking). Negatives: Skills are not tied to attributes at all (brute force skill 10 works as well with strength 1  as it does with any other stringth. charisma and intelligence dont affect speech or dialogue options and dont affect the 3 speech skills (smartass,kissass,kickass) in any way, etc.)  Some skills should probably have been combined into one. Over all they tried to reinvent the wheel with their system and the wheel turned out to be cubic and clunky rather than more useful and efficient. Also: each player characters needs a lot of skill points to be spent on a weapon type to hit well wit hit but then a grenade or rocket launcher has 100% accuracy on any character by default. There are also two skills written as ""???"" without description in the character window, and that still after 4 patches.-- You want to open a box or safe or pick up some poo? Well, bad luck for you: Boxes, safes, doors,  poop; everything explodes in your face when touched. And the real bummer: disarming bombs, safecracking and lockpicking is extremely time-consuming even if skilled at maximum possible levels. Try a whole mine field... Medic and surgery also takes forever. It often feels like wasting my time waiting for bars to fill up when playing. It felt like this took a large part of my playtime. Even unlocking a door with a key (!!) takes about 5 seconds. Pure nuisance. At some point I started to just triggers bombs, mines and traps and eat the damage instead of defusing them because even if skilled to the max, it still takes too long to defuse everything in the game. What is also very time consuming is the movement inside locations. If entering rooms, all characters will be teleported, so you can't even split up your team leaving one character at an area's exit to shortcut running back all the way.o Gameplay II: The fights are not overly tactical. Formations are not supported. You often have to manually position each character 1 by 1 without being able to utilise the actual grid used in fights, meaning the characters will be moved unpredictably a short distance when a fight starts. Taking cover is practically useless, yjust shooting the enemy is often better than wasting action points running around taking cover. Fights are overall fun though. Just don't expect a Jagged Alliance here. ++ Gameplay III: Lots of weapons and weapon types available in this game and weaponsmithing is fun.o Dialogs: while you get different options in dialogs, most are just serving you some general info, repeating almost the same batches of text. When it comes down to actual choice, I often felt a bit limited despite having skilled all 3 speech skills to the necessary levels to have all options present. The skills are pretty useless because you only get to use each of them maybe 5 times in the entire game, and often they do not even lead to better results but to WORSE results which really sucks after having invested valuable points...++ Lots of quests and lots of things to do in this world. Often you have choices to solve quests differently, but ...-  ...the quests do however still converge to an unwanted ending in a lot of cases no matter how you approach it. Sometimes places and people cannot be saved against all logic.-- Graphics: The art direction feels uninspired / heartless and forgettable. Generally too many saturated vivid yellow/green/brown colours, subpar shading (where is the specular lighting?), terrible AA (some bad version of FXAA was chosen whyever), sometimes random blobs of colours. It overall looks very ""meh"" to me, they could have done a lot better. The low-poly modeling is generally fine for third person, but unfortunately they made mistake of letting the character portraits (optionally) be zoomed-in screenshots of the character. These captures look quite awful and you would normally not even see your character that close-up so why enforce making this flaw apparent?- Character portraits:  For your own characters, instead of the 3D snapshots, 2D portraits can be chosen. But the selection is small and some can be encountered in the game again on NPCs. However, you can add custom portraits to the game if you want. A lot of NPCs in the game unfortunately share the exact same portraits. Often the portraits are contrary to the 3D model. The character portraits repeat even on important characters creating great confusion in anyone who would try for recognise them by looking at the portrait. The descriptions given in the text can often conflict the 3D model's looks which also is contrary to the 2D portrait. Three impressions which do not go along with each other. This killed the immersion for me at times.- Many quests have to be solved in an unintuitive and sometimes unsatisfactory way (your actions may have an effect contrary to your goal), some relevant spots inside areas are weirdly hidden (Alexey in Highpool) which took me a lot of time to find in order to solve quests. Also I often encountered situations that weren't solvable (with the outcome I wanted) with logic and speech skills (Railroad Nomads conflict). Some quests were also bugged, but this was solved now. Personally I preferred the quest-solving in Planescape or Fallout. It seemed more straight-forward there, meaning that my actions lead to the results that I wanted to achieve.All in all I feel like this game didn't get as much love from the developers as it should have and also was released prematurely with unfinished design aspects all over the place. Some issues i mentioned might be resolved in future patches but most won't because they would require redesigning big parts of the entire game. Overall it was okay fun to play, but the buggy release make me give thumbs down.			"

												The graphics are incredibly bland, by which I mean that they were made by people that just don't have any sense of style whatsoever. There are games old like gameing itself like Fallout tactics or Baldurs gate that have more personality like Wasteland 2.The music and the sound design are as bland as the graphics are. Not really worth this line of virtual text.Another chapter are the dialogs or should I rather say monologs with intersections. You can't really select any answers. Well you can but only very very rarely. Mostly, the ""dialogs"" are all about utterly boring ""Tell me about this one thing"", ""Tell me about 2nd thing""...""Tell me about that 20th thing. Really the dialogs even though nicely writen are total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.But of all else what I found the most boring is the combat system. Today when you got really interesting combat situations with elemental interactions like in Divinity: Original sin. But hell! Even old games like Baldurs gate got interesting AOF weapons and buffs and summons and what not. In W2 you got guns. Then you get slightly better guns. Snipers are guns with higher effective range but still guns. And then you got sticks. And thats about all of it. Oh yeah and you get to cover and everything happens in something I would call very bland arenas. Thats all I was able to see of the combat before I died of boredom.Remember me.			"

												1. Live action actor playing your commander in a cutscene has a beard.2. In-game portrait of your commander has a beard.3. Examining your commander reads: ""A stiff, bearded older man... walks with a cane... wears a pearl-handed revolver...""Well... his actual in-game model is a 30 years old clean-shaven generic male dude with a generic DesertEagle-sized handgun and it seems that he misplaced his cane somewhere. Bummer.This pretty much sums up the whole game, because everything it offers to the player works exactly like that: roleplaying, combat, economy model, loot system, all of it. It's not an awful game per se, more so in it's Director's Cut version, but if it's the apotheosis of mr. Fargo's publisher-free talent, then it's a very good retirement milestone. It could pass as a solid 15$ mobile platform game, maybe even 30$ in it's DirCut state, but it is too weak and barebone, if not primitive, for a 60$ PC CRPG title.			"

												An excellent return to the formula of the original isometric CRPGs of the past, Wasteland 2 is a worthy successor to its fargone original. Mostly. There are a few moments of derp-dome come again with characters that simply don't fit in the game, but overall it has a good story and excellent gameplay. Bugs do occur, but the developers have released fixes promptly enough to satisfy my needs. Overall, I enjoyed the playthrough and the challenge of its ""Supereme Jerk"" difficulty.  While there are issues with the balance of the game (namely, assault rifle weapons are god-like, while pistols are mostly useless) and the game does use a simplistic toughening/weakening of the enemies and player respectively for its 'difficulty' scaling, it was certainly a well executed, if not perfect, recall to the early years of RPGs.

												I really wanted to like this game. I liked games like Fallout 1/2 and Fallout Tactics.  So the squad-based turn-based RPG is a category I like.  I also wanted to like this game to support indie designers, so against my better judgement I purchased the game shortly after release and at full price.  However, the flaws in this game are vary glaring and difficult to ignore.1) If you haven't played Wasteland 1, this game is hard to follow.  It is more like a continuation of the story than a sequel set in the same world. Many of the clues dropped require some knowledge of the events in Wasteland 1.2) The gameplay mechanics are just a mess.  The armor system is borked to the point of being pointless.  While the initiative system is interesting, there is no prevision for a character to delay his turn.  The effect of which is to create a log jam if a slower character is blocking a door.  Fortunately most of the combat is in wide open area -- probably for this very reason.3)  Looting is similarly botched where crappy useless loot is stored in containers that require a number of difficult checks to open.  The difficult of skill checks is uneven through out the game as well.I do like the three dimensional maps and the ability to rotate them (however they definitely do not rotate smoothly). The attitude and feel of the game seem to be done well.  The character models and animations however do not match the environment very well.  The in game character appearance does not change based upon the armor that is equipped. Clothing choices seem to be poorly matched to gender (I guess cross-dressing is a thing in the wasteland).Overall, I doubt many people will get past part one in the game much less get into part 2 (Las Angels) where the writing and encounters start to fall apart.This game will probably have to be saved by mods, which there does seem to be a few on the horizon to fix the mechanics.  However, I don't see the skill system being reworked with mods, which has a few issues as well -- mainly too many skills.  There are 29 skills in the game and at least 6 of them could simply be removed/combined with existing skills.Overall, Fallout Tactics was a better game.  If you are really liking this type of game, wait for a steam sale.			"

Early Access Review
								after 5 hours played during my first livestream of the game I am absolutely hooked. It captures the perfect feeling of the original wasteland mixed with what the wasteland dev's ended up creating as Fallout 1 and Fallout 2; - along with elements added from XCom (tile) the AP points are used in a mixture of Fallout and more modern style; The ability to import photos of people you know as characters is a huge ""Well; I better not let THEM die"" - and I adore that it does not hold your hand.. at all. Things have been implemented to make it easier to understand for the newcomer; but if you are in a situation and your party does not have the abilities despite multiple methods; you are F'd. - It's hardcore. Its Wasteland. It's Fallout. It's... wasteland 2.I've waited for this for ages; It feels like how I've waited for Fallout 3 back when it was a rumor, then in development by various companies prior to actually being ""fallout 3"" with a teaser 3-4 years before FO3's release.... Wasteland 2... is an A+ title by inExile - Who are currently also working on the sequel to PLANESCAPE TORMENT (how can we lose with these guys? -They promised on everything they said they would thus far - ""One Size Does Not Fit All: Don't feel like finding the key for a door? Why not try a Rocket Launcher! Basically the same thing... right? Enhanced Classic RPG Game Play: Classic RPG game play ideas updated with modern design philosophies. Decision Making... with Consequences: With both short and long term reactivity to the players choices, every decision matters in the outcome of the story.

												I'm playing on Normal difficulty and have about 6 hours in. The game starts out really promising, but then throws a bunch of missions at you at one time. When you get to the second big mission of the game, the enemies are extremely powerful and your band of mercenaries will not stand a chance. GOOD Things: The tactical combat is nice. There are a variety of weapons and it is critical to manage your squad's inventory.Resource Scarcity makes gameplay feel exciting and changes how you approach conflict. The world seems interesting and you won't feel bored reading through all the text. BAD Things: This game is difficult. This comes from someone who loves Dark Souls. Whereas another game could be difficult and fair, this one does not seem fair in the least. Oh, your squad member can shoot once per turn? Awesome. Here is a pack of enemies that can empty their magazines into you. Or, here are some people carrying machetes who can cross the whole of the wasteland and smack you in the face in the same turn you may get a chance to unjam your weapon.Seriously, this is infuriating. Let me shoot this pistol with a 3 percent chance to jam. 3 percent is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You can set your watch to that thing jamming. No kidding, the game is incredibly unfair. I am a huge fan of the old school fallout games as well. I've played Ghosts and Goblins on the NES. I've seen unfair games, and this is such. WHO will enjoy this?Sadists. Masochists. People who love playing CIV on unfair difficulties. People who like pulling triggers and having their guns jam while criminals beat you in the face with spiked 2 by fours.			"

												I'm mainly writing this for my friends because I recommended this game to them before I spent enough time with it. I had really high expectations for this game but I really can't recommend it.  I wanted to love this game, I mean really LOVE it like I loved Fallout 2 or Jagged Alliance 2 or Morrowind. And I tried so hard to overlook the flaws I saw because damn it, I was waiting for this game over 20 years and I wasn't going to let some nittpicky BS stop me. But unfortunately all the problems I kept encountering just kept building up on each other until I pretty much gave up. Some of these problems are as follows: The combat is shallow and lacks any sort of tactical feel despite being turn based; You rarely have a need to move your characters and most battles can be won by standing still and spaming attack or maybe toss a grenade. You can crouch or use a headshot but there's no real advantage that I notice to even bother with these moves.  The missions all seem half finished; apparently it's ""hand holding"" to ask for any sort of clue as to what you need to do or even why you need to do it. And all of the quests have multiple ways to ""complete"" them but if you're looking for multiple ways to complete them in a manner that the devs wanted you to in order to ""win"" the game then you'll need to rely on online guides because those solutions require an extremely linear path to be followed. And by ""win"" the game I mean by having the optimal completion where everyone you encounter was happy with what you did. Those endings are there but as I said they're not very easy to figure out. ""Conversations"" with NPC's are nothing more than triggering the next bit of dialog by clicking on the keyword; there's no branching at all and you're really not interacting with NPC's in any meaningful way.  Character creation is also an oddity since it breaks the norm in most RPG's by having skills act completely independant of  attributes; ie charisma has no effect on your characters conversation skills or barter. And lastly there are some really bad bugs that have caused me to lose a lot of game play time; there's 3 quick save slots for a reason and you should be sure to use them.There's a lot to like here but I'm not going to sit here with a ""pros and cons"" list because I figure a lot of people are like me: if I'm thinking about buying a game I'm pretty much sold on it already and what I need to know is the bad stuff. Now none of the stuff I said above is so much that it's caused me to hate the game but it is enough to make me wish I had held off and waited for more reviews instead of buying it day one. $14.99-$19.99 is probably a good price point for this game but $40 is too much for what you get.

Early Access Review
								There is so much about this game. It would take multiple playthroughs to get every ounce out of this game. I love it! It's fast and fun RPG. I found a sherifs badge on my way through to the radio tower and was amazed by that. It's the very small things in this large game that make it worth playing!			"

												Having never played Fallout 1 or 2 (and indeed spent only 7 hours on this game), I haven't seen much nuclear wasteland from a turn based isometric perspective. Hence, for me this game evokes memories of Baldur's Gate. The first one, not the higher praised sequel. And like going back to BG1 after playing the sequel, this game feels like a throwback. The writing and voice acting is good, but the combat is lackluster and picking the right skills is hit-and-miss unless you watch a Let's Play on Youtube first. It's recommended you atleast skim through a few video's before playing the game.Also like BG1, the first ten hours didn't win me over and I gave up. The game probably gets good later on, but even during the free weekend, I wasn't invested enough to keep going.Verdict: Wait for a sale.			"

												This game is boring. Quests are non original and derivative. Skills system is broken. Too much boxes and safes laying around. They are screwing the whole game, Fargo.To much text in dialogues, most dialogue options are waste of time and they are duplicating each other over and over again.Wasteland 2 is a waste of your time.I would call this game Box Opener Simulator instead. It's more honest name.			"

												If you loved the predecessor and Fallout 1+2, you will at least like this game very much after a few hours of playing. + One word.... Minigun + .50 sniper rifle + discobot ( can you resist the beat? ) + Character development - er - hmm - what ? - can't remember. No wait there was this NPC who stole the booze from my inventory, after I invited him to accompany my party. "

												I'm mainly writing this for my friends because I recommended this game to them before I spent enough time with it. I had really high expectations for this game but I really can't recommend it.  I wanted to love this game, I mean really LOVE it like I loved Fallout 2 or Jagged Alliance 2 or Morrowind. And I tried so hard to overlook the flaws I saw because damn it, I was waiting for this game over 20 years and I wasn't going to let some nittpicky BS stop me. But unfortunately all the problems I kept encountering just kept building up on each other until I pretty much gave up. Some of these problems are as follows: The combat is shallow and lacks any sort of tactical feel despite being turn based; You rarely have a need to move your characters and most battles can be won by standing still and spaming attack or maybe toss a grenade. You can crouch or use a headshot but there's no real advantage that I notice to even bother with these moves.  The missions all seem half finished; apparently it's ""hand holding"" to ask for any sort of clue as to what you need to do or even why you need to do it. And all of the quests have multiple ways to ""complete"" them but if you're looking for multiple ways to complete them in a manner that the devs wanted you to in order to ""win"" the game then you'll need to rely on online guides because those solutions require an extremely linear path to be followed.

												Bryan Fargo presents: Bryan Fargo's Wasteland 2 eschews almost every major game design improvement of the last thirty years for the cause of nostalgia. Combat is simplistic and enemy difficulty scales purely by turning them into bullet sponges, and any 'set piece' fights can be negated by having one party member trigger combat and then run back, drawing snipers from towers and cover to chase them down on foot. Attributes are completely disconnected from skills simply because that's how it was done 20 years ago; as a result, two of your *seven* attributes are dumpstats and may as well not exist (Luck and Charisma), and since Coordination is a meaningless concept when divorced from fine manipulation skills, it may as well have been folded into Speed. The modified ASSI system would be in fact, far less so than the current CLASSIC set-up.However, if you do want to choose Charisma on a character, do not level any social skills with them whatsoever! Charisma's only real benefit is a set boost to all XP gained that scales with how high the stat is, and all dialogue skills grant experience to the entire party when used. Active skills such as the two redundant Lockpicking skills, Demolitions, Mechanical Repair and Computer Science, et al, only grant experience to the user. As a result, your Charismatic character should be highly Intelligent in order to gather as many active skills to benefit from the experience stat. As a result, none of your other three characters really need high Int; 4 or 6 should suffice. Your ideal party should be a beautiful Adonic IT guy who can't tie his own shoes and can calculate pi to the first 200 decimals without paper, and three semi-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ punch monkeys who kill or sweet-talk everything between them and victory.The game is riddled with minor bugs, which would be expected of a newly released game, except every higher-tier Kickstarter backer got the questionable reward of becoming QA-tester for a day the majority of the development process. Unless you got a copy of the game for participating in the Kickstarters of other Interplay alumni, I guess. Currently, keeping any allied non-party NPC alive is terrifyingly difficult as they're often equipped with pistols, and since you can't control them, gleefully run into the firing arcs of any Ranger they can see to maximize their self-harm. But they will duel you to the death if you accidentally clip them, which results in the player having to utilize amazingly unorthodox tactics. Prepare to think outside the box!I've played through the original Wasteland multiple times, as well as Fountain of Dreams, Wasteland's toilet baby. It's not that I hate this game, or even dislike it; in fact, it's exactly what I expected when I put $60+ into the Kickstarter. I've privately bemoaned streamlining game mechanics in favor of overall experience, and it's almost cathartic to have the inevitable conclusion of that flawed ideal thrown in my face. I'm not a casual, but there have been a lot of general QOL improvements to RPG and strategy gameplay mechanics that an entire development team had to put horse blinders on to avoid.			"

												If you seek a short “one sentence” resume for this game: It is just damn amazing, incredible, fantastic, I am completely shocked by this game in the best possible way. Must have for everyone. Score 10 of 10. So get it right now, install and play. This game is a fine, impeccable reincarnation of Fallout 2 (God save eternal games). It is not the same series, but it brings the same fillings, same atmosphere, same unbelievable gameplay. If you like fallout, you should definitely start playing it right now. There is no other game, which would awake memories back in such a bright way.The plot – score 10, dialogs – 10, mechanics – 10, graphics (it does not matter at all) -10. I thought this game would be cool, but didn’t imagine the scale. It is something outstanding! I’ve got pretty sick of all this overwhelming stuff about zombies. This game like a breath of truly fresh air!Many thanks for developers, thank you, thank you, thank you! I am going to have an eye on every following product. Maybe there will be wasteland 3, who knows. I hope very much!			"

												WEll. I waited long for this game. Love this type of games usualy but this one lacks a story that will keep you play longer then a few hours. Im already fighting with myself to play on. Graphics are kind of good but without the story its just a meaningless painting to me. Controls are a bit hard to get used to to much click here press that to just hear someone finish their conversation. In fact i love to see games like this on the market but i cant recomend it to anyone. Sorry guys!Update 1:I already hate the game. Its so boring. No intro  to make the caracters catch your atention. There is basicly no story whatsoever. They could at least tell you that you just got out of a life long hibernation, that would be more interesting than this. There is no strategy or variations in fighting at all. Its so much linear that i cant get myself to start a new game with diferent caracters. Basicly you will feel sorry for your money.Update 2:Back to playing Fallout :)			"

												I have been into action rpg's like fallout 3 for a while but was always hesistant to try the more old school turn based rpg. I must say that this game has completely changed my mind and have now fallen in love with the style. The atmosphere is incredible and it is a nice challenge, especially since I am sadly somewhat of a noob to this style so am still learning the mechanics. I highly recommend this game.			"

												I backed this game because I am a huge fan of Fallout 1, but after a few hours I can't be bothered to play it. Everything seems unfinished and generally rough around the edges. The engine is garbage and the graphics are ugly even at maximum setting. And I'm not talking low-definition ugly - the whole look of the game is just a big mess. It's all pasted together and no details seem to stand out. The UI is abhorrent with a ton of wasted space, which is not acceptable in 2014.  Navigating around the place is a pain because there aren't any proper map markers like in Baldur's Gate, for example. In fact, various caves and other area transitions are so poorly marked that they are hard to click. The camera is beyond terrible and adds to the unfinished feel of the game. On one map there was a tall tower that got in the way of the camera while I was in combat and I spend an ungodly amount of time trying to see around it. This is simply not acceptable in modern games. And don't get me started about combat, such utter rubbish! The guns feel like little slingshots and at times it seems more tactically sound to just come at the enemy bare handed. The combat is so boring and broken I don't even have the space to get into it. This is just one of those games that you want so much to like but the more you play it the more everything bothers you until you just decide enough is enough, close it and then uninstall it. I really don't know what the developers were doing but no one is going to convince me that this pile of garbage is the result of over 3 million US dollars and countless unexplained delays by the developer. My department just finished coordinating a 1.5 million international research project and if we pulled things like inXile we would in all probability be sued into utter oblivion.			"

												Short review- the more you play this, the less you'll like it. It is long, very repetitive, and boring. I don't just want my money back, I want my time back.I'm a big fan of Fallout 1 & 2 and similar games. When I first started playing Wasteland 2, I enjoyed it. It had a similar feel. Unfortunately, as the game progressed, it just aggravated me. I found myself spending all my time performing useless actions rather than actually playing a game. There are crates/boxes strewn about everywhere, and nearly every single one is locked/trapped, so you spend a lot of time using skills to open them (which takes several seconds each attempt), having to reload multiple times because the difficulty of each lock/trap seems to be random. They pretty much never have anything useful, so you've just wasted your time. Also, you have to run across the same areas you've already cleared, just to exit the map. Then run BACK across just to turn in a minor quest.The areas are sprawling, but VERY repetitive. There's relatively little NPC interaction, and most of those are the same, too. I don't know how many times I've gone to a town where they complain about a disease, had to find the local doctor who magically can cure it, but he needs you to go get a specific item to save the day. It creates the illusion of a sandbox as you explore the open world, but most places won't appear on the map until you hit that point in the storyline, no matter how many times you walk over it.Even the fights got boring quickly. Weapon variety seemed decent at first, but ultimately felt pointless. And the ""friendly fire"" is ridiculous. I don't mind friendly fire, but it seems almost guaranteed to hit your friend if he's between you and the opponent, even if it doesn't make sense (like if the friend is in a crouched position right in front of the firer, who is standing, and you're firing at someone at a higher elevation).I got to a point where I thought the game was almost over, and I was excited. Then I discovered I was only about halfway through and got depressed. I considered quitting the game right then, but hoped it would get better in the second half. I should've stopped playing. "

												Unfortunately this game has come out about ten years too late.  When compared to its recent release partner, ""Divinity: Original Sin"", it pales in comparison.  Even held to it's peers in the Fallout series it ends up in the shallow end of the pool.While not a bad game, it's just not satisfying enough to make you feel your time is well spent playing it.Pros:-Interesting story.-Decent voice acting.Cons:-Antiquated & simple gameplay-Graphic design is dated-Fights are dull & repetitive-Level design is repetitive "

												 I wouldnt advise you to pay for this game, it promises a lot but fails to deliver. The graphics are old, the interface is clunky and archaic, the gameplay is mediocre and frankly the storyline is non-existent. It dares to compare itself to the grand old series such as Fallout and Baldur's Gate but it does not even come close to them. This game is a half-♥♥♥ overpriced user-incompatible game, believe me I have been playing PC games in the last 20 years and this one was one of the worst ones, I'm glad I did not jump into it and bought it over another site for much much cheaper than steam price.
