												Fiesta Online is a typical, generic free-to-play-buy-to-win anime MMORPG played by a dead community that consists of veteran players who have invested too much time and money on this game to let it go~ Basically living in denial. In a world where you can't even change your graphics quality, players assume the role of a fantasy hero and play out their life long dreams of being anime characters; desu-desu. Regular bug fixes, rehashed events, and more than 115 levels of doing the same thing over and over again with hundreds of hours of gameplay (thousands if you don't buy $500 worth of microtransactions) await you!Having a hard time hitting that next level? Well don't worry we got 150% EXP Boosters there for you. This allows you to level up twice as fast! Now it'll only take 15 gameplay hours to go from 80-81!Drop rate boosts are also available so you don't have to spend 10 hours killing the same Great Goblin King over and over for a chance at that rare item!Lets not forget mounts! Even you can run around at the speed of sound with these guys! (Food for the mounts must be bought separately from the cash shop)Who wants charms? These charms let you wreck any other player or monster in this game easily. Build a full physical damage Mage and still kill kiddies with your 200% boosted stats.Can't enchant your item because there's a 90% chance of it breaking and going away forever? Buy some ENCHANT BREAKING PROTECTION. Want to upgrade the chance of the item actually upgrading? Buy some UPGRADE CHANCE FOR UPGRADING stones. Want to upgrade the upgrade amount per upgrade? Buy some more unfair♥♥♥♥♥♥ Either spend your life playing this to get better or pay to improve instantly. If you don't believe me on how much of a big deal this game's in-game cash shop is, try it out for yourself. Hell I played this for 3 years and thought it was great, then I graduated elementary school and got a PC.R.I.P. Aka_Ryu guild (Bijou server)			"

												I remember back in the days playing Fiesta Online for hours with friends and family with my old computer  that would play the game on 13-22 fps, this was back when every server was extremely populated, where people were trying to go into raids as soon as possible because of the capacity limit, and when people would stay up late at midnight to wait for GMs to start awesome events with the community, but now this game has become a relic of the past. Fiesta Online was a good game and will forever be a special memory to me.			"

												This game is pretty much dead in the water. I played this game in it's first few years, 2007-2010, and it was great.. I made lots of online friends (many of which i still keep in touch and/or play other games with) and generally had a really good time. The game itself is a generic mmo with rather simple mechanics, it's essentially a beginner's MMO... but of course that's not what made Fiesta fun, what made it fun was the social aspect.. unless you make friends and join a guild you ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE FUN, this game isn't for ""lone wolfs"" that are just looking to play a game and level up because it gets extremely tedious.I downloaded this game again after seeing it on Steam while mindlessly browsing in order to see how much it has changed and damn, has it changed. This game is now just a shadow of the shell of what it used to be..that's right, it's not even just a shell of it's former self, it's the shadow of it's shell... the reason being, there's very few people playing and even fewer new players getting into the game, it's currently Friday night and the server populations are all on Low.... It's mostly just populated by a handful of true newbies that in all likelyhood won't make it past level 50 and the rest are veteran gamers that have sunk way too much time and/or money to quit, which is made evident by the high number of not only high level characters but also mid to low level characters with +9 - +11 gear whom are most likely just alts belonging to veterans. I looked around the low level maps and saw only a few people doing quests, all of them by themselves of course.. Roumen to Uruga ( they're the maps for levels 1 to 60 ), checked all the maps in between and didn't see more than 10 people, none of them were in parties/groups.. just solo'ing. If you look at the screenshot of a group of players above, that's pretty all the people you'll see in Elderine which is the main vendor map...half of those people will most likely be AFK though, so you'll only see around 20 active players in that main city map.So in short, don't bother playing this game.. I imagine it won't be around for another year or two.*sigh* it really was nostalgic running through the maps though, almost brought a tear to my eye remembering all the good times I had with my old guildmates.. all the fun, drama, and plain old silliness.

												I'll start by saying I played this game years ago from 2007-2009 that was the time to play the game. Every server had lots of people and economy was thriving and was a great time to play the game. Also, I played more than 27 hours I found that steam makes this game crash so I downloaded the client from the Gamigo website.This game is dead now has been for some time I heard about a server merge and figured I'd download it and check it out. They just merged the servers into 4 new servers so it's just like when I started 4 servers. When I left the game in 2009 they had 6 servers I don't know if there were more added between 2009-2015. They would have to merge the 4 servers they have now into one to even get 1/2 of the amount of people they had on just one server in 2009. Don't let the population reading confuse you. Two of the servers say medium population they should say ""very low"" Don't get me started on the ghost towns that are the servers that say low...Now for the people I played up to lv 62 I couldn't do any kingdom quests that was the reason I came back to check on this game anyway. The kingdom quests or raids are (were) so much fun! These no longer matter and have not I assume for years. The only kingdom quests that were going were the lv 105+ ones and they were not even full. I saw some people desperately shouting for people to join the KKP Lvl 70-79 KQ the one I loved the most. These were some of the shouts.Join KKP mats <3Please Please Please join KKPJOIN KKP FOR MATS WE DO HAVE A CLERIC!!!!The people are not that bad they just seem to me to be trying to hard to hold on to this game when they know it's on its last legs. The people I met were mostly nice they helped me out more because they wanted to show off their cash shop godly powers than any other reason I got the feeling. I was being run through this dungeon tower for Lvl 20+ toons by a Lvl 60. The whole time we when in there he was saying things like I can do 4000+ damage with these charms. (Charms are cash shop items that increase your damage for a set amount of time) He must have been wearing 60$ or more worth of cash shop items. Now on to the economy guild academy, at least, the two I joined were giving rewards of 1-10 gold per LVL based on what level you are. The academy I mainly stayed in ""Eradicate"" I made 10g the last level 60 for a total of 2gem and 30 gold more than I ever had before. I still could not afford anything for my toon the prices are insane now. I saw one good weapon priced at 7 gems or 700 Gold it was a lv 70 weapon not even enhanced or anything. I started talking to the guy and asked if he would come down on the price he said one simple word ""NO"" The economy on this game now if based on everyone believing that everyone else has a secret level 100+ toon where the quests alone can make you a millionaire. What really finally bashed the nailing into the coffin for me was today 10/9/15 I spent 20$ in the store on enhancement bundles so my weapon would not break as I was leveling it up. I bought 3 of the T3 Bundles for 20$ I had already enhanced my axe to +4 the max limit before it will break if I try again without shop items. I used all 30 of the protection items and only got my axe to +10..... now remember it was already +4 when I started.... the max is +11 I spent 40g and 17 of those protection items just trying to get my axe from 10 to 11 the price is too high for me. A sub to World of Warcraft 15$ a month and no paid in-game items except for looks on that game. I would have to spend 50 or 60 maybe 70$+ just to get my axe to +11 and armors to +10 anyone who says you can do it without ever enhancing your items has never played the game or played the game when there were 1000's of other people playing it and you could get a party if you sucked. I decided to let this game go and wish anyone who is addicted to it well I hope you see what you are doing to yourself before you waste your life away like I did this past week.I try to think of it this waySay I keep on playing past level 62 The good thing is that you can get to Lvl 70 just from quests alone now but then what... So I spend the rest of this week getting to lv 70. I'm now level 70 so I start getting to 80 things are slowing down now as there are no kingdom quests. The quests offer 10-50% of the required XP per level. So I grind for the next few months to get to 100+ then what now I'm a level 100+ toon and now what?? I can get all the money I need by doing quests and play 1 kind of KQ. I can hang out with my ""Friends"" most of whom will be decked out in cash shop items. These people won't want me in their circle unless I spend money on the cash shop too... say I do spend money on the cash shop then what??? I'm now a level 100+ toon with godly stats that is accepted by his peers who spent 100's if not 1000's of $$$ and can do 1 kind of KQ if my ""friends"" feel like doing it too. I can go on raids if my ""friends"" feel like doing it too... I see no future for myself playing this game anyway but, if what I just summed up seems like your kinda place to be jump right in and enjoy the fun woohoo!!!!			"

												I remember playing this game back in the day when I was but a wee boy.  I remember loving this game and spending hours and hours online with a  community that was actually a joy to be apart of. One day, I just stopped playing Fiesta, and moved on with other games. When I saw that Fiesta had found its way to steam, I was surprised to see it was still alive. I'm not sure how its still around, considering how bland and repetitive it is. It's your typical Korean mmo grind fest with an uninspired tab targeting combat system and a pay 2 win cashshop.I guess the only thing that would keep someone around would be the community. Its a shame there isn't one anymore. The game feels dead and empty.  At one point in time, areas that would be bustling with activity and parties  are now nothing more than barren maps with the occasional mob of enemies here or there. From what Ive seen, the towns are dead, say for the few newcomers who downloaded the game out of curiosity. I can only assume the sight of an empty starting town won't keep them playing for very long.Fiesta kind of reminds me of the world in Dark Souls.  It's past its prime, and its waiting for the end to come. But in Fiesta's case, it's seems like the sooner that happens. the better			"

												Game used to be awesome. Like 2008 or 2009, when Outspark owned it. I probably had like 3000+ hours on it. There was like 200k - 1 million players on everyday (probably exaggeration, but it felt like there were that many players). I would play it everyday with my brother and a lot of the friends I made on that game. There were always events, dance parties and the kingdom quests were so full, you had to be quick just to get in. But then the switch to gamigo brought the player base to like 100 players and now they did a merge that erased my friends list, my marriage and spouse, and seperated my characters so my main character is on a different server and I lost all my cash and stored items. Good♥♥♥♥♥♥ But honestly I still love this game because it was a big part of my childhood. But it's outdated now.			"

												I do no recommend Fiesta Online to anyone, it's an obvious skinner box attack to its users, Pve you are not really wanted at high levels unless you are gracing with cash shop items that give really unfair advantages in a game where most bosses involves the drops be given to the highest dps party. And pvp is no fun cause of what I am about to say in next paragraphFrom 50% additional hp, 70% additional damage and armor, 20% more damage from weapon skins,  80% crit rates [crits are double damage], 50% additional item drop rates, Instant full hp, no cd potion, 100% xp rates. Everything is monetized, if there is an advantage you can get there is a thing to buy.I played years  back, maybe 7 years ago, cash shop was mainly used as a consmetic items, maybe some had crit rates but were very minute, i remember a crit set [full cash shop items] having a whopping 3% crit, now its nothing to see people rolling with 80% crit rates.The perm [never leveling] community is what made me wanna stick around, The farming of gears is actually a really fun aspect to me, it's all random statted and I am a collector at heart, i got near all max statted sets and the perm community on Epith never used cash shop, we were really all free to play outside of enhaching our sets. This is where I am now, it's a terrible community thats filled with people buying items for hundreds of dollars, through facebook groups. Pvp has turned into people obtaining the best items by paying real money for them, if you dont buy the items you spend cash shop points to obtain items so that you may gain gold faster, if you are true free to play you can not make the gold another thats spending hundreds selling his cash shop or just flat out buy items for real money, You will not outbid other pvpers for the best items cause some has spent thousands of dollars to obtain un heard amounts of in game money.The drop rates are terrible, beyond bad, even with cash shop items that boosts rates its not fun at all, It wasnt always like this. The ratio of gears farmed to gears that people want is too low, the low drop rates has forced a sellers market that items are so rare that they can decide how much they want for it, where as if drop rates were increased and alot of that item was available it be buyers market where people undercut each other to sell theirs. Guess who gets to buy gears? You guessed it the people that spend real money, you will not succeed if you do not spend you will not have a good time if you do not spend, Do not be used as a skinner rat [ google search skinner box technique] Cause playing this game you will become one			"

												If you like games with medeocre graphics and insane levels of grinding, this game is for you.If you like having to buy over priced items from the 'item mall' just to keep up, this game is for you.I played this game back in beta and I really hoped it would have imporved by now (4 years later?).  Still an Asian grind-fest. When every quest involves killing bioolions and billions of mobs to get the 4 earlobes just to be told you also need 8 nose rings from the very same mobs...Yeah, it's that kind of game.			"

												I loved this game, but too many things have happened to me to make me want to play it again. A long while back, All of my characters where banned and I wasn't able to login/play, because apparently I owed money to them, which I did not. All of my characters, that were leveled quite high, were deleted and I contacted the support, but didn't get a decent response and nothing resolved my issue. I quit playing, for a good 2 years after. Fast forward to today, I started playing this game again and I was doing well, I enjoyed it like I did the first play through, and my characters were well leveled and I had plenty of them to keep me busy- Now, I just tried to play it, today... My Characters are all deleted, every single one, and they, too, were decently leveled. 30-40+. I'm still able to play the game and sign in to my account, yet I can't play any of the characters I spent hours trying to level the way I wanted them. They all were replaced,  by a level 5 Cleric named CalypsoCara, Which I never made. I don't know what the problem here is, but it has dampered my mood and steered me away from this game for good. The game was fun, but it's definitely not good enough to play through over and over, only to reach level 40+, and have everything erased/stolen. Hopefully this doesn't happen to you.			"

												This game used to be beautiful before GameGo took over. Off of steam I have thousands of hours played. For social and non social reasons. But now, a lot of it is dead servers, rushed quests, crappy kingdom quests which NOBODY does anymore. The only reason anyone really plays anymore is for the social aspect. Nobody plays to really level, because getting from level 1-105 now can take an hour or two. Powerleveling is legal now, gifting is legal now, nobody gets in trouble for scamming that I know of, the game kinda just went to crap when GameGo took over and it's a real shame. This game used to be wonderful and beautfiul with gorgeous quests and so much effort was put into it for no good reason accept for fun. Now Fiesta is just like any private server there is.			"

												This is one of the most influential games of our generation. The sole idea tears down the foundation of video games with its originality and uniqueness. This game is one of those once-in-a-lifetime games that grabs hold of you with its stunning graphics and immense immersion. It will have you sinked in to its pay-to-win gamestyle along with its simple ""click to attack"" game mechanics. Its simplistic menu makes flipping through countless pages of quests and character screens easy as counting to 3. Dont even get me started on the music, I downloaded the entire soundtrack to the game yesterday and I have to say that I have never made a better choice in my entire lifetime. 10/10 Never been done before, could not recommend enough.

												I played Fiesta sometime in 2010-2011 so I'm not new to this game, was on and off the game for about a year before I quit for good. This is going to be a fair review for a game that is quite old compared to the ""new-gen"" mmo's, comparing the good parts and the bad. Now the only reason I recommend this game is because I would recommend it to new players who are playing their first mmo, why you ask? Because this game is fairly good when one doesn't expect anything from a mmo, people that have played mmo's before are not going to like it only because they have played better. Fiesta isn't top notch and never will be but it's a good starting point for anyone who really wants to start getting into online gaming. Fiesta has a nice community, diverse classes (traditional mage/fighter/cleric/archer type of deal with a few different ones, crusader/trickster), and a huge PvE aspect from level 1-115 (Or whatever the cap is at now). When I say PvE I mean there's a lot of things to do, but there's a short list of what you SHOULD do to level and not just mess around. You can get pretty much anything without paying a penny but its extremely difficult, there's only 2 people that I know of that have never payed a penny and still were able to cap with high end gears. The guild/academy system is very useful as you can always find help provided that you joined popular guild or a guild with at least 5 people who still play. Now for the people that have played mmo's before, don't bother trying with this game. Compared to most mmo's this is pretty far down the list of ""good games."" It's pretty old and follows old mmo standard playstyles, it's very grindy and it's very P2W (pay to win) there's a large gap when you compare people who don't pay vs those who do. And it's not spend 10$ and you can get some good stuff like in other games, you nearly have to pay 40-50$ a month now to be properly ""geared"" with sc (slime cash/cashshop) items for the MONTH. Now the PvP is very tricky. I can say that it's bad and that it doesn't require any skill for a fighter/mage since they're the ""PvP classes"" of the game since they're easiest to spam skills with or that the cash shop really overly unbalances the PvP with the stat increases + some multipliers of skills = insta death but I have seen people fight really well using any other character that is supposively ""bad"" for PvP so it really does depend on skill in the end along with a little push of SC. ( the company has got to make money somehow right?)In the end, recommended as someone's first mmo but not recommended for anyone who has played any mmo before. "

												If you're an old player returning to fiesta out of nostalgia, keep in mind that its not the same game anymore. Leveling isnt as hard as it used to be, and quests feel rushed. It feels like rather than increasing the exp rate of the game, Gamigo decided to add more, seemingly meaningless quests which give ridiculous amounts of exp. You can accept and turn in quests without even being near the NPC you got it from. This does mean that the ""pay to level"" system of the older outspark game is gone, but it doesnt feel as satisfying to level (I hit level 60 in 3 days, whereas it used to be a huge achievement). The Trickster felt like Outsparks final attempt to reinvigorate the game before they turned it over to gamigo. And gamigo responded by adding the Crusader, a class which seems so rushed that it doesnt even exist below level 60, and it even has some skills copy pasted from other classes.I can see that Gamigo are really trying to update and reinvent the game, with graphics updates, new quests, and a quicker leveling system, which allows you to get into the action faster. It even merged all the servers into a couple of servers to make the servers full of people again. As a result, this isnt the same game as it used to be, but its an evolving, fun game nonetheless.Ultimately, this isnt the golden '105 cap' fiesta that I remember, but I'm not gonna say it isn't worth playing. While its not the game I poured endless hours of my childhood into, its still a good game. Fiesta used to be hailed as a ""pay to win"" game, but now more than ever I feel that this isnt true. You can do really well without paying a cent. Im going to miss the days of stacking, endless grinding and massive guild raids on Karen, but the game is still fun. If you're coming to revive an old interest, you may be better off on a private server. But if you're willing to try a new game, this will be good.			"

												It was fun all those years ago when I played... I ended up quitting then I came back. These guys make you pay for just about everything. You can't quest anymore because theres barely anyone on. It's all high 100+ levels now. If youre under 100 prepare to pay for everything to finish quests. Everything is also overpriced ingame which makes it almost impossible for new players to come in (unless you're prepared to spend a lot of MONEY) Upgrading is terrible... You could buy 2-3 packs and only get half way done because you fail about 60% of the time. (this costs real money btw) Also, the community is awful, there are a couple good people but beware because there will be scammers who ""play"" nice but only until they get what they want from you. Don't even think about disagreeing with a high level 115+ because if you make them mad enough they're tell all their friends youre a scammer or make up something else to ruin you, and theres nothing you can do if youre lower than them. And leveling takes foreverr, by that I mean 1-70 is pretty easy but past that it gets much harder. As i said before theres not many low levels so youll most likely have to find a way to pay people to help you. And its not cheap. Getting past 110 as a free player is probably impossible. Actually getting past 100 in general as a free player is probably impossible too unless you have friends who are kind enough to help you.Basically... If you dont mind spending hundreds on a game then go ahead. But its dying fast and the only players left are vets who know exactly what theyre doing. I used to love this game, but its changed so much. Theyve tried fixing some things but its only made it worse..			"

I was able to log in but when I get to the Create character/enter game screen the button's wouldn't line up with the hit box and no way of manually changing resolution that I could find in the directory so I uninstalled it immediately.  Since when do games default at 1024x768?  From reading the other reviews thank god I wasn't able to get into this game.			"

												This is the game that got me into online gaming. What can I say? I saw an ad, liked the colorful characters, and signed up. It's a fairly unimaginative game with very little free customization. I began playing back in 2008 and when I tried signing in a few months ago, my characters had been deleted, including all my mounts, custom character designs, and upgraded weapons (all of which cost money). I didn't try very hard to get the game back up and working after that.But back in 2008, I invested a ton of time and a nice chunk of money in Fiesta Online. What eventually drove me away was the community and the grinding. If either could have been better, I might have stuck around but the carpal tunnel-like symptoms and the bickering were enough to make me quit.I tried signing in again today, knowing full well it would mean starting over. I was curious. The same three hairstyles, three faces, and three hair colors are present. They updated the character creation screen but it fails to impress. They added a class, which I've only played for a brief period of time, but the mechanics of the game are still pretty much the same. The starting gear is the same cowgirl-esque stuff from 2008. They added a tutorial which I find frustrating to get through but maybe that's because I've done this all before. I think it could have been a bit more streamlined than it presently is. It was really boring standing in place as I swing the same mallet from 2008 at the same Honeying for several minutes before it dies.As a Cleric, I still don't get any offensive abilites until a handful of levels in. The graphics are the same. Roumen appears to be the same. The controls are still clunky and because I've experienced other games since Fiesta, it was enough to make me lose interest. When I closed the game down, the same ""Fiesta.bin has stopped working"" error came up. Ah, nostalgia.It's a very grind-heavy game in which dying means redoing HOURS of repetitive monster killing. Some levels give you a small handful of quests, others give you none meaning you have to space your quest turn-ins out so you don't go crazy.All in all, the game does not appear to be any better than it was 6 years ago but I can't say I was expecting it to be.I will, however, say that I rather liked the Kingdom Quests and still think they're a neat idea. You sign up for a KQ and go into an instanced zone with a number of other players and defeat the end boss. I would say the KQs are probably the more creative aspect of Fiesta Online. They're timed and utilize different mechanics to make them interesting. They tend to require a decent amount of teammwork which can be both good and bad. I also like that, even though I'm currently back on foot and moving slowly, I can press a button to lead me to my objective and basically AFK until I get there.			"

												This is a bit of a tough decision for me to make. I'm going to reccomend this game, but only for veterans and rich people.I've been playing Fiesta Online since 2010, so this game gives me so much nostalgia that it's almost impossible to leave. Quitting cigarettes would be easier than leaving this bad Jackson.But honestly ever since Gamigo took over it's been nearly impossible to do anything because a lot of players have left, the prices have risen, and absolutely nobody wants to help anybody anymore. There's a few tight-knit guilds left on the two servers that people actually play on, but it's still difficult since they're not always available to help you.I guess what I'm trying to say here is that I would not reccomend this game for people who aren't willing to spend at least $20 monthly on it, because you're going to need it, and you'll probably spend more because it's honestly like cocaine.Okay thank you for reading my extremely unorganized review.

												Playing since 2009Pros Chars are pretty.Simple gameplayConsHeavily pay2win ( cash shop increases your damage and def for more than 100%, not counting the enhancing that brings that to 400%)Relies on gambling in the shop to get the best item and to enhance making the prices sometime skyrocket.As a general rule if you enhance all your set expect to pay 100$ every 5 levels. Expect to pay 30-50$ a month for extenders tevas suit. more if you charm alot.Impossible to play competitively as a free playerNo class balance.No strategy anywhere. Get a tank get 2 healers and get 40 players attacking in the back that won't get hit at all.Obselete raid system where 40 players will attack the boss and only one party gets a drop.Leveling system designed for no-lifers unless you put in cash shop.Corrupt staffLazy publishers. Monthly patches at best and most of the time it's only fixing text glitches.Only thing they work on is thinking of new more powerful item to make you spend more.Even the steam page is outdated of at least 2 years. That show how they abandoned it.If you're an old player you'll like the game. It's fun and simple.If you're  a new player looking for a mmo. skip this.This one is too old and is dying.Gamigo tries to keep it longer for the money it brings but it will be dead soon.			"

												I am going to have a hard to recommending this game. I have played it before for a lot of hours before it was ever on steam. The game is VERY grindy and almost all the qests are the same really. Go kill ""X"" Monster and collect ""x item"". If it is not a monster then it is ""go pick ""X"" plant and bring it back"". It also doesn't help that it is pay to win as you can buy power ups with real money that are temporary. What makes it even worse is most stuff is only temporary. You get 5 vendor slots unless you buy a sign of tycoon which is tempoary. I now find most of my time in the game making scrolls and potions and selling them because it does get boring. What makes it even worse is the game seems to crash... a lot so even selling stuff can be hard as you cannot just set it up and go afk... if you do, you pray you don't come back a few hours later to see it crash. Currently, I cannot recommend this game. The populations on the servers is often low, too repedative, too grindy and too unstable. If it improves over time, this may change.			"

												So, I have to take the time out to give this game a review. Despite the number of hours logged through Steam, I have played this game for a very long time. It deserves some love. Let me tell you a little about Fiesta Online.If you're looking for the next-big-thing, this isn't it. No, it's not like WoW or TERA. It's not Black Desert, either. It's an older game that's changed companies a few times, had it's share of population dips, and (shock) still has some bugs. It IS, however, still a very good game and will provide you with a lot of old-fashioned entertainment. I'm not going to do a formal Pros/Cons, but I am going to casually tell you about the game should you be in the midst of a decision on whether or not you want to try it out. This game is very generic in a lot of good ways. Yep, you read that right. It has all of the traditional things you would want in a MMO. Yes, you can buy and level up skills. Yeah, you can quest to your heart's content. It's got the trinity system you'd want from a standard game like this. The game still gets new content. It still gets patches that work on improving existing problems. The graphics have even been updated recently. It has six classes with each having a branch-choice at level 100 for a total of 12 end-game roles. The game has just the right amount of tradtion to relax ya. Grab a cold drink, sit  back, and enjoy some good old-fashioned game play.Aesthetically speaking, the maps are bright, colorful, and easy on the eyes. There's not a huge deal of customization, but you do have the option of furthering your character's design through the cash shop. Speaking of, I've always leveled just fine without using the Cash Shop. (That pay-to-win crap is, well, crap). If you're looking for a good ole anime game, then this is it! (However, I would like to throw out there that I've always found it odd that your characters can only be light-skinned. Then again, they don't have natural hair colors much either). Perhaps the most enjoyable, and unique, aspect of the game is the ""Kingdom Quest"" system. It's an instance-based raid, but it doesn't depend on your class. So, no, dear DPS players, you're not going to wait an hour in que. It's not a perfect system, but it's different, fun, and is currently working very well. When the game changed companies awhile back, the population dropped a bit. This made the Kingdom Quest system kind of broken. I mean, it's hard to run an instance with no people in it. They cared enough to finally merge the servers, and they're working great now. If all else fails, you do have the traditional instances where you find your own party members.The game isn't easy to level. It plays like a casual game, but it actually has some pretty thought-provoking challenges in it. While it's not as hard as it used to be, you're not going to cap in a month. It takes time, effort, and by the time you're there, it feels fantastic! Not to mention, the game has new bosses and raids for end-game. I'm looking forward to them!So, no, Fiesta isn't the best game in the world, but it WILL be fun for you to play should you decide to stick with it. I hope you decide to give the game a go and make tons of new friends in the end!Best of luck,xDYimy			"

												WARNING: THIS WILL FEEL MORE LIKE A COMPLAINT THAN A REVIEWOkay, I'll stop being lazy and post an actual review of this game. For the heads up so you don't go all, ""You haven't even tried this game!"" on me, I have played this game from 2009-2013 (with several breaks inbetween).Anyway, this game is the generic anime MMORPG with men running around disguised as women and vice-versa (you know, to keep the creeps away). With a click-and-sit system and months of grinding-even with an EXP. buff. Honestly, all I can say is the friends/guildmates I met are the ones that kept me coming back after 2009-2010.PS. (11/1/14) After looking at this half-done ""review"", I take back my statement with men-playing-as-women. Some men just enjoy trying different things, same goes with women.PROBLEMS WITH THIS GAME?The cash shop. 'Nuff said.The problem with the cash shop, is that it ruins PvP. Entirely. I remember walking into Uruga (main city), fresh 60, with a bunch of 100's and 90's with an arrow above their head (which I later learned, it was a debuff), and I thought it was the coolest thing ever. However, PvP since then has died down - rapidly. The excitement of Abyss wars, FBZ wars, or just wars in general, used to be the most exciting and anticipating thing in the game that kept me going (well, part of it was my guildmates).The cash shop allows you to use CHARMS IN PVP.When you kill someone, ""CHARMED!""When someone kills you, ""CHARMED!""When you get killed by the hammer in PvP KQ, ""CHARMED11!!1""Nobody assumes a player is good anymore - heck, the ""good"" players are considered good when they use charms. However, I am not discrediting those who worked hard in raids to earn their well-earned gear. Just those who assume one is using charms or is one of those pvp-charm-users.(A/N) This is an exaggeration, of course. However, some people really did act like this. Also, charms aren't as bad as they seem, it's just that it caused people to become somewhat paranoid of it and believe that everyone that doesn't take 10k dmg from them is charmed.Right, now for the more serious problem. PvE.This game is literally a grind-fest. At level 90 (or so), I was able to run Leviathan runs for gear and EXP. While using an EXP. booster, it still took me OVER 4-6 HOURS just to gain maybe 20-40%. That's terrible. Kid me not, it was MUCH longer once I hit 100. (I don't even understand why I stuck around). Heck, I was looking forward to leveling my alts again, which normally would be the thing I hated the most.(11/1/14)At level 93 or 94, all you can really do - besides that terrible leviathan run - was to do a quest repeat which gave 1% every turn in and had terrible drop rates.Leviathan became around 10-15% every 4-6 hour grind in the later 90's.I salute everyone who took the time to level their characters to 100+.PS. I hated when they stopped making that cool mage animation with their spammable skill.. forgot which, but they kicked and it was cool.GOOD THINGS?Okay, yes, this game had a few good things. (From my point of view, it was the nostalgia that kept me going). If you're lucky, you would've made a guild/found a guild that's friendly and fun to be with, making everything much more worth it. However, the rest of the community... not so much.Although they rarely do, but the events in this game are fantastic. My favorite was the Christmas one and I kept killing GM's. :)The flashiness of the weapons - yesss. I thought +10'ing my stuff made my character look absolutely beast. Heck, when I first hit 100, I walked around (like a boss) Elderine and Roumen with my +10's looking so fresh. (Then in a few seconds, I would be bombarded by, ""Buffplz,"" but who cares?)RIGHT. I WILL NOW BE GETTING DOWNVOTES, BECAUSE.... this didn't really feel like an actual review, more like an experience of my pain. Haha.TL;DR. I would never play this game again and would not recommend it - unless you like big grinds and people walking around in the opposite gender's character. ;)PS. THAT MOUNT DURATION STUFF WAS ABSOLUTELY MONEY-EATING.PPS. I downloaded this game on steam and sat there for 20 minutes, just to write a review.			"

												This is a bad game stay away!!!!!!! I'm veteran of this game been playing since almost the start, now its dead.                                (my hours are low because  I only added it to steam to comment)What made me do this review is gamigo the current company and staffAfter paying $400USD only for custom costume items which were promised in 2 monthsme and everyone else who ordered the items are still waiting its 5-6 months overdue. Some more points about the game bellow, but i recommend you don't try this game or quit if you still play things will only go down hill untill the servers close. - pay to win- pvp is based on cash shop items ( the more you spend the higher your stats)- pve is highly repititive ( almost no updates, new content comes every 1- 2 years)- low player base 100-200 people on the main servers rest of the servers are really dead.- need to pay money to be able to do raids/farm properly - bad graphics - no end game content  - grind heavy - bad staff- updates and deadlines constantly not kept - have to spend money each month to be able to play well 50$s+- no value for moneyJust stay away its not worth it.

												I honestly do not see the negatives about this game. Quirky graphic. A bit addicting fight animation and feel. It is fun and nice to play with friends. True it is pretty grindy, but what good is a game that's too easy. Yeah you can argue that it is pay to win. Who cares nowadays, nobody is really on anymore. Overall, if you are looking for a fun adventure check this game out, though you might have a bit of trouble if you install with steam.			"

												I started playing this game in 2009. It has cute graphics, and it's quiet fun! The sound tracks are also really nice to listen to. I personally think it's worth playing. Although I have to say that I do find that I stop playing it for long periods of time, but I always come back to it eventually. It was my first MMORPG and it is one of my favorite games! It's kind of sad to see that the community has dropped though, there are barely any people on the game anymore, hopefully that changes. It would be nice to see Fiesta Online be as lively as it was in 2009! ^^			"

												A F2P PLAYER'S REVIEW!Well nearly 2k hours into fiesta and still haven't decided to write something about it I figured I'd write one now, anyway, your probably wondering why I'm not recommending this game. Clearly 1.8k hours I SHOULD know something about fiesta and how it works. Well your in luck as I do, bare bones this game is extremely P2W and grindy as **** to the point that it just became to much. Now in some more detail about this game:Lets start with the bad parts of the game!-The cash shop:       Most MMORPGs usually have a cash shop which you buy stuff from and for me personally any cash shop that offers boosts to a player's stats things such as DMG,crit, crit rate, HP or whatever form of boost aren't exactly something I like unless it's from a event or obtainable via in game boss or dungeon run things of that nature that can give F2P players the same opportunities as P2W players and I do understand that companies must be profitable to maintain operations of a game however fiesta I feel just lets you download the game for free just to make a few hundreds or more off of you and make you work your *** off for close to nothing. Not only that but their cast shot is virtually stat boost that only last for 30 days at a time before you have to buy something to replace your old outfit.What's also kind of funny the cash shop can make a mage into a tank.-The community:Now this one is a little hard to put on the bad however there are a lot more bad apples then there is good ones when I first started playing this game I joined a guild abid it was a small guild with a good guild leader and members and they REALLY were the only people that kept me playing for as long as I did, however, a more big guild eventually absorbed our guild into it and I met a much larger community and that's when I realized how bad the community really is most of the level 100+ abid some aren't as bad as others but still it's bad most people I met seemed to be WAYY to power hungry and into PvP (Which is really broken due to the nature of the game) ill admit that being power hungry isn't a bad thing or being into PvP, however, one instance from the guild I was in one of the strongest players (We had 2-3 of the top players in our server) in our guild decided that instead of sharing loot which was distributed by how many runs you do which normally take about 2-3 hours to get done per run to keep the loot they got that did get our guild leader angry but decided to let them keep the loot because of the fear of losing one of our top players rather then keeping his word and promises to the other within our guild.For as long as I've been with this game I did noticed that newer player areas really don't have any life to it normally you wont see other players in Roumen (Newb town) or they'll be afk or something like that. Most people that are lower levels get power leveled by higher level players normally for free or they'll ask for gold in return for leveling (yes it's not against the TOS at least the power leveling part is not so much the asking for money part).-Events... This one is pretty short, Events in this game are practically nothing. Most events are done on forums which I can say just is lame because it gives the game a feel of nothing interesting is happening which is most part nothing IS happening. And when a event is out it's normally just something for Halloween or xmas that's really the only 2 events you are normally guaranteed to have. Most other events happen on blue moons or out of the blue.-The player marketAnother short one I'm getting tired of writing so ill try to keep everything from here on out short. The player market everything is really over priced even after I quit the prices of things only really just gone up and that's about it. It's a real problem.-ScammersNot that often you'll find people that would go out of their way to screw you over for money or whatever but a common scam in this game is gifting this game does let you gift cash shop items from other players sweet and all right? Wrong, as people normally know you need to spend money to be able to even gift (I don't know much about it as I never gifted or brought items from the cash shop) Scammers know this and would say something like give me the money first and ill gift you first or if they want to get something for free from a gifter they'll asked to be gifted first. There are other scams out there, however, that's the most common one other scams aren't done as much however that's the most common one out there.-THE GRINDOH GOD, Can I say this game becomes just to grindy to the point you have to do it for hours to just see 5% for level 105 at black bear repeat quest with a party of level 100-105 this game starts to get grindy at levels 61+ and slows and slows down a lot to the point it's not fun to play even with a group of high level players the grind becomes old pretty quick.The good of this game FINALLY!So here we are at the good things about fiesta good on you if you read this far into it.-The communityWhile this is in the bad part it also has it's good bits it really does if your able to find a guild or a group of players to play with regularly this game becomes VERYYY addictive because of how fun it can be to run a high level kingdom quest or do group repeat quests to level up.-It's about as classic of a MMORPG as you can getTitle says it all fiesta is for the most part the most classic of a MMORPG as you can get to at least as far as I know.                                           -The end-I know this review isn't a perfect one at all but I do hope it help you out a fair bit in not picking this game up.  my personal rating of this game it would have to be 3.3 out of 10.*I don't intend to rework this review anytime soon nor will I probably play this game again as it is WAY to p2w.

												There is nothing wrong with the game itself. The problems lie within 2 things.1. The creators of the game are money hungry. It is extremely hard to ignore this when every person you see around has +9/+10 gear. (These are the best enhancements for gear, which can only be obtained with either buying things from the store to stop your gear from breaking and increasing success rate, or you can try with a 95% chance for your gear to break otherwise.2. The community is basically dead. Most maps have only veterans or new players who have just started. Also, a lot of the community likes to scam you out of your money. You will come across the rare ""helpful player"" every so often though.So, let me enlighten you on something that will make this worth your time, and will cost you less (Or no) money.Private servers. Servers made by a community that cares about its players more than it's income, unlike Gamigo.Unfortunately, I am unable to name any off the top of my head, but there is a site with a top 100 for them, look it up.Now, these servers are more user friendly than the original server. Here is a list of things they do compared to the original.- Most cash shop items (If not all) can be bought with in-game cash instead of your credit card. -Exp is multiplied (ALL servers have different rates!! ) to prevent you from ""Requiring"" an exp x2 card from the shop. -Drop rates are higher, but usually not to the point where you get a drop every kill.-Money is easier to get, and items that are sold by other players are usually fairly priced, unless it is godike. (Max stats on it)-Server maintenance is usually weekly for most servers, usually fixing bugs and adding in custom items, bosses, and more.-Like I said above, custom content exists. Most servers will also accept user-made content, if that's your thing.-Some servers run purely on donations, others DO have a cash shop, but they usually only contain non-gamebreaking items.-Every server has a different feel and experience.-Much more.So really, the game is alright, but can be easily improved as shown by private servers.  If I were you, I'd skip the steam download and take the time to look one up, as It's well worth your time to try them out.Good luck, and I hope you take my advice.			"

												Avoid investing money into this game. The company Gaminggo is using poor tact to trick people into spending more money than they should, just to share cash-shop items with friends. In particular if you get married in game you get a pet, I tried doing this but got led on by Gaminggo. ""Get to level 30 to gift to others"" After reaching level 30 i then get told ""You haven't spent enough to gift to others"".If I had known this I wouldn't have spent 20$, just to be told to spend another 100$ more. mind you i'm canadian, $75 USD is alot in it's own, but nearly $112 canadian, just to gift 1 Item is completely complete idoicy. This game can be very enjoyable, given your friends dont die or stop playing because a year later you'll think they were online.(Month/Day time stamps)All in all, the game is good, but this gets a NOT RECOMMENDED due to the fact it's hosted by a theiving backstabbing company, oh and don't go whiteknighting saying ""Its a business tactic"" no, it's Lieing to your players!

												An mmo with a anime look to it. This game starts off pretty slow and leveling up is also pretty slow. You can increase the speed at which you level up by purchasing in game items for real money in the online store. The game is very grindy and can get boring after a while. If you are going in this game as a solo player it will get boring very fast. It is best to party up with some people or bring some of your real life friends to this game with you and you all can share the experience. It still does get boring after a while but not as fast as if you were playing this by yourself.I originally played this game when it first came out before it was ever on STEAM. I leveled a cleric up to level 90 over the course of off and on gameplay for about 2 years. If you want to level up to max level you would have to play at least an hour a day, every day and not mess around and go straight to questing and grinding. Doing that it would take you about a month maybe. IF you really try you can get max level in 2 weeks but you have to invest a lot of time in the game everyday.			"

												I've played this insane game for like 3-4 years while under ownership of outspark.It was a good game, if not for the buff beggars (people who are too damn lazy to do things on their own and have to demand or cry for buffs to go out and grind.  these are a rare occurance in other mmorpgs and i will not oblige these...creatures as a cleric.) and the whiners who just beg for money and sometimes insult you if you refuse them other than the demons of this mmorpg the game is ok.. if not dated by today's standards, from last i played i recall a slight graphical and map improvement.  the item mall is a little pay-y to win-y, but i can only sing the praises of the 7 day EXP card, lol			"

												Fiesta Online was my first forray into MMORPGs nearly a decade ago.  I have played Fiesta off and on since Closed Beta 2.  I have watched this game evolve over the years and can still reccommend it to players.  Fiesta Online is a great beginner MMORPG or for anyone wanting a casual online playing experience.  Leveling can be slower than newer online games, but consider this is a direct import from the Asian market.  Playerbase is talkative and friendly, which seems to be hard to find in newer games today.  I find many online games today I go through leveling and raids without any communication.  I find it refreshing that still, many years later, the community here is the same.  Many will find the game much more active at level 100+, unless you find a guild academy to join.  I would say the game appeared ""dead"" prior to server merges.  This is not the case anymore.  Isya server is usually at High Population every day.  Every free MMO must have a way to generate income.  I find it unfair that people spout ""pay-to-play"" when just about every free game, both PC and mobile games, offer microtransactions.  This model isn't going away, no use compaining about it.  With regards to Fieta Online's cash shop, I find the convienence items pretty expensive for the average person, thus not really aquirable enough to call them game breaking.  If the cash shop was truly game breaking, the game would have shut down years ago.  Give Fiesta Online a shot.  There are far worse MMORPG experiences out there and even more games that are just cash grab fads.  Fiesta Online has survived throughout the years.  That alone should say something about the quality of the game.			"

												I havent played this game for long but its already a fun experience, i already got a estate, the game was confusing at first but i slowly learned it, the marriage system is a little odd to have, i personally most likely will never use it but if you and a special someone play this game together you can get married in game to let everyone know of your love, i would and have recommended this game to my friends overall its got me at a soild 9/10, although the pay to win isnt all that fair this isnt the only game to do so, and yet no one not a single person complains about that in other mmos so why this one? i mean for real other mmos that are free to play charge money for areas or levels to stay strong but no one cares but this game everyone goes beserk over it, you dont need to pay to win unless you want to do pvp, which i personally dont do pvp at all.

This is certainly pay to win and towards the end of the game, pay to play (in a sense).

												You cannot rate this game poorly till you have reached level 90 to where you NEED to make this game a pay-to-win. Though this isn't the issue I'm faced with, it's just how irritating how imbalanced classes are. As a 100 sharpshooter you cannot kill a single enemy in pvp even though sharpshooter is made for pvp. We just get pwned by a mage who can 1 shot us or spam their magic blast, and gladiators who dash to you and somehow land the stun perfectly even though sharpshooters have the best evasion in the game. Also dex is broken, as an archer it's impossible to kite enemies without speed scrolls which cost a fortune if you're broke. And one last thing, at higher levels it's impossible to find a +11 bow/crossbow from venders as with archer sets. The game is supposed to get a rebalance, but that was said by gm's about 3 months ago. If you want to play this game I highly suggest to play an op class like Fighter, Mage or Cleric.			"

												Fiesta Online is a free-to-play MMORPG. Fairly standard stuff. The cartoonish graphics are easy on the eyes and the Lore is fairly rich. Most importantly, however, the community is fairly nice and it's easy to make friends here. While there are items that require cash to buy, there's no real pressure in the game to get them. If I were to recommend any MMORPG to someone, it would definitely be this one.However, Fiesta Online has one critical flaw: it is a time-draining, virtually-endless game. Do not play this game unless you are willing to sacrifice at least 4 hours a day, every day, for the rest of your life. The game is definitely easy to work with for the first ten levels, but the next ten are truly horrifying. Getting to level 20 in this game is incredibly difficult. It's not that the game is challenging; the hard part comes from forcing yourself to sit there and grind for the countless hours necessary to get out of the gloom that is the lv. 17-19 range. The game picks up after that, but only for so long. The cruel cycle continues to repeat itself. This game will eat your life.If you like the typical WoW-style MMORPG setup, then, sure, this game is great. However, ultimately, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone.			"

												This game.. Oh man, this game is so much fun! I do miss it when Outspark had it though.. To all you people saying this is a ""generic"" or ""typical"" is wrong. This game has so much creativity and so much stuff to do. You have 5 classes: Fighter, Mage, Archer, Trickster, and Crusader. All pretty self-explanatory. The graphics are good, the music is nice and peaceful, the community, I must admit, isn't THAT good, but I bet it'll get better.  Overall, Fiesta is a fun little game that you can play either with friends or alone, join Guilds and Academy's, make new friends, and just have fun. If you like Anime-style MMORPG's, this game is a MUST for you!			"

												Slight disappointment...Fiesta is a Free to Play ""Anime"" MMORPG, Anime being a loose term for the style of art used and not the actual feel of the gameplay itself.Graphics:  5/10The Graphic team that put this together probably put alot of effort into it, but the cocders who turned it into a game probably stripped away alot of what they did to make room for other functions... They should have put alot more into the visualstyle instead of leaving things bare-bones pastels. Not bad, but definitely not good... evenf or a Free-to-Play game.Audio:  3/10Like most MMORPGs the audio ranges of the game almost feel like they are bringing back the old 8-bit music ranges. Constant loops and single grunt dubs are all you have to look forward to. This combined with some other lack luster features convinced me to do an uninstall after reacching level 7.GamePlay: 1.5/10Like most other MOORPGs out there the variety of quests are limited to:1) Kill this for me2) Get this for me3) Do this for ""Yourself""Nothing really new here, but they way that the quests were set up could have been more creative without hacing to add any new features. Grinding gets boring fast, and having to use the rest function (which heals you at an agonizingly slow rate) shows you that you either have to be as patient as a Saint, or be willing to forrk over some cash for a game that isn't going to be getting much better.For the most part, this game was everything I hope to not find in an MMORPg of any caliber, but one thing that did please me was the ""Free Stat"" system which most RPG players are happy to see. The ability to choose where your stat point go into is always a nice thing :3So unless you have the patience to lug through a fairly clumsy battle system and agonizingly slow walking speed, you might want to look into play some other MMORPG. You've been warned.			"

As an interface designer and I've worked with many POS programmers and SQL databases I am just puzzled because I've seen horrible interfaces and horrible databases but this game/site takes the cake on what not to do! I registered with two different email address and now I have them already sending me tons of junk mail just 2 minutes after I registered for the game. ugh!!!

												Fiesta Online NA is a free to play MMORPG that started in 2007.  It worked, sounded ok, looked ok, played ok, was understandable.  Had some sort of tutorial help pages. Has anime styled world and characters with cel shaded graphics and cute stuff. IMHO, a terrible starting character experience. Having started an Archer, i had no money, no gear,  having no starter bow and no starter archer skills. Skills cost copper money.  Found a several quests to attack i guess begginning critters using hand attacks. 2 had rewards for hat and boots.  Looking in the steam forum and negative review saying this game is highly Pay to win.   I didn't like this game, try it if you want to pay real money to win.For more info:

												Great MMO. Game play is good. Places to play have some pieces of code that seem to not displayed correctly no matter how much it gets patched. E.G. grass and other plants flooting  in mid air, monsters that walk or run up walls, warp gates turned sideways so much that they are almost impossible to see. All in all its still a good game but its new owners needs to play it to see all things a lot of players has sent in, asking for them to be fixed.			"

												I am recommending this game based on pure nostalgia. After almost 3 years of playing this game, I downloaded it on Steam. I wish I could see the amount of hours I spent in this game over the years... or do I? Let's be real, there are innumberable amounts of far surperior MMOs. But this one will forever hold a place in my heart. If you have some time to kill, then grab some buds and mess around on this game for a bit.			"

												Where to start. Firstly I guess all in all, if you have an addictive personality, love to spend money, love to be the best there is after a very short amount of time, then this is your type of game. Now if you want to want to know what makes Fiesta the worst MMO around, continue browsing. It needs to be noted down that this is in no way a free-to-play game, despite what some advertisements may suggest. This is by far, the epitomy of not just micro-transactions, but pay-to-win or uninstall before your account goes dry. With that being said, you can spend on average $50 a month alone just on costumes, accessaries, cosmetics, useful power-ups such as extenders/charms etc, and that's not including the amount you need to actually get good gears, enhance them, have in-game money for pots/stones/scrolls, and then include the amount of money you'll end up spending on trying to get a skin for your shield or weapon to look and be as strong as everyone else. But the strongest players, myself included at one point, were spending over $200-300 a month just on one game to keep up appearances, raid daily, PvP daily, and continuously get better gears. Most of the systems involved in-game are currently broken, including levelling, enhancing gears/weapons, farming for gears/weapons, and the community itself is just as appalling. It took a slow tumble from 2010 and onwards, down further to what most people could refer to as, ELO Hell in League. Spammers, scammers, ♥♥♥♥♥ and prats are loose from everyone to converse with, and the amount of times a person can get catfished in one game alone, well this would definitely be situated for the award ceremonies. As most people have stated, the game used to be good, had a very friendly and on-going community, it still had it's problems, especially at higher levels within specific guilds, but hey, what game doesn't.

												I have been an on and off player dating back since 2008. I, personally, lost interest several times but every single time I did quit; I came crawling right back. The game is not the same, SURE, but there are stilla  lot of good qualities. The server merge happened and the servers are healthy and active (ESPECIALLY ISYA). I recommend ISYA if you do rejoin. HOWEVER....ONSONSOFT just sold Gamigo the entire rights to gamigo themselves...meaning we can finally spread our wings. I think they are going to do a great job...as they have and it has been a month so far. OOS was a major restriction when it came to the game. Cross your fingers :)!			"

The only benefit spending real money can give you is for pvp.That character models are adorableThe scenery is cutethe people are amazing Now, for all the veteran players that left because of the server merge or the greek-like economy. there is hope friends.I started a brand new account on the NEW server Enid, there is an economy, slowly growing. it's not over priced, the people are some of the nicest i have ever seen and honestly, im just enjoying my time on this game now.

												I have played this game a lot. i currently have 192 hours mostly on my archer level 76. This game has really good combat in my opinion because the skills and healing with sp/mana hp/sp pots and stones is really fun and different from most games of the genre. It has a really good core idea with lots of little funny and odd anime stories but i have more complaints then things I like.       I said that I really like the combat which in a very grindy game is a must need. You dont have a million abilities but you have enough to keep you interested. I like that the balance is really good because there are a lot of buffs you can do to your character. You more often then not will have scrolls or potions on that increase your stats tiers 1-5 that can all be created through crafting and receiving from quests. The stat system is very normal and well made. The game has lots of different cool thins like your mini house. You reviece a mini house that over time restores your hp and sp over time from sitting in this mushroom that you can change the look of the higher levels you reach. Now on to the bad things.       This game has a decent structure I think with a few personal things gamigo has come up with with cool buff systems and healing items to keep you in battle. But there are a few things that make this game absolutely atrocious at times. I am not sure what level it starts happening at (around level 50 I think) when you die you loose hard earned xp. Ok this seems ok sure you die and you loose like 5% of your base xp FINE. But this game was made so that when you level up you get a certain amount of quests for the next level and if you die to many times durring that level you are suck having to grind or do ""repeat quests"" which are quests that give next to no xp which are very grindy and take forever to do just so you can get the last 10% of your xp bar to level up and get a new set of quests to go grind more mobs. They try to cover up the flaw by giving you the ""repeat quests"". Another thing is the economy... THERE IS NO SUCH THING because the way you can sell items to other players is by setting up a mini house and selling your items in a stationary spot which means if you wanna sell things you have to be online. And instead of playing while your online which the makes should be emphasizing you sometimes just have to get on and go afk all day to make money.        If gamigo would just let as keep our xp when we die and come up with an auction house or somethign like world of warcraft then you would be afloat i think. "

												I have sunk a few years into this game. I originally had it before it came out on Steam, and the only reason I got it through steam was because I stopped playing and uninstalled it at one point. It was originally owned by a company called Outspark, and it hasn't changed all that much since it switched over to Gamigo. Mostly skin changes for monsters and the starter town.. oh and maybe some NPCs. In terms of classes, it doesnt really matter what you pick since all the quests are the same. There is no story line whatsoever. There are seasonal events, and the premium item store holds some goodies if you are willing to spend real cash in order to get store currency. It has been said that FO has become a pay to win game, but as long as you're willing to put in the hours, it is possible to reach cap without premium items. I dont suggest battlefields, pvp dungeons or PVP kingdom quests without premium items... which I guess proves the pay to win section.The enhancement system is also a lot harder if you dont use premium items, and even though enhancement offers some perks, and makes your gear prettier... it is still possible to play without, or you can always farm/sell for in game currency and hope to buy off another player. Players stores can be ridiculously priced though.. unfortunately people dont really offer an item for what it's really worth and tend to overprice useless gear. Be mindful of your class and stats before buying from other players, and really consider whether it is actually worth the price.It has its pros and cons like any game, but if you're into things like this then by all means give it a go. It's not so bad, as long as you're willing to sink hours into it. (Though... if memory serves... since I havent started a new character in a very long time... you can get to level 30 within a couple hours) "

												I agree with the review that said that the only people who still play this are really casual players that don't give a crap about 'omg best evur' stuff, or older players who have sunk too much time and money into it to let go. I used to play this game a lot, then I left for a while and everything seemed horrible when I came back and it was horrible. VERY play-to-win, very party-reliant; its a good mmo to start out with but when you realize its really crappy, its probably time to move on to bigger and better things.			"

												So Horrible!!! At first it was OK with the Tutorial, but when I started a real quest it screwed up back. I tried auto-walking to the NPC and it took me to another area, to a specific portal, where I would stop walking. I then tried auto-walk to NPC from there and it took me in a circle through another portal and back to the first one. After about 4 or 5 times of that. one of the portals I went through, I tried to just manually walk away from the portal and after so mnay seconds it set me back at that portal. It continued to do so every time I walked away from it. How am I supoosed to do a quest with glitches like that?Terribley pathetic!!!!!!!! You know what else I noticed? When installed it has this certain game security program installed to run while the game is on. Can't remember the name but stats with X then about 4 more letters. That same security program, I have seen installed with quite a few games I tried has caused a problem for every one of them I played. Usually it just shuts down the game after some message about another program being a security issue. I shuts them down after about a minute or so when I first open the games.			"

This is kinda bullcrap. Graphics ain't as good.However, it still has LOTS of room for improvement. I'll definitely come back to this game when it gets better :)			"

												SOOOO MUUUUUUCHHHH FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!I'm sorry, that's not a good review. This game is an absolutely fantastic anime-style MMORPG (except for when the autofind doesn't work, but that's just me being lazy) with D&D like elements. It IS so much fun though. However, for those who can't play often, you might get bored of it quickly. Also, the graphics are not QUITE up to snuff. If you're a graphics snob, try Aura Kingdom. You'll get more out of it. Also, if you're a stickler for class choices and such and more deep story, go for Aura Kingdom.			"

												Fun game a long time ago when it had first started it's open beta which was i think 5-6 years ago.  Noobs were running around, the community was great, and there were plenty of kingdom quests (essentially raid type events that you would queue for every hour or two) that filled up pretty fast.  I've logged into the game recently and saw that the game was pretty much empty, everyone on my friends list has moved on and worst of all, kingdom quests were no more because they relied on a booming community.  It's sad to see a game like this die because it was the first mmo i've ever played, but unfortunately it is a dead game.  :[			"

The quality of the game is good, there is alot of weps., armor, mounts, quest, ect. that ues can earn and you can buy stuff too!(THIS IS NOT A P-T-W GAME)(Btw P-T-W stands for pay to win, but there is no end XD)Lots of nice people and the mobs are not hard UNLESS its the mob riot witch means dragons, ice beast, land killers and more powerful stuff spawn BUT THATS EVEN MORE FUN!!! :D There is movment stuff to like sitting, walking, DANCING, waving, emotions, ect.What im saying is GET THIS GAME!!!!11!!1!!one11!!!!

												As a game that completely ruled my child hood i can say without a doubt this game is a masterpiece. While mmos may be a dying breed the Fiesta community continues to put into the game they love. Yes, the game could use a graphics update but the core gameplay and welcoming community is what has kept me coming back to the game since 2009. If you havent tried it it's free to play so give it a  shot, and most importantly dont be discouraged if there isnt anyone in Rumen (first city) they are probably just vendor camping in uruga.

												I've played Fiesta for a few years now, and I just want to clarify some things up.Fiesta has changed drastically over the years since I've joined the community, and I'm pretty well adjusted to it. It is not a pay to win game, it is only pay to win if you choose to pay to win. The only useful things you can buy that actually help combat wise and gameplay is enhancement bundles, so your item doesn't break when you want to upgrade it. Fashion gives you slight crit buffs or hp etc. and it's not that effective unless you have a lot, either way you don't need to pay to get these kinds of buffs. Just build your character right, and you have a pretty easy going time.[Fighters] usually build END, and STR. Me personally, I build STR and DEX for damage and so I don't miss and have much more evasion when I fight.[Archers] build DEX, SPR, and sometimes END depending on what kind of gameplay you would like, like if you wanted to AoE, you would need a bit more END.[Clerics] build full END, or END, SPR, and STR (sometimes). Clerics are the tankiest class in the game, but you also build SPR for more mana so you don't just kill it with a set of buffs.[Mages] build INT and SPR. INT for magic damage (I usually go full INT), and SPR for more mana and crits.[Tricksters] build STR, SPR, and DEX. Tricksters have the fastest attack speed and the highest crit chance, evasion, and hit chance. I mained a trickster for a while before switching to Fighter.[Crusaders] I have yet to experience. I'm sure they build STR and END. I've seen some crusaders that build tanky and others that build pure damage and destroy everything. Though you need a level 60+ character in order to make a Crusader.But yeah in conclusion, I would give this game a try. It's pretty fun, just takes some time to get used to some stuff. There are even vaults you get every so levels that help your experience, whether it be from fashion to mounts, from resting houses to weapons. They reward you for leveling up. Plus if you're running out of money, you could join an academy and every level from 10-60, you'll get money and item rewards for leveling up. I'd give it a try.			"

												I'm not sure if it is just because I got used to newer MMO's, but this game basically gives you not much in terms of knowledge about what you are supposed to do. It's really outdated in the ways it could present material (like pls, just put quest objectives to the side, that way you can glance). It's cute and colourful, but I feel like it's just... lacking.

												Summary: Fiesta is an anime-themed massively multiplayer online (MMO) game that emphasizes group play. It is simple enough for ten-year-olds, but a few annoying bugs and a very grindy lategame may discourage you after many hours of play. It is free, and buying in-game items can help speed you along without breaking the game.Positives:1. Fiesta is simple as MMOs go: you don't so much *win* the game, but you gain levels by earning EXP from completing quests. Quests mostly require killing monsters, collecting drops from monsters, or gathering items in the wilderness. The quests and overarching storyline are text-based and perhaps tangential to the game itself; there is virtually no real ""roleplaying"" of your character. Don't let the anime feel fool you: you spend the bulk of your active gaming time looking for monster spawn points and exterminating them.2. If dressing up your character in funny and cute cosmetic items is a draw for you, you will be pleasantly surprised at the wide variety of available costumes, hats, ears, pets, and mounts you can (rarely) earn or buy in the real-money store. Most cosmetics give a mild buff, such as increased critical hits or more EXP, and some can be earned by leveling, playing games of chance in the Lucky House, or completing timed rewards during in-game events.  You can run around in a t-shirt, butterfly wings and rainbow tube socks while fighting the bad guys, and still have all your gear equipped and active. Even a free-to-player can earn about 15 specific cosmetics by the time a character reaches level 66.3. A handful of typical classes provides some variety, but you only acquire perhaps 10-20 skills unique to each class, so there isn't the deep customization you would find in action RPGs like Diablo or World of Warcraft. That said, you can spend skill points on your favorite skills to make them more powerful, cheaper to cast, or to refresh their cooldowns faster. You also get stat points to increase the raw abilities of your character also.4. Fiesta boasts one one of the few truly female-friendly gaming communities. Also, the gender of your character can be chosen on creation regardless of class and without effect on your character's stats. Also, if you're a parent of a potential user, Fiesta has virtually no content that is inappropriate for preteens; only the chatter of the other players need be monitored. There is also no way in-game to purchase real-money content; the store is on a separate, secure website.Negatives:1. Fiesta needs to address a few bugs that cause the game to crash repeatedly, usually caused by switching areas or standing around in populated areas. This is causing the existing community to slowly leave, however the most popular server (Bijou as of this writing) still enjoys a large population. If you want to play alone or just with some close friends, you can choose one of the other servers and not be bothered much by chat spammers or other annoyances.2. No Steam overlay for a Steam game.  No Steam Guard for a Steam game; it still utilizes a third-party anti-malware software (X-Trap). You can't use Steam Wallet Funds to buy Slime Coins, the currency used by the parent company, Gamigo (at least that I can find). Steam does little more than hold the shortcut for you, much like a non-Steam game you've added to your library. So what's the advantage of being a Steam game...?3. Some of the crafting skills (i.e. making potions and scrolls) require you to spend hours of real time crafting many more items than you will ever need or sell. It's something you can have the game running in the background while you do other tasks, but it is kind of a pain.4. On one hand, the game is growing: some low-level maps have had graphical updates, and the level cap has increased to 125 replete with new areas, quests, and items to find.  On the other hand, the North American servers are slowly depopulating, just because there are so many other games out there to play, and that the patches (and bugfixes!) of new content are coming too slowly. If you can find friendly players and join a Guild Academy, you are more likely to stick with playing longer. But playing solo is a real grind (even for me, and I'm used to grinding solo).Free Advice:1. You will level MUCH slower if you ignore the quests and just find a place to grind.  Until level 30 you can play as you wish, but in later levels, most of your EXP will come from completing repeated quests, not from defeating the monsters required by the quests.  That said, I hope you like grinding, because in the mid-game (say your level is in the 60s) a typical quest may require you to kill 40 of a monster for 4% of your required EXP to gain a level, and a repeatable quest will require 120 of a monster to earn 7% of the required EXP.2. Save your skill points until you have played the character for a few hours and have become comfortable with your hot-keyed skills. You cannot unspend the skill points unless you spend real money to do so. Maxing out the power and maxing out reduced cooldown time of your main attack skills is common.3. As far as your stat points, most players maximize their character's Strength in order to increase damage, unless you are a Wizard (max INT instead). Depending how you play your character, however, you may put a few points in SPR (to have some more SP and to crit more often), and perhaps a bunch in END (for extra health when you intend to get hit a lot).4. You can earn a lot of random cosmetic items by participating in month-long Attendance Events. By logging on for one hour a day per character, that character can earn a reward of 1-3 cosmetic items per week, as well as another reward for earning attendance for at least 21 of the 28-day event. Stash these items, then use them when you're bored or when you plan to do a lot of leveling!			"

Tried to login to the game... try different username/password. Logged into the registration website no problem. Tried to plug that same username/password for the game itself... nope, same error. Reset password... successful login. How silly. I changed the screen resolution in game back to something normal. One of the first things the game wants you to do is purchase gear and a weapon from the black smith (yes they have it as two words, black smith.) I purchased weapon, but then can't purchase or click on any gear except one item that is for a different class that I can't even use. I think there have been enough problems in the first 5 minutes that I don't need to bother wasting any more time with this game. What a piece of crap. lol			"

												I remember when this game used to be extremely fun in the 09-10 era. A lot of friendly people who weren't always selfish or shy were everywhere, and really entertaining soundtracks would always set the mood when seeing people fight monsters, but now it's a really depressing game. Unless you have played games that are similar to Fiesta ( like Rift, Warcraft, Eldevin, etc.) you are going to be bored and the atmosphere of the game may ruin your fun. I don't even think it's going to be fun if you have friends playing WITH you. Overall, I wouldnt recommend it, unless the game gets a major re-work to when it honestly wasn't Pay-To-♥♥♥♥ing-Win. (Note: I played this game on the client in 2009 before the game was handed over to Gamigo [When i realized the game's fun dropped dramatically] and logged on about 100 hours, so if anyone has any questions or does not feel like i have the experience in this game to write a review, I just wanted to let you know I did spend a lot of time playing the game. Man i loved the Clerics.)			"

												As I've been a long-time player of this MMO (since 2009), in my advice, I wouldn't recommend it still. Yes, there'll be times where I'll go back to it, maybe I wouldn't if I hadn't wasted so much time leveling up my characters to 95 more than six times... Anyways, in my opinion, the community here is great-the gameplay? Not so much. It's tedious, boring, way too repetitive. CP & SEG grinds? God awful unless you have a party of your own to play with. Soloing can be okay in some MMOs, just wouldn't really recommend doing it on this one-unless you're farming something, of course. Now when I say I've had to level my characters more than six times, I mean I've had to go through two other accounts. Two in which were IP banned by when the game was owned by Outspark. Which told me that I owed payments to Fiesta and then withdrew money from one of my cards without validation. In terms, caused a huge lawsuit in which my people tried to sue Outspark and won-although my money was returned, my account was still banned and deleted. Contacting support gave me a comply of ""We'll look into this,"" and then that was the end of it. Even so, I returned to the game after hearing the companies switch to Gamigo to give it a try again. And as I have said before, unless you're looking for a good community-I don't have much good to say about the gameplay. You surely don't have to drain your money into the game to become OP, but it is a faster opportunity that people often take and then becomes quite addicting when you do. For awhile, I've lived off of farming and cringing every time one of my blues broke because of the luck percentage for enchanting. Which is why people prefer to spend tons of money going down the easy way to enchanting or powering up anywho. Anyways, Fiesta is a disappointing ex-boyfriend I keep coming back to regardless of the **** I say about it.			"

												To the developers, the launcher UI is broken, I would recomend allowing it to be optionally compatible with steam play and the VCredlist startup procedure rather than an external launcher to fix errors. I know the game is good because I played it before off your website but when on steampowered there is multiple errors to manually hammer out. So changing the launcher would be optimal, until then I can't recommend this because I can't even launch it.			"

												This is a very great game, the only downside is that the best thing about this game is now almost gone. The community used to be so alive and friendly but now barely anyone plays it anymore... I recommend this game if you play with friends. I don't if you play on your own since it'll get boring very quickly especially if you are playing a support class considering the community and parties are very rare and hard to find			"

												So it's been years since I've played Fiesta and I gotta say that I like what I see about the changes that have been made. Although the player base is low it is still fun to play especially with friends. From what I've heard Gamingo is going to do a server merge in a month or two, this is a good move because now a lot a players will be able to play with each other and spread the word about this awesome game. As you can see I have been playing this game a lot and I mean A LOT! With the server merge and more advertising, this MMO will be restored to glory.			"

												This game is free for a reason. Downloaded game and registered to play. When launching the game, it changed entire Windows screen resolution settings to 1200 x 800 or something terrible. Tried to login to the game... try different username/password. Logged into the registration website no problem. Tried to plug that same username/password for the game itself... nope, same error. Reset password... successful login. How silly. I changed the screen resolution in game back to something normal. One of the first things the game wants you to do is purchase gear and a weapon from the black smith (yes they have it as two words, black smith.) I purchased weapon, but then can't purchase or click on any gear except one item that is for a different class that I can't even use. I think there have been enough problems in the first 5 minutes that I don't need to bother wasting any more time with this game. What a piece of crap. lol			"

												I played this game once upon a time when it was just starting out 8 years ago, but for various reasons (mainly I got bored after a few months) I stopped playing. I come back and find it in the Steam store all these years later. I also find out my old login didn't work so I have to start again. I currently play a ranger on the Apeline server and joined  a guild academy called A_Forgotten_Past, with a few nice guild members to help me get started again. Some things I remember, but a lot has been improved since I've been gone, and it reminds me of a saying I used to describe it by: ""It's like WoW, but a lot more colorful!"" If you feel like trying something like WoW out but don't want to pay a monthly fee, this might be a good game to try out!			"

												Summary: Fiesta is an anime-themed massively multiplayer online (MMO) game that emphasizes group play. It is simple enough for ten-year-olds, but a few annoying bugs and a very grindy lategame may discourage you after many hours of play. It is free, and buying in-game items can help speed you along without breaking the game.Positives:1. Fiesta is simple as MMOs go: you don't so much *win* the game, but you gain levels by earning EXP from completing quests. Quests mostly require killing monsters, collecting drops from monsters, or gathering items in the wilderness. The quests and overarching storyline are text-based and perhaps tangential to the game itself; there is virtually no real ""roleplaying"" of your character. Don't let the anime feel fool you: you spend the bulk of your active gaming time looking for monster spawn points and exterminating them.2. If dressing up your character in funny and cute cosmetic items is a draw for you, you will be pleasantly surprised at the wide variety of available costumes, hats, ears, pets, and mounts you can (rarely) earn or buy in the real-money store. Most cosmetics give a mild buff, such as increased critical hits or more EXP, and some can be earned by leveling, playing games of chance in the Lucky House, or completing timed rewards during in-game events.  You can run around in a t-shirt, butterfly wings and rainbow tube socks while fighting the bad guys, and still have all your gear equipped and active. Even a free-to-player can earn about 15 specific cosmetics by the time a character reaches level 66.3. A handful of typical classes provides some variety, but you only acquire perhaps 10-20 skills unique to each class, so there isn't the deep customization you would find in action RPGs like Diablo or World of Warcraft. That said, you can spend skill points on your favorite skills to make them more powerful, cheaper to cast, or to refresh their cooldowns faster. You also get stat points to increase the raw abilities of your character also.4. Fiesta boasts one one of the few truly female-friendly gaming communities. Also, the gender of your character can be chosen on creation regardless of class and without effect on your character's stats. Also, if you're a parent of a potential user, Fiesta has virtually no content that is inappropriate for preteens; only the chatter of the other players need be monitored. There is also no way in-game to purchase real-money content; the store is on a separate, secure website.Negatives:1. Fiesta needs to address a few bugs that cause the game to crash repeatedly, usually caused by switching areas or standing around in populated areas. This is causing the existing community to slowly leave, however the most popular server (Bijou as of this writing) still enjoys a large population. If you want to play alone or just with some close friends, you can choose one of the other servers and not be bothered much by chat spammers or other annoyances.2. No Steam overlay for a Steam game.  No Steam Guard for a Steam game; it still utilizes a third-party anti-malware software (X-Trap). You can't use Steam Wallet Funds to buy Slime Coins, the currency used by the parent company, Gamigo (at least that I can find). Steam does little more than hold the shortcut for you, much like a non-Steam game you've added to your library. So what's the advantage of being a Steam game...?3. Some of the crafting skills (i.e. making potions and scrolls) require you to spend hours of real time crafting many more items than you will ever need or sell. It's something you can have the game running in the background while you do other tasks, but it is kind of a pain.4. On one hand, the game is growing: some low-level maps have had graphical updates, and the level cap has increased to 125 replete with new areas, quests, and items to find.  On the other hand, the North American servers are slowly depopulating, just because there are so many other games out there to play, and that the patches (and bugfixes!) of new content are coming too slowly. If you can find friendly players and join a Guild Academy, you are more likely to stick with playing longer. But playing solo is a real grind (even for me, and I'm used to grinding solo).Free Advice:1. You will level MUCH slower if you ignore the quests and just find a place to grind.  Until level 30 you can play as you wish, but in later levels, most of your EXP will come from completing repeated quests, not from defeating the monsters required by the quests.  That said, I hope you like grinding, because in the mid-game (say your level is in the 60s) a typical quest may require you to kill 40 of a monster for 4% of your required EXP to gain a level, and a repeatable quest will require 120 of a monster to earn 7% of the required EXP.2. Save your skill points until you have played the character for a few hours and have become comfortable with your hot-keyed skills. You cannot unspend the skill points unless you spend real money to do so. Maxing out the power and maxing out reduced cooldown time of your main attack skills is common.3. As far as your stat points, most players maximize their character's Strength in order to increase damage, unless you are a Wizard (max INT instead). Depending how you play your character, however, you may put a few points in SPR (to have some more SP and to crit more often), and perhaps a bunch in END (for extra health when you intend to get hit a lot).4. You can earn a lot of random cosmetic items by participating in month-long Attendance Events. By logging on for one hour a day per character, that character can earn a reward of 1-3 cosmetic items per week, as well as another reward for earning attendance for at least 21 of the 28-day event. Stash these items, then use them when you're bored or when you plan to do a lot of leveling!			"

												I used to play this game hours on end. Unfortunately, when i came back, the community was dead, there were no players anywhere apart from the few newbies wandering through the starting area hoping to find a good game. I would only recommend this if you like grinding hours on end and spamming repeats to level through most of the game as well as completing raids with only a few party members and in most circumstances, by yourself.

												I read another review here that said that this game is recommended to those who are just starting to play mmorpgs. I completely agree. Fiesta was one of the first mmorpgs I've ever played and somehow, I still love it (even with all the repetiveness and grinding). Why? The community is nice (which I find very assuring when you're just a starter, so this is the big concept I want to point out to beginners). People will always help you when you're least expecting it; whether it be a random buff from a cleric or people asking if you need help in your guild -you can always rely on the community. I might be naive saying this, but I've played other mmorpgs to some extent as well, and at some point they all have their repetiveness, so as far as the gameplay goes... what's so bad? The skills have increasing levels that you unlock as you level up, and skills that you eventually come to gain. You don't come equipped with all your skills and for me, I found that such an exciting experience when I first started playing. [If anyone else has played Vindictus then I would like to compare: you do get skills along the way, and can level them up to some degree, but unless you're not into the whole paladin/dark knight thing then there's no other skills] I always looked forward to getting new skills in Fiesta and still do (because I haven't reached the level cap yet since I've taken such a long time off this game, but I still come back to it).Now if you don't like grinding or P2W then sorry; this is definitely NOT the game for you if you plan on playing it for a while. This is the reason I've taken long breaks and the only reason.Overall, I definitely recommend this games to starters of the mmorpg worlds. Even so, I still recommend this game to experienced mmorpg players as well. This game goes back to the classics. Classes of Fighter, Mage, Cleric, and Archer can never let you down. To add, the developers have even added Trickster, and Crusader to those who want a little variety. note* Crusader becomes availible at level 60. I always seem to come back to this game even if it is repetitive because I miss it, and I think others who have reviewed have the same feelings. It's a relaxing game that has cute sprites and reliable gameplay. I think that's all from me ^^			"

												This was my first MMO. I started it when I was 10 and played it for about a year and a half. In that time I met many good friends. Some of which I still speak to today. The game provided a very fun outlet for me for a little over 900 hours. I played this before it was on steam though. So my hours aren't necessarily shown here. I played when the game was owned by Outspark. The community is really nice and helpful and the game has good progression, good dungeons to crawl with other players. Though I'm not sure how populated the game is now. Overall very fun if you find a few friends to play it with or make friends along the way. Im recommending this from biased nostalgia. Because it was fun and I enjoyed it. I would most likely still be playing it if I could figure out what happened to my account after they switched owners and websites. PS. The nostalgia factor with this game is strong. I miss a ton of my old friends that I lost when I lost my account. Most notably DarkArcher97.EDIT: I just realized they now paywalled a lot of things ingame :/. Not cool. Changing my recommendation because of this. Why must devs try to suck cash out of everything?!?!			"

												Game is very pay2win and grindy after you get to a certain level. Spamming repeats and saving quests for levels with no repeats is the only way to level after a while. But there's more than just spamming repeats. There are Kingdom Quests, where you join other similar leveled people to beat the boss...or survive for a period of time.  The Kingdom quests and the anime style are the two reasons I keep coming back. The population isn't very high, but there is a server merge going on, so that might fix things like people buying instance runs. The economy is also very broken. Things that used to cost like 80g now cost gems because the server is being flooded with money with no good gold sink. Even with all the problems with this game, I still recommend it. I still enjoy playing and interacting with the community in game.Edit: As much as I liked this game, even I have to admit that Fiesta is dead at this point. I've seen some things...like people being paid small amounts to just make a Fiesta account. I've moved on, and so should other people who play this game, or are thinking about playing this game.			"

												You can try to play this game, but it will disconnect you and you won't be able to log back in. The ""Connection to servers has failed"" pop up will stop you from enjoying this game. Gamigo hasn't a clue on what to do with this issue and no one knows what to do as it is a pursisting problem for years.			"
