												This game is beautifully made, voice overs are great, quests, loot, crafting.  But what is at the heart of every game like this, combat.  Now I will say, combat in itself is just as well done as the rest of the game.  However, someone on the dev team needs to understand the importance of mob spawning and placement. For me this is where the game literally falls apart.   there is almost no space to manuver in this game as it is, then add the mob spawn logic.  Take two steps and mobs spawn in around you in a circle and attack, This is a game where tactics do not exist, its simplhy a matter of stepping forward, getting encircled with spiders, taking boat loads of un dodgeable damange and spamming pots, lots and lots of pots.I find in annoying enough to stop playing even though the rest of the game is literallh a masterpiece.  All I can ask is that as you redesign and update your game for the re-release, try to create a more fluid combat dance between the player and the mobs.  Dont rely on cheap spawning tactics to create articfically difficulty.There is also an abundency of console type boss fights, tiny little rooms, no where to move, lighting fast bosses that do tons of damage.  There is no pacing to these events they are just pot swigging marathons, or as suggested in the loading tips, over level your character and go back to fight bosses.Unfortunantely I will have to give this game a thumbs down.  I am the owner of just about every top down Diable style game available on steams, literally dozens and there is somthing magical about a game when they can get mob spawning, combat fighting spaces, mob and player speeds, functional CC down riight.  I just dont think this game has that criticall component.  What a shame.			"

												Updated Note: The developers seem to have the rights to the IP now and by all accounts are working on getting the second half of the game!When it comes to ARPGs, Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms travels down the road less traveled, managing to not only deviate from what has become a tired and overused model but to do so with style. ARPGs very rarely have a captivating story but I found Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms to be an exception, that's not to say it's as good a story as found in story-driven games, but it does it's job well and draws you in. Add in exceptional voice acting and great aesthetics and you have a game with a lot of good components working together. I found myself quite immersed with this game and had more urge to play through this game start to finish than any other ARPG since the Mass Effect trilogy.That's not to say this game is flawless, it does have it's problems but I found that the pros far outweighed the cons. I had some crashing issues on a single map, I found the developers use of foreshadowing was a bit heavy-handed at times, and the game started off a bit slow due to the nature of how combat works. The game does start out with a fair amount of story telling,  but once you get through that you are left to delve into the combat with a fledgling group. Combat revolves around the demon you play, who can bind the souls of deceased beings, making them a part  of your party. At the beginning of the game you have just the demon and the main hero in your ""party."" You only control one party member at a time, but each party member is unique and brings something different to the table, this is a very interesting dynamic that makes combat a lot of fun...when you actually have a full party to choose from. Fortunately after a few hours of play you should have a full team and from there on out combat is generally well paced and far more fun to play. There is a party limit of four, but you can always travel to your home base and change the roster. During combat you can switch to any of the active party members. I found this to add a lot to the combat, you can change the unit you are playing on based on situational factors and also rotate characters based on their spells cooldowns. I thoroughly enjoyed the combat once I had a full party. Individual spells might not  be the most exciting but the fact you can switch characters at any point more than makes up for it.All in all, I really enjoyed the experience in Book 1. I was definitely eating this game up and was only putting it down to play co-op games with friends. The story was a lot of fun to follow throughout and I enjoyed going through most of the dialog, I didn't even skip over the voice acting by and large (just about all dialog is accompanied by voice acting). The combat was equally enjoyable once I got into the core of the game. Add the two elements together along with everything else the game does great and you have the exceptional game that is Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms (Book I). I'm definitely keeping my fingers crossed that Book II sees the light of day, it would be a shame for the series die after such a strong start.P.S. The game has an awesome orchestral soundtrack, here is a sample:

												I  have played this game for four hours at this point and am unsure whether to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down. This may be a product of not playing the game enough but in most games I play, by 4 hours you usually know where the game is going. So this is what I know so far and what I believe people will find useful if they are looking at buying this game. I bought this game because I wanted to try another arpg that marketed itself as being different from the usual model. This game does that. It is story driven and has characters that very much have their own flare and personalities. The voice acting is very good and the dialogue always feels important and interesting.  However, I feel that even a story driven game should have fun and interesting combat, or at least cool combat animations. In this game I never found myself saying ""Holy (explicative) that was awesome"" or ""This move is fricking amazing"". Instead I found myself mumbling ""ok, this a stun/aoe"" and ""Im not sure why I even picked up this second skill"". I tried using both the archer and the barbarian and although the archer seemed a little bit more versatile, the abilities used still seemed lack luster. And maybe this was by design in an effort to make a more grounded game. But in my defense I bought a game where you play as a soul devouring demon who controls/ binds with souls of fallen heroes, and that just sounded a lot more awesome than it turned out to be combat wise. Im choosing to leave out anything dealing with bugs and technical issues because the developers do seem to care whether or not the game runs well and have taken the time to roll out a few updates. For that reason I wont judge the game based on how many times it crashes. But I will say this, when a game comes out of early access, beta, or whatever testing phases it uses and is marketed as a finished game, it should be finished. It shouldn't be released with known crashes or unfinished graphical features (like  vsync). With that said the game is under 35 and should get a little slack for technical issues. For me personally it's the combat that kills this game. I plan on finishing the game after the crashes get fixed because I spent money on the game and because it does have a really interesting story line. But if I had known now what it plays like then I woulnt have spent more than $10 on it. So in conclusion, if you dont care too much about combat or gameplay and mostly judge games based on story and concepts, then this is a game you will love. However if you are like me and want a visceral combat experience where you can feel progression at every skill point, then you will be underwhelmed by this game. As a general piece of advice, give this game another month or so to iron out tech issues. This will be a good game for some and a poor game for others, unfortunately for this reviewer it just wasn't up to snuff. The only reason I chose ""No"" is because I had to choose something and I wouldn't tell my friends that this is a must have. If you need a number this is a 60/100 and thats assuming tech issues get resolved. I hope this review was helpful(:			"

Warning: Stream edition is missing retail gameplayI’m not talking about the game being release in two halves. There’s actually locked doors and three quests in part 1 that can only be opened in the retail edition. It’s not available on the steam version, even to earliest of the early adaptors like myself. And there's nothing in the game to tell you this, so expect to waste time backtracking because you don't know which bits you were supposed to come back to with your new shiny, and which bits were never meant for you at all.Chapter 1 is great. There’s a good mixture of combat and plot. Chapters 2 & 3 and the other hand is just combat. The combat’s not bad, but that’s really all there is to Chapters 2 & 3 so if you looking for something other than grind, stay away.I played through to the end, but wished I hadn’t bothered.Pros:Excellent art design. Each level is both pretty and functional. The ability to switch to a ‘ghost world’ gets twice the millage out of each level without it feeling tired or forced.The ability to switch between characters is quite cool and well implemented. All characters receive XP whether they are in the party or not, so there’s no penalty for trying one out. The characters each have a distinct feel even though they all fall into one of three classes (ranged, magic, melee).Bosses are varied and feel special.In the configuration settings, you can change the ‘highlight loot/interactive area’ key from push-and-hold to toggle-on-and-off.Tom Baker voice over.[b[Cons:[/b]There are no movement keys. It’s right click to move, left click to attack. This makes most combat stationary and a battle of health bars rather than something dynamic and exciting. There is some ability to kite by switching between ghost and meat characters (and you’ll be doing that a lot in chapter 3).Some of the later levels have you backtracking across multiple levels without fast travel no apparent reason.The game engine does not support multiple CPUs or GPUs (source: dev posting in the comments). My 4 core, GTX 970 SLI config could barely manage 40FPS on max settings. Mob difficulty level is all over the place, typically at the start of a new chapter. Skill are unbalanced. "

Early Access Review
								PLEASE READ FULL REVIEW BEFORE JUST LOOKING AT MY RECOMMENDATION! Honestly, from the little I've played of this so far, I'm thoroughly intrigued as to where the game will go. I can't say it's the most original feeling experience as it is basically a ""Diablo clone"" (as much as I hate to use that term), but it does enough of its own thing to warrant my time, I think. Besides, if you're going to go for a style of game play, you could do a whole hell of a lot worse than iterating on solid design to begin with.PLEASE REMEMBER THIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS GAME! If you're wanting to try this game to see what it's about, maybe watch a YouTube video or something first as I can't recommend the game for $26.99 as is. That being said, if you're like me and are able to look past some major game flaws with an open mind while being a fan of the genre, this isn't the worst purchase on Steam.As is, I would recommend having a decent rig for playing, since there are currently no options to ""tune down"" any of the graphic settings beside resolution to work well for lower end machines and even on my high-mid machine it chugs like a beast due to lack of optimization (that will surely come much later). I streamed my first impressions of the game and I feel like that was a mistake and may have made the game look much more choppy than it actually was, but I feel like the most I got at any point in time playing was 25-30fps. It isn't unplayable, but added to the sluggish movement feel and kinda janky item pickup, some parts felt more arduous than they will when I can tweak the settings to make sure I get my full 60fps minimum.TL;DR Don't be silly and think you'll get an objectively ""good"" product right now for the price, but there is enough in here to show glimpses of a future solid title.P.S. Shameless video play plug and to the devs, I'm sorry my streaming made the game look like it performs worse than it actually does :-(

												If you are looking for another Diablo game, this is not it.Cons:EDIT: No more crashes happened after that first one so I guess this is a non-issue""It still has some technical issues but I only experienced 1 crash so far and you can say I abused the game quite a lot. Most games can't take the amount of Alt+Tab that I throw at them but this one did. :)""EDIT: this getting stuck has not happened in a long time.""The most annoyng technical issue I ran into is related to collision when the character gets stuck on a level difference, and that usually happens when there are 7 enemies around him.""EDIT: the  con mentioned on the next row  has been solved and combat is now more spectaluar and you can see clearly who you hit (can be seen in episodes 16+ of the series I linked below)""The combat could be a little more spectacular, and by that I mean, a few more clues of who your abilities hit when you use them."" <-not valid anymore as of 03.dec.14EDIT2: the below mentioned con has been addressed in the patch from 04.dec so now all enemies are manageable. ""EDIT: but I can add a new con and that is about game balance. Some enemies are to tough, some are not tough enough and some characters get loads of good gear, and others you spend 6 levels with the same thing.  I know that in this game, stats don't scale like in other arpg's but still it is a little annoying. ""ProsEDIT:  there have been 3-4 patches since launch and they have fixed almost everything that I had a problem with. I really like that they moved pretty fast on issues that mattered and not just promises. I also like they interact with the players here in the Steam Community forums and are open minded about stuff. (I don't have any relation with the developers, I just find them to be some of the cooler people in the business about how they handle stuff)This game has a nice story, interesting characters and awesome voice acting.The developers are invested in making the game awesome, and the progression the game has seen in the last 6 months is really impressive, so I have very high hopes, they will fix all the annoying stuff. :)I find combat to be more satisfying than that of other arpg's because you need to employ tactics when fighting enemies, not just spam Blizzard of Fire :) (I have hundreds of hours of D3 but sometimes it annoys the hell out of me :))I have made a playthrough series with the hunter/archer and there you can see the tactics I talk about. Once you get past the first chapter, (on normal mode) you will need to synergize your abilities if you want to be able to kill the enemies efficiently. For efficent killing speed, you'll need to use your puppets in synergy. Also you'll need to synergize your Devourer and your Puppets since some enemies need both to be killed.(you can see this in episode 8 of my series if you want)

												This game is amazingly well done.  Excellent story line thus far, flexibility in how you approach things, and an innovative method of dealing with a ""party"" type situation without having a party following you.  You are able to switch back and forth between playing a soul devourer and his many meat puppets.  The game pay reminds me on some levels of the genius of the old game Soulbringer,in that you uncover things and sometimes need to accomplish objectives both on the mortal plane, and on the astral.The environments are stunningly beuatiful, especially when playing using the DirectX 11 drivers.  This is an amazingly well-done game.  This is not your typical hack and slasher.  Some moral grey areas throughout on potential situations.  I have not played far enough through with multiple playthroughs to determine how this affects the overarching story or potential endings yet, but I cannot wait to keep on plugging away and explore those sorts of options.  A very enjoyable game.  Well-done.			"

Once you get past the first couple hours, combat becomes more fluid and exciting and the story begins to open up. Not recommended if you are looking for a fast paced ARPG focused on gear and loot drops.			"

Early Access Review
								Overall, in just the short time I've had to play it, I would recommend this as a game. Yes, it is Early Acess (pre-alpha), combat feels a little slugish, same for picking up items, art work (for what ive seen) has been awesome, sound track has been engaging, need click+hold attacking. On the upside, switching between members is fun, seeing both the light/shadow sides and being able to level both seperate is a great thing to have. In its current state, I'd give it a 7/10, but I strongly believe it will only get better from here.			"

Get to act 2 before you make any hastey reviews as i did.Act 2 the game became really pretty amazing..  you worked out the wrinkles and confusion you get a few more puppets and that changes the entire play value.. if book 2 never comes book 1 alone is well worth the asking price imo..  a very attractive game sound/ graphics/mechanics all i would rate fairly high..  but the true fun comes once you have a selection of puppets to control.. it was a game changer for me..  i sincerely hope book 2 makes it to release it desreves to.for 20 bucks i got a good deal			"

												Wow, great game!  I'm only 8 hours in, but I've completed Chapter I, so I think I have a good taste of the game.  There's just nothing about this game I can critize.  The UI, the character inventory, the crafting, the voice acting, the graphics, the writing, game performance are all just great.  I've experienced no bugs or glitches, at all.  And, above all, the game is fun.  The combat isn't revolutionary, or even evolutionary, but it works and it's fun in the way it's implemented.  The difficulty on normal is reasonable.  There's a nice strong story, too, which is tied to your character's backstory.  This is just the game I've been looking for; all fun and no headaches.			"

Early Access Review
								you can play with 1 hand most the time. your other hand is only needed for the heal button and still attacking button. you can switch in and out of different souls. you can be a monster, a animal person, a slow super armored zombie. you can go to the shadow world, and it also works like a puzzle mechanic. like zombies that cant die, unless you kill the souls in the shadow world.  yes its a diablo clone, but then it dosnt matter if it was a fps, strategy, 2d platformer. most everything is a clone of mutiple things. its a little buggy, combat can be sluggish, items are kinda hard to pick up, crafting is lacking only because you buy the recipies and they can be useless by the time you can make em. alot of crafting mats that just sit in your bag because you havnt gotten to a place with recipes that use them.  its not complete, but its fun. havnt played that much, but i already have 5 souls. if what i read is true, then this game will give alot of play time. if you can afford to buy it then buy it, you can be a armored zombie monster that crushes everything.

												NOTE: I'm still playing this game, and haven't finished the first book yet, I'll probably update this review as soon as I've finished my first playthrough of book 1.Also, I'm trying to keep this as spoiler-free as possible, so some things may be worded quite vaguely. My apologies for that.Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms is one of the most interesting games I've ever played. The gameplay is similar to that of Diablo 3, in that you have the same camera perspective and you basically spam your abilities to kill enemies. However, this game does it with a simple twist, the ability to move between two realms at will.What this simple mechanic does, is that you actually need to think whenever you're fighting against a group of enemies, as some of them are exclusive to one of either realms. I thoroughly enjoyed battling a boss, and using this to my advantage.The story of the game has been pretty good so far, and the characters that you control are quite interesting. The fact that your characters have their very own story adds a huge amount of replayability to the game which is really nice. Despite all the good points though, some players may not enjoy the game that much due to the rather slow progression in stats and power, I haven't had any trouble with enemies on normal mode yet, but you don't feel very powerful either, since you'll die quickly if you stay within the range of your enemies' attacks. Do take note that I play a ranged character, it is possible that melee characters do not suffer from this issue.I personally believe that the slow progression is kind of nice. It really is a great feeling when you finally level up, like you really accomplished something. And usually you do notice a change in power due to the scaling as you invest skill points into skills or passives.Graphics-wise the game is absolutely gorgeous, particle effects in combat are not over the top and flow nicely. The environmental art within the game is great too. Alongside the music and narrative it really immerses yourself within the game.One should most definitely buy this game if they enjoy a good story with a large amount of side-quests and simple, yet mechanically interesting combat.TL;DRIf you would enjoy a game with a fair amount of exploration and story. Buy this.			"

												Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms is a hack'n'slash RPG with a great story idea - you play the role of The Devourer who, as his name suggests, devours the souls of heroes. But this way, he also gives them a new life! In the end, this leads you to ability to switch between The Devourer and any of his collected hero souls. From beginning, you start with only one picked hero but as you go through the game, you'll find more characters - every character coming with its unique skillset. But don't get too much hyped about tactical group management, you can play only one character at time.Whole graphic style feels pleasant in terms of the genre (and competitors as Diablo III), the atmosphere is good thanks to nice soundtrack and well-made voice acting, though it depends on specific characters - for example the princess (mage beginning character) was sometimes cringeworthy like Obara Sand from Game of Thrones. Every environment has two version - the real one (for living characters) and the spiritual one (for The Devourer). This split is a nice idea and it's well implemented in the game, as you can swap between characters to get into/from spiritual world to run out of big group of enemies - only elite minions and bosses are in both environments. Interface and the game controls are something that feels totally unoriginal. I think the developers might have wanted to be more close to casual and current generation of (MOBA) players, so the interface and control keybindings are similar to League of Legends (or Dota 2). As a huge hack'n'slash RPG fan since the first Diablo, this felt really bad to me, seeing even small details, as the health regeneration counter in the health bar, made my impression pretty much worse. Another terrible thing is the AI of enemies. Many of aggressive minions won't attack you even if you are next to them, until you attack them. Enemy mobs also don't have much idea about pathfinding and walls, so if they can attack from range, they'll try to shoot you even through the wall. And they will fail.What is almost a must feature in RPGs to have as a resource besides health? There should be something, right? Mana (magicka), rage, whatever you may think of but there's nothing! All character skills are only cooldown-driven (run and spam skills while you can), the blue resource you can see in screenshots is ""soul essence"" that is used by The Devourer to ressurect dead characters. Besides mentioned cons there are also some smaller bugs like missing item icons or bugged achievements (couldn't unlock achievement for getting characters to level 2). Also, it's good to warn you that there's no autosave! That means, if you die, you have to load your latest manual save, in good old style. If you are too much spoilt by today's games, you might accidentally lose some of your playtime if you die and forget to save your position sometimes before.Overall, I understand why Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms gets many positive responses, though I felt more like I was playing a fan-made custom campaign for already existing game (and I believe it's a lot because of the interface and controls, it does not fit the game). It's not bad and it might be worth getting on sale but otherwise I'd rather recommend you checking for some other ARPG.			"

												This game definetly resides in the Diablo 3 genre but is also very unique. So far I have beat this game with the merchant king and now I am working on the enchantress. this is obviously a beta version of the game but is well worth the money upfront. There are some minor improvements to the mechanics of the game but everything else is outstanding especially the graphics and effects especially for a non main stream or popular name like Blizzard. Con's: The mechanical issues I have quams with are as follows: #1. When holding down your left mouse button to walk automatically if your mouse cursor by chance hits a destroyable object (which happens every friggen single time!!) will cause the character to pause and shoot or melee that target......this is a major ""no, no"" #2. Spontaneous game crashes. Luckily every time the game crashed I had saved my progress at major points of the game before the incent but still cost me many wasted minutes. This is also a major ""no no""!!!.#3. Unlike games like diablo 3 when you press your button to attack a target then quickly press the button again to attack a different target in the middle of your attack and executes instantly to attack the other target after hitting the original target. This game has characters that execute 10x slower than the characters in Diablo so when you predetermine your target then change targets in the middle of your execution your character pauses and does not execute the original target then restarts the movement to attack the new target........This is super annoying for D3 players like myself but this setting is much more realistic so if you appreciate the realism vs the unrealistic stuff like D3 then this game is for you.Pro's:#1: The Price of the game is low for this quality of a game.#2. The music & the character voices/material is great.#3. The graphics are very detailed and realistic.#4. The gameplay and story line is very unique in it's genre.#5. This game has great potential. "

												I usually do not like ARPGs, and skipped this one by due to not being interested in arpgs and thinking the ""shadow world"" mechanic sounded bad.   I bought this while bored and was very suprised by how much i liked it.  It is a very well done game.  Clearing every area twice isn't so bad.  I like my demon and my main guy so far, I enjoy the charcater building and there being no resets of skill points requiring thought.Combat is fast and slow, with almost limitless heals and sometimes extremem damage spikes to help with the mechanics.  It has just the right challenge level and combat is very well done considering you have potions, 3 alive people to cycle through, the demon, and your soul bar heals and reserrects.The game has a pretty decent crafting system.  The rpg aspects of quests and npc interactions are actually very heavy for an ARPG and plays like a real crpg.  Production value is high and the voice overs are actually really good for the demon, my fighter character, and the others I've heard.I am happy i bought this game, even at the current full price of $20.  I just bought the orginal and am going to play that through now and then come back to this.  I skipped almost all arpgs back in the day like this and sacred, etc, but am now learning to appreciate the heavier ones like Divine Divinity.For some reason this game, S:HK reminds me of Lionheart.  It isn't very similar but it has repetetive combat that somehow doesn't bother me.  This is a different sort of game than the ones I usually go for so is hard for me to recommend it to people who usually play crpgs, but I think most crpg fans will find this to be a good game whereas Torchlight, Diablo 3 type arpg fans may think it is to crpgish and slow.

												This is an indie gem, really, as far as action RPG games goes. A lot of good things going for it: engaging gameplay, rich in lore and story, challenging and needing to keep your wits about you (no steamrolling through areas in this one, folks). The environments look pretty, and even though isometric in view, the depth of the levels makes it work in a very nice balance. Enemies will chase you - just walking a screen away soesn't make them forget about you - and you have to keep in mind not to stumble deeper into enemy territory or it will be game over.The switching between characters is unique in this game, and makes for rather interesting challenges. You have to be adaptive depending on where you are and what you want to do. You can develop the characters at your disposal individually, making it possible to have completely different play-throughs. That means a lot, a LOT of replay value in this one just from that, not even counting the completely different story lines from when you make your first choice of champion.A few downsides I found that could use some work: using the mouse, in fights, the targeting is sometimes really off, making you move to or attack unwanted targets when you're just trying to get away from what's chasing you. Another issue I found is that the challenge level of the game goes up rather steeply in some areas, making it difficult to progress.Otherwise, I strongly recommend this game - and I do hope the developers will continue writing more of the story in next ""books"" in the same vein.

												If you expect this Game to be like Torchlight or Diablo 3, do not buy it.Combat: It is somehow pretty buggy. You end up pretty often hitting nothing but Air, if you get swarmed by multiple Enemies at once. Also, it seems that quite often you just hang, and then you end up dying, because your Character decided to do nothing.Running: While that System is nothing you should think its buggy, it is still buggy. Because you find yourself a few Times just getting stuck on Things .. and yes, you can even get stuck into NOTHING. Then you just cant move anymore, no back or forth.Content: Here comes my biggest complain. The Steam Version of the Game is incomplete. When you finally end up killing the ""End-Boss"", you find yourself with a few unfinished Quests that lead into nothing. There are several locked Doors/Gates that you cant open. Missing Boss in the Steam Version. On the other Hand, if you have the Retail Version of this Game, all those Quests are doable, and you can open the Gates/Doors.Crashes: You experience random and non-random Crashes all over the World. There are several Hotspots in the World, where the Game just crash, and it does this every time you get close to this Point. And the Random Crashes happen also, all the Time. So you can repeat or walk over the Map all over again, just to end up having another Crash.As of now: Dont buy this Game, at least not on Steam, if you want the Full Experience of the Game.Additional Information: For Achievement-Hunters - DO NOT BUY. Due to the Fact that the Game is not complete, many Achievements are not unlockable!			"

Early Access Review
Heretic Kingdoms: ShadowsEarly Access GameplayPlayed it for a bit but this game really surprised me. Kinda slow paced hack-and-slash which is refreshing after the Diablo's and Torchlights of this world. You also play as 2 characters, one Deamon and the character it has ressurected which is an interesting twist to the good old party system. Switching characters changes the surroundigs to an alternate world or the 'real' world, each with it's own enemies and physics. You can use your souls to ressurrect your character if it dies, which is quite fun mechanic. You lose health quite easily, and if you are near dead you hear your heartbeat go faster and faster until you die and are ressurected again. So dying isn't a big problem which is kinda cool.Graphics are good, sound is excellent and animations are fine. Had a fun time until now, so I can recommend this game.			"

												Hi gamers and friends,i bought this game today for 20 EUR and in the box was a poster and the soundtrack on audio CD. I played 3-4 hours and enjoyed it alot. I am very excited how the story continues.The developers made a very good job and i am surprised how good the game is in every single aspect. (gameplay, design, visual quality, music, sound effects)Only the performance could be better, my quad core is running only a single thread for it.I was interested after reading the review on 4players.de, but now i clearly understand how much better this game is than many other games around.You like Roleplaying? You like Hack and Slay? Buy Shadow: Heretic Kingdoms immediately.Best wishes from germanyViele Grüße aus Deutschland			"

												Excellent ARPG. I'm one of the half dozen or so people who purchased the classic ARPG Heretic Kingdoms at release and enjoyed it quite a bit, so I was excited for this somewhat belated semi-sequel (same world, different characters). It really delivers. It has all the appeal of the original and its bizarre, dark anti-theistic world of the Heretic Kingdoms setting as well as great art design and graphics, rock solid controls and an interesting combat mechanic whereby you can change to a different character/form on the fly. Each form has different strengths and weaknesses and multiple ones are frequently viable in a given area. Bosses are fun, enemies are challenging without being overly difficult and all-in-all this is just a great game.Just an FYI, this game series is single-player and campaign oriented and plays more like the Dungeon Siege or Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance than the more loot-driven, frequently multi-player oriented games like the Diablo series or Titan Quest.Additionally, Book 2 has not been released. Even if it never is, it's still a great game and the ending doesn't feel abrupt.If you like ARPG's, buy it.			"

												This game is fun and does not really deserve the bad rap. Playing in two different realms with two different characters, with different attributes, at the same time is clever. The people that are complaining about health need to realize they are not playing an easy d3 clone. These days we are seeing more games that are harder and some have permadeath. Publishers have to come up with ""something"" to make themselves different, don't they? If you see the number of games that i have; i have played a few games before. I only take the time to leave a review when something is either complete garbage or is being maligned inappropriately. This is one of the latter. It fulfills what you would want from this type of game. Now that it is being picked back up we should see more updates and get the free dlc. At best, get it now or put it on your wish list and wait for a sale.			"

												Basically why I don\'t like this- every character I played had the same 5 attacks. 6 \""characters\"" I think I tried. All 5 attacks the same, even the \""upgrades\"" did very little. So to force diversity the only difference is some charatcers are tanky and others do elemental damage that you sometimes need to bypass resists to other damage types. I think they only programmed the 5 attacks and just used different graphics for each character to make them different.I could have played the game, got over the generic loot treadmill and mediocre story. Graphics are decent. But the same attacks for everyone killed it for me.			"

												Shadows is a heavy story driven arpg that has gamepad support. Sold me right away. Other than that, what you have with Shadows is a simple skill tree level progression system, multiple characters to play as, which includes an on the fly swap character mechanic. I can choose to be a demon (the main character) that resides in a dark nightmarish world of his own, (nether realm) fighting enemies that are exclusive to that realm, like other demons and ghosts, then with a press of a button, I turn into one of his puppets which is a human barbarian that resides in the ""main colorful world"" fighting humans, spiders, zombies and such. Its a unique mechanic and keeps the game from getting stale. I like Shadows: HK a lot and recommend it to anyone who enjoys story driven ARPGs.			"

												Unfinished game being sold as finished productThis games has potential, although it needs balancing and the crafting system is virtually inexistent. But what makes me say a big ""NO"" to the game is the fact that it's unfinished because of an ongoing bankrupcy process and there is no estimate for when  and if Book 2 will ever be launched. I feel mislead, because there is no info on Steam about this, the information is lost amid community posts but not clearly stated in the game's page, the game is sold as if it's a finished product. I would like to get my money back. If you want to waste your money on an unfinished game, go for it. A third or less of a complete game seems to be available and the rest hasn't been released, and probably never will, for that matter.			"

												This game reminds me how spoiled we've been as gamers the last five or ten years; If I had played this game before having played Diablo 3, Borderlands 2 or Torchlight 2, I'd have declared this one of the better titles of it's time. There are tons of good ideas here, as well as old classic ones, all great reasons to buy and enjoy this game. I'll list a few of them below.First of all, this game is a classic call back to titles like the original Diablo, Ultima, Might and Magic and Golden Axe. I say that because the plot, characters, items and abilities are reminiscent of a simpler formula for what made roleplaying games fun: Genuinely mysterious plots, needing to pick through lots of containers, trying to find ways through locked doors, tons of areas to explore and re-explore, life-threatening bosses, and cool new upgrades in each place you visit - All tropes we're familiar with, and elements we've largely taken for granted in today's world of grindy hyper-fantasy turbo-speed action games. To talk about the new, the first thing you'll notice is that the pacing in combat is intentionally slower than most modern games because you actually have tons of different things you can do at any given time. The primary gimmick is that you can switch between characters at will but only play one at a time, which has a great justification in the game, which also justifies the manner in which you heal your party, the purposing behind which is very well thought out and works very well. The game opens up and starts throwing lots more monsters and compromising situations at you as you acquire new abilities and party members, which you will begin to switch between often. Once you start to learn the combos you can do and the pace at which you can do them, strategies for dealing with different kinds of badguys become endless and the gameplay becomes very rewarding. Add on top of this that the voice acting and plot is excellent despite having been developed in Europe and the color and environments are nothing short of beautiful, and you will spend a lot of time enjoying this game. The only complaints here are that the game starts off maybe a little too slow, and there isn't enough to do as far as playing the first character you start out as for the first hour or two. After hour two, the game becomes much more interesting. An ideal price for this title would be between 10 and 15 dollars as of when this review is going up. I'm only a quarter of the way through and I have to say, if the game is as long as I believe it is and keeps presenting new and interesting challenges along the way, it would be worth playing through at least once even at full price. TLDR, 8 out of 10. I would say this is a very good break-out title for the developer Games Farm, and we'll be expecting to see bigger, faster, harder and better from them in the future.			"

												\Garbage.  This has to be the WORST game I have played in over a decade.Locked doors and inaccessible areas because (arbitrarily) you didn't purchase the retail box.  Nothing in game to indicate that this is the case.  Yeah, the dev said f()ck you steam owners (""I'm sorry you feel that way""). Update: ignore the help requests pulled up in Google for this issue because they HAVE added the quests, but nothing updated since 2014.Running into other quests that cannot be completed because devs didn't get around to it.  AFTER running around in circles in-game with no indication this is the case.Brick puzzles requiring precise character movement when the programmed mouse movement is anything but.  Frequently in battle I find my character just standing there, unresponsive to attacking (not sure if I am being chronic stunned through most battles as there is nothing to indicate this has happened, just unresponsive character). Nope, the fighting in this game (even with Shift pressed) is horrid and unresponsive.  At some points, the only way to do any damage at all is to just WAIT for the specials cooldown and use them again. WTH? Also, love it when hitting a special and he makes the grunt noise like he was completing the action but does absolutely nothing until you hit the special button again.Plans/blueprints at merchants indicate in no way what mats will be required, nor which party character will benefit from their purchase.  Healing does not stop draining soul essence when health is full.Also enjoyed having an NPC interrupt my looting and push me through a door that closes behind me, leaving the loot on the other side.  In Hidden Fortress numerous pieces of loot are ""stuck"" and cannot be picked up (even with auto-loot enabled).  Every SINGLE time an item of blue value drops it cannot be picked up.  Even tried kiting the mobs to different areas of the map.  Saving and reloading still leave loot broken.  Oh, that's awesome!  Not being able to pick things up breaks the Nemek quest entirely.  Not one, but TWO quest items in the same room cannot be picked up (waning moon), so that's two quests that cannot even be done. BRILLIANT!Continue from the main menu doesn't load the latest save.  Large numbers of inventory have no image placeholder, so completely blank spots are actually filled.  Having crafting ingredients in the accessories and gems listing when they are actually necessary.  Sell something to a merchant by accident?  You can buy it back, but at 10x the price you were paid for it, so WTF is the point of even having a buyback tab?  Just add the sh!t to a merchant's inventory for crying out loud.  item tags while Auto-toggle is activated still fade or never show up.  Not sure what auto-attack actually does because it in no way assists fighting.  demon/puppets still stand around with their thumb up their collective @$$#$.Also forgot to mention random crashes to desktop as Kult3d quits working.So much of this game was poorly thought out and horribly executed.

												First Impressions:Beautiful graphics, excellent voice acting, and solid combat.  Based on my research, the game offers roughly 10-15 hrs per character (there are three), which potentially gives players 30-45 hours worth of play time.  I also discovered that free DLC will be offered early 2015 that adds 5-10 hours per character.  For $29.99, 45-75 hours worth of play time (DLC included) isn't something to scoff at.  Worth a look if you don't mind playing single player only action RPGs.

												Graphics: 7.5 Music/Sound Effects: 7Voice Acting: 8.5Story: 8.5Combat: 4.5I like this game, but I could have loved it, the story writers and voice actors have for the most part knocked it out of the park, the idea behind the game is solid and novel, it's like League of Legends single player. You get lots of characters to choose from, all different with their own novel little twists, and you can switch freely between them (The devourer and up to 3 souls in combat, but you can return to the realm of shadows to change your line-up).Combat... if only it played with the fluidity and sense of impact that League of Legends has it would be stellar but sadly it doesn't. Your character seems to just plant himself in the ground when you use an ability, combat animations are underwhelming and enemy’s don't react much until you kill them when there is a bit of a ragdoll effect.I am still going to give this a thumbs up because I can see myself finishing it because of the story.Devs if you read this please do yourselves a favour and make the combat fun and fluid with impactful abilities, fix that and you have a guaranteed sale for every expansion from this arpg player.

												This game is really awesome! Great take on the classic RPG. Allows you to transform at will into different characters with different abilities. So for those who are always conflicted about whether to be a mage, brawler, or archer at the beginning of RPGs, don't worry because you get all of them at some point in the game as you devour souls.Graphics, story, and voice overs are all solid. Not sure why there are some people who dislike this game. The only gripe I had was that the load times were long. Shadows has become one of my favorite games, and for $20 it's much cheaper than many big name RPGs.			"

They have done some great work on this game and as I understand it have already several updates and more content ready- which they cannot release until the issues with their publisher have been resolved.In conclusion- yes, I can recommend the game, and in future there will be more updates and more free content, BUT because of the legal issues this might take a while.So if you want a longer and more polished game, you might want to wait until the legal issues are sorted out.

												This game is great, good fun, interesting story. Definitely worth the price tag and I can't wait for the sequel!It's not without its problems though - performance is abysmal (FX8350/390x/16gigs DDR3 Ram) and the game would get stuck in 20-40 fps, when the hardware is more than enough to maintain 60+ at all times.Few targetting issues when you're playing a puppet with short reach, annoying but not game breakingHad 2 crashes in 17 hours, not bad at allAll in all, worth the price tag, good fun and interesting game			"

												i've finished it down to book1 ending, satisfied no less, but i can't say it was worth it.issues encountered are typical mistakes that normally happen in RPGs.quests with no indication as to how to find stuffs (you'll know when you play it), locked doors that can't be opened, hidden stashes that cannot be reached, and others.as for the game mechanics, the crafting an item is damn hard to complete, getting the stuff is already hard enough, the NPCs doesn't restock supplies at all.drop rates for objects are low except on the outlands, silver income is decent on all places though, the NPC price of equipment is near extortion.limited inventory space, with sparse NPCs you could sell to you'd encounter times where you end up with a full inventory, thankfully leaving items on the ground is fine, use your base as an unlimited storage.the skill tree is next to impossible in maxing, i had tried to cheat just to see how far i can get the level, and i was surprised that it takes over a billion exp to reach lvl30, and thats still not enough to get all skills to max, so choose your skills wisely.and speaking of leveling, its hard, like 18,200 exp required to reach level 9, and you only get measly 2~30 exp per kill. a soft-cap level is felt around 20 due to how steep the curve becomes, quests is your primary source of level, so do all if possible.and then theres the issue of difficulty, the mobs themselves are nasty, even on easy they're ridiculously tough and hit hard. so stay vigilant about how you combat them, you can hit and run even as a melee.

Early Access Review
								First Impression:  Hard to believe this is an early alpha.  Has some bugs and does feel sluggish evenon my quad core i5 and decent video card, but the concepts and ideas here are incredible.  I almost don't mind the bugs realizing I should be reporting them.  Assuming continual work, this will get better.  Large screen support is better than many final games here.Basically its ""like diablo"" in the sense that being in a ferrari is ""like"" driving a honda.  Its the same thing, but wow, just a whole new spin on it, the demon/human realm concept, the use of souls.  I only hope I have time to play more and can contribute to the alpha/beta so it gets better.			"

								Completed the first act. Storyline seems engaging and interesting. As stated by developers the game is early access and has several bugs. If you can get it started (some people had issues but today's patch seemed to help) then the other bugs encountered seem fairly minor. Just make sure you save your game! I'm hoping the game is completed and skill sets for the puppets are solid. I don't see how they can turn this into a multiplayer game with all the puppets and the change of perspective due to switching to the devour. Developers are listening to the community as today's patch proved which is great. So far lots of fun! Can't wait till more content is released.			"

												Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms displays all that an ARPG could be. The key word here is ‘could.’ The story is strong and has great depth, which is helped along by the detailed characters, who are excellently voice acted. Despite its linearity in most situations, Shadows shows the importance of story-telling in video games. The same cannot be said about the gameplay however. The awkwardness and cumbersomeness of it all makes this game a struggle to play at times, but is worth enduring if you are enjoying its story.Read the full review here: http://www.noobfeed.com/reviews/1098/shadows-heretic-kingdoms "

												Finished Book One and absolutely loved every minute of it. Can't wait for Book 2.Plays like a typical RPG but you can easily cycle through a total of four characters. That's what made the game fresh for me. It was so easy to go from archer, to dual weilding swordsman, then super smashing golem and finally to the demon. Awesome. The healing was equally easy and fun to use. The only thing that i had problems with was occasionally clicking on an enemy and my character not sighting and attacking, but it didn't happen often enough to be a problem.Please buy this game, you'll love every minute of it. That being said the developers are doing a comple overhaul of Book 1 before they finish Book 2. Buy it and wait for the update (the wait shouldn't be too long). It will be worthi it. As well, the developers have being keeping us abreast on how development is going on both facebook and discussion pages.			"

After ~act 2 (~8 hours gametime) it starts to get a bit too repetitive for me, but well, it's expected from this genre.For ""indie"" game the graphics and artwork is superb and it's surprisingly balanced.

												WOW what a pleasent suprise! I got this game because I thought it looked Diablo-ish and cool, I read some reviews first and was kinda nervous after what some people said, but I can say this is a GREAT game. The graphics or art is amazing and totally immersive when mixed with the terriffic musical score. The music for the first city is beyond what I was expecting. The way you talk to NPC's by choosing dialogue to get quests, learn more is pure RPG at it's finest. The way the NPC's spoke fit right in and pulled me into the atmosphere of the game. The combat at the start is a bit slower than a Diablo, but it's almost more relaxed allowing you to focus on the game, story and whats happening instead of powering through at lightning speed and skipping what the NPC's say.The best part of the thing that seperates this game from all others for me is the fact that you play multipule characters at once. It's not only the switch between the demon and say the mage woman I chose, but it's how the music changes as well, how the world switches into the demons realm with it's own music, art style and story. To me OMG I am so happy I picked this up. I feel relaxed while playing this, like just getting sucked into the story and games atmosphere not noticing how much time has passed. Very well done game, highly recommended by myself. If you like RPG's that bring you into their world, this is a great find!			"

												12 years ago today, I played Vampire the Masquerade –Redemption. It was not mainstream, from a small studio, with occasional bugs but funny as hell. Similar is Shadows. I started with beta version and there were problems but with every patch game got better and more stable. Since official release I had no crashes and game runs fine. I tested this game on 2560*1440 and it looks and runs great. Very attractive element of Shadows Heretic Kingdoms is its main character and a unique party system. You can switch between the Devourer and up to three party members, each with their own special abilities. You can even switch between worlds to survive otherwise lost battles, avoid traps and solve puzzles. First I played as Jasper, archer and I liked his stunning arrows. Later I acquired Urshak, a little one, who can make bombs and traps and I liked him even more. During next hours I was able to play with more characters with quite different combat styles. Music is great, done by Budapest orchestra.You can buy a mainstream game for triple price only to realize later that its nothing special but if you are looking for something unusual you should try these small budget games. Almost all new games, even with millions of dollars budgets, have some bugs and problems and Shadows in no exception but unique and funny environment, characters and story makes it for 20 euro a game worth buying.

												As of now, i give this game a negative review, it is very unbalanced and clunky. Sadly i have to give this negative review, the voice acting, and the story is very well done, but its hardly enjoyable to play, it has too many cooldowns, in my opinion to make a game fun, remove the cooldowns just base it on mana, take some advice from Diablo II it has almost perfect gameplay aspects, and even today the graphics hasnt aged as much as others from its time.      All of these new age aspects in gaming are generally bad in terms of a lasting game with a great replay value, please fix the combat, it has such a great potential and doesnt need to be so rudimental and insanely dull. I really tried to give it a good chance and play through, but i cant urge myself to finish the game, the skills, items and combat need big changes, i hope the developers are listening, because i want to be able to come back and give a positive review.Thank you for your time			"

												Deleted from my hard drive.....Really, enjoying the game, but then CTD, CTD, CTD. There must be some bug that does not like it when you drag an item from the crafting slot or something. And then there are combat CTD's. The CTD's I could have lived with...just save often. But overpowered werewolves are more of a chore then fun to kill, especially when they are constantly regenerating health. I could handle one of them, but when you have two or more chasing you down this is NUTS.To the games' credit:  great graphics, excellent music and sound, good game play and loot.  Please fix your game.  I cannot recommend until then,.			"

								The game has a huge potential. Too bad it is not possible to understand the vision of the puppets, because so far we can only choose between two. If developers read my review, leave a request here. Please, I want a puppet-inspired Cruzader D3. It would be really cool to see a warrior shield and flail like puppet since the blizzard did not know to enjoy this class. Other legal puppets would be a samurai and an inspired use of chakrams, as can be seen in Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. I am very eager for more content.			"

												An Initial Impression: Definitely Triple-A effort here. Very polished, looks great. Considerable thought went into the writing of the interesting premise. Play seems a little on the 'large' side... that is, elements are viewed at a closer distance than some action RPGs do. A plus is a slower pace of play; not too much slower, but certainly not blistering. Looking forward to returning to it for more of both the story and action.			"

												Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms (we'll call it S:HK) was that game in the steam store that I was curious about, but wasn't certain if it was worth the $20 price. After finally giving in and buying it, I found it to be a pretty fun spin on the arpg formula.S:HK takes place in a fantasy world with a pretty neat concept. There's magic, but no religion (from what I gathered, people were abusing religion for power so others rose against them and wiped it out), so no clerics or paladins here. As the description tells you (or maybe you ignored the description and came down to the reviews immediately you little rebel), this game has you take on the role of a demon known as the Devourer. Honestly, that is what made me want to buy this game. As the Devourer, you consume the souls of the dead and turn them into puppets. These puppets are pretty much copies of whoever or whatever was consumed, but now under the Devourer's control.The concept of the Devourer plays into the mechanic that makes this game unique. The puppets make their way through the regular world while the Devourer explores the shadow version. You end up switching between puppets and the Devourer to bypass obstacles, find secrets,escape from one world to another to avoid a bad situation, or to kill extra enemies for those delicious experience points. You will start with one puppet and the Devourer, and you'll find others throughout the game as things go on. This is where I have to commend the developers for making such unique playable characters for and arpg. I won't spoil what they are, but, believe me, you won't be expecting some of these. This creates a cool dynaimc where the player won't run through the game with only one character, but rather switch between them to fit the situation. Maybe you'll use a mage to take out a group of smaller enemies before switching to the Devourer to take out a shaman without the others interfering, then proceeding to switch to an archerto kite and kill some of the stronger enemies, and finishing with your warrior to plow through what's left. It's a fun and engaging mechanic that makes me want to keep coming back to find new and useful combinations, and it definitely hold this game up. Levels are shared between characters, so don't worry about one getting ahead of others.The game can be pretty short if you ignore some sidequests and know what to do, but I feel that this works to its advantage. The game has plenty of points where decisions affect the story and playing through with different puppets and different decisions adds a ton of replay value. I see people complaining about the cliffhanger ending, but I honestly feel that it's warranted. There's plenty here, and the developers likely wanted to send this out to see how it goes before investing more into a project that might fail.The game is not perfect though. It has a few bugs, and sometimes it isn't clear what the player is supposed to do at some points. The save system can hurt at some points, but that's only if you forget to quciksave every now and then (although i understand why trapping the player with frequent autosaves could lead to issues as well). The main issue is the amount of walking you end up doing. There are points scattered around the world that you can fast-travel between, but, after you use one, you have to walk across an entire map to go into a dungeon and beat it to do your quest, then retrace all of your steps without enemies to occupy you on the way back. Also, there are quests that you either won't want to complete (I will not put myself through that Call To Arms quests, and nothing can make me) or quests that you can't complete until the next part comes out.I feel I should address a common complaint I've seen in reviews and say that the attacking system works fine for me. Left-click on an enemy to attack, hold it down to keep attacking, and hold shift to attack while stationary. I had very problems, and even those were just trying to target the right person in a group of enemies.All in all, S:HK isn't a perfect game, but it has a good amount of content, interesting concept, as well as a unique and dynamic mechanic that make it well worth that $20 price tag( that's like one meal at Olive Garden for at least 22 hours of entertainment). If you're a fan of arpgs or just curious about the concept in general, I'd definitely recommend it.			"

That makes so different gaming experience. Try it!			"

												There's plenty wrong with this game - more than I feel like committing to a review right now.  However, despite all the problems, the game itself would be worth a little bit of fun.  IF IT WORKED PROPERLY.I have ~30 hours in on this game as of this writing, and I've experienced every kind of bug you can possibly imagine:  input bugs, freeze bugs, crash bugs, audio bugs, and much, much more.  Just now, the game crashed during a loading screen when I tried to transition between maps.I've pretty much given up at this point, as I'm convinced that development of this title never actaully completed.  Maybe it got halfway through beta and then the devs just said, ""♥♥♥♥ it! This looks good enough. Ship it!""  This game is essentially a bad Diablo clone, so for your money you're better off playing Diablo 3 or Torchlight.			"

			Views: 519		

			Cosmic gives his first impressions on early access action RPG Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms developed by Games Farm. On Steam here - http://store.steampowered.com/app/256030/ Twitter -...		

Shadows is a top down isometric action rpg that is being developed by games farm and published by bitcomposer games. Shadows Heretic Kingdoms is the successor to 2004's Kult Heretic Kingdoms which was also published as Heretic kingdoms the inquistion in North America.The game takes place in a time where the Heretic Kingdoms are no longer ruled by anyone. An uneasy peace remains across all races and factions. Now however cracks begin to emerge, minor fighting has begun and something more sinister and far more threatening has begun moving in the shadows.Ultimately the games main character is a Demon from the shadow realm known as the Devourer. A mysterious cloaked man has summoned you and let you loose upon this world. The cloaked man speaks of a great threat to both him and the demon but he speaks cryptically and there is much yet to be answered for the demon.			"

												PROS-the game is fairly cheap to buy -has a combat system where the main character can change into other characters -the game looks fairly ok but not greatCONS-the game is really cpu intensive so if you have a doule core and your trying to watch a video on the side its not going to happen-the controls are extremely clunky, awkward, and not every fun to play -the time i takes to switch between characters takes way to long for any meaning full combios to be achieved-the voice acting is really flat, i wish this game just didnt have voice action at all and  spent their money else where-the game isnt very polished, if there is dialog going on and you pause the game. the voice will continue to speak all the way through even though the game is pause.-on the edges of some maps the characters will clip through objects and environments.-not enough enemies and the amount of damage you do is very little also the cooldowns dont help with the flow of combat either. over all the combat is very clunky and dull. CLOSING THOUGHTthe games isnt horrible but isnt great either. the just isnt very fun to play. i think its just how they have the damage amount and cooldowns set up. combat is just really long, clunky, dull, and over all not very fun to play. I would say just skip this game you wouldnt be missing anything important.			"

												It's a boring ARPG with all the weaknesses Action-RPGs can have - no emersion, boring ""run from a to b"" quests and ""kill X"", extreme lame ""click all skills after another"" fights with endless hordes of the same monsters. Monotonous landscapes, linear levels who are no fun to explore because you only find barrels and co to loot. Upgrading skills is no fun either. I bought it for 10 euro and even that's not worth it. Last but not least I want to add that I'm sad about that gamng experience because I like the idea of playing a demon and not a human again who also can controll up to 6 puppets of different races. You can switch during battle and off battle between your different characters and that's a nice twist. I also liked the idea that the demon is dressed with runes and not common weapons and gear. In the hands of another developer's team or maybe with more money and time this could have been an interesting, fun and special game.			"

												This game is at best 2.5/5 stars.  The combat system is buggy.  Skills frequently fail to complete activating and continually clicking to attack causes stuttering.

												This game really rocks ! It is a very unique Idea realised and I had a lot of fun with it, until I got to the end of the first part, where I realized, that I can't finish the game, because of the bankruptcy of the publisher bitComposer. It might be already available now, or soon, I don't know, because I did not play it for some time now. I was really sad, that I had to stop playing this game, just when it started being really a fun game (except for the desert part :P). As  soon as you can play the second book too, I would recommend this game as a must have.			"

												I wanted to like this game so badly but can't recommend anyone buy it. I loved the look, the UI and the idea of having two worlds to mingle in. Twice the fun, right?Two worlds, 1 ShadowNot really. The two worlds thing is nice in theory, but it ends up being a chore. I have to wander around an area as 1 dude then wander around as the other. Sure, it's not that bad and I could easily deal with it by switching it up while I'm still in the same area, right? Both sets of characters take FOREVER to get around. They're far too slow in general. Later on I unlocked an Archer type dude who was ever so slightly faster and it still took far too long to wander around. This is an Action, Hack'n'Slash, right? You know, ARPG like Diablo? It sure doesn't feel or act that way. I literally looked around for a Diablo 2 style Sprint button or toggle; didn't find one. If you're not going to give us the means to move faster then at least make the characters FAST themselves, geez. Hows the Voice Acting?The voice acting is grand! It's great to hear everything instead of having to read literally everything. Sadly, the sound mixing is terrible. Voices either cut off other voices or are automatically played right after the next even if you heard it mutiple times already. There is large amount of NPC's that only have a single thing to say. Some voice volumes are unbalanced and are often too loud when compared to voicing before it or during. For example, I was talking to Morphew and there was constantly a weird busy market place sound effect that contains some yelling that would continue to pop up as he was speaking forcing me to read the text instead of hearing the lovely voice acting. Hows the rest of the sound?Annoying as heck! Just playing the very beginning-ish area with the Shadow guy and hearing the Soul sound effect over and over at the exact same volume each time without any fading or canceling, was like nails on a chalkboard. Then you have mutiple enemies all playing the same loud dying sound effect as well, over and over again everytime. It reminded me of bad Tablet games where they just let the sound effects cut in and out without any control or balance but it wasn't enough to abandon ship just yet. The only good thing sound wise was the music and how it would change based on what world you're in. Cut Scene VideosI have no idea what's going on with them but they look to be pre-recorded poorly rendered videos and watching them on my large monitor felt as if I was rubbing the screen with my eyeballs. Crazy pixelation and overall poor quality. Is there anything else ""good""?Believe it or not, the story. I was more invested in the story of who is the Hooded Man, what happened to Kalig and overall my evil shadowy self then I ever was in Diablo 3. There also a few quests that seemed entirely optional and gave a worth while reward at the end of it. However, the ""search for intel"" related quests were utterly terrible pieces of nonsense. It went on for too long and the quest markers kind of broke during it. The UI is also very good in most areas. The inventory UI seems a tad large and in your face for my liking but at least it was easy to be effective with it. I could tell it was really trying to have only a single window for shops, inventory and character equipped items. Bugs and GlitchesYeah, it should be noted that there are some bugs and glitches. Some areas that look walkable aren't or the pathing is off. Some times an enemy can sit in an area where you're not able to walk towards and thus cannot attack them. Often the screen seems to have visual tears even with V-Sync on and having tweaked the settings. What made me quit out?I ignored everything else mentioned above in order to play the game and see what it had to offer. Again, keeping in mind that I really wanted to enjoy and love the game. The combat is what killed it for me. Besides the fact that the game thought shoving me onto a level 19 character with a bunch of skills that I didn't know what any of them did was a good idea when It wasn't... I could never get past the strange disconnection from the characters. Every attack feels as if it's turn based instead of an ARPG. I walk over to get in range and stand there spamming the attack button, waiting for the attack animation to start up and then attempt to hit them until X target dies. It annoys me how long it takes between each attack and that movement is obviously slow for only you as enemies can zip around while you're still starting up your attack. In short, it's mind numbingly slow. I used the Shadow guy and Kalig, both felt the same. Both had the same issue. Only Kalig had it worse. His attack animation is so long that it could easily be canceled out of. No damage is done to your target when this happens. It makes the fact that you can MISS even more annoying.Even just breaking a bunch of Urns and Barrels takes far too long. The slow nature of attacking makes everything related to it a chore or a test of will. Skills? Nah, they're just as slow and awkward. Skills and normal attacks can hit targets that should clearly be out of range. Some times your first skill as quite the long cooldown making combat entirely about single targeting every enemy.The combat is so slow nothing I do with skills feels rewarding. There is no satisfaction from using an AoE skill to kill off a number of enemies as I have to wait to do anything at all times.			"

												this game is so buggy - keys not being where they are meant to be characters getting stuck - dont buy it I was stung!Part II - after completing the 1st book....Well as a follow up not all the things I thought were bugs were in fact - just badly explained or hidden issues, but not completely I have fallen through the floor a number of times and not been able to pick up or shoot at certain locations, but to be fair outside of it being a bit grindy it has been a lot better than I first thought. So I'd say not as exciting game play as Tourchlight II - but a rich story and I hope Book 2 will fix the bits of the game that were weak in book 1 - I'd say wait for the release of the second book before you buy and check the reviews then. It supposedly will release Feb. 2015 (today's the 18th no word yet....)			"

Early Access Review
								While the game has great visuals, impressive voice acting (in as much as they've implemented so far), good music, great atmosphere and apparent character choices the controls kill it for me. Some would say that controls are only part of the game, but to them I say, it's one of the few things that you have to deal with for the entirety of the game. It's not something to take lightly. At Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms' current price it comes off as a tough sale even if this game has a lot of promise. If you're really into ARPG's you might have a difficult time over-looking them. If you're casual ARPG player, this may not affect you at all. I would keep your eye on this and when people stop complaining about ""sluggish"" controls, it would make the price a lot easier to swallow. This isn't a title to write off. You can see the work they are putting into this game and that is, once again, not something that should be ignored.Full Review: TheVideogameBacklog.com "

												On paper, Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms seems promising. A diablo-clone with emphasis on story, choices and a planeshifting mechanic?I was expecting a modernized mix of Soul Reaver and Divine Divinity, but it was never going to meet my high hopes. Especially since the developer is in legal trouble with their publisher and we can't expect a second game/""book"" anytime soonThe story never manages to seem much more than a loredump, and another hunt for a magical MacGuffin. You get to control multiple characters with different personalities, but there's not enough consistent flavor in much of the dialog and it is often immersion breaking to see so many options that only make sense when we break the 4th wall and consider that the *player* might want to ask or say something, rather than the character.There are also various situations that would fit a moral/story choice quite naturally, but the game ignores the opportunity.As a pure diablo-clone, the game is average at best. There are some enemies that are interesting because their gimmicks make use of the plane-shifting mechanic, but otherwise, the designs are boring, your characters' skills start feeling incredibly samey as you grow in levels and unlock more, and they very rarely feel like they pack any punch or are otherwise significant. The combat does not have the *feel* that can really elevate a simple diablo-clone.The loot is simply dreadful. Very rarely will you stumble on any gear with enchantments or anything of the sort. Aside from healing potions and herbs, the crafting system may as well not be there, it is that useless!The game is also a disaster on technical level. With a Nvidia GTX 560Ti, I can barely ever get above 40 fps while playing at 1080 resolution. The combat is often incredibly unresponsive: game drops skill commands done mid attack animation, does not buffer movement clicks well when you really *need* to move in a hurry, and your auto-attack does not continue if the enemy that you're attacking moves from under your mouse cursor. The loading times are also quite bad, especially if you teleport into Realm of Souls, the one place where you can switch ""party members""Then, after going through all this, the game ends after a super dull bossfight with an annoying cliffhanger that will never get payoff.Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms is truly a mediocre, disappointing title. The concept may intrigue, but the lack of excellence in *any* field, and lack of competence in some, will turn this game into a chore before you get outside the gates of your starting city.			"

												Buyer beware: This game is prone to crashing and is largely unfinished.  Not ""largely unfinished"" in the sense that it doesn't conclude, but unfinished insomuch as the game yields 5-10 hours of gameplay in total.  That's it.The mechanics of swapping between the shadow/real realm, and swapping puppets in combat to chain constant stuns is interesting, but that interest is short lived.  Once you get into a rhythm of chaining two or three stuns between your puppets, you infinitely lock down enemies.  Bosses aren't much of a challenge when you can ensure they never move, let alone attack, for as long as you can keep swapping and stunning.Once Book II is released, and an initial hand at balancing passes over the game, it may be worth a buy if it's on sale.  For right now this is not worth putting down the money.			"

												As great as this game is, I'll have to neg it because of one thing only....and that is the sluggishness of the combat.The pace of combat is so embarrasingly and pointlessly slow that you may very likely lose interest in the narrative all-together. There is no reason in this day and age why basic attacks in a point and slash game should take 2 to 4 seconds to happen. That is just profoundly disrespectful to the time of your players.Everything else from graphics to story to soundtrack is top-notch.			"

												Heretic Kingdoms is a generic isometric hack and slash that tries to stand apart with its unique ability to switch between characters on the fly but is held back by its slow and clunky gameplay.  It is a visually appealing game but the UI is lacking,  items on the ground are virtually invisible unless you hold the alt key to highlight them and the inventory can become cluttered.  Unfortunately I can not comment on the complete story as I encountered a save file bug 7 hours in that froze my character in place whenever I loaded the file preventing me from advancing any further and I was not compelled by the story at that point to bother replaying it.Hopefully these issues will be remedied in any future sequals/updates as I feel there is potential here especially with the party system, switching between 4 characters and chaining their abilities to melt your enemies was very satisfying.+Appealing graphics+Unique party system-Game breaking bugs (may be solved in future updates)-Slow combat and cumbersome movement (clinking near an enemy will cause your character to attack making positioning difficult)+/- Story had some highlights but mostly bland (unable to complete the full story due to bug)+/- Gamepad support, I personally love playing games with a controller but at the time of this review the gamepad controls were bugged and would crash the game after several minutes of play.

												I don't usually write reviews, but I just wanted to warn people about some of the issues I have had with this game. I run triple monitor 6000x1080 with gtx760 SLI and though the pregame res options offer this as a possible config it will immediatly crash every time I try to run it. I have seen that many people with multiple monitors report similar issues with this game. Next, I attempted to play the game on my Nvidia Shield and while I could finally get into the game it would crash after about 5 minutes. A common complaint in the forums is that gamepad support is insufficinet and is prone to cause crashes, I'm not sure if this is why it fails on the Shield but its a thought. If your interested in this game and the pricetag doesn't bother you ( a 20 dollar crap shoot) then go ahead this game might work for you. It did not work for me.			"

												I had high hopes for Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms and the game was on my wishlist for quite some time. After winning it in the Auction I was excited to try it out.It didn't take long for me to become disappointed. The movement in the game is clunky and a lot of the time your character will stand there doing nothing. I've had to press Esc a few times because I thought my game locked up. The difficulty of the game is pretty average, the further along you go one of your characters becomes broken enough to solo everything. The final boss of this ""book"" was a complete joke, on top of that there's almost no challenge.What I thought was going to be a game with some story and great gameplay turned into mindlessly slaughtering small groups of enemies with terrible A.I with almost no story at all, apart from the couple main quests you get.Stereotypical ""You're the chosen one!"" Story with random sidequests to find X or kill Y. Being locked out of ""Exclusive Retail Version Content!"" is also pretty lame, considering you get the quests and the achievements exist for everyone. Although they apologized for it, it's still a shame.There are some up sides to the game, thankfully. The boss battles felt unique and were fun to do, still not the challenge I was hoping for. With a quicksave feature in place, there was no sense of danger since you could just reload 2 seconds before where you died. The skill system is average at best, there still only felt like the classic ""Mage, Archer, Warrior"" classes, with most of the spells doing the exact same thing with just different particles. The ""Shadow Realm"" aspect brought something neat to the game, only during the puzzles though. Everytime else it felt useless unless you had to switch for a brief second to go through a wall that was blocked in the mortal realm.I guess if you get the game extremely cheap you could have minimal fun playing it for as short as it is. The Dev's think they're doing you a favor with the ""Reduced Early Access Price"". This first half of the game is supposed to be complete, but it feels like a huge rushed mess. "

												The game has a wonderful and interesting story, very good voice acting and the idea of swaping through your diffrent classes in a fight is really compelling, the GAME is at it's absolut worst when it come to GAMEplay. Everything from the basic movement to the strange and unfair difficulty spikes is absolut and utter crap.If this was a animated story I could watch instead of play, man would I like it. But it's a game and as a game it's crap, it's even more frustrating because you want to know what will happen in the future, you want to be the one to do all the things they talk about in the game, but in the end you just get more and more frustrated because the game doesn't seem to want to give you the chance to move forward at a half decent pace.I'm really sad and angry that I can't like this game, because the creators took it upon themselfs to smash every bit of fun and investment in the story you could have built after the first few hours in bits and pieces in the hours to come.It's another game where I can only think, why didn't the ppl creating the game make gameplay the main focus, because if the gameplay gets in the way no good story, voice acting or looks can hold it up enough to make it worthwhile and because all of these points are really good, they seems to have talent. Something not entirely related to the review:I'm disappointed with the many games that are so good at the beginning but then can't hold up because the creators try to make it extra hard or extra wonky or extra whatever, in an attempt to make their game special while forgetting joy, playing a game should be fun. If the game isn't fun to play, it's not worth the time ppl stick in it to play it.So to all ppl who are making a game or will in the future: Stop wasting our time and money for crap, we as gamers love to fund you if your game is fun to play.

												no sure why but the game kinda lags/slows down when your in combat mode. I am pretty sure its my PC.... but Considering i can play games like Advanced Warfare with lag only when its loading its kinda odd. Anyway Overall the game is good. If the Lag Problem can be fixed it would be awesome. Until then for me its just not that fun. That was the previous version tho not sure about the newer one...			"

Early Access Review
								The idea of the game is nice, some kind of mix between soul reaver and diablo, but made kinda poorly, such a short prologue which tells you kinda nothing... a useless tutorial, items blending into terrain, you can keep healing yourself wasting your 'souls' even when your health is max, I looked into the no old school mode and there were exclamation marks on everything so switched to old school after few secs, the animation (even of the main heroes) is so simple and looks pretty bad, and that's from 10 minutes game time.So in general doesn't worth the money right now but has a potential if people do buy and help the creators with money and suggestions so for now I don't recommend the game, was kinda disappointed, looked better in store than it is.

												Update for 2017:While the game itself has polished gameplay with a very interesting and fun spin on action RPG mechanics, it is a game that is unfinished and full of empty promises not delivered 2 years after official release. Book 2 is still unreleased as of Feb 2017 and discussion on a remastered version has been going on for over a year and a half, while the developer, has openly shifted to working on a new game with a new publisher.In terms of this game, I really like the atmosphere, the rich environments and the lore. If they ever end up releasing the remastered version and the long promised (2 years) book 2, I will fully recommend. Right now I wish I could give a neutral, but for now I will leave this at a thumbs down. The developer managed to get rights to this game back from the publishers over 2 years ago and said they would make the game supporters, especially those from early access, whole, well at this point after a ton of empty promises, we are still waiting. If you are ok with knowing there is an entire book (read half of the game) for this game that was planned and promised, that that is still ""on hold,"" while the devs are working on a new game, then go ahead and pick this up on sale. What is there today is an interesting spin on the ARPG genre, just unfinished. If however, you want a finished product, I recommend waiting to see if the remaster ever gets released. If they ever end up delivering on the promise I will update this review accordingly.			"
