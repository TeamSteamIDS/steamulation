Fallout: New Vegas, is it for you?If you are considering picking this game up, but not sure if you'll like it, here are some things I liked and disliked.What I liked:Character Customization:The amount of character customization is really up there. Virtually unlimeted posibilities when making a character. (Not as much as TES: Skyrim, but really close).Mod Support:The modding community is very expansive for a game that has been out sinse Oct, 23 2010. If you can think of something, it probably exist!Open World:Depending on what version you buy (Standard or Ultamite edition), you will have plenty to do. Sights to see, things to shoot! Weaponry: Fallout: New Vegas is full of many types of weapons. Everything from M4 carbines to helicopter propeller swords! But don't forget that there are mods for anything you desire.Hardcore Mode:Want something more realistic to a real life apocolypse? Well Fallout: New Vegas has a ""Hardcore"" mode you!Multiple Playthroughs:There's not just one way to experience New Vegas, but four ways!What I disliked:Crashing:Fallout: New Vegas will crash on you at least once or twice. Whenever it does it can be anouying having to go back and redo quest that you've completed.Navmesh:Despite the occasional crash, the navmesh in this game works, but is a little sloppy. Sometimes NPCs will walk into walls and furniture. But it is easliy overlooked when you get further into the game. (You may even find it funny)PC abilities:This game is not the most demanding game for a PC, but can effect your overall experience of it. (I.E. glitching, FPS drops, and crashes)So what's the difference between the standard edition and the ultimate edition?     The ultimate edition is the standard game, but with all of the DLC will it. Yes it cost an extra $10.00 but is worth it compared to buying the standard edition for $9.99 and all the DLC for $22.94.  All-in-all:Fallout: New Vegas is a good solid game for the money. You'll find yourelf captivated by it's charm and want to play evenmore of it. It does get a little dull after a while, but does have a fantastic modding community. I would purchase the Ultimate Edition instead of the Standard, just my opinion. Steam does have The GECK in the tools section which will allow you to make mods for the game. "

												The Wild West meets the Fallout Post Apocalyptic world and a great game is born.Fallout: New Vegas is an open world RPG set in a Post Apocalyptic world. Where Fallout 3 was set in D.C. this game is set the Mojave desert around the ruins of old Las Vegas. The theme throughout this game is a western one, but many different factions are present, each with their own unique (and often hilarious) style. And of course there is a power stuggle between a pre-war industrialist, Caesers legion and the New California Republic is under way and you are about to be thrown into the middle of it. What will you do?This game is filled with great characters, hilarious dialogue and so many entertaining quests that it would be hard to do them all in a single play through. The DLC adds many more hours of fun although it is quite varied in flavour and in value, but all of them are worth playing at least once. The exception might be Lonesome Road, which most people loved but I had some issues with, especially with one decision it forces you to take that I felt was not one any of my characters would ever have made. But Old World Blues may be my favourite DLC for any game ever. The first fifteen minutes had me crying with laughter. When you add the fact that the modding communty is adding more of everything, this game could provide several hundred hours of play time and still have things to offer.

												One of my all-time favourite games, I really enjoyed it and I spent many, many hours playing this. The huge amount of choices, factions and playstyles the game gives you, makes you want to experience every single one. The story may be a bit weak and the graphics a bit rusty (same engine as Fallout 3). This is however beaten by an awesome gameplay (modable weapons!), a brilliant atmosphere set in sin city, nevada and its surroundings and also 4 high quality DLCs (I strongly recommend Lonesome Road, because of its story and revelations).

												I think this review is going to be much like my Arkham City review; I would say the majority of user's on Steam will have already purchased Fallout: New Vegas, and most will have probably even finished it.  So this review will be aimed at the probable minority of people who don't have it, or just haven't played it. Fallout New Vegas was released in October 2010. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic, open world environment around the areas of Nevada and California. You play as a Courier who has been hired to deliver an unknown package to the New Vegas strip across the Mojava Desert. During the delivery, you are captured and shot dead (or so they think). After being recovered by a friendly robot, you are thrust into this massive world which is filled with various different factions competing for control over the land.This was my first ever experience with a Fallout game; I had previously watched my younger brother play a little bit here and there, and of course I am on the internet, and so it's always mentioned on popular websites and subreddits so I knew what I was getting into,  a huge deep time sink. Game play is focused around the use of your V.A.T.S for guns, as well melee weapons. V.A.T.S pauses the game so to speak, and allows you to target certain areas on the enemies body. You have a limited amount of action points to use in this mode, so once you aim, you come out of the aiming mode and the character carries out the orders you set. You can then either wait until your action points have been replenished or use free range shooting mode.  As you wander around the desert, you will find plenty of items, weapons, food, drink, books and many more items that will be of use to you in someway or another.  Obviously you cannot loot every single thing you find, alas we have a weight limit for how much you can carry on you at any given time. This can sometimes lead to difficult choices to make when it comes to looting heavy weapons or armor. As you progress through the game and get a higher reputation, you unlock safe houses, where you can store your items in fridges, cupboards and desks for safe keeping while you are out traveling.One thing I was surprised about in Fallout is that there is surprisingly not as much shooting and actual fighting as I had initially imagined. I created my character to be more based around being able to talk his way out of situations, and this cut down the amount of fighting I had to do by quite a bit I think. It was a nice surprise to see this big game take this approach as I have not come across many that have; like wise, you can go guns blazing at all times if you want; although I would hate to see how your story ends out. Within Fallout New Vegas you have the main quest line which you follow from the very beginning of the game, right until the last moments in the game. Along the way you will pick up side quests, these take you away from the main story and lead you down little branches that allow you to explorer the world you are in and become completely immersed. There are so many little olive branches of side quests that you actually completely forget about the main quest after a while. Some of the side missions in this game are the most memorable I have ever played, helping ghouls escape on their great journey, liberating a power plant were among my favorites, but there are just so many to do, and I would highly recommend that people don't just rush through the main quest in New Vegas as you are going to miss out on hours and hours of content. While the graphics in New Vegas don't look like the graphics we have today in game; they can be enhanced with community made mods to get them up to and even better than any game you will ever play. I played my game completely vanila as it was my first ever run through; I was still happy with the way game looks in the vanilla state, it looks nice. You can get some pretty amazing screenshots from the remote locations you find. The game has varying levels of difficulty, you can play it on hardcore mode, or just on the regular easy, normal and hard modes. I played on normal mode so I could see the missions, story and explore the world without being too focused on min/maxing my character to be optimum at all times - although once I got the option to have Boone as my companion (a sniper), the combat in game takes a definite decrease in difficulty as he just rips through enemies in no time, sometimes you end up not even shooting at all before they are all dead.As you can see from the amount of time I have put into New Vegas, this is one of the biggest and most content heavy games you will ever see, and probably in our life times. You will never be bored; there is always something different to do, whether it be crafting potions, or just playing a little Black-Jack at the casinos - there is never a dull moment. I 100% recommend Fallout New Vegas to anybody. Even if you aren't a fan of RPG games. New Vegas will probably change your mind; this is easily now in my top 5 games of all time and I cannot believe I had not played it until now. If you haven't got New Vegas, get it, it's on sale quite regularly and if you do have New Vegas but haven't played it; please don't wait a second longer, boot this game up and get your self fully immersed in this absolutely perfect game. Easily one of the games of our generation.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												The 'real' Fallout 3 to a lot of members in the community, Fallout: New Vegas picks up where Fallout 1 and 2 left off by continuing to expand upon developments on the Western Coast of the United States in a post-apocalyptic world. The New California Republic is back, as is the Brotherhood and Enclave (or what remains of it). Veterans of the franchise will notice a few subtle nods to previous games in the franchise, such as Poseidon Energy and a few characters coming from locales in Fallout 1 and 2.Unlike Fallout 3, New Vegas maintains consistency in its lore with previous titles in the franchise. The Brotherhood is a reclusive organization rather than an army of ''do-gooders', the Enclave isn't the powerful organization it once was, and Super Mutants aren't all over the place for no reason. It's no surprise that the creators of Fallout : NV are also the minds behind Fallout 1 and 2, before the studio closed and Bethesda bought out the franchise. The post-apocalyptic world is still fresh in their minds and care was applied when creating the world and lore so that it meshes with previous entries.New to this entry is the faction system. Whereas Fallout 3 automatically made the Brotherhood the 'good guys' and you only had one choice in the ending (tamper with the Purifier or not), New Vegas lets you side with one of four factions, affecting the New Vegas power struggle and the ending. Whomever you decide to side with, they carry their own mainline quests to win control of the Hoover Dam. The faction system also carries it's own subset of reputation; a faction may despise you (attacking you on sight) or idolize you. Reputation is gained or lost by finishing quests for a faction and/or siding with them when presented with the option. When doing the mainline quests for a faction, you'll slowly lose karma with the others until you're attacked by them on-sight.Whilst siding with a faction for an ending is excellent, don't place too much thought on juggling reputations whilst exploring and doing sidequests. Whilst exploring the Mojave, its in your best interest to side with the NCR when presented with the option; they have camps all over the map, they account for at least 25% of all sidequests (estimate) and a potential companion (and his quest) requires NCR fame. The only factions you'll have to juggle rep with outside of the main quest arcs are the Legion and NCR, all other factions have peaceful resolutions if presented with an issue between the two of them. Most of the time it'll be a question of whether or not to fu*k over the Legion, since the quest will come from an NCR official. The Legion has ONE camp in the game (the other reached through the storyline), and no sidequests so always side against them. Don't worry, there's a point in the main storyline where negative rep is reset with either the Legion or NCR (or both), allowing you to do all sidequests and then side with the Legion in the main story.So it's a coin toss: either you appreciate the ability to do all sidequests in a single playthrough without having to worry too much about factions and reputation (which I believe), or you believe the system failed since it's effect outside of the main story quest arcs is non-existant. Perhaps the Brotherhood and Followers should've fought more, perhaps concurrent sidequests between two factions should've been introduced, forcing you to balance reputations. Or maybe you aren't a fan of having to play through a game multiple times, especially when you invested a ton of hours into one playthrough. What is clear is that the Legion, despite being an important faction in the game, has VERY little representation in the game. This is due to time constraints: with only 18 months in development Obsidian had to leave everything east of the Colorado River an unexplorable area, originally being Legion territory. There's also an entire western portion of the map blocked off by mountains, and the north eastern end of the map as well. The game also has a significantly lower amount of interiors (buildings you can go into) as compared to Fallout 3, and the Mojave wasteland is littered with meaningless locations (abandoned shacks, empty areas with no interiors). You don't have to look too far to see time constraints everywhere. All to the game's detriment: I would've preferred more interiors with PC terminals and notes delving into inhabitants lives or situations around the Mojave.Fallout 3 did exploration better: more interiors and towns. But Fallout NV does everything else better: lore, story, writing. Fallout NV is more of a Fallout title than Fallout 3 was, and if you're a fan of the franchise you'll love the care Obsidian put in handling its congruity with the other titles. If you really can't be bothered and are only interested in exploring, then Fallout 3 might be higher on your list. Whatever the case, NV's short development cycle and the quality of the end product is a testament to how skilled and dedicated Obsidian is to the franchise. Thumbs up, loved it more than FO3.			"

												The very first Fallout game I've played. I've been sitting here for maybe 15 minutes , thinking of something to write, but thanks to writer's block, I'm going to make this short and sweet:- It'll run well on pretty much any computer that's not 10 years old- It's fun and funny- If you like shooters or RPGs, I'd recommend this- If you like Skyrim, I'd suggest thisIf you do buy it, I just suggest one thing: Use the manual save, and only the manual save. If you're comfortable using the quicksave, go ahead- don't try and load off a quicksave though, only use it when in game. Don't use the autosave function, it's pretty unreliable.But it doesn't matter; everything comes down to this:I shot someone in the hand with a hunting rifle. He blew up. 10/10			"

												I'm going to Rewrite my Fallout: New Vegas review because my old one was monkey ♥♥♥.Fallout: New Vegas is in my top 5 favorite games of all time, and definitely my favorite post-apocolyptic world. Its one of the best open world games available and I can't recommend it more, full price or not. This is truely one of the greatest games of the last generation, and of all time. I played over 100 hours of FNV on my PS3, before I became a PC gamer. I've now put in 55 additional hours and I'm still not done with it. I'm not even close to playing through the amazing mods, and quests this game has. There is easily over 100 hours of content, without replaying any of it. Its absolutely unreal how much content is in this game and how fun it is to play it all.The Story of FNV starts with you getting shot in the head. Pretty weird start, but it works, it makes me interested. Why did I get shot? Who shot me? Why did he shoot me over [SPOILER DELETED]? You find all this out over the course of the story, that plays itself out greatly. On top of an indepth main quest, you have detailed side quests to go along with it. The side quests do a great job of tying the story together while also telling its own. I don't want to go on forever here, but if you want comparisons, the story in FNV is exponentially better than the story in Fallout 3. And I enjoyed the story in Fallout 3 quite a bit. The combat system works in an interesting way. While you do have the basic FPS mechanics, you also have VATS, which makes it work in sort of a psuedo-Turn based way. You target certain body parts, tell your guy to shoot, then he does. Its pretty satisfying, especially seeing an opponents head go flying in pieces off of his body. Pretty satisfying combat. I do wish sniping was done a bit better, I feel like when I'm trying to snipe opponents from far away, VATS doesn't really want to cooperate, which is unfortunate. Pretty much my only complaint about the combat. This last part isn't really about combat, but it is gameplay so I'll mention it here. The game implements a hardcore mode, which forces you to eat, sleep and drink along with making combat more difficult and companions killable. I've never done a full hardcore playthrough, but I do enjoy the mode for the most part. Killable companions is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t though, I use a mod to keep that part off.This is getting really long, so I'll make my last point about the world. This is probably the major weakness of the game, if I was to point out any. I don't really think there is anything majorly wrong with the world, but at the beginning it sort of feels like you can only go one way. If you try to go north, you're almost guarenteed to get slaughtered, unless you turn god mode on. Mid level(about level 15) and on, you can pretty much go anywhere in the world and you don't have to worry about dying. The world feels good and exploration is fun, but it definitely feels like its forcing a linear path for the first 1/4 of the main quest.Fallout: New Vegas is my favorite Single player FPS of all time, and if you've never played this gem, you should pick it up immediately. I promise, you'll love it. Buy At Full Price  "

I just found my new favorite thing to do in Fallout. I literally just downed all of the drugs, alcohol, and food in my inventory, and then i went around bashing people over the head with a hammer (the one that's made of a block of concrete). I took absolutely no damage and killed nearly everyone with one hit (I had also taken Nighteye, so it was extremely hard to see what i was doing, and i stumbled around viciously attacking walls many of the times).  Luckily for me, i happened to be in Fiend territory, and repeatedly ran into their camps. Needless to say, their camps were filled with drug stashes, allowing the fun to last indefinitely..... or so i'd thought.  My drug-fueled rampage ended when the withdrawal kicked in (for every drug), causing me to commit suicide by dumping all of my landmines in a large pile directly beside me, and then lighting it on fire. Mass murdered and then killed myself afterwards 10/10 "

												To review Fallout 3 or New Vegas is a difficult challenge. Not because their content is too hard but their expectations of what players want to enjoy are different. While seemingly similar in their mechanics, both games diverge in what players expect to enjoy in a ""Fallout"" game. If you have read my review of Fallout 3, then you know I consider New Vegas the more refined game. Traits, player-choice influenced quest-lines, the faction systems, and the gray morality are important factors for what makes NV so great. However, it's the world-building that puts NV as one of the finest examples of open-world games. As someone who has thought of open-world games as the death of narratives from the Ubisoft games to the missed opportunities of games like Risen, Obsidian has forever changed my opinion on their storytelling merits. NV doesn't tell the greatest story nor the smartest; it tells a world of tales of your interactions that shape the Mojave one grain of sand at a time.Nuka Cola or Sunset Sarsaparilla?Before I discuss the importance of NV's strongest suit, I do want to go over the improvements of NV. Many fans I think will consider liking F3 or NV to be something similar to the question, ""Coke or Pepsi?""While both games are mechanically the same, there are noticeable differences. For example, F:NV focuses more-so on the role-playing mechanics by making its perks more unique, sometimes beneficial with consequences or adding a new level of challenge. F3 simply focuses on numbers and how to make them better. I found that by Lv 43 my character in NV still had room for growth whereas my F3 character was maxed out before LV 13.Quests in NV seem more shorter and to the point than F3. (Admittedly, the travel time between each quest could be the reason for why they feel more brief in NV.) The Mojave is a more compacted, content-rich area than D.C. which might be great to some (like me) and a negative to others. What NV makes up for instead is how questlines can feed into other quests seemlessly by the player's exploration and choices.Even when it comes to the FPS mechanics, the iron-sights, weapon mods and various ammo types for every gun make the barebones gunplay of F3 much more tolerable. (I find the repair/ammo-crafting benches too restricting on junk to ever warrant using them.) I hardly ever use VATS in F3 or NV unless I want to get headshots on Deathclaws.Speaking of Deathclaws, enemies in NV are not leveled to the player from the get-go. They are given a fixed level—and scaling later—which makes enemies more consistent in NV. This change does come at the cost of making the early part of NV more linear as you have to loop around the road to get to Vegas as your first major quest-goal. However, like in Risen, the game tells you this through the enemies' difficulty and there are quests/paths along a more linear beginning than F3.I personally prefer the grim-humor flavor of the post-post apocalypse of the Mojave over the post-apocalypse consistency of D.C. Your taste may vary, but I hope to explain why NV is the superior game.It's All A Matter of ContextIf you have played a Bethesda game before, then you will more often notice a problem of its open-world design: The world always feels disjointed. Quests in Bethesda games have been focused on telling individual stories with little to no relation to one another. Tone-shifts, relevance to the over-arching storyline, and other narrative pitfalls suffer as a result. While some fans may enjoy this format, the result is a world that feels more lifeless by their lack of context.Fallout 3's main-questline is indicative of this problem. You go from exploring the Museum of Natural History to get a radar dish for a DJ, to wandering to a city made of a shipwrecked vessel to learn about your father's science project, then exploring a Vault with a murder-simulation program, and then later stumbling upon a society of children. In contrast, NV begins with the town of Goodsprings caught up in the much larger conflict of the Legion encroaching upon the NCR claimed settlements of the Mojave. A gang of escaped convicts harass the people of Goodsprings who have stolen their explosives from the NCR mining outpost of Sloan to exert their power. (The result being that the explosions have lured out Deathclaws along the road of Sloan.) This gang has taken the town of Primm under their rule as they fight off the NCR stationed there, and the gang's other settlement Nipton is under attack by the Legion.As seen in this one example, conflicts in New Vegas feed back into each other and expand upon the world it tells. This description of events is simply the background window-dressing to your actions as you can side with Goodsprings, the convict gangs, the NCR or the Legion. Your interactions stay within the story's guidelines of NV. Questlines also can link-back up with previous or new areas, and the order of these quests can be stories you create for yourself (ex. Jacobtown and Black Mountain). What can also be seen in this one example is the careful attention to details. Why are Deathclaws roaming Sloan? Why are the NCR defending Primm/Goodsprings? Even in its environmental design, there is a level of detail of the farming area of Goodspring to explain how a town can survive. Something that was utterly lacking in Fallout 3.The reward from all of this attention to detail is that the world of NV feels more alive than it actually is because the world makes sense. Are there still tone-shifts or missing details? Yes, especially with the cringe-worthy sexual tensions and swear-words. However, these moments are far less abundant and offer a dark sense of humor in a post-post apocalypse. ""I've Got Heartaches by the Number""I would be lying if I said I thought NV is absolutely perfect. While I praise the game's means of storytelling and of player-choices in the overall game there are some downsides that I think some people may enjoy. It took me years to be stubborn enough to play to Vegas because I was so used to F3's freeform exploration.The narrative hook of NV is not one to keep you invested if you don't care to learn more about the conflicts around the Mojave. Even then, the plot of the Courier is very sparse and not very personal. (On the otherhand, the freeform nature of the Courier lets you make him/her be whoever you want.)The rushed schedule of the game has had some impact on its development. F3's engine has really shown its age with how much NV has to restrict itself, whether it be the barren New Vegas or the amounts of gated loading screens. Not only are aspects like this have to be rushed but even some interactions aren't coded in.For example, when trying to set a truce between the NCR and the Brotherhood of Steel, if you had gotten rid of the previous Elder then the option for truce does not exist. It's not that the new one is arrogant and won't agree to it--the game is not programmed to understand that option. These type of instances are very, very, very rare but they are a stain on the freeform nature of the game. On the flipside, it is really telling how much trust Obsidian has with its player when the game has one--and only one--unkillable NPC, the Yes Man (aside from children and Victor in the early part of the game). Fallout 4 is littered with these unkillable NPCs while New Vegas offers multiple optional objectives/paths for almost every quest. If Obsidian was given more time to flesh out the game and on a better engine, then I think this game would be a perfect masterpiece. (In spite of its somewhat lackluster personal narrative.) Instead, it's a masterpiece with a few smudges you have to accept.With all these gripes being said... the day I stop counting that's the day my world will end. "

												Gameplay is amazing. Writing is incredible. Immersion is insane. The amount of choices YOU can make for yourself is unmatched (looking at you, Elder Scrolls). Kept alive and fresh by an *excellent* modding community. Get it. Also, the DLC storylines intertwine. They don't interact much, but it's all cohesive.Get it.Cons? Bugs. Unfinished content, woes of a rushed game. For example, Caesar's Legion (one of the three main factions) lacks as much ingame depth as the NCR (much ingame depth). Another example being Freeside's (outskirts of New Vegas) condition - cut content, seperated zones (there is a mod series called Freeside Open dedicated to restoring this).Update: Still has the best DLC of any game I've played recently, and on the whole I still recommend this over Fallout 3 and 4.

												-=-Hello! If anyone has read my reviews in the past, I'd just like to let you know that I follow a consistent pattern of playing at least 10 hours of any game I choose to review. So, without further ado, my Fallout New Vegas Review.-=-If you have played any of the Elder Scrolls games, you might be familiar of the famous RPG/Adventure game developers, Bethesda. They do an AMAZING job at creating medieval and sci-fi adventures that they are very well made storylines and well made graphics for four years ago. I think Fallout New Vegas is a great game, but the graphics and presentation are ugly. Its really not even an upgrade over Fallout 3, I would call it more of a downgrade. Bugs are small in amount, landscapes are varied, the open world populated, and many, many towns and cities to visit, including your very own Vegas. Okay, off of the specs: You start out in a small town with a gun, and you can get meat cleavers, baseball bats, plasma rifles, sniper rifles, a concrete club, etc. There are lots of choices on weapons.You have so many choices of armor, too. You will never get bored of character customization.Some horror aspects that will keep you waiting for the next combat. The worst I've experienced was walking through a rundown factory, killing weird creatures and invisible giants.GORE. Yes, I said gore with all caps. You can dismember people! Even when they're laying on the ground, dead, you can use your sledgehammer and slice arms and heads, yes heads, off of the corpses.Crippling aspects. Pretty neat, although weird in some ways. I shot a centaur with an incinerator (Flamethrower) and I crippled his tongue.Mutant creatures. Giant flies, scourpions, and geckos, etc, alongside and against eachother. (I was walking to a town called Prim, and a fly got mauled by a young gecko.)The exploration in this game is incredible. You can go through Vegas doing quests like taking down a large empire, repaying debts, etc. You can head to several different other towns, drink out of toilets to regain health, take down large bandit empires, and kill large geckos with pool cues.If you like the Elder Scrolls, this game is fun and enjoyable. 9/10 great game, accidentally deleted my level 12 character and I hate myself for that. (Spent 9/10 hours working on him. I had a sword and medium armor. freaked me out, I guess I can restart.)Anyways, thanks for reading my review, please rate if it helped, also comment on what you'd like to see in any other review, open for suggestions and will answer questions if needed. :)			"

Developers from Fallout 2 involved in the creation? Yes.Elements of the cancelled Van Buren (Black Isle's Fallout 3) finally brought to life? Yes.A mainstream roleplaying game that will challenge your intellect and emotions with superb writing and meaningful choices and consequences? Yes, yes, yes.For all intents and purposes, Fallout: New Vegas is the true Fallout 3 and the best sequel to Fallout 2 that one could expect given the troubled circumstances surrounding the series.Unfortunately Obsidian was stuck working with Bethesda's sub-par game engine and base mechanics, but they still managed to craft something worthy of following up Fallout 2. If you're a long time fan of the Fallout series, playing this will mostly make you forget about Bethesda's attempt aside from some mechanic problems that unfortunately carried over (problematic automatic weapons, for a big example.)Also worth noting is that Obsidian were only given around 18 months to finish this project. The fact that they managed to release what they did given the timeframe will never cease to amaze me.Lead developer JE Sawyer's mod (though I consider it a much-needed patch) is highly recommended for the best possible experience.Description/update notes for JE Sawyer's mod for a good idea of what it does: http://fallout.gamepedia.com/JSawyer "

												Fallout: New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic open world R.P.G. developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda Softworks. The game takes place in the year 2281 near a retro-futuristic version of Las Vegas following the Great War between the United States and China that occurred some two hundred years prior. For a grand total of two hours on Octorber 23, 2077 the earth was scorched in nuclear fire forever changing life on this planet as we once knew it. Presently, you're a courier tasked with delivering a package to New Vegas until you're suddenly intercepted by a gang led by a mysterious man who then shoots you in the head and leaves you for dead in a shallow grave AFTER relieving you of said package. Shortly thereafter, you're luckily found by a kindly robot named Victor who then takes you to a nearby settlement called Goodsprings where a doctor saves what's left of your life. After some much needed R & R the doctor, who was a former vault dweller, gives you a vault suit, a PipBoy 3000 and a weapon for protection and you begin your fantastic quest to find the man that shot you and retrieve that package...""They Went That-A-Way!"". Along the journey you will encounter your fair share of hostile raiders, strange situations, terrifying irradiated creatures and a plethora of interesting people to interact with. I have to say that this game is just stuffed with so much content and sidequests that you will find it very difficult to stay the course and concentrate on completing the main story without veering off the beaten path from time to time....to time and time again. Wandering around the Nevada wasteland, as dangerous as it may sound, is just such a joy to do in this superb open-world title.The gameplay is definitely one of the shining jewels in this titles heavy crown. The combat in Fallout: New Vegas is a blend of a first and third person shooter for the most part. How you tackle combat in Fallout: New Vegas is completely up to you and the style of play that you enjoy the most. Your character could be guns blazing and shoot up everything in sight, you could also opt for the stealth playthrough and take down your enemies with sniper rifles and close quarter sneak attacks or be a melee fighter and go hands or blade to body with your enemies. The combat can be quite fun and very challenging depending on what mode or method you choose to play. Also let us not forget one of the staples of the Fallout series, the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System or V.A.T.S. which is always something great to see in action. V.A.T.S. is an active pause combat system implemented in the game that allows the player to select specific body parts to target during combat. Gameplay-wise, finding things to do and creatures or people to fight in the Nevada wasteland will not be a problem...just pick a direction and start walking.  Fallout: New Vegas operates off the same game engine as Fallout 3 did so other than running slightly better than it's predecessor both titles have a very similiar look to them. Graphically, I really enjoyed this title when it first came out but as the years have passed it really began to show it's age and lack of visual fidelity in it's base form especially when compared to alot of today's games. However, with the fantastic community of superb modders available like with all Bethesda's outstanding open-world games, this is no longer a problem. With just a handful of graphical modifications your version of New Vegas will look absolutely beautiful in all it's High Definition glory. With that said, this is the type of open world game that you just want to spend hours walking or running around and exploring because it is gorgeous. Every settlement, every cave or ruin that you investigate all have a unique look to them. You definitely won't see any recycled environments in this game thank you very much Dragon Age II! The music is great and really captures the post apocalyptic and somewhat western theme of the title whether you're in a battle, exploring or in some type of dialogue with a denizen of the Nevada wasteland. Last but not least, the sound quality is also top notch and really immerses you within the gameplay.If you're a fan of the Fallout series or just an open-world roleplaying game enthusiast then this is a title that your library cannot do without. This game is truly one of the best in the genre and definitely one of the greatest of all the Fallout titles available. There is an ample amount of very good DLC to play as well as a grueling hardcore mode for the immersion fans. Fallout: New Vegas is filled with lore from the previous Fallout titles which is a very nice addition for true superfans of the series. Also, what with the massive modding community available for Fallout: New Vegas, the replayability of this game is tremendous. This is a title that you can enjoy for months if not years to come much like I have so you will definitely get your moneys worth out of this purchase. Fallout: New Vegas is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

												Day 1: Woke up in a doctors house, found myself in sweaty underwear, and was asked to sit on his couch and answer questions.Day 2: Opened the radio the doctor gave me, I think I've heard Johnny Guitar 500 times now.Day 3: Radio wont turn off, have now idolized Johnny Guitar.Day 46: I've been stuck in a cave for 42 days now, my only company is Johnny Guitar.Day 102: Succesfully developed a cult devoted to Johnny Guitar.Day 252: Radio died, I can't hear Johnny Guitars voice anymore, massive withdrawals.10/10 would go insane from hearing Johnny Guitar 1000000 times again.FOR REAL DOE ( ACTUAL REVIEW )      SPOILERSI SAID SPOILERS YOU CURIOUS CATGame never dissapointed all the way till the end (I'll get back to that). All of the DLC, and mini quests even were all very enjoyable, such a wide variety of ♥♥♥♥ to collect and do that you can put a solid 100 hours into one character without the addition of mods. Fallout is such a good game, but they really took a ♥♥♥♥ on my chest when it comes to the ending. Now I know a lot of people say that ""Oh I prefer it this way"", and then other people say ""It's better this way"", but the ending to Fallout New Vegas sucked donkey ♥♥♥♥, mmk. I had so many plans, I was going to discover every area in the game and complete every quest available prior to the ending, but you know what they did instead of let me do that? They gave me the option to revert to a pre-hoover dam battle save, or return to the main menu never allowing me to continue that character from the end of the game on. Finding out that there was no free-roam really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, regardless the game is very fun, but hey at least it doesn't give you a worse ending than Skyrim's. I suggest doing everything you want to do with the game pre end game cause you wont get to do it again, enjoy the game, and don't try to ""experiment"" with fisto.... please.			"

												I am the Courier.After I accepted a package to deliver, I found myself on my knees outside a village looking at a shallow grave. A man in a suit flipped a silver gambling chip and shot me in the head, telling me I had entered a game I had to lose. Like so many others, my story would have ended in blood.Except I didn't. My lifeless body was dragged to a doctor who patched me up. Sadly, my name and life was gone. All I knew was the face of the man, and the clothes given to me by the good doctor of Goodsprings. I don't know who I was, but I know who I am now. I am the woman who will have her revenge. As I stepped outside, I saw the good people of Goodsprings being ravaged by bandits. I took up my  9mm pistol, and told the leader to meet us. We would give him their prisoner. As they stepped out confidently, I shot them all in the head. The blood stained the sand red, but the bandits left Goodsprings alone. Taking some food and water, and as much ammo as I could carry, I took a hat off of one of the raiders and hunted down the rest of them in their sleep.I eventually came to the town of Primm; here I met the NCR. A large group of foreigners who told me what I could and couldn't do. Wanted to help, but didn't do anything. Unbound by their rules, I picked a rifle out from their bed and, at night, rescued the locals. I supported the new Sheriff in Primm's independence. The NCR was only willing to watch; cowards, the lot of them.I later came across more of them; content to sit, drink and complain, I learned of the situation of the Mojave desert and began to fix the problems; they thanked me, paid me, took the credit, and continued to spend their time guarding a road going nowhere. They had built a great statue, but did no great deeds.I then moved along the path, following the clues about the fancy man with the fancy chip, until I came across a town on fire. Outside a group of people fought over yellow bottle caps; I killed them all and took their caps for myself. Strange. Stranger still was the townsfolk nailed to crosses as their homes burnt; a town of the dead. Legionaires of Caesar came to me, and asked me to carry on their message. All shall be equal before Caesar. I remembered these words.When I came to Novac, I found a town terrorized by stalkers in the night and electricity stolen by the NCR. As I saved them, I taught them to stand alone. I met the NCR at the power station; obsessed with taking the power from the people and feeding it to the strong of the desert, I sabotaged their efforts and gave the power of the sun to all of the people. I winked at my fellow co-conspirators of the Fellowship of the Apocalypse, and continued on my way.At a trading post in the middle of nowhere, I met Veronica. Beautiful, if eccentric, she was as alone as I was in this desert. She told me of the threats the Mojave faced; her own Brotherhood nearly wiped out by the aggressions of the NCR. We travelled together, learning of the plights of the people in the Mojave.As we moved along, we came across the poor gathered outside new Vegas. The Fellowship of the Apocalypse agreed with my thoughts, that those in power cared little for the Mojave beyond resources and manpower. We killed the local drug dealers, killed the troublemakers, wiped out the Kings for creating a civil war, and once peace reigned, continued my bloody path to my gorey conclusion.As I looked upon the wealth of New Vegas, I saw the rich and powerful live a life beyond the imaginings of any outside. I found my man in his suit, ""Benny"". Surrounded by guards, he warned me off. I hadn't come this far to fail, however, and a few fevered whispers in his ear had him meet me in his room. Alone, I took my pleasure from him, and with his shaving knife, cut his throat in his sleep. That was the first night I slept well, although I needed a shower upon my awakening.I discovered his secret; a robot that could change the whole game to my rules. Not a brutal conquerer like Caesar, not the haughty expansionists of the NCR, nor the greedy self-interest of House; no, Yes Man provided a new way. Our own way. My travels taught me that only in true Chaos could the strong rise and lead the Mojave for itself; not as a battery for an empire nor as a farm for the rich. That was what I told myself as I walked through the rivers of blood.The White Hands family was first, high airs and low appetites, I smiled as I cut my way through them, executing them with the same gun Benny tried to execute me with. Then the Omertas, typical schemers; they screamed as I murdered them in their beds.Instead, I put the power into the hands of the people; the Boomers, remants of those before, I brought their dreams to life. I gave the Brotherhood back to those who would see it's power restored, partly for my philosophy, partly because Veronica had been my partner through everything and I would see her dreams come true as well.I then found the Sierra Madre, a dead land with untold riches. Finding it ruled by the mad, I killed the King of the Dead for my partner's sanity and the safety of the Mojave, and left this damned place to rot in the clouds of poison. Alone and silent.I found Mt. Big, the hope for the future from the past. Dusty, unused relics, I crushed their rotting brains beneath my boot. Our future would be our own; the past had already failed us, as my past had failed me.To the north, I found Zion; a man had returned to his people having seen the failures of empires, and despite the bleating of pacifists, I forged these people into a strong ally for the Mojave; they, like we, shall be independent.Finally, I took control of New Vegas; as the NCR and the Legion of Caesar fought, we executed our coup. A grand army of independence, from the many I had helped, came to free our land from the bear and the eagle. We drove off the Legion; and when the NCR came for their blood prize, I had their leader thrown from their bloody ambitions to his death.The Mojave is free, and shall stay free. Even after I leave.

												Hands down the best game I've ever played. I love it more than I love my family. ""Three crippled limbs, haven't slept in four days, no ammo left and hunted by the Legion. But atleast my spurs go Jingle, Jangle, Jingle.﻿"" It's a perfect RPG with a perfect amount of everything you want. Unlike Fallout 4, you actually have more than 4 choices of dialogue, and the ability to make up your own story. I usually end up using revolvers and repeaters, since I'm pretty much obsessed with cowboys. The amount of really good side quests is incredible. Some of them are even more interesting than the entire story of Fallout 4. Although, in my opinion it is easier to gain playtime in Fallout 4. What about the DLC's? The DLC's, well, they are as amazing as you'd expect from Obsidian. Honest Hearts my favorite, since I love the landscape of Utah and the story of the Burned Man. Old World Blues however, made me laugh as much as I have never laughed at a game before.Lonesome Road and Dead Money? They are gold aswell (literally). The soundtrack is the best. Ever. I've been listening to the music from day 1 since I got the game, and I know the lyrics to most, if not all the songs. It's quite surprising how you won't get tired of them. Also, Mr. New Vegas. It's impossible not to love him. <3How about factions, do they beat the Brotherhood of Steel or The Institute?Hell ♥♥♥♥ing yes, any day, any time. The conflict between the NCR and Ceasar's Legion is far more interesting and immersive than the BoS vs Institute thing. I'm a bit of an NCR patriot myself, heheh.  Never been a fan of lynching and burning people alive. ""Crashes by the number,Glitches by the score,Everyday you love me less,Each day I love you more."" Let's talk about mods. Oh, lovely mods. If you're getting a Fallout because of the mods, this is the one for you. You can (and should) customize your game entirely using them. I'm running 100+ mods now and it's not even that much. The problem is getting the game to work with all of them though, it can be pretty frustrating.New Vegas is nostalgically depressing but it's surprisingly a great feeling.﻿So, should you put 60 dollars into buying a failed Fallout game or spend 20 bucks on one of the best games ever made? The choice is up to you. I'd get this game though.Edit #1Please, vote for this game to win the ""Test of Time"" award. Obsidian deserves it.			"

												Where do I even begin with saying that this is a really stonking great game.Let's just start with some history: Fallout New Vegas is the Fallout 3 that should have been. At least, most of the elements that make their appearance in New Vegas were actually of the original Fallout 3, which was canceled when it was almost finished by Bethesda so they could make their own 3, which wasn't as amazing as it could be in several factors, and fell quite short of its numbered predecessors, to say the least. Fallout New Vegas is pretty much more of a Fallout 3 than the actual Bethesda Fallout 3 was, so calling it Fallout 3.5 isn't doing it any justice whatsoever.Plus, Fallout 3 runs quite badly on the PC partly due to GFWL and apparently is even more crash-happy, so there is that.On to the actual game, it is incredebly enormous in size. I bet that you easily will sink upwards of 50 hours in it at least. If you just take your time and explore like me, expect well over a hundered of hours of gameplay on your first run. The game world feels huge, with way more than enough places to discover. Also, it has a gigantic list of quests, so yeah, this game is going to give you some real bang for your bucks. Evenmoreso with the Ultimate Edition, which covers every piece of Expansion Pack/ DLC with it, which ups the game length very reasonably, and brings enough stuff to the table to make it worthwhile. Not only do you get to go to entirely different locations which will feel entirely different to the Mojave Wasteland, but they all bring enough new in-stuff to the table which is also useable outside the Expansion Pack arenas. Have I mentioned yet that this game has a gigantic amount of weapons?Seriously, I cannot remember another game that has such a gigantic and varied arsenal of weapons to use. True, it is partially due to the Expansion Packs bringing a part of it to the table, but even without it is bigger than Fallout 3, and with the expansion packs, it absolutely makes Fallout 3 looks like a dwarf if you compare the two. The only thing Fallout 3 has weaponwise what New Vegas doesn't is the Rock-It Launcher, but that is about the only thing.Even if it isn't graphically amazing and it is made on an extremely rickety engine, GameBryo, which really should be replaced next-gen and is still a bit glitchy, it is still really acceptable, and hey, graphics aren't the most important things in a game.Story's pretty great too. It all starts off getting capped in the face by someone looking like Bugsy Siegel, if he wasn't shot in the face (yet) and wasn't living in a post-apocaliptic Nevada/ Las Vegas,  you wake up a week later and decide to pay this gentleman a visit, where ever he might even be, to have a very stern talk with him. What's more, is that there are multiple big factions duking it out for power over the Mojave and New Vegas, and it is all your choice who's gonna come out on top, by what means necessary... Or you just decide to take it all for yourself. Voice Acting is pretty well too mostly. Just don't expect the nameless NPC's to say something amazing.Darn, hear me rambling about this game, and I've probably haven't even covered a small part of it! In short, this is a quality game, the Ultimate Edition is where you should go for, and it is really dirt cheap during event sales (like 5 bucks in the Summer Sale) , and you really should pick it up, for a game of this calibre it is practically theft.

												One of the best games I've ever played.My experience of the game in a nutshell: - Speech is OP - Trying to be a good guy is really hard when it gets near to the end of the game - Punching is also OP when you happen to have a robotic hand. If not, don't even think about it - VATS doesn't differentiate friend from enemy so if you're using it quickly it IS possible to go from fighting on one side of a huge battle to being violently abused by enough soldiers from both sides to make you wonder whether they've been killing each other at all - There is a comedian next to one of the doors on the Strip. His line about not being able to get to sleep WILL help you pick up girls in real life - 'Side' quests can be ridiculously long-winded, but worth it - Everything you eat is irradiated, so I survived on hardcore drugs alone. Don't try this at home kids10/10 Would spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to find a sniper rifle again.			"

												I decided to take down my negative review and try to stabilize the game and write a positive review something that this game deserves!Pros:- Replayability Value- Multiple ways to solve quests- Ammo Crafting and Ammo Types- RPG elements - Interesting Factions- Lore- Roleplay-ability- Awesome Radio Songs- Achievements aren't disabled if you use mods- Fun mini-games that are very rewarding- Cheap- No Settlements and Preston Garvey- Mods for everything! And I mean EVERYTHING! Combat, Power Armor, Faction Armor, Throwing Weapons! You can have everything that Fallout 4 did good in Fallout New Vegas!- Great DLCsCons:- Locked at 2GB RAM (You can increase it up to 4 with a mod)(That's the only con I can think of)As a new player in the Fallout universe and Fallout 4 being my first I can assure you that this game is propably the best in the series (I haven't played the classics so i exclude them)! Hell I even unlocked all achievements! The mod community is one of the best I've seen so far alongside the Skyrim mod community!10/10 Best Fallout (excluding the classics)!			"

												One of the greatest RPG games of all time (In my Opinion)Lots of people say Fallout 3 is better, I admit it is hard to decide between the two. Positives	 Fallout 3 had a better atmosphere compared to Fallout New Vegas, it actually felt less of a Wasteland in New Vegas, less of a gritty and depressing feeling and more of a Cowboy, Western feel.The Story in Fallout New Vegas is utterly Amazing. It can go many ways depending on who you side with later on in the game which brings me to another point, later on in the game you have much more choice and freedom on which path to take, which allies you want aiding you, who you don't want to work with... etc.The Game starts off very slow paced, a bit like any RPG and is most likely the part where most people are going to turn it off at, but once you get going it becomes addicting, the Characters are detailed and some of the guys you encounter you will either like or hate.Fallout 3 had 20 Levels (NO DLC) and 30 Levels (WITH DLC) so if you thought that was too little, you will be glad to know that Fallout NV has 30 Levels (NO DLC) and 50 Levels (WITH DLC).Many people argue that Fallout 3 had a bigger map, this may be true I'm not sure but I feel that FONV has more unique locations to visit. I also found the DLC in FONV much more interesting than FO3. It wasn't a case of... ""I just want to finish this damn DLC so I can get the items"". Last thing is, there are Factions which weren't in the previous game which is pretty damn cool. Once again opening a path for your character on who to side with. (Legion FTW ^^)You can at least create attachments for your guns in this game, unlike Fallout 3Tons of mods which spices the gameplay up A LOT Negatives	 The only downside to this game is that it of course uses the same engine as FO3 so it may feel a bit outdated, along with the graphics (Not like they matter, sadly they do for some people).One thing that annoys me the most about this game is the fact you cannot work alone later on in the game, you must have the aid of someone else if you choose to... SPOILERS >>>  Take over Vegas	 Once you hit max level, it gets really boring. All you can really do is do the side quests and explore. Conclusion Great game, definitely buy it. Worth way more than the price it is. 9/10			"

												Now this..... this is a Fallout game.Don't get me wrong, I 'liked' Fallout 4....But I LOVE New Vegas.While actual gunplay and animation is mediocre, the characters, world and story is what keeps this game as one of the best of the last generation, and one of the best in the Fallout series. Bethesda should've taken notes from Obsidian, but the newest installment just doesn't live up to its name, compared to Fallout: New Vegas.You're not a concerned parentYou're not a middle aged white protagonistAnd you're not looking for an oversized maggot character model that we're supposed to call a childYOU, good sir/madam, are a FORMER courier from Primm, a settlement in the Mojave Wasteland, left for dead by some rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ high roller wannabe. You wake up in a tumbleweed settlement named Goodsprings, and go out to claim your revenge, and shape yourself to be WHO YOU WANT TO BE and the world AS YOU SEE FIT. While you may be the best in some aspects, this game will assure you that you are NOT a god on earth, or a wasteland deity, but just a guy or girl that is just good at what he/she does in order to survive and leave an imprint on post-apocalyptic America.There is no 4 choice dialogue crap, there is no binary form of morality in terms of how you play and impact the world, nor are there any quests that are just there for grinding.Your story is A STORY, and it is up to you to make the best of your time in the Mojave Wasteland from the beginning, to the end.Ladies and gentlemen, in the end, this game brings to you an excellent story, RPG mechanics, characters, a breathing world, plenty of diversity, and so much more that if you choose this over FO4, I can assure you that you are not missing on anything, but rather are making the smartest decision. This games needs you. And when you boot it up, it will not bound some of your choice with Bethesda's chains, but greet you with open arms, and welcome you into New Vegas in hopes that you will, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it you will, enjoy your stay.

												Fallout: New Vegas is one of my favourite games of this generation. It takes the fundamentals of the classic Fallout games and puts them into the Fallout 3 engine, giving fans of the original games a true successor. Developed by Obsidian Entertainment, New Vegas was created by a company that houses many people who worked on the original Fallout series, and whose strengths are writing and solid role-playing mechanics, and it shows. The writing throughout New Vegas is phenomenal, and no matter what type of character you want to play, the game was made with you in mind. You constantly feel rewarded for your choices. Hardcore mode also allows you to play more of a survival game, having to get food, water, and sleep. For a real challenge, check out the mod Josh Sawyer (lead designer) made for the game. It takes hardcore mode to a whole new level.I also highly recommend playing all of the downloadable content for New Vegas, since it has the best DLC suite I've ever experienced. Each of them is brilliantly crafted, expanding the story of New Vegas in interesting ways. Furthermore, the DLC is foreshadowed throughout the main game, and the DLC can cause changes in the main game as well. If you only get the DLC for one game, make it this one.I can't recommend this game enough.			"

												If you haven't played this game yet on PC than what are you doing?With improved gameplay and dialogue desicions that make it vastly superior to fallout 3 but also the exploration didn't feel as tedious or boring due to enough variety in the locations to make each area unique and feel part of the mojave wasteland.Even though two out of the four main dlcs are actually quite solid (honest hearts and old world blues) the modding community has helped to make this games lifespan survive longer than what Obsidian ever could do. With new weapons (some inspired by other games), texture packs, quest lines and new areas to explore it means that their is much more to do in the land of the mojave.Fallout 3 was my childhood RPG but New Vegas is my personal preference of a Role Playing game where your character is actually the main focus on how the world changes around you.Would recommend a solid 9.5/10			"

												If you like Adventure RPGs like i do, you're going to love this gamePros:-I'll start with the most creative way to start a game.-Unique Characters that you won't see in any other game (Specially if you get the DLCs).-Different kinds of weapons:Wanna kill a bandit with an antenna, go for it!Do you wish yo slash bugs with a fire convered sword, hack em all!Want do duel people in a Western Cowboy style? V.A.T.S with that.Wanna blow up an entire factory filled with super mutants, blow em up!Wanna unload an entire clip killing an entire town, be my guest.Want to exterminate an entire army of Robo-Scorpions with a Mini-nuke, as long as you don't kill yourself, DO IT IS FUN!But take care of your weapons, the get dammaged over time.-Expansive World to explore (I haven't found all the locations yet).-Thousands of Quests to do (Believe me, i have more that 50 hours and i still haven't finished the main quest because of the secondary quests, plus the DLC ones).-Amazing Soundtrack-The quantity of mods is astonishing (From super inmersive mods that would kill you faster than a Dark Souls playthough to Kinky mods for kinky people ;) ).Big 8 Hours long DLCs (Each) with challenges for those that call themselves ""OP"".Cons:-Limited Character Customization (Nothing a good mod can't fix though).-Level cap to 30, but you can add 5 more level per DLC you get, untill you get a total of 50 (Like i said before: nothin' a good mod can't fix).Fallout: New Vegas is a game that is really worth buying, is fun, gives you an adventure feeling you might be looking for, or just a game to kill Monsters, Super Mutants, Humans, Animals, etc.If you are looking for any of this things, Fallout: New Vegas is a game made just for you. 9.5/10			"

												War, War never changes. But Bethesda has.When Fallout 4 Launched, those who survived did so in Fallout 3. When the steam reviews rolled out the community set out across the ruins of the old franchise to build new mods. As 48 hours past, what had been the Fallout community, united underneath the flag of the New Fallout Republic, dedicated to old Fallout values of non-voice acted protaganists and actual RPG elements. As the Republic grew, so did it's age, modders spread east seeking better storylines and Intellegint speach options the dryer mercilless expense of the Fallout franchise could offer. They returned with tales of a game untouched by Fallout 4's terrible launch that have scorched the rest of the world and a great wall of its mods spanning the Fallout Nexus site. The NFR mobilized its army and sent it east to occupy the Fallout 4's steam page and restore it to negetive reviews that actually made sense. but across the Nexus another society had arrisen under a diffrent flag. A vast army of Fanboys who had never played an RPG in their life. Forged from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ communities of COD and just about every EA game, Todd's Legion. 4 days have passed since the Republic held the steam page just barrely against the Legion's fake possitive reviews. The Fanboys did not retreat. across the Nexus the legion gathers strength. Dialoge options release, re-textures come out. Through it all Fallout: New Vegas, stayed open for buissness under the control of it's mysterious overseers obsidian entertainment and their army of rehabilitated fanboys.You are a reviewer hired by IGN to deliver a review for Fallout 4.

												It's been a few years since I've played this game, but still it comes up in conversation for what it did right, and how it left it's mark on meFor me, good writing is the truly vital part of any game that hangs the world, and by extension- the gameplay, off of a strong narrative. So many games are written like a book that's then interpreted into a game, there's rarely any crossover, and if there is any, it's usually contrived. Fallout 3 springs to mind.New Vegas isn't like thatFor example, one faction, caesar's legion, was a thorn in my side for many hours. I read what they did, I heard from people how they did it, I saw for myself the effects they had. Eventually through the story they offended me enough that I got my gun, went to their camp, and killed every last one, caesar included. Right after, I tracked down a person they famously tortured and mutilated close to death years earlier -totally on my own volition mind- and the very first thing you can tell him is that Caesar is dead. He has outlived his closest enemy.I was a courier for my own delivery. The fact I could do that tells me an awful lot about the writing of this game. They understood the Courier. They understood me, the player.From there it only got better, mostly in the DLC stories. One taught me that sometimes it's best to just let go. Another taught me to respect my role as a courier, to think about the results of my actions and to see things from another perspective.I realized in horrifyingly clear terms, that by giving in to my anger and desperation by killing the people I hated, I was no better than the people who dropped the bombs that ended the world. This wasn't forced or even directly addressed, this was something I actually did, and I changed as a result. I now understood why the burned man wasn't happier that I had killed caesar. This same righteous hatred put him in bandages years earlier.Having some of the biggest plot points be informed by what type of game this is, how the player might play it, that has the largest impact. That is what makes this game special. There are ideas, not just dialogue and conversations with X or Y result. The writer's must have actually played the game.By the end, I was faced with the final big decision, to decide the fate of the mojave.I considered my effect on history, what all sides wanted and why, what the people and their stories on my journey had taught me; what ulysses had told me. And finally, next to the hoover dam, I made the best possible decision for everyone.I let go. I stopped playing.And I never went back.			"

Heartaches by the numbers, troubles bythe score- everyday you love me less,each day I love you more~-Day 1 without Miss NovocaineShe's left me. After five years of beinga couple with her since entering highschool, my girlfriend has left me.I am horribly depressed, but I beginmy ritual of logging into Steam in themorning. The Fallout Franchise Saleis in full swing, and New Vegas temptsme so. I consider buying the game.I believe I am going through somethingakin to withdrawal symptoms. I miss hertouch, her laugh, her smile. My handsgrasp air, as I swear I can still smellMs. Novocaine's scent about my bed.I break down, crying. Ms. Novocaineleft me on the first day of the holidays,the time before college. My plans withher up in smoke, I blubber and buy theUltimate Edition of New Vegas.Fallout: New Vegas downloads fastenough. I begin the game with a bulletthrough my head, buried alive and leftfor dead. The game opens up its storyneatly and cleanly, telling me I was justan everyman hired to do a job whichwent horribly downhill. The world is now mine to explore, whatwith me having cheated death and theoptions to pursue multiple paths haveopened for me. With trusty six-shooterin hand, I leave the dusty backwatertown I recovered from my beating inand venture into the bleak world onthe frontier.-Day 15 without Miss NovocaineI have become a veritable recluse. In thetime that has passed, the feelings for Ms.Novocaine have not dulled, but my heart aches even more for her. How can this be?She's started seeing a lanky, fashionableart student. Then a new, stereotypicalbiker bad-boy. I hear she's begun sleepingabout. My heart breaks a little more witheach shred of news I overhear.In New Vegas, my vengeance is tenfold.I brandish and alternate between a lever-action cowboy shooter and a revolverwhich would make Ocelot approve.I undertake multiple quests, but stickto the main quest to restore the fortunesof my employer, the mysterious Mr. Houseand his casino the Lucky 38. I encounterboth the NCR (New California Republic)and the savage Caesar's Legion, led bythe terminally dying Emperor Caesar.-Day 30 without Miss NovocaineI've completed a good chunk of the mainstoryline by playing two sides between theNCR and Mr House's outlying Casino forces.Perhaps on my next playthrough, I shall bea cruel sadist and throw in with the Legion.No matter, the DLC of the game shall keepme company on these cold nights alone.I instantly regret playing Dead Money first,as I soon discover that compared to the others which are of incredible quality, it isDead Money that is the most exceptional.After a few tears sting my eyes at the endof Dead Money, I dive into Honest Hearts,and meet the enigmatic Burned Man at histable of seemingly endless M1911s. His mission clear and his soul reborn, theBurned Man extends his hand out to me so that I may join in his crusade against the savage White Legs tribe, allies of Caesar's Legion.-Day 45 without Miss NovocaineI've done it. I've returned to the main storyand fought the final battle at Hoover Damagainst the new leader of Caesar's Legion,the towering and brutal Legate Lanius.Armed with all that I can carry and drapedin an NCR Ranger's trenchcoat and Chinese Stealth Helmet, I finish the leader of theLegion on behalf of Master House with mynow-signature Revolver.I still have two more DLCs to complete, Old World Blues and Lonesome Road,where the latter serves as an epilogueto my character's original story from themain game. I stifle a yawn and take a long hard look at myself in the reflection of my monitor as I put my computer to 'sleep' mode.Time I got some sleep myself.-Day 65 without Miss NovocaineFinished Lonesome Road last night, andhere I am stifling more yawns in the lineto apply at College on this hot Mondaymorning. A good epilogue after all thathappened in Fallout, but I did wish thatthe main villain, 'Ulysses' would havejust shut up rather than droned on as hedid in Lonesome Road.My mind wanders to Ms. Novocaine as Itry to remember any shred or scrap I canof her. It frustrates me to no end that Ican barely remember, especially after allthe time we've spent together. Did NewVegas really help get over my flightyex-girlfriend? Surely not...Lost in my thoughts of Ms. Novocaineand considering replaying Fallout: NewVegas from a different perspective, I failto see the pale perfection of a girl, dressedin gothic petticoat and corset and daubedin black, blue and silver, knocking intoher and throwing her application papersabout.Dumbstruck, I apologize profusely, buta stare which could stop a clock tickingfrom her hazel eyes meet mine. She blowsa stray blue lock of hair away from hereyes and pays no attention to me.""I'm- I'm so sorry- I was just thinkingabout my application, and Fallout, and-""She perks up at the mention of Fallout,while kneeling down to retrieve herpapers. ""...the Fallout sale? I thought itended already?"" I tell her about howI've been playing it since the sale, andhow well it's been, as both a game anda journey of self-reflection.""What course you apply for?"" She tersely says. It sounds more of a demand. I gulpa bit, intimidated by this beautiful girlwho seems dangerous and skilled. I tellher I applied for Arts and Psychology.The girl has a deadpan look now, beforeshe breathes out in boredom. ""Huh. Itseems we're going to be classmates, loser."" She's collected her papers,but I manage to grab hold of her bookthat she dropped in the commotion.""Let me carry your things. It's the leastI can do."" I tell her, as I feel a fierce heatwell up behind my cheeks. ""Please. Letthis loser make up for his clumsiness,Miss...?"" She scowls, before handingme all of her papers and strutting off.""Come on, Fallout Boy. I don't have allday."" She beckons, her voice laced withirritation. She almost looks beautiful, asbeautiful as Ms. Novocaine was, if notmore so. ""Walk me home while carryingall my things. Then... then maybe I'llforgive you, and add you on Steam.""My heart leaps now, and I suppress a smile, bounding after her so I can walkin step with her. After a time along thesidewalk, I finally muster the courageto ask her.""What's your username on Steam?""She flicks my forehead before skippingahead of me, flashing what I wouldcome to know as her signature smile.""It's _Summer-Rain_.""I bid Ms. Novocaine farewell under mybreath and I smile to myself at havingbought Fallout: New Vegas.Heartaches by the numbers, troubles bythe score- everyday you love me less,each day I love you more~ "

												Honestly, having played Fallout 3, Fallout NV with all the DLCs and recently Fallout 4..NV really stands out as the game that captures the spirit of the Fallout universe the best.It can be a tough game to get into if you're not used to what Fallout is about.In short, you can do anything you want in no real particular order, the NV universe is big and diverse, and allows for plenty of hours of amazing gaming. You'll have some emotional moments (especially in the DLC..), some WTFmoments, and you'll have loads of laughs.For me, this is a must have for every gamer. Just buy it :)			"

												I, along with an unfortunately large number of people, was not too fond of New Vegas when it was released. My original review was littered with complaints about bugs, issues, uneven difficulty, and so on. However, with Fallout 4 on the horizon, I think I'm going to miss Obsidian. They have (or had) an understanding of what I appreciate most about the series, and it took me almost five years to realize it. Don't know what you got till it's gone? When it comes to the post-apocalyptic wasteland; once you've seen one bombed-out building filled with skeletons, you've seen them all. I got my fill of ""destroyed-beauty"" in Fallout 3. I expect something a little more intriguing. New Vegas creates a more thoughtful world. The characters are interesting, the stories are imaginative, and there's always that superb twist of dark humor. It ain't pretty though, and I mean that in every sense of the word. Speaking from a strict game-design perspective, the Mojave is amazing. There's a linear structure, which works well for first-timers. In subsequent play-throughs you'll know where to go, how to get around those freakin' cazadores, and create your own path. If you focus entirely on the main quest-line, the average play-through is roughly 5-10 hours. Naturally, once you factor in all of the additional content (side-quests, DLC, mods, etc) that time balloons into absurdity. I think it's perfect. I also really appreciate that this game doesn't employ level-scaling. But the Mojave is not only a desert, it's also a desert that suffered through a nuclear war. Even New Vegas itself is just a few casinos and some lights. If you didn't notice the details, you'd think it was the blandest place imaginable.The details are where New Vegas absolutely shines. Each ""dungeon"" has a story to tell, some (like Vault 11) are among the best the genre has conceived. It helps to pay attention to posters, and even subtleties like what somebody was holding before they died, or how some everyday objects are arranged. This is what I appreciate the most from Fallout's jump to 3D. Though I have a soft spot for reading a paragraph of text when I right-click on a broken vent, sometimes I just want to be able to see that it is in fact a broken vent and move on. Not only are there multiple endings, there are also several methods for getting to them. Every quest has numerous solutions, and if you can't be bothered, then just crack skulls until you're allowed to progress. The faction system is also quite interesting (especially now that it works), and it's nice to have actual consequences. Bethesda's obsession with essential NPCs drives me insane. Diplomacy is also extremely effective. Not only can you talk people out of fighting, but you can talk people into fighting for you. In a couple play-throughs, I sat back while my allies did all of heavy-lifting, even for the climatic Hoover Dam battle. On the flipside, there isn't any ""benefit"" to playing a stupid character. This is the unfortunate side-effect of higher production values. Everyone has to be voice-acted, and there's no time to record hundreds of lines to satisfy low-intelligence play-throughs. Playing an idiot in Fallout 2 was so much fun. The combat mechanics are...well they're still rather poor. This is something that I've grown to accept with this game. We can't expect all games to be at the level of FEAR 1 when it comes to shooting, but FO3/NV are content with barely passable. After all these years though, I guess I've just grown tired of pointing it out. I never paid much attention to combat in the 2D Fallout games. It might be considered strategic, but for me it's only entertaining when I knock a chunk out of somebody with a sledgehammer, critically hit someone with an advanced karate move that kills them instantly, or shoot their eyes out with limited edition red ryder BB gun. Basically, when I get into a fight in Fallout, I only care about the results. I punch someone, someone turns into dog food, and that's good enough.Since this is a review of a Bethesda game on the PC, I might as well talk about mods. With Skyrim, I got almost all of my enjoyment through modding. With New Vegas? It isn't really necessary. There are a handful of mods that I think are essential: New Vegas Stutter Remover*, Mission Mojave, and Project Nevada. Once you grab those, you're pretty much set. Now I'm not saying that's all you'll ever want in terms of mods, but it's more than sufficient for playing and enjoying the base-game. The only other notable mods I have installed are A World of Pain and Daughters of A.R.E.S. AWOP adds hundreds of dungeons, which can be fun to shoot through. I have ARES installed because the courier is actually a cool-looking robot with anime-colored hair. This is totally immersive and most certainly canon. Also when playing New Vegas, instead of listening to ""Starrrrrrrrs of the midnight rangers"" for the billionth time, I listen to non-stop Eurobeat.In short: I have a new-found appreciation for this awesome game. *Mission Mojave might make this mod unnecessary, I'm not sure.

												This is by far my favorite Fallout game. (Just after Fallout 2)The intro is short and to the point.. No info who your dad is, or your mom, or your childhood friends, or just about everything that could ruin your character building. Here you wake up after being shot in the damn face by someone who wants to take the package you were supposed to deliver. You then wake up with your personal mission to track down the man who did this ♥♥♥♥ and if you chose a female... well. just do that and choose the Black Widow perk.. You'll laugh. And while your trying to find that guy, you'll probably notice how much nicer the world looks now, not as boring anymore either. Side quests are a lot fun, except some usual ""Go to Point A, now go to Point B, now go to Point A again"" quests.. they are a little annoying as they offer no real sense of accomplishment other than some XP rewards and maybe a small amount of caps. (But you can kind of expect those in a RPG game.) Resources can also be quite rare in this game, like Stimpacks and drugs. (If you've played Fallout 4 you'll probably know how common they are in that game) This offers a nice feeling of being out of supplies constantly.. which is always appreciated, as finding items now feels a lot better, and it also helps the roleplaying and the overall immersion.. and holy ♥♥♥♥ is this game immersive. The music helps greatly! and the overall atmosphere in a lot of places just makes you sad.. seeing corpses and briefcases and their items they had on them before the bombs.. The atmosphere is amazing here. And the leveling is rewarding. And all the perks seems very useful which makes it hard to choose. Oh and also.. The sense of progression is once again just fantastic. When you first start.. almost every enemy is scary.. Deathclaws are horrifying, Casadors are poisonous a-holes and you just need to stay away from those.. Then at level 20 you can take on the Casadors with just a rifle shot or two. Then at level 30 you'll just go up close to the Deathclaws with a Hunting Shotgun and blow off their faces.. One major problem I have.. is the Invisible Walls.. They're some of the most annoying things I've ever ""seen"" in an open world rpg.. They really want you to take specific paths to quests and other areas.. you're not allowed to find shortcuts by jumping on rocks or anything else that would seem logical to climb.. which just pisses me off when I should easily be able to pass over a little rock but there's an invisible wall in the way.. and sometimes they'll literally get you stuck inside them for some weird reason. Also some quests are bugged to hell and back. Which was never fixed, so I'd suggest installing some mods for that. Here's a list of what is good yo! Weapons, A lot of the quests, Progression, Perks, Dialogues, Enemies, Weapon Modifications. Fantastic!			"

												Somewhere between convincing a young boy to hand over the trigger for an orbital death laser, and running into a trio of elderly women howling for my blood after I reprogrammed a sexbot to work for the local bar, I found myself thinking, ""This might be one of the best RPGs I've ever played.""More than any other game in recent memory, Fallout: New Vegas is an RPG that encourages - and rewards - you for exploring strange or out-there possibilities. Whether you want to be the savior of the Mojave Wasteland or the Devil Incarnate when it comes to the way you deal with the world and its residents, this game actively relishes in allowing you to mold the experience in any way, shape or form you choose.As a courier who is double-crossed and shot in the head, the game immediately sets itself apart from previous Fallout titles (which all had you start in a Vault and bring you slowly into the outside world) by having you wake up in a small town and immediately get caught up in a (sometimes-overwhelming) amount of oddball characters, sidequests and machinations from various factions within the Mojave. When you set out, you'll quickly find yourself making enemies, running across all sorts of strange locations and getting lost in a mountain of sidequests that will quickly have you glued to your computer saying ""just one more mission"".The most interesting aspect of the game is the care that's taken to giving the player unique, memorable experiences. Whether it's strolling into a new town as the sound of Marty Robbins' ""Big Iron"" plays on your Pip-Boy radio, the oddball encounters given by the Wild Wasteland perk, the unmarked quests peppered throughout the wasteland or the fact that you can literally run around killing everything and everyone (up to and including the heads of major factions), the game has an unbeatable sense of world-building and freedom. You can quite literally massacre everyone and still achieve an ending that's on par (or arguably better) than one of the faction endings.Much care has also been given to the wide assortment of companions you can recruit throughout the game, who all provide incredible benefits during combat. They all have their own quirks and unique conversations, strong companion quests, insight into the various factions and amusing chatter during combat and encounters. Likewise, it shows how much care Obsidian Entertainment put into the game when you see some of the minor NPCs, who have surprisingly-intricate conversations and mini-questlines.New Vegas also has some of the most interesting and, I would argue, iconic encounters and quest designs in the entire series. Whether it's the surreal ""social experiment"" in Vault 22 (and arguably, the rest of the Vaults in the Mojave), menial tasks like the picture-taking sidequest at the south end of the Vegas Strip, or just being able to sell your companion to a group of high-society cannibals for no other reason than ""for the evulz"", the game does an incredible job of keeping things fresh and varied throughout a playthrough.The most interesting thing is that you can play the game a number of different ways and get a different experience every time. The first time I beat the game, I was doing a completionist ""goody-two-shoes"" run where I saved everyone I could and was incredibly thorough. When I went back for a second run, I played as a female melee expert who ran around stealth-killing everyone with sneak attacks, but couldn't shoot guns to save her life. The flexibility and care given to making both character builds have unique advantages is the main part of why New Vegas continues to have such replay value.Of course, there's also the modding community, which has given the game unparalleled longevity, both through restored content (like the New Vegas Uncut series on Nexusmods) or major gameplay overhauls like Project Nevada. Even if it wasn't on sale, the game is still incredible value thanks to the amount of content both in the game and contributed by the community.I highly recommend New Vegas for anyone getting into the genre. It's one of my favorite Western RPGs, and an experience that keeps rewarding me time and time again.			"

Hijacked the rockets so that they would crash into each other killing all the people and the leader of a weird ghoul religious cult. Saved the president. Killed the president. Killed Caesar because I thought saving the guy that shot my brains out and buried me would be amusing.Whole Legion camp went hostile.Killed everyone.No regrets.			"

												One of my top favorite games of all time. It's as great as Fallout 2, which is high praise. If you're having crashing on Windows 10, please install the following mods. Read the installation instructions carefully as these mods are a bit different from the typical ones.http://nvse.silverlock.org/  <---This is the New Vegas Script Extender. It's required for a lot of mods anyway.http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53635/     <----New Vegas Anti-Crash. It's a plugin for NVSE. These are installed in the following location: GameDirectory(where the falloutnv.exe is)/data/NVSE/PluginsYou drop the nvac.dll in there and violla, your game will work again.			"

												GAME CRASHING AFTER INTRO CINEMATIC? SOLUTION HERE:Hey everybody! This is a great game (played it on console before) but I was having issues with it crashing after the initial cinematic on my PC. This issue stems from some game files not being able to recognize newer video cards. Essentially, you have to add a file to the game folder and it should run.STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMUpon initial launch of the game, a pop-up window should appear stating what graphics level the game suggests after detecting your graphics card. If this does not happen, you're in the right place.STEP 2: DOWNLOAD WINRARWinRAR is a free application that allows you to open RAR and ZIP files. You need this because the file you'll have to add is a RAR file. You can download WinRAR from this link: http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm Make sure to download the proper one for your PC. STEP 3: DOWNLOAD RAR FILEThis is the ""unopened"" file you're going to add to the game folder. Download the ""d3d9dll"" file here: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34778/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fnewvegas%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D34778&pUp=1The ""main"" file worked perfectly for me. You can click on the description tab for the author's comments if you'd like.STEP 4: OPEN THE DLL FILE WITH WINRARAttempting to open the DLL file should open it in WinRAR immediately. Click on the file in the WinRAR interface, then click ""Extract To"" in the toolbar.STEP 5: PUT THE FILE IN THE FALLOUT NV FOLDERThe ""Extract To"" option should open up a new window asking where you want to put the DLL file. Navigate to the Fallout NV folder (C:\(Hard Drive) -> Program Files (x86) -> Steam -> steamapps -> common -> Fallout New Vegas).STEP 6: ENJOY FALLOUT NVThat should do it. Please note that this solution worked for me as of 10/23/16. Download files and applications at your own risk. I am not responsible for any viruses/damage these sites may cause. This solution worked for me without any issues, but that is just my personal experience. I believe that I had to do a similar fix last year for Fallout 3, so if you're having issues with that, the solution should be similar. Good luck!			"

												Many people leave the game running to clock ridiculous numbers of hours and say something stupid, like, ""it's okay"".I didn't. I've clocked each and every one of these hours with actual gameplay (or modding and testing), and it is far far more than merely ""okay"".  If you've been living under a rock and you still haven't gotten around to playing this yet, you're missing out. I can't even count the number of characters I've played through to varying stages of completion -- probably in the forties by now. With Tale of Two Wastelands porting over all of the Fallout 3 GOTY content (if you own that one too), the hours I've clocked and the numbers of characters I've played have tripled.Sure, it's buggy. The graphics were outdated when they came out, let alone for 2016. The 50's schtick wore thin enough in Fallout 3 and they tried lampshade-hanging on it in this one, but all they wound up doing is showing how stupid it is to run around with a lampshade on. Some questionable design decisions, sometimes linear plot, invisible walls, vast tracts of empty. Dialogue that sometimes vastly misses your actual motivations (where's my ""Because I don't like being used!"" option when playing the Wild Card?).But this game is ten times the roleplaying game that Fallout 4 even dreams of being, and twice the game that Fallout 4 actually is.

												New Vegas is a proper Fallout game. The lore's there and the story is rich and diverse, with many different endings, albeit missing a proper post-game feature like Fallout 3 did.Obsidian, ever the company that is rushed into releasing their products, also unfortunately did not have enough time to properly playtest this game, and thus, expect a lot of bugs, some of them quite annoying. Game's a bit crashy as well. Thankfully, we're blessed with mod support, and they fix many of the issues present.Gameplay's slightly better but never look at this game as a proper FPS, because the engine was never adequate for it. Do expect hundreds of hours, because although it is set in a desert, you'd be surprised at the amount of locations it has.The DLC can be a bit hit and miss. Gun Runners Arsenal adds a few fun weapons but nothing mandatory. Dead Money had great plot, but terrible gameplay. Old World Blues was pretty funny, but had a few bugs and at times I thought they were trying too hard. Lonesome Road was linear but pretty tight, with great pacing and story. Honest Hearts was probably the weakest, because Zion and its denizens didn't really interest me, except for one character. Not saying who it is, but if you've played it you'll know who I'm talking about. New Vegas is an RPG through and through. The characters are original and engaging, especially the possible companions you can have, their personality trump anything Fallout 3's companions could offer. The choices you make impact the game and nothing is ever black and white in this world. I recommend it to everyone in a heartbeat. Games like these are few and far between.			"

One of the best games I've ever played: Fallout: New VegasPros: Great Factions Great Weapons Great Characters/Voice acting Hard to choose an ending (Means the game is good) Smooth gameplay Excellent DLCs Great creatures/enemies Amazing quests Great Modding CommunityCons:  No major changes in graphics from Fallout 3 When you complete the last of either quest you choose as your ending, you can't play from there you have to restart at the Hoover Dam or whatever save you choose to restart from (I brought this up due to Fallout 3 having this included)Overall the game was fantastic! I know I said I love the graphics in the pros, but hey I had to include atleast one con. And they could've improved the gaphics by just a bit, but I understand its an open world game and those usually dont have the best graphics due to lag and other various problems. I would rate the game 10/10. But my main reason for the rating 10 is because you can choose sides with different factions unlike Fallout 3. Plus in Fallout 4 you're most likely gonna choose to side with the protagonists of the game. In Fallout: New Vegas, however, its hard to choose what faction you wanna side with. "

												I've always heard that people liked Fallout 3 better than New Vegas. To me, it should be the other way around. New Vegas is better that Fallout 3 in countless ways.-The story is much more complex than Fallout 3's story. In Fallout 3, it was as simple as Brotherhood=Good Guys and Enclave=Bad Guys. New vegas has a nonlinear, choose-your-own-path storyline: Help Caesar's Legion conquer New Vegas, give the NCR control over New Vegas and the Hoover Dam, or fight for an independent New Vegas. There are also numerous smaller factions that you can join or fight. There is a massive amount of player involvement in the world, and your actions in one faction may affect your reputation with another. Not only does this make the game's story more interesting, it also gives the game immense replay value.-Did the Capitol Wasteland in Fallout 3 feel empty? I know that it takes place in the aftermath of a global nuclear war, but the world of Fallout 3 felt barren and boring. In New Vegas, there are plenty of locations to explore and loot around the Mojave Wasteland.-The weapon variety in Fallout 3 pales in comparison to New Vegas. Fallout 3 had about 50 different types of weapons, whereas New Vegas has over twice as many.-Fallout: New Vegas actually allows the player to look down the sights of the gun they are holding, rather than the zooming-in effect that Fallout 3 had. If you liked 3's method of aiming better, then don't worry; you can toggle ironsights.-In Fallout 3, you could only repair weapons up to a certain point, and that point was determined by the repair skill. In New Vegas, Weapons can be repaired to 100% no matter the repair skill. The repair skill instead determines how efficient  you are at repairing a gun (For example, a person with a repair level of 80 would need less materials to repair a weapon than a person who had a repair level of 30.)-Fallout 3 has almost no color whatsoever. Most of the time, the screen is filled with a dull gray. Even when looking at what should be a gorgeous sunrise, the world is bathed in gray. New Vegas has much more color compared to Fallout 3, which is admittedly not very difficult to accomplish. Granted, it's nowhere near as colorful and vivid as Fallout 4, but at least the player doesn't have to stare at the world through a monotonous gray filter all the time.-I will concede that the DLCs in Fallout 3 are interesting. However, New Vegas' DLCs tell much better stories. In addition to their own individual stories, the DLCs in New Vegas all tell the story of another courier, ""Ulysses"". In each DLC, the player finds out more and more of Ulysses' story and learns more and more about who he is until the confrontation in the ""Lonesome Road"" DLC (to be honest, Ulysses' story is much better the second time through, when you can catch all the  minor details).-In New Vegas, unwanted ammunition can be broken down and crafted into different ammuntion, allowing the player to destroy ammo for a weapon that is rarely used in order to create ammo for a weapon that the player uses frequently.-The option of hardcore mode in New Vegas presents an added challenge if the game seems too simple or easy. The player muust manage their hydration, food, and sleep. If they neglect any of these for too long, they suffer negative effects and ultimately die.-Nearly all of these points add to the replay value of the New Vegas, which is something that Fallout 3  did not do very well. In New Vegas, you can side with different factions, use different weapons, explore different areas, complete different quests, learn different things, etc.Overall, New Vegas feels like more thought went into its production, despite only being in development for a year and a half.

												TL;DR below.The good:- Meaningful and plentiful choices. The quests and stories (especially the main one) actually made me stop and ponder for a while what I wanted to do.- So many things to talk about with so many characters.- The role-playing system.- The environments are pretty nice- The DLCs are amazing and worth playing.- Many interesting and engaging characters.- You get to be the mailman who delivers DEATH.- The lack of level scaling.- An ending which didn't infuriate me (unlike Fallout 3 and to some extent Fallout 4).- You can get a house with various appliances that talk to you. Including a seedy machine that seeds soil using seeds.- Moddable.- Perks. Perks. PERKS.- Companions and their provided perks. ED-E is the best.- The physics are hilarious at times.- Many things to do.- The world and all the interesting stories you can find.Note that almost all the problems listed below apply to Fallout 3 as well! Strange, eh?Biggest issue in the game:The karma-system is really bad. I really wish they had opted for scrapping the general karma system and instead only had faction reputation. You may encounter the Brotherhood of Steel (BoS) while exploring the wasteland. If you find their bunker (through sheer coincidence even), they will demand that you surrender and will put an explosive collar on you to put you on trial. If you resist: they turn hostile and will try to kill you, killing them in responce will incur negative karma. I find it strange that the creators of the game create a situation where they (as a some sort of objective arbitrator of right and wrong) say defending yourself against this action is wrong. Additionally, say you murder the entire BoS-chapter (that's what their groups are called), be it through another faction demanding you do so and you abiding, or because you decide to: you may incur some severe karma loss for this action. However, you can ""repent"". How do you ""repent""? By killing more people that are deemed ""evil"" by the game's creators such as fiends (humanoid, always hostile) and feral ghouls (monsters). What. Murdering 12-13 BoS members and letting the rest die in an atomic explosion in the bunker incurs karma penalties that can be undone by killing 7 members of the fiends. Additionally, this makes it really hard to play a evil character by the game's definition of ""evil character"" as you may have to fight enemies that give you positive karma for killing them! This game would've been better off without this system (just like the Mass Effect series!).Other major problems:- Crashes. Lots of them. May be caused by me modding the game, however, I didn't run too many mods - I had 10, 3 of them graphical, 7 of them minor gameplay changes/other. Wasn't too much of a problem as the game autosaves all the time.- While the dialogue system is extensive and great, I really wish there were some more options to speak out against authorities in the respective factions when you're on their side to influence them a bit more.- Glitches all over the place - including some rare ones that makes your game get stuck.Minor problems:- The AI can be kind of bad sometimes. Things like these happen occasionally:

 Other problems include characters not following you through doors if you're supposed to go somewhere with them (always let them go through first), companions running in front of you during gunfights (Lily is very prone to this - somewhat annoying as she goes invisible if you're sneaking), and enemies have strange reactions to stealth attacks - such as not responding to the fact that someone next to them transformed into a red mist and associated bits of flesh and bones on the floor.- Graphics are somewhat dated.- While Fallout 4 is accused of being a ""superhero simulator"" (fair accusation), you can sort of get the same thing going in this game quite easily as well. Certain combos when creating a character gives you a truly godlike character compared to the alternatives - one of the keys is to go with 8 endurance (and get a 9th point through Lonesome Road). Early-game: you can take a lot of hits, late-game: you get +1 to all SPECIAL-stats, passive regen and additional damage threshold - but you need 8 END (or waste perk points through investing in intensive training) to do this. Slightly better balance could've been achieved if the number of implants you could get wasn't determined by your END.- You can't hotkey turbo or implant GRX (both give a slow-motion effect) without a mod (and sometimes during combat you can't bring your Pip-boy up!).- I want the hear the stealth suit's voice, but I don't want it to apply med-x or stimpacks automatically (got a med-x addiction because of this!). The only solution was to install a mod that disables the voice completely.- Some design-related issues (this holds true for at least non-hardcore mode): stimpacks are disproportionally better than everything else healing-wise - they heal insantly, and they do not weigh anything at all. Food weighs, does not heal instantly, and may also give you some rads.- Rads are mostly a redundant as a mechanic except for one place in Lonesome Road that is optional and for characters with some perks that may choose to incur radiation poisoning on purpose.- The crafting system is meh.- The physics may do strange things like this:

 (all of this is frozen!)- Some invisible walls here and there.- Some items labeled as things you can only steal (an action which incurs very minor karma loss) when they belong to an opposing faction.One final very minor problem:


Poorly placed outpost

 This outpost is one of the worst things I've seen.If like.. three enemies with some grenades (and maybe a grenade launcher) attacked this place from the position I'm standing in everyone would be wiped out in seconds.More screenshots can be found here:http://steamcommunity.com/id/TZer0/screenshots/?appid=22380TL;DR/Conclusion:Flawed in some ways, but worth the playthrough as it is a lot of fun.

												A work of art reflects and depicts the culture where it is created. This is what Fallout: New Vegas achieves on its best way.Politics are defined here like anywhere else in a videogame.Democrats are represented by the New California Republic -NCR-while Republicans are epitomized by the Legion.Technocracy and dictatorship are Mr House,and Anarchism is the fourth path you can choose to finish the game.Some spoilers here: None of them are perfect. NCR are corrupt and pay no attention to anything but their interests;and Legion are slavers and gynophobic, although true to their word as their ending shows up.Despite the fact that Mr House is one of the best hopes for humanity (you can see the message if you get rid of him), his regime is totalitarian and despotic.No Gods, No Masters ending is also imperfect. Hard to say which one is canon, honestly.End of spoilersAll the relations you establish with every faction, and there is a lot, affects its gameplay and endings, so this game becomes in my opinion the most complex and rewarding I have ever found, and I remember seeing the first arcade Pacman when I was a kid.The quality of the main quest is reinforced by the impressive amount of sidequests. This game is not only about the campaign, you get swallowed by the Wasteland through the sidequests. Even your companions have hidden quests, all of them flawlessly written. You might need to check the wikias, or buy the game's guide (totally worth it, for me at least), to activate them. There are hundreds of hours ahead of pure delightment, and you will have that feeling you get when you read a really good book:""I don't want it to end""New Vegas inherits the spirit of Fallout 1 and Fallout 2, in an act of enrichment beyond Fallout 3, even though a good game, not as excellent as this one. Even the humour is pretty as unique and subtle as in the two previous games, (just watch a Legionnaire picking his nose and we'll talk). Or the name of one of its Commanders: Vulpes Inculta (Ignorant Fox in Latin). Just play Old World Blues if you want to have some hillarious laughs. I still smile remembering those conversations, oh God! Suffice to say, if you ever played Fallout 1 & 2, I assure you you'll get shocked when you find some characters in the Wasteland. There is a LOT of references to the previous games. Just like the Wild Wasteland perk, you get it or you just don't even notice. That is, after all, what being cultivated means.And yes, I'd love to see those games remade with nowaydays engines. Sorry, purists.Whereas Fallout 3 was focused on resources -water, more precisely-, New Vegas is a struggle of energy resources and you can notice how everything is twisted around that. Not only this is very clever, but also it is the most mature post-apocalyptic simulator you can find to this date.Mojave Wasteland isn't as huge as other sandboxes, but it is worked to the detail, full of spirit and so plenty of diversity or marvels you can walk those sands for a thousand hours. I can guarantee that.Even though the campaign is close to perfect, New Vegas DLCs, all of them, create a storyline arch which multiplies the game's quality immensely. From Dead Money through Big Empty to the Lonesome Road, there stands a parallel storyline mesmerizing and superbly written. By the way, Lonesome Road which was unfairly critizised for being ""linear"" (aren't all paths linear after all? o.O) contains some of the best this game has to offer.Edit: for those owning Ultimate Edition, think that you should really play the DLCs in order:    Dead Money    Honest Hearts    Old World Blues    Lonesome Road.Voice acting:Simply the best there is. Let's talk about Caesar and get to the point.Every time I found this character I was amazed how charismatic and strong he was.No doubt a superb actor was behind those flawless performance.That actor is John Doman[www.imdb.com]When I was watching The Wire (the best TV series of all time) I was literally shocked when I heard the Commissioner William A. Rawls reprimmending his police officers.That acting strength wasn't similar to New Vegas' Caesar, it WAS Caesar himself!And he was.Same goes for many others. Boone, Veronica, Doc Mitchell... Ulysess.Edit: THE MUSIC:It goes without saying this is some of the best soundtracks ever made. I just want to talk about something else to reinforce how mature, cultivated, and serious, this game is.Driving and listening to this soundtrack I found something amazing: the TITLE of a song.'Jacobstown Ladder'. Inon Zur left an impressive cultural mark even at the level of giving title to the songs. It is a reference to Jacob's Ladder, a Biblical figure whose purpose was to rescue the lost souls and take them to Heaven. If you have ever been in Jacobstown you can see the pun (paronomasia it is also called) and how it is related to the game. I bow in respect to you. Me quito el sombrero. 'Dam Nation' is the song for the Second Battle for Hoover damn. There goes another paronomasia with big balls.Con dos cojones. And there is more: the MODS.(Yes, that thing some economical powers of gaming industry wanted to charge you for).I have not only found gamefixes which work fantastically, but also some writers out there that I do consider cannon of the Fallout universe. I am looking at you, Someguy. Your ""New Vegas Bounties"" are part of this game. Congratulations.Edit: WOW just WOW New Vegas Bounties III. Marko enters the Pantheon of best villains ever made (Kerrigan, Arthas, GLaDOS, make some space because you have a new neighbor)And the story, Someguy, you really got me there, you monster.100 out of 10. To my eyes you are part of Fallout Universe by right.Check ""Paint Your Weapon"", please. ;)There are other fantastic attempts, like for instance ""Dust"", the most extreme survival simulator, although having certain flaws in my personal opinion.Other mods I recommend:    Leather Backpack    Veronica Can Wear Vera's Outfit    Russell    Burning Campfire    HZ Novac Campfire    New Vegas Stutter Remover    The Someguy Series    Enhanced Blood Textures    Tales From The Burning Sands <--     YUP Base Game and all DLCsWhat else can I say?One more thing: what this game means to me. I deleted my previous recommendation, which was one of the most higlhy rated I have, but deep inside I knew I was being unfair to my favourite game.In a few days Fallout 4 will come out.I know it will change many things, and you can bet your moustache Bethesda is going to put a lot of efford to make it a breaking point.I am not saying I am not going to love it.I am just saying it has the most difficult task if it wants to conquer my heart.I left my heart at The Mojave.

												I need to update this review, how people gave it 79% user approval is astonishing, this review was rather silly and inconsistent.The Fallout Series tripped my trigger during my middle school years, however I was really rude to this game before playing it, and I slumped it with some awful generalization while I was young. Personally this game was one of those most fantastic games I have ever played. It is full of what Obsidian wanted and they deliver a much more fine tuned game compared to what Bethesda released a few years before this. The reason I like this game a lot more than 3 is the fact there is more involvement, lots of things to do, and it is overall an improvement on what Fallout 3 had to offer. Having true iron sights, more customization, a more fluent battling mechanic. Sure the shooting mechanics are often bullcrap, but really they are not so bad as the point it hinders my enjoyment of the game. There is tons of lore, and quite a few interesting questlines. The game feels more massive than what it really is. Exploring is a lot more fun on this game, because there is not a overwhelming feeling of emptiness that you get when you play Fallout 3, and this game offers an overall great experience to those that liked the early Fallout games, but hated the turn based combat mechanism. Yes, this game still isnt the most RPG of the Fallout series, but it is definitely better at being an RPG than the Bethesda games. The companions on this game are much more interesting and they have more involvement with the story, as the end potrays. Your character feels like he has much more involvement in this game. Even if three of the endings might seem similar, they each feel different. What this game does wrong is the fact that unlike Fallout 3, you cannot continue after the game ends, but personally that is not something I argue about, becuase there is mods that allow you to do so, and thats really that. Do not get me wrong, games like Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 are both good in their own intricate ways, but Fallout New Vegas seems to combine everything I wanted in a Fallout game.What will turn you away from the PC release of this game, is the constant crashing, and the annoying bugs that sometimes come about in this version of the game. Installing mods is quite effective, but even with tons of crash fixes I still crash every now and then, and it angers me to the core. The PC version is not very stable compared to, lets say, the Xbox 360 version, but I still very much enjoy playing it. So, if you want a game with decent combat, fluent story, and an immersive experience, I can easily recommend this game to you. If you want lots of mods and a dedicated playerbase, this game is for you. However if you get angry with games that crash a lot and are full of tons of bugs, you might not want this game, yet I will still heavily recommend you at least try it. To me those bugs and crashes are worth it.			"

												Let me start this off with one statement:Fallout: New Vegas is one of the greatest games I have ever played.(Mass Effect 2 holds that title for me.)I will most likely add onto this after more playthroughs. I've still yet to play Dead Money (got the endings from the wiki).I'm also currently replaying Fallout 3. The base game has been finished, and I'm currently trying to explore the entirety of the Capital Wasteland and do the DLCs before I go back over the review.Like my other reviews, this will be kept simple, with pros+cons, and a small explanation of the game.Disclaimer: I played Fallout 3 through a CD ROM.Another: While I have 100+ hours on the game, today was the first time I actually did the Battle for Hoover Dam.Fallout: New Vegas is a spin-off in the Fallout franchise, a series of post-apocalyptic RPGs. Using the same engine as Fallout 3, New Vegas was developed by Obsidian, the same company who made games like Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords.Unlike Fallout 3, New Vegas takes place in a location not hit by the Great War as much as DC was. The Mojave, which was already a wasteland. Also unlike 3, you don't start out as a Vault Dweller.You start off as The Courier who was sent to deliver the mysterious ""The Platinum Chip."" (Yes, THE is actually part of its name.) You're intercepted by the Tops chairmen, Benny and two Great Khans, who then shoot you in the head. You're rescued (slowly) by a strange, friendly Securitron named Victor, and sent to Doc Mitchell in Goodsprings, who saves your life. After creating your character, you set out to the Mojave to hunt down Benny, only to be caught up in a full blown war.There are of course spoilers ahead.Pros:+ A strong lore like the other Fallout games.+ Great companions that all have their own story. They all give opinions to the Courier and make comments about the world around them, even a PROBE, who got an ENTIRE DLC involved around him! Except Boone. ""MY WIFE IS DEAD""+ Characters in quests have better writing and memorability than the ones in 3, The only characters I can remember in 3 are James and Three Dog.+ MUCH MORE PLAYER FREEDOM. Fallout 3 had barely any freedom. You HAD to go here, HAD to find your dad, and HAD to side with the Brotherhood of Steel. In NV, you have many more options, including multiple game endings, where you have four choices. NCR, Legion, House, or Independent. Six if you count Dead Money (dying in the vault or siding with Elijah).+ Less invisible walls than 3. Still a lot, but they don't block off any paths or anything. Only simple hills and mountains. I'm going to get a lot of backlash for that, but this is from experience.+ A great radio and soundtrack. + Graphics are quite decent.+ Animations are OK. It's best if you get a mod to improve them.+ A large modding community. Not as large as Skyrim's, but still quite large.+ Better optimized than 3.+ Well designed armors, weapons, and enemies.+ Well written storyline. While not as story-rich as Skyrim, it connects with characters more.+ The move from Damage Resistance to Damage Threshold was a smart one. Now you won't be shredded by a simple assault rifle while wearing Power Armor.Cons:- MULTIPLE bugs and crashes that need to be fixed with mods, and said mods require the DLC. I'm looking at you, Unofficial Patch.- Gunplay is... bad.- Sometimes you can halt the progress of the entire game by doing a quest wrong.- Locations tend to be very bland. In 3 many of the locations were quite unique, like Rivet City.- Feels boring at times. In Fallout 3, you had actual random encounters, even if they were just Super Mutants every 200 feet.- Game ends completely at Hoover Dam. Unlike Fallout 3, there is no DLC to fix this, but there are mods.- Battle for Hoover Dam felt small, BUT it could be because I nuked the entirety of Arizona. I'll change this con when I STOP the nukes in my next playthrough.- While there are less than 3, invisible walls. Some of them, while most are in hills and mountains, are in places they shouldn't be, like ridges in places you can go.- Not enough redheads. Forgot about that one.Final Verdict: 9/10 AMAZINGOnce again, I will add onto this as time goes. Please comment on any pro/con you disagree with.			"

'War. War never changes!‘[… but mods can change everything.]________________________________________________________________________________These words are the prelude to the ‚Fallout‘ series, a world on the brink of destruction. During the great war in 2077 all the nations launched their nuclear weapons and civilization was nearly annihilated. Some people have been seeking shelter inside the vaults, others died by the explosions, the contamination and the fallout. Nowadays ruins are most of the time the only witnesses of former glorious cities and nations. Mutations have spread, the curse of radiaton still haunts the wastelands and brutal raiders and gangs wage war against poor survivors and former armies. And then there's you, a simple courier who has been hired to transport a mysterious package. You had the feeling that something wasn't right there. But you still took the job. And in the end...... you’ve been shot in the head. Twice. Then your pursuers robbed and burried you. But somehow you’re still alive, rescued by a mysterious robot and a doctor. Of course you not only want your package back but you also demand some answers. And so you start your adventure through the wasteland of Nevada, following the trails of your former pursuers. And this will lead you right into the heart of the Strip, where the former glory of Vegas is being rebuilt.________________________________________________________________________________Typcially for the ‚Fallout‘ series you are able to explore a huge open world, a post-apocalyptic wasteland where hundreds of abandoned buildings, ruins, caves and so on wait for a curageous adventurer. You will find countless weapons, armors and items, fight against raiders, bandits, animals and mutated beings like ghouls or death claws. With every lock you open, every enemy you defeat, you’ll get stronger, forming your own character. You may evolve into the intelligent mastermind, focussing on energy weapons and science or into the evil cannibal with a love for rusty chainsaws – the choice is up to you. And meanwhile you can follow the storyline of the main quest or you lose yourself in the huge wasteland, the sidequests, the crafting or the fighting. Or you'll just go to the casinos and try to hit the jackpot. The amount of content is huge, so many persons to talk to, so many places to visit, so much stuff to blow up.And all these positive points make up for some of the games disadvantages: Even with different fixes and stuff the stability isn’t perfect, the translation of some items, dialogues and stuff is (at least in the german version) ‚interesting‘ (maybe ‚creative‘ would be the better term) and some stuff like e.g. loading errors can annoy the crap out of you……but you will still continue playing. At least I did it. Because I really love the style and atmosphere, the soundtrack, the exploring, the development of my own character and all the other stuff. And due to the great 'Nexus' modding community you can make the game look absolutely stunning and beautiful, you can add even more content and make it an apocalyptic masterpiece. But even without the mods you won't regret the time you spend in New Vegas.________________________________________________________________________________So all in all there’s only one more thing to say: Gather your stimpaks and the ammo, load your energy rifle and ride into the sunset… *Vault-Boy approves*			"

												I've spent weeks playing this game (almost litterally), this is by far my favorite game ever made.If you've never played it before take a good 20 hours in vanilla to get a feel of the atmosphere and visuals then go rampent with mods and you'll have a almost current gen first person fallout game with true a dialog system fallout is suppose to have. You're not playing a story, you are the story.My favorite roleplay in this game would probably be to go a steath small arms/sniper rifle route with wild wasteland turned on for maximum enjoyment. DLC is a must so get the Game of the Year edition.			"

												Fallout New Vegas is a game that comes around only once in a decade. Maybe two decades. It's just one of those games where you either love it and think that it's the best game that has ever been made to represent the fallout universe, or you hate it because you are a sad person who hates fun (or just doesn't enjoy these kinds of games which I can understand. To each their own.) I've put in over 300+ hours on steam officially and probably another 200+ hours offline. The modding community for this game is....well its like nothing I have ever seen before. There is a mod for almost everything. I took great pleasure in modding this game to the point where it nearly crashed many times and yet I still played on. If you like a game where the choices you make actually matter, where the people you meet are interesting and have a story to tell, and if you just love getting to take pot shots at drugged up junkies with explosive anti-tank rounds, this game is for you. ∞/10. Would come back as the Courier to kill Benny again.  "

												This game, THIS game... where can I begin?Let's start with this: buy it... got it? OKGameplay:Although you might argue that the shooting and gameplay in general is the same as fallout 3 (which you should also buy) it does improve over its predesecor like with the all new ironsight, a real one for once.Crafting is generaly the same etc. etc.Quests:This is where the game really shines, its story and quest will leave you wanting always more and that's a good thing. The characters are way more interesting then in fallout 3, in this game you will want to think twice before killing someone who isn't an enemy and you will always think : was that a good idea? Also the quests are not fetch quest well some of them but not a lot.Factions:In this you will come across the many factions of the harsh Nevada desert which wil include mad bombers, underground thechnology freaks,the new army of some sorts,a legion of slavers and Mr. House(I can't tell anything about him)Story:YOU are a simple courier... or are you? So, after you ty to deliver a package you get shot in the head... but you live and now you're on a wonderful magical quest to find the sonofab***h who shot you... but that's where our story begin, find out by yourself.Community: You being part of the pc master race CAN and WILL put mods on your game. What are mods you ask well they are content created by users like you yes you and with time and patience you can make some too. But seriously go to the mod nexus, it is amazing what people can do with this game.DLCs:As I see it, the dlcs( downloadable content) are part of the experience, don't buy the game without them you will miss out on an extrordinary adventure.Dead Money: The first and best dlc released for New Vegas, I recommend starting it at low level, you might not get the best ending but it's way better that way also play it in the dark, it will be quite an experience.Honest Heart:The weak link at least in my opinion, it does have a good story but all in all it was laking something, I don't know what.Old World Blues: If you are patient you will enjoy the dialog but if you normaly skip it all you will find this dlc laking, it still as some memorable moments though.The lonesome Road: Arguably one of the best story in video game history, this dlc makes you uncover your origin, do this as your final challenge before the end of the game if you want to enjoy it.And finallyThe Verdict:As I said before buy itright now, you will not regret it, it doesn't cost much and it will take you more than a few dozens of hours to say: I'm finally done with this.I give this game 9.8/10, my favorite video game in the history of gaming.

												Take fallout 3, expand it, add more diversity, add more interesting locations, triple the amount of factions, add a better theme, and add more immersion and you have fallout NV. Obsidian has taken a decent game and made it great. Really a lot more depth in the world and just overall better. Of course your on the same engine, so some of the same problems exist. Really though the best way to describe it is it makes the fallout 3 world seem boring.Score: 9/10			"

												You know the drill - war, war never changes. The ultimate edition is quite a package and after playing endings for the three major factions (ncr, house, yes man) out of four I feel really full of waging war. I gotta go back to experience the ultimate bad guy route as the Roman psycho sometime later after I have survived the hangover from having drunk hundreds of Sunset Sarsaparillas. Its a really good RPG with extremely well written dialogue and abundance of choices up to you. The vanilla game really has it all on its own, the DLCs are just a bonus - like spin-offs of the main world of Mojave Wasteland. I dont really have anything bad to say about it, except for some annoying bugs like enemies getting stuck inside the terrain and the player occasionally falling through world etc. Gotta lock that FPS to 60 as well to avoid severe bugs with physics. You can even make the game look decent(ish) by todays standards by exploiting the offerings of nexusmods.com and ENB.So the DLC; -Loved Dead Money, great story building around the theme of Greed with intriguing gameplay elements; it deliberately makes you approach the game from different angle than you were accustomed in the base game. -Honest hearts was a bit of a letdown, kinda uninspired area with basic gameplay and run of the mill storyline, it answers some minor questions and rumours heard in the base game though.-Old World Blues was amazing, definitely the best dialogue offerings in the whole game and such a fun story with ludicrous weapons and gadgets to be obtained. I didnt want it to end =D-I'm bit on the fence with Lonesome Road, it has its moments as a ""final boss"" of sorts and discovering the rest of the Courier's tale but it falls kinda short with its boring map design, endless +4 radstorms and fighting sections full of Deathclaws and Ghoul grunts with deathclaw-like health. It gets a bit old to get ambushed by an instakilling monster while crossing a minefield the hundreth time. And that freaking storm always comes out at such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ time you will find yourself thinking if that crap is scripted or is your luck just running completely out.Overall the ultimate edition is a very good game with not too many annoyances, well played Obsidian Entertainment!

												I bought this game in 2014 on PC, and I haven't played it recently enough but it has always been in the back of my mind. I played it on the PS3 at release aswally and when I bought it on PC, I replayed it with some graphics mods and improvements on the game.Fallout: New Vegas is the underrated 3D Fallout game by all people who seem to be unable to see what makes a great Fallout game. It's superior to Fallout 3 and 4 in every way except the gunplay and the graphics, which is technically surpassed by Fallout 4, but I feel like Fallout 4 seems like plastic, but I digress and I'll move from this incoherent rant into the main meat of this review. Story and Dialogue Fallout: New Vegas is written by those who originally worked on Fallout 1 and 2 and their work and faith to the old lore is absolutely phenomenal, I have been engrossed into the world of New Vegas and the whole Mojave desert just through the dialogue and how the whole map, locations and all the politics behind every event, would, as Todd Howard would say, ""it just works"". The whole conflict between the NCR and the Legion is written in a way where you cannot technically define Evil as all choices are quite morally gray, all choices have a proper pros and cons list and it seems like they're all equal shades of gray, but at the same time, they seem black from the other perspective.Characters do speak in a realistic manner, but as I say this, I'm sure that there are characters that don't really speak naturally (dialogue wise) but I just cannot seem to think of any at the time, except Ullyses, he seems too pretentious to seem like a real person. Mechanics The mechanics of the game are quite an improvement over Fallout 3, the quest system from Fallout 3, where the choices and quest start could be different or change the course of the quest but it's quite llinear and less liberal with all the different choices, and in New Vegas, they overhual it and give you more methods to complete a quest depending on how your character is built and how you want to play. The shooting has been improved with the addition of Iron-Sights. The stats have been improved with slight more impact onto the game and the quests, adding alternative routes into quests.They've readded the traits from Fallout and Fallout 2, which force your character to gain extra skills but also penalizes you in some other way. And the perks have been turned into an affair that only comes each 2 XP Levels, This is to prevent you becoming some sort of past-mortal god at Level 20, and the repair system has been revamped and improved and works in a much simpler and handier way than in Fallout 3.I do recommend Hardcore Mode for returning Fallout 3 fans as it does add a slight minigame that makes food and water quite neccesary and adds a bit more difficulty.  Graphics and Map Design The Map is designed in a way where it is easy to find something interesting within a radius of something else, making it like a Mountain that you climb in a way, you progress, you can fast travel back to safety if you're outside, then return from the last spot you were at and keep progressing. Fast Travelling does cheapen the game quite a bit and make it less interesting but at the same time it does make running back for supplies or even restocking or upgrading much simpler.The Mojave Desert has roads on it, and when I first played the game, I had never noticed that the roads in the game would actually work if you drove on it and it made me realise how much thought the developers put into the map and the playable region of the game. The developers put less effort into the third and fourth DLCs, Old World Blues and Lonesome Road when it comes to how the map is planned out and how it would work in real life, but who plays an RPG for realism? It's all an afterthought. Soundtrack and Original Score From classic 40s-50s American music from the likes of Dean Martin and other artists (to be honest I don't know names, I just listen) to ambient noise to give personality to an otherwise dark, quiet, pest-infested cave, the soundtrack does hit it's hits of how to perfectly fit in the silence of the Mojave and the slow trekking through the map.It's amazing to listen to and the songs have stuck with me throughout my daily life, still stuck in the back of my head, still jingling and jangling.Then again, music tastes are subjective, but in my opinion, I do feel like it did fit the game quite well.

												So far yet so great, this is the best fallout game for me even this game came out 6 years ago. Why did I say this? let's have a look to the Cons and Prons that I've made based from my reviews.Pros:-A strong LONG story that'll make you surprised even from the beginning until the end.-Faction system-A lot of major and minor improvements that made the game not to run like a rotten potato that will ruin another fallout game.-Great Difficulty that lives up to its name and that is the ""Hardcore Mode""-Massive, varied, open wasted world just for you to explore and to encounter interesting characters and quests-New combat system, faction system, and more features to the settings-Keeps the atmosphere and structure that made it's immediate predecessor-Weapon Mods that let you have fun and experiment with your guns.-Great DLCs that isn't made for a cash-grab tactics-Powerful enemies in different parts of the world.Cons:-No more Metro Tunnels like you can see from the past game Fallout 3-No significant innovations or improvements in graphics, design, or play mechanics-Lots of Bugs and Glitches that you can encounter while playing this game-Dirty rigged AI-Lets you go up to Level 30, you only can pick few perks like 15 perks only (Not Including the 2 perks at the beginning.)If you asked me if YOU should get this game, I would say it why not? This is the best fallout game made by bethesda and obsidian. Too sad for Fallout 4 which obsidian wasn't part of the development which is why Fallout 4 was the suckiest Fallout Game.			"

												Obsidian is an amazing company, with a solid background in RPGs and storytelling. Fallout New Vegas is my favorite Fallout game, with Fallout 2 following closely, and is an amazing RPG with great lore building and lore stacking.Obsidian also knows what the ♥♥♥♥ an RPG actually is, unlike bethesda, and makes great advancements over Fallout 3 and over Fallout 4 as well. The reintroduction of traits, which was short lived as Fallout 4 lost all of its RPG elements, was a great feature to FNV, taking traits from the orginal Fallout games and adding new ones; even going as far as to add even more in the Old World Blues DLC. The perk system is similar to Fallout 2, a perk ever other level rather than one every level; the perks also do what Bethesda perks don't, which is actually behave like perks. By this I mean that the perks in FNV are game changing, perks should make the game play differently rather than just doing more damage or more EX per task. Jury Rigging and Mad Bomber are my favorite perks from FNV, adding new ways to supply yourself with weapons and changing up how the repair system works. There are perks that do add more EX per task like I mentioned, but its signifigance is small compared to how many there are to change combat, crafting, survival and speech options.LORE, I absolutely LOVE lore. I can't get enough lore out of things I'm into, the Brotherhood of Steel lore especially, I'm a huge BoS fan. Obsidian does this amazing thing, whereas others *cough *cough* bethesda, don't. Surprise! They actually know what the ♥♥♥♥ they're talking about when they write lore. They actually give a damn if the lore can be supported and if it will conflict with other lore. They build onto previous lore and write new lore where its needed. Jacobstown is a HUGE reference to Fallout 1 and 2. The name of Jacobstown itself is a big reference, the super mutants who mention the masters army is a big reference, nightkin is a reference which I thought had been lost in the newer games. Obsidian knows what they're doing with lore much better than the company which prides inself on it's ""storytelling"".So, Obsidian is a great company who deserves ever dollar they get from you buying this game. They make AMAZING RPGs, they write GREAT lore, and overall they're just good at what they do, and isnt that what it should all be about in the end? Making a great game requires a great company to make it.P.S. The head honcho of Obsidian is one of the lead directors of Fallout 2, so classic Fallout fans, you can trust him. You also should try out KOTOR 2, or Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2, another great Obsidian game.			"

												Fallout New Vegas has proved to be a high-level title regarding the PC version, that very little moves away in qualitative counterparties on consoles. Basically the game still has a well-balanced interplay between Dynamics typically from role-playing and first-person shooting, with a collection of narrative lines that are incoceranno and will find their point of Union in the decisions of the player himself. The endless Mohave desert awaits players and make them share personal experience and subjective, long-lived and never boring. There are unfortunately some problems in terms of graphics and code cleaning, resulting in sudden drops in frame rate and a random bug; as well as on consoles, though, it's very little flaws that affect the value of a product to be considered calmly among the must buy for all fans of the series and role-playing games in General.

												Fallout : New Vegas is, in my opinion, a rather good game nailed down by numerous bugs/glitches, so having any reasonable conversation with someone about it turns quickly into a glitch-swapping fest.So, let's do some good old fashioned Pros/Cons way of reviewing video games.PROS-A large, expansive world.-More guns/ironsights instead of that inching forward from FO3-Unique factions, and every single one of them you will hate.-The line ""What's a Chicago?""-The Bloody Mess perk-Funny physics toss-ups-Modding community active in all departments.And now for the bad.CONS-The game dies silently behind loading screens.-The game dies if you use explosives too much.-The game dies if you use the console too much.-Running into cars stacked atop each other can get you stuck, forcing you to use the console.-Achievements-Many weapons from FO1 and FO2 have been removed.-The Gamebryo engine is one of the worst engines I've ever played on, but dayum, is it flexible.

												What can I say about Fallout New Vegas other than that it's essentially a 4 year old game that I still play more often than most recent triple A titles. I'm not the sort of person who plays just one game based on nostalgia. The primary reason for my love for this game is that. like many others in Bethesda's RPG line up, it's pretty much fully customizable with mods. There are mods still being made to this day, and you can make changes to virtually everything in the game world. Modding includes adding custom weapons, clothing, lighting, enemies, creatures, weather effects, custom companions, missions, expanded game areas, sound effects, voice effects, interface, homes, and even to linking fallout 3 to New Vegas (given that you own both games), and that's not even scratching the surface. If you have any experience with modding, or a willingness to learn, I HIGHLY recommend this game.			"

												For starters, since you're probably playing on PC, I STRONGLY recommend you spend some time looking at various mods that people have made for this game (and are completely free). While the vanilla game experience is still good, playing with even simple mods that fix bugs makes the experience so many times more enjoyable, and allows you to tweak the game to your preference.This game is very enjoyable and easy for me to lose myself in. I can spend hours just wandering the Nevada wasteland exploring new locations or cutting down enemies. A number of the non-playable characters have interesting, and even sometimes thought-provoking, dialogues that makes doing quests something you actually want to do (besides getting a reward of some sorts).Of course, this game has its downsides. For starters, the game engine is junk. The game clearly shows its age, so if you're not using mods to make the game look good, don't expect it to look amazing. You can go in any direction you want past the opening sequence of the game, and while I consider this a good thing, those of you who prefer linear games will probably dislike this. The game very strongly suggests the direction you should go in (by following along the main questline), but more experienced players will probably greatly deviate from this.If you've never played a Fallout game, what are you waiting for? (Well, I can understand if you're waiting for the next $5 sale, I did that too.) For those of you already familiar with Fallout / The Elder Scrolls, you'll probably enjoy this.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is probably the only post-2 Fallout game that I would consider to be a legitimately good Fallout game instead of just alright (Fallout 4) or worse (Fallout 3). It feels more like a sequel to the original games than any of Bethesda's work, and frankly there are so many improvements from the gameplay to the writing and story that I'm too lazy to go into an in-depth review of all of it, so you can either take my word for it or just go read my Fallout 3 review and imagine if there was a game like that except good instead. It makes the shooting feel slightly less like it was taken from an amateur's Oblivion mod, it balances out the perks and makes it generally tougher to become a god, the companions actually make you want to travel with them instead of leaving them all in a slumber party at your house, and the main storyline actually makes sense this time. It's just overall a really great RPG, and a great Fallout game.The DLCs are a little different than most Bethesda DLCs in that they all have an overarching storyline going on in the background leading up to the final part. The first DLC, Dead Money, will probably either be your favorite or your least favorite depending on whether you like being challenged or you're a big whiny baby. It's probably my favorite part of the game as a whole, and the characters and general atmosphere of it are pretty great, especially if you turn on Hardcore mode for it (which I don't really recommend doing outside of Dead Money, because it's not really that challenging in the main game; it's more like a minor inconvenience that occasionally pokes you and tells you to sip some water). Honest Hearts is the next one, but you can basically skip it as far as I'm concerned. You get some cool .45 pistols and tommy guns that you'll never find enough ammo for in the main game, and you get to see Joshua Graham (also known as the Hanged Man from Van Buren) for about 5 minutes or so because the main questline of the DLC is like one hour long and there's not really anything else to do in it. It also has barely anything to do with the overarching story. Old World Blues is the next, and it's most peoples' favorites. It has a lot of fun areas to explore that actually have things in them, and the overall presentation is pretty funny and entertaining, which might be a welcome change of pace because of the dreary nature of the rest of the DLCs. Lonesome Road is the final DLC, and while peoples' opinions on it tend to vary (the Lonesome Road True Faction Allegiance mod is pretty much mandatory in my opinion, because otherwise you'll spend the whole time getting yelled at for being an NCR dog because you waved good morning to one of them on your way there), it's a pretty solid conclusion that solves the mystery of who that guy in the collector's edition playing card set was.If I had to complain, it'd be that Lover's Lab's selection of sexual mods for New Vegas is pretty terrible, and you're a lot better off with the Elder Scrolls games if you're into that. It can also be a little slow at the start on additional playthroughs, because even though each area presents multiple ways to handle it you will likely see the same few areas in the beginning because of how the map is designed to send you in one of two paths to New Vegas (the long way that takes you through several areas on your way to New Vegas that you're supposed to take, or the big manly man way through a chasm full of deathclaws). Overall, buy New Vegas.			"

												This game is love. Fallout: New Vegas really tells a brilliant story and although you feel at parts like nothing more than a pew pewing machine, other times there are decisions that affect you as a person, and your emotions, be extreme laughter, or sorrow for the smallest of characters. Without a doubt my favorite DLC is Old World Blues, I highly encourage you to buy this along with the game, if not the entire DLC. OWB had me laughing and giggling with each witty remark, and Obsidian do a fantastic job in both this and its other DLC opposite, Dead Money, a horror type DLC which does a good job of making each step you take a worrying and questionable one due to the enemies AI staying stealth and silent untill the last second. Good job Obsidian, I'm sure the replay value for taking sides will keep me going for quite some time!Edit: The music in this game has become a bliss for me, the music having music from the actual time the game is set in gives a stable feel of authenticity to the game and to its creators. Each time ""Big Iron"" plays from my Pip-Boy I can't help either go along silently in my head, or even start singing it out loud with broken but well meant notes :)Another thing I have to say is something I feel a bit sad about. When I began the game, I had no clue what I was doing and thus, did not like the game at all. I had a friend's strong reccomendation that all would get better and thanks to his reassurance, I've had great fun. So this little note is just to say that you may not fall in love with this game at first, but perseverance makes the game feel like a gift rather than the chore like feel I had at the beginning.

												This is the easily one of the very best story-driven games that exist with decent gameplay and presentation.You probably already know all the pros but I'll skip to the cons outside of poor optimization/engine.-Low effort on Legion path, lots of things unfinished (thanks Bethesda 1 year time limit)-Mojave outpost is pretty ♥♥♥♥, not nearly as important feeling as everyone hypes it out to be-There's like 5 voice actors in the entire game and 2-3 lines that repeat for all the soldiers/NPCs you can't interact with BUT luckily you can fix all of these with mods and more, and the DLC for this game is also fantastic (especially for the mods)Some recommended mods (new game is probably necessary and some of these may clash without Nexus Mod Manager)Also this is not the mod load order, important and you probably need all DLC for this to work (get it anyway it's great)-New Vegas Redesigned III-Project Nevada (Core, Rebalance, Cyberware)-NMCS texture pack (prioritize in first couple mods, use small texture pack if your computer is weak)-Nevada Skies-New Vegas Bounties I, II, III (get all)-More Traits/Perks-Weapon Mods Expanded-Interior Lighting Overhaul-Populated Casinos-Mojave Outpost Redesigned-Fallout Character Overhaul-A World Without Pain-Anti stutter/lag-New Vegas Anti Crash-Some desert eagle mod (trust me here)-New Vegas Killer-Weapons of the new millennia -Vurts WFO-Bad mother fu.cka + all other NPC additions -Improved companion sandbox-Someguy Series master (required for some mods)-Better loading screens (is the name of the mod)-Freeside open-Immserive Karma-Enchanced blood-Wasteland Flora overhaul-Wave Radio-New vegas strip connected-EVE (weapon particle retextures + overhauls especially for laser weapons)Optional (as if the rest weren't):-Unlimited Companions (I just wanted Boone and Cass at same time with the Doctor guy)-Perk every level (I liked an easier game GG EZ)-Run lucky 38 (great but takes time to figure out)-Level cap 100 (self explanatory)If you haven't played the game yet I highly encourage you to get the game with all DLC's, and to definitely get it on a sale (like 100%). If you're not brain dead I also encourage you to install all of these mods before playing the game once as it makes the experience much better. Also even if you have finished the game on vanilla but want to play the game again you should definitely get at least some of the mods listed above.			"

												Allow me to ask you a simple question:Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas?I know, I know. This is something we think every day... but I want you to REALLY think about it. Which game is better? Fallout 3 or New Vegas? Back when New Vegas was released, many critics said it was the equivalent of an expansion pack to Fallout 3 and passed it off as just more of the same without being anything special. Yet now many people argue that New Vegas isn't just the better game... that it might be the best game in the Fallout series.Of course, I'm not one to throw stones in this debate. I've only played Fallout 3 and New Vegas so I can only give opinions on this much smaller debate. God, I'm making this sound more important than it actually is.So, I've never been a big fan of Fallout 3. I enjoyed the time I played it when it came out and then I played the GOTY edition on my second playthrough, and I've considered buying it a third time but I'm always reminded about the stuff in Fallout 3 I didn't like, further emphasized by an interesting video called ""Fallout 3 Is Garbage, and Here's Why"". If you're not easily provoked, I recommend this video. It really reveals the chinks in Fallout 3's design.Obsidian is a very underrated gaming company in my opinion. They've made a couple of my favorite games. And what they did with New Vegas was similar to what they did earlier with Knights of the Old Republic: they took an old idea that was good and tweaked it a bit to make it so much better, added better writing, and shoved in a ton of bugs and glitches. Hey, I didn't say they were perfect. I said they were underrated.So New Vegas is made very similarly to Fallout 3 but small tweaks by Obsidian have made this a wholly different experience. Firstly, the story is a massive improvement. Fallout 3 failed to connect with me because it felt far more like I was following in the footsteps of my Liam Neeson dad without feeling like I was creating my own journey. Sure there were some clever ideas and fun setpieces here and there but the story as a whole was kind of flat. And that's mainly because the writing handled the conflict from the Enclave (and also between good and evil) in a traditional black-and-white view of morality.Fallout: New Vegas is a story of choice. The city of New Vegas is ruled independently by a silent overseer named Mr. House but from the East rises a new foe, Caesar's Legion. Their Roman dictatorships guides them to conquering New Vegas in the name of order. They aren't malicious moustache-twirlers. They have clear motivations and justifiable reasons for why they're doing what they're doing. Along with them is the New California Republic, sticking stubbornly to Old World democratic ways. As a decicive battle begins to rise, you must choose the best possible fate for New Vegas- keep it under Mr. House, vote for the NCR's control, conquer it with Caesar, or... find your own unique path. There is no clear ""right"" or ""wrong"" which makes the decisions feel more personal rather than me sticking to a traditional good and evil mentality like the bullsh** karma system in Fallout 3. Of course, on top of that the side quests handle this similar morality as you are given difficult decisions on what is the best to do. Do you choose to destroy or build? Each comes with a cost and a repercussion when chosen, and it's very believable. Of course, not only did the story keep me playing for 70 house (F***... that's depressing) but also the gameplay is very addicitng. You customize your own character as the Courier and embark your quest, as is expected with most RPGs, but the leveling system is so easy to manipulate in order to beef up your character to their best possible stats and all the hidden locations, secret weapons, and amazing side quests kept me hopping from one objective to the next.The world of New Vegas is also much more aesthetically pleasing than Fallout 3's grimy green and dirty brown Washington D.C. New Vegas has bright blue skies and massive golden deserts lying beneath it. During both day and night, the Mojave is constantly a dynamic and enjoyable place to explore and there's enough variety to the world to keep you wanting to explore the whole area... while... on... foot.If you plan on buying the Ultimate Edition, you'll also be getting several DLC packs, including the 4 added story packs. I'll give a mini-review each of them.Dead Money: Fun trip going back to having little supplies and learning to survive. It's a bit on the hard side though, especially at a random middle point in the game and some obnoxious speakers scattered around the map. But the story is pretty decent and the Sierra Madre looks amazing.Honest Hearts: Much cooler in concept than execution. The world of Zion looks amazing, especially with the added weather effects, but the story is clearly another conflict of two different ideas on how to confront a problem and you choose the option without feeling very invested because the story really loses steam when you realize that it's 80% fetch quests.Old World Blues: It's pretty enjoyable. The intro is too cringe-y and long of a start until you actually starts playing the game... until you get over the first hour difficulty hump where you try to find the right weapons that actually affect your enemies. But the world is kooky, fun to explore, and the ending was oddly unexpected but still believable. That and the new weapons are very useful.Lonesome Road: Definitely my favorite. It adds some much-needed backstory to the Courier (which I think is more of a fault in the main game for not having that) but the Divide is incredible. It's a hard play-through (especially when considered to the Hoover Dam battle) but the ending is satisfying to watch unfold. If you don't get any of the DLC packs, at least get this one.Of course, there are some problems too. The game crashed on me more often than my dad's jalopy and there were a couple bugs and awkward conversations with something blocking the other character's face. That and the voice-acting isn't the best. A lot of actors play their roles very same-y and don't variate their voices enough so that most everyone sounds the same.Despite this, I think Fallout: New Vegas improved massively on the initial formula set up by Fallout 3 by adding in more mature moral dilemmas, a more-interesting world, and some fantastic ideas for quests. Sure there are some problems, but this is a game I played in my past that has gotten better with age for sure. I'm giving Fallout: New Vegas a 9/10.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is simply one of the greatest games I have ever played.I'm not going to pretend i'm not a fanboy as I write this, because I am. I have always been deeply in love with the Fallout series since the first game and I am happy to say it's one series that seems to have only gotten better.I'll start by saying I own this game both on Console and on PC and i've completed the game on both. Though, with Fallout 'completed the game' is a very loose term, I use it to mean finished the main story mission line.Fallout is one of those games that allows you to play how you want, and punishes you accordingly. If you want to be 'evil' then you can, but don't expect to find allies amongst those who want to protect, and if you want to be 'good' then the same applies, but don't expect the Legion to want to help you.My favourite thing about this game is the freedom to play it at your own pace. There is the main story mission which you can follow and most likely complete the game in a few hours, but there are also hundreds of sidequests, areas to explore, people to help and companions to find. My Steam shows that i've played 79 hours and i'm nowhere close to having completed every side quest or exploring every location and in those 79 hours I don't think I've ever felt bored. The morality in this game is another standout feature that I loved. Many games have a good/bad element to it, but I felt in Fallout: New Vegas your actions and choices really do have an impact. I find that there are so many games now that give you choices but they never really affect your gameplay. Fallout: New Vegas isn't one of those. Maybe like me you'll start to question if what seemed to be 100% right at the start, really is the right thing. Fallout does have it flaws though, like most Bethesda games, and they don't intend to fix them. You will most likely find quests glitching out here and there and the game crashing as and when it feels like it. Saving often can massively help, and keeping a Fallout Wiki open in the background to check if the quest you're on has any known glitches is something i'd recommend. There's also the massive issue of killing someone (by mistake or purposely for whatever reason) and finding out 20 hours in they were part of a quest and that quest is either failed, or you have to select an ending you wouldn't have wanted. The frustration of losing an hours worth of gameplay because I forgot to save it has been the reason many times that i've stopped playing, but I always pick it up and play again sooner or later.You can't really go wrong with an open-world rpg survival style game with leveling, perks, companions and over 50 hours gameplay. The game is worth every penny and more in my opinion, and even if you don't have the £14.99 to spend now, when it goes on offer grab it. You won't regret it.			"

												Fallout New Vegas is the best way to shame Fallout 3!As a big Fallout fan, first time I felt I was in Fallout world since the first games was New Vegas.A lucky courier finds himself/herself patched up by a good samaritan and a bullet to avenge.New Vegas introduces us to Mojave, a land where we see the ""future"" of the wasteland.NCR grows to be a large government. But are their goodwill limited to self-benevolence?A newly risen power is the Caesar's Legion. What seperates them from mere slavers?What's the position of the players such as the Brotherhood of Steel or the Enclave in Mojave?And who is Mr House?You're going to find the answers to these questions in this ACTUAL post-apocalyptic game (as opposed to the reskinned fantasy game F3).Ups:Believable charactersGood dialogueVastly improved gameplay (comp to f3)Dusty atmosphereModdable (google for compilations)Downs:Carries the unfixable downs of the f3 engineThis is definitely a must-play for any fallout fans and strongly suggested for any RPG players. For shooter lovers, it still offers a variety of weapons and enemies and a deeper game play then f3.			"

												Coming from Fallout 3 with the positives and negatives that resided there, I was wary of New Vegas. I came in expecting to be bias against it, and instead came out with one of my favorite games of all time. New Vegas offers a unique experience with nods to prior entries in the series, and adds affecting quests and intriguing choices. Its strengths, however, come in the form of its DLC. The main plot of Vegas is interesting, and allows you a large amount of ways to go about the end. But what stands out is the story behind the Sierre Madre (Dead Money), finding out who Randall Clark is (Honest Hearts), learning what's really going on in the Big MT (Old World Blues), and figuring out a part of your past and what you left behind in the Divide (Lonesome Road). Obsidian tells stories that stay with you, and nothing does it better than New Vegas.			"

												Fallout NV is one of my favorite games. It has a great atmosphere,quests,and locations. The modding for the game is top. I reccomend this for anyone that liked Fallout 3(and all who dont need dragons or orcs and elves in a rpg xD)The Fallout series takes place after a nuclear war and the U.S. is desecrated, a shell of its former glory. Humanity emerges from the tragedy as selfish and power-hungry as ever. Despite the bombardment of numerous nukes, the city of Vegas managed to survive the war mostly untouched. In the aftermath, a group of people formed touting the values of the old governmental system and called themselves the New California Republic, or NCR. Thanks to the Hoover Dam, the NCR and citizens of New Vegas have access to clean water and power, something most areas lack. At odds with the NCR is the Legion, a dictatorship lead by a man who renamed himself Caesar. Based on the Roman methodology of conquering other civilizations, the Legion absorbs nearby tribes and enslaves a portion of their population. The NCR and Caesar's Legion butt heads over control of the area, and tensions are high. Deception, cannibalism, space travel and drug use are all themes, really crazy sometimes :)backstep-crit-boooom      :-O			"

SUMMARYObsidian's Fallout: New Vegas is the last good Fallout game. It features everything good out of Fallout 3, features superior writing, and a generally better feel.REVIEWFallout: New Vegas. Otherwise known as ""Fallout 3 that should have been"".Imagine Fallout 3 but with more meat. A lot more meat. I mean a mega-ton more meat. That's New Vegas. Basically, New Vegas features better writing, better plot, more story, better pacing, more interesting side quests, more weapons, more interesting perks, the re-introduction of traits, interesting factions, and interesting locations.New Vegas manages to revive the feel of the classic Fallout games by including fun, interesting characters, grimy locales, and choice with consequences. In the first few moments of the game, you are given a number of choices that can influence how the rest of the introduction will play out. For example, the starting town of Goodsprings is facing a problem with a gang known locally as the Powder Gangers - merciless thugs that use a lot of dynamite. You essentially have four choices: help Goodsprings, help the Powder Gangers, help no one, or kill everyone. But it's not so straight forwards, as there are subtle ways to complete the quest without following the most obvious - being to complete all the objectives. I'll leave the rest for you to find!The visuals are improved only slightly from the previous installment, but they get the job done and can be easily improved using an ENB filter. The basic gameplay mechanics are the same, but there are some improvements here and there. The game shines with its writing, proving that Fallout isn't about the guns and loot as much as the story and characters.New Vegas is known for its large modding community, and it has more files on Nexus Mods than Fallout 3. They range from small tweaks,  as in the popular ""New Vegas Anti Crash,"" or as expansive as Project Nevada - which changes the fundamental gameplay of New Vegas, adds new weapons and armors that are well balanced, adds neat visual effects, overhauls the stealth mechanic, and more. If you are a returning player of New Vegas and haven't played in a while but are still looking for an interesting and immersive experience, I recommend these following mods:- Project Nevada- Enhanced Camera Mod: makes third person animations visable in first person (check the ini!)- Nevada Skies: adds new weather affects, like rain and sandstorms. Works well with Interior Lighting Overhaul which changes the mood of all rooms in New Vegas to be more realistic.- All of Vegas Uncut, especially Freeside Open and the Strip Open.- Enemy AI - Tactics - NPC Healing: just generally makes the AI better and more interesting, plus optional AI healing.- EVE: New effects for explosives and energy weapons- MTUI and oHUD: MTUI is just a more PC friendly hud set up, with small fonts, more room in menus, etc. oHUD is a suite that includes imersive HUD options, (HUD disappears after a moment) adjustable HUD options, and extra HUD options (hardcore needs, clock, etc.)- WMX: Adds a bunch of new, balanced weapon mods.- Classic Dialogue Options: Doesn't tell you when you have a skill check in dialogue. For immersion, etc.- Enhanced Blood Textures: Generally better and meatier looking blood.- Pipboy 2500 mod: it's not a big, ugly Pipboy, neither a gay readius- Flashlight NVSE: adds a host of different flashlights, for when Nevada Skies nights are scaring you away- Fallout 4 Quickloot: The only good thing to come out of Fallout 4.CONCLUSIONWhere Fallout 4 failed miserablely to capture the intangible essence of Fallout, the folks over at Obsidian managed to craft a fantastic Fallout game that is worthy of being placed alongside the classics.

												Never would one imagine that one would find so much to do in such a grand role-playing world. If I were to define New Vegas in a brief sentence, that would be my definitive statement. The extent to which this game has changed me whenever I replay it is incalculable. So much so that it is a difficult task to enumerate its many virtues. I will try to stick to vital values. Firstly, this is a game that adapts itself to several gameplay tastes. Whether one wishes to play it casually, attentive to storytelling elements and lore progression, or whether one would rather feel the potential for post-apocalyptic survival that it presents, New Vegas is there to provide it. Explore the numerous side-quests or discover how influential and emblematic each of the four main-quest personalities of the game (Yes-Man, Caesar, Mr. House, General Oliver and his entourage) can be. There is never a shortage of in-game mythos prone to in-depth unearthing by the player should they be interested enough. On the other hand, the game is so self-sufficient and self-explanatory as to not demand any background knowledge should the player choose to ignore Falloutian lore. And all that wholeness executed in perplexing 18 months by the careful minds at Obsidian.New Vegas steps into the chaotic territories of mechanic bugginess from the infamous Gamebryo/Havok combination, but manages to keep major nuisances at bay. I have never experienced a single game-breaking bug or glitch, only the minor and even amusing stuff. And although the mechanics was already dated when it was released (late 2010), New Vegas feels like a fresh journey with its simple but timely additions - among them I can bring up the Companion Wheel, shooting downrange, and the addition of a hotkey to switch between ammo types; not to mention the precise crafting system and the hardcore gameplay option.Characters are as close to perfection as you can get with an RPG. Brilliant voice-acting, immense sense of uniqueness in each of the relevant characters, and an actually solid story given to each and every one of the player's companions. This is the good old Fallout 2 companion system that we are discussing here, only improved. A set of quests intertwined with the main conflicts shall give the player valuable support for the entirety of the game's mythos, as almost every companion has a history with the Mojave to be scrutinised. The emotions enticed by such quests can vary greatly, and only serve to reiterate Obsidian's sharpness in delivering an authentic, almost flawless rendering of branching storyline in an electronic RPG. And these are just side-quests. I am not even going to discuss the merits of the game's intricate main storyline, as I leave it up to anybody thinking of buying this title and playing it for their first time.Willing to abandon your real-world anxieties for valuable moments of embedding yourself with an immersive post-apocalyptic experience? Investigate or intimidate, persuade or kill, hide or bring mayhem about, survive or secure your niche, craft or buy from merchants. New Vegas gives you all said options to prosper and unveil its stories. The Mojave awaits, and it will reveal a thousand mysteries as long as one is willing to travel extensively across its horrifying deserts. Those points and several others are some of the reasons why this is one of the most impressive videogaming enterprises I have ever witnessed.			"

FALLOUT NEW VEGAS PUTS AAA TITLES TO SHAME!Incredible game for ludicrously low price.If you are going to mod new vegas after playing for a while, I strongly recommend the following mods from Nexus CommunityProject NevadaMakes the game even more interesting than it already is. You can have optional FPS Shooter elements with Project nevada. Dynamic Crosshair, Bullet-time, Peripheral vision etc, fully customizable you can enable or disable them at any time. Also to mention Cybernetic implants which give the player extra perks.True leaning, by XilandoEssential if you are going to Install Project Nevada, or Stealth. A very simple mod which allows you to peek from corners. Thats about it.NMC Texture PackThe game is a little old, but NMCTP revitilazes the game giving more realistic and detailed textures. Will consume extra space on your HD but worth it definetely.Bottle that WaterIt's odd that Obsidian devs missed such feature, by default you don't have the possibility to refill water from lakes, pumps or fountains. But thanks to the modding community now you can.The mods I recommend going on and on, there are definetely more essential mods but I wrote the most important.Look from my personall mods installed here:http://i.imgur.com/Xixo1zb.pngI Bought Fallout New Vegas on Autumn Sale 2014, Invested many hours playing even after finishing the game I feel like playing it all over again. I upgraded it to Ultimate Edition on winter sale 2014, to get all the DLC's to increase the playability of the game. It's basically enormous game, and the time you  can spend on it. Let's also mention the ridicilous modding potential, if it happens to beat the game with all 4 ""factions"" and finishing the DLC, you can either turn the game into a complete sandbox, give it some bounty hunting mode or user-created quests.

												New Vegas is a faithful sequel to Fallout 2: New Reno. Much like its predecessor, the game features a desert, gangsters, casinos, guns, surprisingly good role-playing. The game takes place in the Mojave Wasteland � a pretty much lifeless, HUGE and twice as many locations as F03.  It's a bleak world without much hope and the choice is between bad and worse.New Vegas does have a few technical issues. Overall, the game is best played not as a sandbox but as a more traditional RPG where you explore the main quest, which, depending on your choices, will send you to a variety of locations. New Vegas is a huge game. I can probably write another 6 pages examining New Vegas's various aspects but i'd rather play more. This game is only improved upon with the INSANELY TALENTED modding community with some quest mods even better than the ones Obsidian has written themselves dont forget all the armour, weapons, the re-texture's and mods that increase the difficulty of the Mojave. Without a doubt a MUST OWN! even without mods and any DLC its just so great it would be a crime to not pick this up worth any amount of money.			"

												More than just a Fallout ""3.5"", Fallout New Vegas is definitely an unique game for me. The atmosphere, the weapons, the lore, the NPCs... all of this make it my favourite game.Instead of having the focus on your character's story like in Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas puts mostly the focus on the background of those places : the war between the NCR and the Legion. This background is so well-introduced and so well-placed, when I met Mr. House for the first time I felt like it was a movie (a true icone of the game). Thanks to this, you feel like a part of the Mojave and not just playing an RPG game.About the gameplay, the new crafting seems a bit too complicated and unworthy to be really used, but the addons on weapons are really nice to get. Also the survival mode makes the game a great experience. Like in FO3, the locations are well detailled, and even if they don't have a reason to be visited through some quests, you'll end up doing it just to find the funny easter eggs.Finally about the RPG part, you'll really feel like your actions have influence on the world and also how the world will react to you. You have a karma with each faction, and each one will change your own story in the Mojave. "

												Took me a while to get into but once i did, i loved it.It's better then Fallout 3, why ? Because it lets you do whatever you please, you can kill everything if you feel like it, even important characters related to the main plot of the game can die and the world will react to it properly with many dialogs with NPCs changing to what you did and some quests might not even be open to you anymore due to what you did.Quests in New Vegas tend to have alot of multiple choices,solutions and endings, not just one neutral ending,one evil ending and one good ending , instead there's a fine line of varying shades of grey which will often make you think about what you're about to do instead of doing the usual video game trope of ""Well, i wanna be a good guy/a**hole so I'll pick text that's in blue/red"".This is why people tend to recommend Obsidian's New Vegas over Bethesda's Fallout 3, New Vegas has far more intreasting things to do in it with an insane amount of choices and outcomes which make replaying it a second and even a 3rd time still a somewhat refreshing experience without resorting to installing community made quests via the Nexus mod site.However, the problem New Vegas still has to this date is the engine it's powered by.Even when it came out back in 2010, the engine it had was considered a fairly limiting and old engine, it can only use 2GB of RAM on a system which is just one of the many reasons why  this game loves to crash so much.It also comes with an annoying micro-stutter bug that's caused by the fact than the engine was for some reason coded for 64 Hz at 64 FPS for some strange reason and since pretty much no one in this world has a TV/Monitor that's 64Hzs, it ends up causing weird micro-stutters in the game.Thankfully the community created various mods which fixed these issues, there's a popular mod which removes the micro-stutters so you can enjoy a a nice smooth 60 (or 120/144 ) FPS experience without any stutters and there's a community made launcher which enables New Vegas to properly use at least 4GB of RAM and not just 2, which is a must if you plan to mod New Vegas with graphical mods that increase texture sizes alot or maybe add alot more models and other things in the world to be loaded by.Overall, it's an amazing game that's sadly sometimes hampered with technical issues it has due to the engine it uses.

												Fallout New Vegas is an excellent game. Generally speaking, I do not really play any games over 50 hours unless I really enjoy the game, and with 80 hours, I completed my first playthough of Fallout New Vegas, including the DLC. So in terms of time that you can get out of this game, Fallout New Vegas is worth every cent.The game itself is fun and the questing system is enjoyable just like Fallout 3, which I have previously played. Many quests have multiple ways to finish it and there are tons of branches that open up from that. Additionally, Fallout New Vegas features factions which is an interesting a good addition from Fallout 3. Not to put an major spoilers in, but I ended up compeltely destroying a ceratin faction that just did not seem like a good bunch of people >:) But you can really destroy the balance with the factions with certain actions and sometimes they lead to unintended consequences. There is so much to do in New Vegas and so much to explore. The skill line, perks, and skill requirements for things are all just as good as Fallout 3, except that leveling up is a little too fast and easy in Fallout New Vegas in my opinion. The visuals and audio are good as well as with almost all Bethesda games so there really isn't too much that is bad with Fallout New Vegas.The DLC for Fallout New Vegas are generally fun. The only DLC that I didn't really like was Dead Money because it was so dark and creepy for most of the time, even though I was overpowered by the time I went in. Dead Money just didn't give me a good feel playing it. Old World Blues and Lonesome Road were by far the best two DLC compared to the other New Vegas and Fallout 3 DLC as well. I personally liked Old World Blues the best, but Lonesome Road is closely behind.Although I generally have no problems with Fallout New Vegas, there are actually a couple of game breaking problems. When I mean game breaking, I mean actually game breaking. There are certain parts of the game that completely glitch the game and freeze it, prevent it from continuing, or crash it. I installed a couple of mods (that did not change the gameplay at all since I like Vanilla) to fix the bugs and crashes such as the unnofficial patch. The mods integrate very smoothly with Nexus Mod Manager so it is very easy to ""fix"" the game for the most part.TLRD: With the glitches and bugs aside, Fallout New Vegas is an incredible game that is a ton of fun.Rating: 9.2/10Recommend Price: Full Price (it's worth every cent!)

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. The reason ... the freedom. Sure you could say it’s for the graphics (not), or the amazing story line, or even the gameplay. No, the freedom the game offers you is amazing. You start of a guy/or gal, woken up from a shot to the head that should have killed you. Although some information was given about the person you choose to play as, I would have liked to seen more from the game. From the start you are given various options as to how you want yourself to be represented. As a hero, or an anarchist. Aside from the freedom you also get lovable characters and their factions, the decisions you make, and locations you venture off to that you   WILL remember. Graphic wise, the game isn't strong. The animations aren’t either. But you know what who cares, oh you do? MODS!!! The modding community of this game is huge, however it has  gotten smaller but sure as hell isn’t dead. The community is still alive and still pumping those sweet, juicy, hot mods you want. The mods include many things like : texture packs, weapons, or weapon mods; quest, npc's, and a whole lot more. Don’t like the mods the community has to offer? Make your own! The game does have a creation kit,yes it is confusing, but with a little practice you’ll be making mods better than a lot of the stuff on the sites. Sure the game isn’t perfect but you can make as good or as horrible as you like depending on what you do in the game or what you do to the actual game.			"

Went to ruins, sniped down ghouls, stole their loot. At that point, I was attacked by an invisible demon, I panicked and shot grenades everywhere like a spaz. Repaired a rocket ship, loaded it with some more ghouls, shot it into the sun.Day Three: Made it to New Vegas. Got shot at by some Elvis impersonators, removed their skulls in revenge.

												I usually don't do lengthy reviews, but, hey, it's Fallout.Pros:- Great story- Hundreds of quests- Can run smoothly on probably any computer- A lot of choices- Mods- DLC- Dozens of different play styles- Easy and challenging- Dozens of weapons and locations that I haven't even been to yet.- S.P.E.C.I.A.LCons:- Can be buggy- Crashes- Sometimes frustrating- After playing it multiple times, Goodsprings is repetitiveSome things you might care about:Question: I like (genre) games, and not western games like New VegasResponse: Chances are, Fallout: New Vegas has some of that genre. It's not horror, but sometimes creepy. Also, if you don't like western games, it doesn't really matter because New Vegas has it all.Question: Do I have to side with the good side?Response: No, and there really isn't one ""good side"". You can side with the NCR, Legion, Mr. House, or Yes Man.Question: How should I approach this game?Response: In my opinion, approach it how you'd like, at least in the first play through.Conclusion:Should you get this game?Absolutely. $10 for a game this great is a steal. I have 125+ hours so far on this game and I haven't played every quest yet. Words cannot express of how good a game this is.			"

												If you are a fan of RPG's this one should definately be in your library. The atmosphere is both horrific and beautiful. It immerses you into the post apocolyptic world that is Fallout. The story is excellent, the music is perfectly suited for the terrifying wasteland, the combat is great fun. Overall an excellent game that is highly recommended!			"

												War, war never changes.The GameFallout New Vegas is another Fallout series, which focuses on open world experience, with combat and RPG. Fallout New Vegas, like its predecessors, inherits lot of its series strong points, the most important thing is that your choice matters. The game is set upon the ruins of Nevada after the Great War, which includes the ""city"" of Las Vegas and its surroundings, such as Primm, Goodsprings, and Freeside. Like in RPG games, you can interact with a ton of characters, you could speak, trade, or get mission from them. The combat in the game is similar to FPS, which means just point your gun and shoot, but also added with a special mechanic that allow you to stop time for a while and fire more accurately.The Good of the GameOpen World. No borders.Since the beginning of the game, you can go whenever you wanted. You heard from the NPCs that the Quarry Junction is filled with deadly deadclaws, which are high-level encounters. You still want to go there? No problem. Do you want to skip early mission and head straight into New Vegas? No problem. You wanted to use that beautiful gun? No problems, there are no level requirement, just some stats requirement (for example : You need a high skill in Guns before you can use a Marksman Rifle).You can interact with many people.Every people have their own schedule, so you won't find a single person at the same location every time. At night they usually goes asleep at their own home. Some may visit other people, some may visit casinos, but no one will just stand and waiting for you to talk to them. You can kill people, enslave people (mods required), pickpocket them, puts grenade in their pants, etc. Some of them have interesting personalities, in fact most of the personalities you would find in Fallout New Vegas are on the colorful side, instead of the ""Regular Joe"" personalities. Like what a character in the game said : ""If someone is too clean, you can bet he/she has hidden a terrible secret.""Great DLCsFallout New Vegas does not have DLCs that only add 1-2 weapons, but they add DLCs that gives a new area to play, even some DLCs have different way to play. At Honest Hearts DLC, you are living with the tribes near Grand Canyon, thus you must rely on traditional medicine instead of your regular stimpak. At Dead Money, you are forced to be more resourceful and careful. And so on and so on.Better companion system that the previous game.Interactions with companions is now done using companion wheel, so you can order them around without the trouble of going to their dialog choices one by one. On the other hand, you companions also have a lot of interesting backstories attached to them. Faction systemThere are lots of faction vying for power in New Vegas. If you kill faction A members, expect them to came to you and try to kill you. If you help faction B members, expect them to give you something or help you.Weapon moddingA new feature in FNV, that allows weapons to be added with mods, such as scopes, silencers, cooling system, etc. A small but great addition to the game.Interesting worldThe world is interesting. The game is interesting. The world is interesting. The story, mission, backstories, they are all interesting. Interesting means that they evoke a sense of ""need to see the end"" of the story, so you don't get bored. The details of this game is also big, there are lots of terminals and logs scattered around places that gives rich backstory to the game.Mod supportEnough said. With mod support, there are lots of changes in the game. There are mods that makes the game more realistic, whether in the gameplay, lighting, or the weather. Some mods add weapons, armors, and other stuff to the game. Some even add areas outside the game world for more gaming hours. Mods are what Fallout New Vegas are still played today.The Bad of the GameBugsLike your regular Bethesda game, there are some bugs. Some doors fail to open, some achievements fail to register, some quests do not work, but mostly it is a minor issue. Being a PC master race, usually a simple console commands will fix the bug too. Bear in mind that the game is very stable, but using mods may creates instability, though it adds lots of fun.Companion missionWhile companion mission are great backstories and great stories themselves, to trigger them it is fairly difficult. Without guides, sometime we can only walk in the dark. Even more, some companions ""trigger"" will only trigger once (for example : when meeting a person for the first time) thus by just playing you could miss your companion mission and it have detrimental effect in the ending.VerdictA definite buy this game. Don't buy Fallout 4 yet, but buy this one and Fallout 3. Both are great games. "

Note: I've spent hundreds of hours on this game excluding its DLC on the console versions. There are so many good things that can be said about this game, from gameplay to side quests to how the S.P.E.C.I.A.L and skills work, but I can only say one thing that makes me prefer this game so much over Fallout 3. I would have to say it is the constant references to Fallout 1 and 2, by exploring the wastes, talking to people, and even gathering items from those times, you can really see how Obsidian pays tribute to the games they helped create whilst under the name Black Isles. From the tales of a screaming Sargeant stationed at Navarro, to tales about The Master, and finally to the Chosen One blowing up an oil rig; it's obvious the wastelanders will never forget about the amazing tales of the Vault Dweller and the Chosen One. Neither will Bethesda, Obsidian, and most importantly, us, the players.You will never get bored of this game, it's a masterpiece just like the games before it. 10/10			"

												So instead of reviewing the game I'll tell you about a near perma-death-loop experience I had as an example of what kind of crazy stuff can happen in this game, and then you can decide if a game that allows you to experience crazy stuff like this is the kind of game you're interested in.-So I get a quest to go into this old abandoned vault to figure out why the towns water is radiated. They tracked the radiation to the vault but since there's tons of undead in it nobody wants to go in.-I get my rad suit on for protection, I got stimpacks, some fresh water, some rad-away, some rad-X and so on.-I head in and find out that there's a small cave I have to get through first.-Then I enter the vault.-I find my 1st vault dweller (undead) pretty easy, dead in a few shots of my 9mm machine gun.-I take some Rad-X to prevent rad poisoning.-And then I find my 1st vault dweller guard.-He's much stronger than the 1st, and he gets a lot of good hits on me.-I drink some water, and eat some food, it restores my health, but I still needed to use the one super stimpack I had, so now that's gone.-I have 10 water, 2 food, 4 stimpacks, and 1 doctors bag at this point.-So then I go deeper and deeper in the vault, navigating the maze, all the while my rad points are increasing steadily.-I get rad poisoning, I use some rad-away. This happened multiple times until the last time when I ran out of both anti-radiation meds.-By now I've explored most of the vault going from terminal to terminal to open door after door.-By now I have 5 water, no food, 1 stimpack, and a doctors bag.-I find the vault overseer who is the most radiated of the undead and the strongest, he's protected by 2 machine gun turrets.-Before fighting him I take out all the nearby undead to avoid them interrupting the fight and catching me off guard.-My supplies are: 3 water, no food, no doctors bag-I proceed to the overseer's door. My health is VERY low, so I use all 3 of my survival magazines to increase my water's effectivness of healing me, I then proceed to use all the water I have left in order to have the most health possible.-My health is now at 85% and I have no healing supplies.-I open the door, and the turrets start firing. I sneak in a grenade which takes them out.-My companion (A robot named ED-E) charges in and gets some good hits on the overseer, he now has half health, and I still have 85%.-He charges and I have no choice but to back away as quickly as possible while shooting a plasma rifle at him.-He gets plenty of hits on me lowering me to 5% health.-Then I get rad poisoning. And have no way of stopping it.-So now my brain FINALLY says ""GET THE CRAP OUT!""-So I begin to make my way out and actually run into another vault guard, I use a stealth boy in order to avoid detection, and have ED-E take him out.-After this happens my health is down to 4%. (Rad poisoning)-I proceed to try and find the fastest route out, but since it's a maze down there I end up just wandering aimlessly.-Eventually I find the exit to the vault.-My health is at 1%.-And then I hear a vault dweller directly behind me.-ED-E takes him out and by some INSANE luck, I level up.-Now leveling up does not restore health in Fallout. It just lets you increase your stats. So I'm not too excited.-But then it turns out it was an even number I leveled up to, which means I get a new perk.-One of the perks that I can unlock at level 12 (Which is what I leveled up to) is one that allows me to increase my max health by 50 more points.-And so I use it, make it out of the cave, fast travel to a doctor, and fix the rest.10/10 would panic insanely again.

												There are lots of people who say that Fallout 3 is better than Fallout: New Vegas because Fallout 3 has better dialogue, or more interesting characters, or makes you care more about the world than New Vegas does. Those people are lying.Let's start with the obvious one: The world. In Fallout 3, you basically have a choice of being a good guy or being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥-bag, but no matter what, you are railroaded into following the main quest line, which is to grow up in the vault, leave to chase after your father, join up with the Brotherhood of Steel, and fulfill your parents' dream of a wasteland filled with life. The only difference between a ""good"" and ""evil"" main quest completion is which of two options you pick at the very end, either putting a modified FEV strain into the water supply to kill off ""unfit humans,"" becoming a eugenicist in the process, or not doing that. That's it. A ""Do you want to be evil? Y/N"" dialogue box at the very end of the main quest is NOT GOOD DESIGN. Even worse, picking one choice or the other doesn't actually change anything after you complete the main quest. In New Vegas, by contrast, you have four different ways to finish the main quest line, and you're locked into picking one when you're still a few quests away from the climactic ending. Once you've firmly sided with one faction, the others  will shun you, and even attack you if you're particularly mean to them. The fate of the Mojave wasteland is real and dynamic, and you get to shape it to your will far more than you can the Capitol wasteland.And that's not even mentioning the fact that it takes a solid ten minutes in Vault 101 before you're let out into the world, while you only need about sixty seconds of listening to Michael Hogan before you can start roaming in New Vegas. The tutorial in NV is more organic than F3, and completely optional.What about the mechanics? Well, F:NV has everything F3 does, PLUS a fully-flushed crafting system (Fallout 3 let you make 10 marginally useful items from blueprints; New Vegas has dozens, maybe hundreds, of craftable items) that includes campfire remedies, reconstruction and recalibration of bullets, improvised ammo, natural poisons, and lots more; the ability to AIM DOWN YOUR SIGHTS (I didn't remember how much I valued that until I picked up Fallout 3 again); a higher level cap and more - and more specialized - perks (lots of Fallout 3's were just ""Add 5 points to this attribute and 5 to that one!"" Boring.); the need to choose two handicaps at the start of the game to make each playthrough pose its own challenges; faction disguises; a hardcore mode; decreased effectiveness of V.A.T.S. to make the choice of whether to use it or not meaningful (in Fallout 3 you could just spam Jet with Grim Reaper and mow down tons of foes without thinking; NV makes you play more tactically); and lots of other things I've mostly forgot about. From a mechanics perspective, then, Fallout: New Vegas does beat Fallout 3.What about characterization? Lots of people have said that they just didn't care about the characters in Fallout: New Vegas the way they did the characters in Fallout 3. I can only conclude they didn't get exposed to any video game characters before playing Fallout 3, because New Vegas' characters are definitely more flushed out. Companions are the best example of this: In Fallout 3, your companions have the personality of two lines in a speech bubble stapled to a cardboard cutout with a crayon smiley-face drawn on. There are no real differences between the companions: They simply run around, shoot whatever weapon you give them, and have a few generic lines of dialogue. In New Vegas, however, each character starts out holding a part of their personality back from you - you know, like people in real life. They have personal motivations, and will leave you if you do something they don't like (for example, retired NCR ranger Boone will leave if you start hurting NCR people, Cass will leave if you have very low Karma, etc.). If you do things they like while they're travelling with you (for example, if you have Chuck Bartow- I mean, Arcade Gannon in your party when you direct HELIOS One's power to Freeside and Westside), you will eventually trigger more dialogue options where they tell you more about their past - because they trust you - and, depending on how you respond, you can trigger a quest that has them confront their past, the choices they've made, and what their future holds. You, as their friend, have some influence based on your dialogue options, and that impacts the way these characters will act in the future. This is the epitome of characterization in video games. That is about as close to ""how people work"" that we're going to get in an open-world post-apocalyptic RPG, and I love it. I'm not going to bother getting into nitpicky things like weapons, armor, buff items, etc. It's a sequel, so of course there's an improvement in the variety of items. That's to be expected.In short, the worst Fallout: New Vegas can be accused of is ""not improving on Fallout 3 enough."" Fallout 3 is better from a ""Narrative storytelling"" perspective - the narrator, of course, being Liam Neeson - but Fallout: New Vegas is a game where *you* choose who you are - which is the crux of an RPG, a Fallout game in particular. I recommend you get both this and Fallout 3, but if you *have* to pick just one, New Vegas is the better option. -Heit			"

												You were fooled. Tricked. Betrayed by the man. But you wake up from the grave with a mighty lust for revenge and nothing is going to stop you.Thats how i felt when I first started playing New Vegas. I think it has one of the most amazing beginnings of any game, because you just feel that you have the get back at the man who shoots you in the opening cutscene. A lot of people have spoken in a negative way about how the game isn't open from the start, and while I partly agree with that, I don't think it matters that much becuse starting your journey towards the strip is just so engaging.Like any other game from the fallout franshice the experience is what you make of it. If you just use the first gun you find, only follow the main storyline and don't talk to people and explore, you're probably not going to get that much out of the game, althoug it is certenly playabe that way.To get the most out of this game, you have to immerse yourself in your character that you can basically make your own in most ways; from what faction you are going to side with, handling delicate situuations peacfully with you charm or going in guns blazing killing everything is sight, how you are going to look and act during dialouges.The game is however full of bugs (and not just the giant insects trying to kill you). Some of it can be excused due to it being such a large world with so much to do, but it can be annoying at times when the game freezes, some character interactions being buggy and objects glitching out.But most bugs can be fixed throug unofficial patches since fallout probably has one of the largest modding comunities. This also means you can add endless amounts of content to game already filled to the brim with it.Fallout: New Vegas is a great addition to the already fantastic fallout series, fixing alot of the problems people had with Fallout 3, like like the iron sight. It aslo contains probably my favourite storyline in the series so far, with gambling, gangs and a big battle.8/10Feel free to check out my other reviews.			"

												What do you get when you cross the Post-Apocalypse with the Old West? A bullet to the head.You play the role of a Courier who was ambushed, ""killed"", and brought back from the brink of death. Now you can hunt down the man who shot you and left you for dead! Or not. Take over the Mojave Desert! Or not. You can do pretty much what you like, even if that means shooting everyone while giggling like a madman/madwoman. (Giggling not included.)The DLC is recommended as well.			"

												After the huge dissapointment that ruined the fallout franchise and decided that Fallout should be a fantasy first person action game with an ilusion of choice codnamed 'Fallou 3' we actually get a Fallout game. Ladies an gentlemen, welcome to Vegas. New Vegas.Now I'll be comparing this masterpiece to both FO3 and FO4:New Vegas is set much closer to the original Fallout games, on the west coast, where super mutants don't exist everywhere for shooting things reasons, there are no colapsed buildings to force you to go around or use console comadns( that annoyed me so much the only way I was traveling the DC ruins was using tcl).There are no enemies named 'raider', the 'raiders' are part of different gangs. There are FACTIONS, something thatwas missing in FO3, and they don't shoot at you for gameplay reasons. In case you haven't figured it out I'm talking about the Enclave, who even if you side with them still try to kill you just so you have something to shoot at that shoots back at you. Speaking of the Enclave WTF are they doing on the east coast in DC? I tought they blew upp at the oil rig back in FO2. You can still find remnants of the Enclave scattered across the Mojave, and they are well aware thet the Enclave blew up at the oil rig, one of them can be your companion. Companoins who won't hate you because you want to make money. Oh, and inn this game you aren't a concerned middle-aged white parent, or a 19 years-old daddy's boy, no, you are a... mailman. The Mailman. Who has more than 4 answers to a question. In FO4 you had 4 options: 1) Yes(I'll help you)2)A question that lead to the other options3) Sarcastic( make a bad joke that will make the player feel embarased they chise it and help him)4) I don't care about you but my character and quest  marker does so I'll help you anyway kind of option that will make your companion hate youIn New Vegas you can talk your way out of most situations with a SKILL check, and not having to quicksave before you choose something in case you have 10+ Charisma but you still fail. Also this CHR checks are not color coded for people with low INT(see what I did there) who can't read numbers. Also in FO4 INT no longer affects your speech, because they could't record so many lines. Take this for example:Fallout 4When you meet Kellogg, no matter what you say( all options indicating that you are a middle-aged concerned white parent) your options are:I'll kill youI'll make you sufferI'll make you payA bad joke about killing him again in hell or something like thatYou can't convince him to leave, either by a speech check or by having low INT, You can't side with him, BUT you can shoot him, because this what FO4 is all about: shooting things and being a middle-agedg concerned white parentIn FNVWhen you talk to the Legate you can tell him to f*ck off, you can convince him to fight you 1v1 with a karma check(karma no longer being in FO4)ORWhen you meet with Benny you can just kill him, have sex with and kill him in his sleep, let him escape and tell him to let you live etc.Also New Vegas includes dark humor, not bad and embarasing jokes that only a middle-aged concerned white parent would say. In FNV you have no family, no friends, it's just you, the Mailman. And that makes you feel like an adult making your own choices that affect the game.The 4 main factions are: Mr House, The NCR, the Legion and Yes Man's independent New Vegas. When you finish a faction's quest you don't get the same end mission( yeah,you have to face Lanius, but under different circumstaces) like you do in FO4. Also, some may disagree, but its better if the game doesn't allow to play after the main quest because if you sided with let's say the NCR, you've probably done all of their quests before the second battle for Hoover Dam. If you would still be ablle to play, there'd be no legion, no Mr House so it's better if the game ends with the main quest. Also this game includes gambliing, just like FO3 and FO4, but unlike FO3 and FO4 it's gambling with chips and money and all that, not your skills and dialog options. There are also plenty of smaller factions such as the Great Khans, The BoS, who can either help or work against in the second battle for Hoover Dam.Take this for example: Colonel Moore from the NCRasks you to(spoilers) deal with the BoS. You can initiate the self destruct sequence, just kill them of sign a truce between the NCR and the BoS. Each of these options will give you a diffferent end slide, and the Courier can decide if the choice was either good or bad. You can play as a saint or thedevil's right hans if you want, you don't have to be the Wasteland's hero. FO4 wants you play as a good guy, but it doesn't really let you help people. In FNV you can really help people if you want to, like helping people in Freeside kick their habbits, not making you build houses like a minecraft ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for 'settlers'  who are never happy. There are plenty of houses in Boston, you don't need more.			"

												Best Fallout title to datemassive amounts of content worthwhile exploration, faction affinity and looting as well as immersive side stories after having played fallout 4 I realized one of the things I loved the most about this game was the dialogue options and skill system. You can become a professional and your dialogue reflects it, if you've got high medical skill you'll have unique conversations with doctors, got guns? talk to gunsmiths and so onthey also included the classic fallout intelligence dialogue feature in that if youre intelligence is really high you speak clearly and concisely and if it is really low you basically just talk like a super mutantcan't reccomend this game highly enough			"

												Well, where to start? Hmm, ok, the main story of New Vegas: VERRRRY well written! An almost perfect balance of difficulty, questlining, exploration and cast of colourful characters. An awesome 4 different endings for the final Hoover Dam battle, deciding the ultimate fate of the Mojave forever. Plenty of side and faction quests to keep you occupied for an easy 100+ for completionists. The factions are very cool, with some very interesting backstories, e.g. how the NCR are the re-construction of the democratic world, or how the Legion are basing themselves on the success of Pre-War Rome. Definitely adds to the throwback of the Pre-War era.Ok onto the DLC's:Lonesome Road: Ok Lonesome Road has got to be my favourite DLC by far. The amazing and yet emotional story of the true destruction of human nature, The Divide. The hellish nightmare you'd think most of the Fallout world would truly be. With plenty of secret US Govt. bases and awesome prototype laser weapons including Red Rocket. A heartwarming and cold-blooded ending with the tale encrypted into ED-E, and an epic finale showdown in an OPERATIONAL Nuclear Missile Silo, with the option to change all Faction relations in the Mojave with the option to Nuke NCR or Legion... or BOTH! 10/10 would replay many times!Old World Blues: This was an interesting DLC. Travelling to an old Pre-War Area51-esque science base called Big MT, having your Spine, Brain and Heart removed for robot parts, and then quest to overthrow the facility and track down your old brain in a very epic confrontation. Definitely will recommend this DLC to anyone. 10/10Dead Money: Ok, so Dead Money. This DLC has a unique and interesting storyline, of a super luxurious casino opened on the day of the Great War bombings in 2077. Having never opened, and left sealed in a cloud of toxic dust, it has been haunted by the ghosts and holograms left to rot. I liked the story of the Greatest Heist of the Century. Howecer, the downside to this DLC is the unbelievable difficulty. It took me as a Lvl50 character, 9 hours and about 12 deaths later to beat it. Its a good DLC, but needs to be nerfed in Difficulty ALOT! 6/10Honest Hearts: Honest Hearts was the kind of DLC made specifically for the more strategic and cartegoraphical advanced player. Not an easy terrain to navigate in the Utah badlands, but a very cool Native American-esque story with many tribes scared of Pre-War structures, living the old native way, under threat for warmonger tribe White Legs. And a heartwarming story to decide the fate to Fight or Run to save the Sorrows and Dead Horses. And a very confronting meet with The Burned Man himself.... 9/10			"

												Considered by most people as the best fallout. This game is a great game with tons to do. Your choices matter in this game. If you decided to team with any faction it could drastically affect the game. You can be evil or a saint. This game is a great fallout game and a great game in general. This game worth every penny and sometimes it even goes on sales so you could get this amazing wasteland to explore and reform for just 5$! Great game haven't gotten the DLC yet but I hear it is great so I will get it as soon as possible.			"

												More and more, I return to New Vegas as the absolute paragon of how a game can resist the ""Show it all in one playthrough"" mentality, taking your actions and choices and moulding them into a meaningfully different, unique-to-you conclusion that describes how your time in the Mojave Wasteland affected not only the fate of characters you met, but entire factions and regions of America in the years following the game's conclusion.Obsidian provide a masterclass in storytelling, engaging and memorable quests, meaningful choices and fantastic post-apocalyptic survival gameplay. Fallout has always been about the world that was burned away as much as it is about the world that rose from its ashes, and Obsidian never forgets this. Dark humour abounds, twinged with a kind of sadness, but also with profound musings on what it is to be human, what it means to lose your history and culture, and how we might replace these things among the ruins of the civilisation of yesteryear.A fantastic job is done of resisting painting the franchise's various factions as simply ""goodies and baddies"", giving you the freedom to decide the fate of the Mojave without feeling like you have been pidgeon-holed down clear-cut, simplified endings. The game refrains from judging the player's morality in a refreshing way, staying true to a core tenet of Fallout: morality is a flexible thing that can mean many things in the Wasteland.I cannot stress enough that this is a game totally unafraid to bar you from embarking on certain quests as a result of your actions, and I must insist that if you play it, you fully embrace it. It's not about seeing it all, it's about the tailored story unique to your character that came about by reacting intelligently to how you played, and letting the chips fall where they may. In my most recent playthrough I played as an Enclave fanatic, and this roleplaying decision governed all of my choices - what weaponry and armour I wore, how I interacted with others, the factions I chose to support and attack. It couldn't have been a more different playthrough than my first, where I decided to be chummy with the New California Republic. It is hard to describe the satisfaction to be had when a game reacts so capably to your decision-making. Few games have done it as well as here.Companions are memorable and have side-quests which open up their characterisation and make you feel attached. Locations are iconic, ranging from the debauched New Vegas Strip to the sun-baked settlements that surround it.The DLC is, frankly, unmissable, chronicling an excellent story thread which is interwoven in each piece of DLC despite them at first glance appearing to be thematically unrelated. It's important to play them in order of release for the full effect.Fallout 3 was an amazing RPG, but New Vegas reminded me why exactly I had loved Fallout so much in the first place. Closer to Fallout 1 and 2 in tone and RPG design, New Vegas leaves huge boots to fill for Bethesda's Fallout 4. New Vegas honestly remains one of the best games of its generation.			"

												I know the Fallout series from the promotions of fallout 4 when it was announced. It is a great game. As a fan of FPS games, I can't deny the fun of fallout 4. Until I bought and play Fallout: New Vegas (FO:NV), I start to realise what an RPG should be like. It would not be exaggerated to say that this game is the best among Fallout 3, NV and 4.The GoodsBeing a real RPGIn the game, when you talk to someone else, there are usually at least 3 dialogue options to be chosen. DIfferent dialogue can lead to different ending of that mission or even brings good/bad impression to the ppl in that area. In contrast, the dialogue options in fallout 4 is limited to 4 only. In some situation, different dialogue options will lead to the same consequences. Fallout 4 has been focusing on FPS too much and forgotten the RPG part. FO:NV has shows what a good RPG should be like --- the player can immerse in playing as the protagonist.Attention to detailAs mentioned before, what the player has done can affect the reputation of him/her in a town/settlement. For example, if the player has completed a lot of side quests assigned by the residents in the settlement, residents there will be more polite to the player and may even offer discount to the player when he/she purchase stuffs there. If a player wears a certain cloths in a certain place. NPC may recognise him/her as a companion/enemy and stops shooting/start shooting the player. These attention to detail warn players to be cautious when making a decision in the game and immerse into the game. Similar to fallout 3, player can choose a skills when level up and unlock unique dialogue options in certain circumstances. This makes the conversation goes smoother or deeper. Player can also explore the history of some special characters or some places by talking to the residents there. Those details in the game makes the game a lot more immersive than the fallout 4.Fabulous storylineI don't want to spoil the story too much... The game offers a wide variety of options for player to choose so that the story is driven by the options made by the player. (A little tip: Upgrade Speech first as it will be beneficial when the story progresses)The BadsPoor optimization to newer Operating SystemIt happens with fallout 3 too. Bethesda Softworks simply doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the game running on newer operating system. To even start the game properly, player needs to search for fixes on the community forum. I run the game with the fixes found on the Internet and the game will still crash periodically. Such a great game is sort of ""abandoned"" by the developer. In contrast, I can still run Half Life 1 on my WIndows 10 PC smoothly without needing to fix the game by myself. I don't think it is that hard to make the game run on newer OS smoothly. Bethesda Softworks, please fix this.Minor flawsThe abbreviation of certain ammo does not have any full name with it and sometimes may cause some confusion to the player. It may be a good idea to display the full form of the abbreviation when player select the items. Also, some bugs are presented in this game. I get stucked behind the wall and can't get out sometimes. It is really frustrating.Overall ImpressionThis is a fabulous game if you can patch the game yourself and tolerate the bugs on that game. I really hope the developer can publish an update to the game so that player can run the game flawlessly on newer OS. This would really make this an undeniable masterpiece.			"

												I remember waiting anxiously for Fallout: 3 to finally arrive. I had played and loved Fallout and Fallout 2. I had waited for  years, and could barely contain my excitement for a modern Fallout title to be released. I have no shame admitting that I enjoyed playing the game immensely. However, I always felt that it just had the Fallout name slapped onto a post-apocalyptic RPG, with a few Fallout-esque elements thrown in to loosely tie it to the previous titles. While the post-apocalyptic atmosphere of the DC ruins was incredible, It didn't follow in the intellectual footsteps of the previous games in the Fallout lineage, nor did it maintain the same feel. When Fallout: New Vegas arrived, I was completely blown away. It exceeded my expectations in every way. The setting in the American Southwest maintained the atmosphere of the original titles.  The faction system allowed for alliances to be forged within the Mojave Wasteland, but like the real world, denied you the possibility of making everyone happy. While I believe there was a mistake in maintaining the clunky Karma system of FO:3, I felt your choices within the game were more morally grey, more reflective of the world wherein there are actions and consequences rather than an arbitrary definition of good and evil. The major NPCs have excellent dialog and some of the most compelling back stories in gaming. The base game is good in and of itself, but the DLC add dimensions that are unparalleled in any of the previous Fallout games and the modding community has produced many excellent add-ons which enhance the gameplay and appearance far beyond the vanilla offering. I have devoted more hours to this game than any rational adult should. It is by far my favorite game of all time.			"

												Fallout New Vegas is hands down my favorite RPG of all time.After playing Fallout 3 I didn't think another Fallout title could out do it, then came Fallout New Vegas which was made by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda. New Vegas did everything right in my opinion. First off FNV was made with the same engine as FO3 so it looks exactly the same. As far as I know they didn't upgrade any visual details. New Vegas runs okay, I like to use RivaTuner to cap my FPS at 60. This ensures there aren't any insane FPS jumps and I've found that higher frame rates cause micro stutters. There probably are mods to remedy this but I've never bothered. All in all FNV may look really dated in some people's eyes but I still love how it looks.The RPG element of New Vegas is so deep, you can play it for hundreds of hours and each time your experience will be vastly different. There are a wide variety of perks, if you have a play style in mind, I can gaurentee there's at least one perk for it. My favorite part of this game is developing a character and making it my own. The gameplay in Fallout has always been great in my opinion, it was made even better with the addition of aiming down sights. In FO3 it was basically essential to use VATS but in this game I never use VATS, I don't invest in any VATS related perks, and I love never having to use it. With that being said I think they improved VATS and made it way more balanced.The story in New Vegas is my favorite out of the series. It's a classice revenge story with a great twist. The best part about the story is that it allows you to role play any character you desire and it will all make sense. So if you want to be an evil raider or a good NCR ranger, it all would make sense around the story. There are a ton of factions in the game and I love the variety they bring. It's also awesome how your actions can effect your faction relationships. Also the setting is great, I've always been fascinated with the west coast in the Fallout universe so it's cool to see in this iteration.The DLC in FNV is some of my favorite in the series. It brings much appreciated scenery changes and even the worst DLC for FNV is still really fun in my opinion.So, as a final point, to say I recommend Fallout New Vegas is a bit of an understatement. This game seriously influenced the types of game I enjoy playing and I will always be able to come back and enjoy a fresh playthrough.			"

												Have you ever been a long-time fan of something, gotten really excited when you heard it was coming back, only to be massively disappointed with the result? Fallout 3 had this effect on many fans of the Fallout series, myself included. Thankfully Fallout: New Vegas was developed under Obsidian Entertainment, a smaller company known mainly for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II. The project leader was Joshua Sawyer, the same person in charge of the original Fallout 3 that was cancelled after financial troubles with the developer’s parent company. Fallout: New Vegas serves as a “return to form” for the Fallout series, bring it back to its roots in exploring the ethics of a post-apocalyptic world, not exploring the world itself.Returning to Western USA, New Vegas is set in the Mojave Wasteland, directly adapted from the real world Mojave desert. Being a western the art direction of the game has changed from Fallout 3 but it should look familiar. The horrible green tint has been replaced by a much more subtle (yet still a bit annoying) orange tint, Buildings a much more suited to the environment (with much more varied interiors) and a good portion of the game world is actual desert. Despite being set on a desert, the sheer amount of content in New Vegas is densely packed in a logically designed world that is easy to navigate without a map, thanks to cleverly located landmarks. Gone are the days of trying to distinguish between this pile and rubble and that pile of rubble. The Mojave also features a number of areas that are very dangerous to lower level players, while level scaling does exist, it only ensures that enemies aren’t just cannon fodder at later levels.Moving from Fallout 3 to New Vegas won’t feel too different gameplay wise. While the two are very similar, New Vegas is improved in every way. Iron sights have been added to make first person shooting a viable tactic, VATS has been reworked to be less unfair for enemies, Guns skill no longer increases bullet damage, etc. Character creation has had a few smaller changes but the ways your point allocation works in the world has been greatly improved. Perks are only gained once per two levels making you still human by level 30. Traits make a welcome comeback from Fallout and Fallout 2 where you can choose a nice little perk but at the cost of something else. Fallout: New Vegas allows great flexibility in what kind of character you want to play as, and all character build are perfectly viable. Want to be a gunslinger who kills and instils fear in all who oppose him? Go Ahead. Want to be a pacifist? Using your words to solve issues? Sure, New Vegas allows you to. Being able to shape the game, rather than just play it, is what makes Fallout: New Vegas stand out among modern RPGs. It’s surprising how not many Role Playing Games actually let you Role Play. While at launch the game was buggy beyond being playable, the game has been shaped by developers post launch to be the most stable Gamebryo game in existence, not a hard title to achieve but a good one nonetheless.You play as “The Courier” and while delivering a small package to the New Vegas Strip, you are ambushed and end up in a shallow grave. Miraculously you survive the encounter and begin your quest to retrieve the mysterious package. A common misconception with Act I of the story is that it's just a western tale of revenge. The reality is that the story is about the package you were meant to deliver and using it to determine the fate of the Mojave Wasteland and its inhabitants.The two main factions, the New California Republic and Caesar’s Legion are battling for control of Hoover dam and the conflict between the two is apparent throughout the whole game, and by the time you finish Act I you should be near a decision on who you want to side with, or if you want to side with one of them at all. Unlike Fallout 3, New Vegas is not a simple tale of White Knights vs Evil Moustache twirling cartoon characters and many of the game’s decisions are morally ambiguous as opposed to black and white choices. Because the game predominantly features factions with unique motives, it makes sense to reintroduce the Faction Reputation System, as opposed to relying on a heavily flawed Karma System. Players can complete quests in a variety of different ways, and in favour of different people. Whether it be through distribution of electricity, or destroying the NCRs monorail; the variety of ways to play the game makes it unrivalled in terms of replayability.Interacting with the seemingly infinite number of NPCs is a joy. Dialogue is excellently written and everyone has lots to say. The Skill checks the feature are well varied in the skills they use and expertly written to be believable. “Your predisposition towards anger suggests unresolved issues in your past” sounds like a credible thing someone trained in Medicine would say. While the number of voice actors is only a small improvement over Fallout 3, the quality of the voice acting is a massive improvement, characters personalities are greatly enhanced by the brilliant voice work done. Facial animation still leaves a lot to be desired but it’s still an improvement. Because Obsidian Entertainment consists of many ex-Black Isle employees, including the series creator Tim Cain, New Vegas is very faithful to the canon established by the first two games. The game also plays a lot like a first person version of the old-school RPGs. A lot of NPC interaction is involved making the game more about interacting with the world than exploring it.Fallout: New Vegas does well to capture the atmosphere of Fallout, a world rebuilding after a nuclear holocaust. Adding to this is the soundtrack, which is largely comprised of the atmospheric music from the first two games. While it’s disappointing that very little new score was composed for New Vegas, it’s still infinitely better than the action movie soundtrack of Fallout 3. Radio stations make a return and play music appropriate for the retro future setting. Though this time with radio hosts that actually make sense in the world of Fallout.If you enjoy RPG experiences with deep lore, plenty of replayability then Fallout: New Vegas is for you. If you just want a simple minded shoot and loot then it may not be for you, but I still highly recommend it. It does a fantastic job of bringing Fallout back to being… Fallout.			"

												Amazing game. Of the 55 hours of playing it I spent maybe 20 hours on actual story missions. The rest was spent doing sidequests, some more sidequests and finally some more sidequests. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.Seriously, if you get easily distracted then this is the game for you. The game is so ♥♥♥♥ing addictive. I played it for 13 hours the day I bought it. When you start you can't stop. The story is amazing, the characters are great and the gameplay is good.That said, I didn't think the game was that immersive. The game is full of bugs, NPC's act like robots with loose wires. They're always running into walls, getting stuck in animations et cetera. Oh, and above all, CRASHES. At the start is wasn't that bad. I had maybe 2 crashes in the first 13 hours I played it. But especially near the end the game was crashing like crazy. Every time I booted up the game I crossed my fingers, because there's a chance the game will crash so hard you will need to reboot our PC. At one point I lost more than 5 hours of progress because the game flipped a coin and decided 3 of my save files didn't exist anymore. This is what made me take a break from the game for about 15 months. If you get past that however, the game really shines, especially the story. The premise is amazing and the way the different factions interact with eachother is really well done. You really get a sense that you're in the middle of a living, breathing community. This is probably the reason this game is so addictive. That and the fact that the missions are extremely varied. One moment you're a bouncer for a lasergun store, and the next moment you're helping radiation zombies develope a space program. The dialogue is really well done as well, with loads of funny lines and loads of interesting choices to make. During the entire game I listened to Radio New Vegas, which is an awesome station although several 50's country songs are now forever etched into my soul.To conclude: An amazingly solid game, even though it does has some technical issues. Definitely recommended.9/10			"

												While some say its really buggy I didn't have that problem, since there are several readily available mods (posted in a sticky on the steam forums) that fix most of this game's problems. I played the previous 3 fallout games and enjoyed all of them, but this is my favorite so far.Its an enjoyable Open World quest based RPG game that let's you do *almost* anything. And then you find out that the Legion are slavers that crucify people for fun and you realize that you only have one choice. Which is killing every living thing in the wasteland to prevent the Legion from having the pleasure, of course.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition is a good RPG with an interesting setting and a lot of content. That said it also has a lot of quest related bugs that make it seem to be not very thoroughly tested. There are a lot of locations to explore and factions to discover. You can choose your way of playing the game after you develop some skills pretty freely and it never loses that ""choose your way"" feeling. The DLC that tie in along the way are mixed. Dead Money and Lonesome Road feel like filler material while Honest Hearts let's you explore a totally different area and Old World Blues is just a must play. The main story isn't fully engaging, but it offers enough choices to be interesting for a couple of play-throughs.Sadly the game crashes a lot and feels a bit under-tested which takes away from the overall experience. Otherwise I'd fully recommend the trip to New Vegas!			"

												This review. Like my Fallout 3 review will be long.For my Fallout 3 review go here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaoticmayhem/recommended/22300Fallout New Vegas still stands as one of the greatest games ever to be enjoyed not only as a Fallout fan but an RPG fan as a whole.The game brings together combined elements from Fallout 1, Fallout 2, and Fallout 3. While adding a few things of it's own here and there to make the game even more exciting. To top it off this game presents Hardcore mode, which basically turns Fallout New Vegas into an (almost) realstic game.Combat- Combat has seriously improved since Fallout 3. The combat in this game instead of a straight forward shooting up your enemies with VATS with a few grenades here and a rocket launcher here, and a lazer gun here and last aid of your companions or the other faction that is fighting your potential killer, you will have to rely mostly on 'special ammo' for example, if you are attacked by a deathclaw the only way to kill it or bring down it's 'defeneses' (the name will have a shield icon right next to it) is by using armor-piercing rounds. Music- The music of this game is both combination of western and Vegas style. You will need music mods to make that list grow even larger. But in the end it doesn't really matter because both music pieces presented in Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas are great either way.Quests- There is a barrage of quests, not only from the modding standpoint, but also DLC and the game overall. You will spend a lot more hours with these quests as the same amount of hours you do with Fallout 3, and the other Fallout titlesCompanions- Companions are no longer ""Lydia's with guns"" They are actually smarter and with the aid of the companion wheel it makes life SO MUCH easier when talking to your companion for him, her, or it to move back, go non-agressive, wait, trade equipment, and maintain distance. Bewarn, if you play the game in 'hardcore' mode, your companions will still be smarter, but they will end up dying and staying dead till you reload your save or you restart the game after you finish it. There are also companion centered quests, Which by the way some are fun, but others are just boring and tedious to do.World/ Exploration- Unlike Fallout 3, where it really shows the post apocalyptic side to the world. Fallout New Vegas really doesn't have the gritty atomosphere sadly, It is more of a homage to movies like Mad Max (1979) and the Book of Eli with Denzel Washington (2010). All desert, a few settlements here and there. Hostile areas here and there with random events. You only have the New Vegas area as the ""DC ruins"" of this game but unlike D.C ruins of this game, it is populated. Also the game map itself is huge.RPG- The RPG elements in this game are heavily seen, for example, ""Faction armor"" depending upon what faction armor you wear, the other side, and the neutral party might be offensive or hostile to what you wear. The choices you make in game, also shape how the faction looks at you. Leveling up is much different from previous games. It goes on an odd or even level of leveling up, so install mods to fix this little issue and make it more like Fallout 3's leveling up system. Lastly the perks within the game that you obtain either through challenges or leveling up really make a difference so choose wiselyDLC- The DLC within the game are extremely well done. If you want to put your skills to the test, play Dead Money. If you want to play a DLC that touchers your inner nerd, play Old World Blues. If you want something more faction oriented and exploration play Honest Hearts. And lastly if you want all three combinations (except the inner nerd part) But offer a much more bigger challenge, play Lonesome Road. There are also 'player add-ons' that gives you basically starting gear.Voice Acting- Fallout New Vegas not only has a huge celebrity cast, but also the voice acting for the different NPCs ranges differently so from settlement to settlement don't expect about every odd or even number of NPCs to sound the same.The Modding Community- The modding community has been ever helpful to make this game not only challenging, but more prettier and much more longer, also of course the usual mods (weapons, armor, companions, etc.). *MASSIVE Spoiler Alert* Because unlike in Fallout 3 where you can free roam after Broken Steel DLC, all DLC takes place BEFORE the final battle at Hoover Dam. So make sure you really take your time with this game, because there is no going back when the final quest begins.Conclusion: Like in my Fallout 3 review, Fallout New Vegas has things that Fallout 3 should've had, but again Fallout 3 had things that Fallout New Vegas should've had as well. But regardless of that, it is really an enjoyable game to play and this game is a definite recommendation			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is the single best video game to ever be released, with no other game even coming close. The story is great, and for the time, so were the mechanics. You actually had real choice, unlike gay ♥♥♥ Fallout 3 and Fallout 4. There were real RPG elements, relation to the original games, and a western theme. In fact, New Vegas is so good that Bethesda refuses to recognize it because they know that Obsidian is better at making Fallout than them. Companions actually make sense in New Vegas. You have to do a quest in order to get them to like you, unlike Fallout 4 where you could pick 50 locks and then ♥♥♥♥ Piper. The endings were all different, unlike Fallout 4 where there are three reskins of the same ending, and then an Institute ending. Also, in New Vegas you can be ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. You can sell Arcade Gannon to Caesar, give Veronica to the White Gloves, you can burn Doc Mitchell to death, and take over the whole Mojave with Father Elijah. Speaking of Dead Money, it is the best DLC for a game to ever come out, only rivaled by Old World Blues. And if you don't like Dead Money or get a mod to make it easier, you're a ♥♥♥♥♥. Speaking of mods, New Vegas has the best. Someguy2000's mods alone are better than anything the entire dumbass Bethesda team could come up with. In New Vegas, there is a sense of progression in the map as you go south and around to Vegas. It makes the game feel structured, increasingly challenging, and increasingly rewarding. Again, unlike Fallouts 3 and 4 where you can go wherever the ♥♥♥♥ you want right after leaving the Vault. The vaults in those games had basically the same ♥♥♥♥ing number too. God Bethesda is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You can play New Vegas however you want. You can play the whole game like a ♥♥♥♥♥ and never kill anyone, a feature Bethesda promised for Fallout 4 but didn't deliver on. You can also play the whole game without dying or even healing at all. There are so many choices within each endgame faction that you have to replay each faction multiple times to try out all the possible endings (except for the NCR, they're too gay to play more than once). Oh and even the raiders have more character in New Vegas. They fall into gangs with history and lore. In Fallout 4, they are just raiders. Nothing else. Mindless fodder to shoot. The enemy placement throughout the Mojave is explained and just makes sense. Now I do rip on Fallout 3 and 4 a lot, they aren't bad games. In fact, they are pretty good. Just they are not RPG's. They are open world action games. All in all, Bethesda needs to liscence another Obsidian Fallout game if they want to save their cucked company.			"

												this game is everything fallout 4 should have been and it is 6 years older.pros:-its actually an rpg unlike fallout 4-quests have multiple solutions and are very different from each over, unlike fallout 4 which is mostly ""go here, shoot this, oh another stupid settlement needs our help-factions are really interesting and play a big role in the narrative-story is great, with different paths to choose-mod support for this game is amazing-actions will effect the ending-has lots of replayability -great dlc (honest hearts has a good story but is too short),-skill system -perks are fun and change the game.cons:-gunplay is not great-grahpics are a bit dated but can be fixed by lots of the mods on the nexus-because Bethesda rushed Obsidian in development so the Legion was not fully fleshed out but this can be fixed by the legion expanaded modin conclusion its a great price for the amont of content			"

												Just thought I'd share an old preview of the game that I did when it was first showcased at PAX.  Fallout: New Vegas lived up to every anticipation, and is truly an excellent game worthy of the series.______________________________________________________________I just returned from my first PAX, where I managed to get a good look at the upcoming Fallout game: Fallout New Vegas.The Bethesda booth had demos on the X-Box, only allowed you to play for a (theoretically) 15-minute interval, using a demo savepoint, and had lines at least 45 minutes long -- all of which gives you a very limited look into the game. But fortunately, I discovered that the Nvidia booth had a Fallout 3 demo for the PC, often with no lines and a gameplay duration limited only by your conscience. As such, I was able to get in several hours of play in the new game.That said, I avoided most anything that would spoil the plot for me, as well as avoided major areas like The Strip. Instead, I focused on learning what I could about changes to gameplay, and I'm writing to share those with you.What I've learned:(If you've been looking forward to this game, some of these things you will probably already know from other reviews and spoilers.)Fallout New Vegas uses the same engine and basic gameplay as Fallout 3, but incorporates a lot of things from Fallout 1 & 2 that Fallout 3 dispensed of, and includes a lot of game tweaks previously only available in mods.Visually, the game is beautiful. The green haze is gone, giving us a bright blue sky and a lush desert landscape which is heavy on oranges and browns.Traits are back. Traits are special perks, available only at the beginning, which either modify the game a little or which give you a benefit at the cost of a drawback. You can pick two traits for your character. (One trait, Wild Wasteland, ""adds additional 'wacky' content and modifies existing content and special encounters"" that makes connections to the bizarre encounters you could have in the first Fallout games.)Skills have been mildly revamped. ""Small Guns"" and ""Big Guns"" are now just ""Guns"". Plus, they have added in the ""Survival"" skill. (More on it later.)A lot of the perks from the older games are apparently back. In addition, opposite-sex perks (like Black Widow) now have same-sex equivalents.Food items now give you health slowly over time rather than in a single lump sum. With sufficient Survival skill, you can activate any campfire you find and cook food (or otherwise combine foodstuffs) to create superior foodstuffs. For example, you can cook gecko meat to create a gecko steak which is much healthier.Similar to the ""recipes"" for food, you have the ability to modify or break down your weapons with a sufficient level of Repair skill -- you can even break down scrap metal into lead. You can add silencers, scopes, etc to certain weapons if you have the parts, the Repair skill, and a workstation.In addition, apparently you can repair items up to 100% regardless of the level of your Repair skill -- higher levels just makes it easier, requiring less items.And, having mentioned gecko meat... yes, geckos are back! In addition to a wider variety of monsters, New Vegas offers more variety within those monsters, including smaller ""young"" versions of the adult critters.As well as basic good-evil karma, you also garner reputation with each settlement and group. On a similar note, stealing from any group (even an evil one) will get you negative karma. This leads to scenarios like the one I encountered below:I sneak up on a camp of Powder Gangers (a gang formed of escaped convicts -- they be evil) and take them out (gaining positive karma for killing the bad guys but negative reputation with the Powder Gangers). I loot their bodies (gaining nothing... except loot, of course). Then I loot their campsite (gaining negative karma for stealing from the Powder Ganger faction).As a fun addition, if you are wearing the outfit of a particular faction, you are disguised as a member of that faction. The initial reactions of people you run into will be based on that disguise. (So, as it turns out, running around in Powder Ganger armor wasn't such a smart idea.)Weapons (at least some of them) have special critical hits. For example, fighting with boxing gloves allowed me to knock an enemy critter out cold.So, overall, I'm even more excited for Fallout: New Vegas than I was before PAX. It looks like this game is going to be excellent!			"

												This game is honestly the best modern Fallout title to this day. It fixes almost everything that Bethesda flopped with in the original (DT is better than DR, the locales are pretty believable, dialogue checks are guaranteed with proper skills), and it just feels like what Fallout should have been with the transition. There's no level scaling, so there are some locations that are probably a bit too difficult until you reach a certain level, and it doesn't feel like an empty land to explore. There's vegetation and people trying to go about and make the world seem as if it's trying to repair itself 200+ years after The Great War rather than the DREARY POST APOCALYPTIC WASTELAND THAT STILL SOMEHOW HAD FOOD IN GROCERY STORES. Good character writing, quirky but not too far out there, and factions are well done. Karma system still sucks but is essentially irrelevant.Also, unlike FO3, there are actually 200+ endings in New Vegas. Just play this buggy mess instead of Fallout 3/4, because Bethesda needs to know that they suck at Fallout, and it's a shame that we might not see Obsidian take another jab at it. Remember to consent with Fisto.			"

												Absesive!Ok that top line was my review for well over a year. If you knew the series, you got the joke. But in the spirit of an often on sale yet over looked game, I can do one better.Yes folks this is one of  those  ""Games You Absolutely Must Have!""Set in the Fallout world of Post Nuclear America, this time in the Nevada Badlands outside of what is left of Las Vegas. You awake as a courier recovering from a nasty headshot. Think old west mixed with Rat Pack era Vegas, and the fallout dash of mutants, ghouls, tribals, NPR, Brotherhood of Steel, and cowboys. Yes you get a PIP Boy. The Fallout standard navigation device, inventory access, and radio.You have VAT. Fallout's version of action freeze/bullet time.No this one does not have bobble heads. Iit's only bad point in my opinion, though it does make the game more challenging.Look if you enjoy a premium RPG first person shoot/hack/zap... game. I can highly recomend this one. Intense combat. Fun plot. A small but rich open desert world explorer. Nice voice acting as well.  Best of all nowadays highly afordable. If you haven't played this yet, you are truely missing out.			"

DIS GAME.Gameplay:I definitely love the gameplay. Roaming around the dry Mojave Desert day & night, slaughtering mutated creatures that were once normal, avoiding other tribes that will ruthlessly steal your damn clothing & supplies, murdering you is in the deal as well. Although V.A.Ts is a bit buggy, Example: You would use it & heaps of enemies would be around the area, it'd take afew minutes to actually lock onto the targets that are head of you. When you click one of the arrows to go right, it may go left, even though there is another enemy towards the right.Weapons:Holy ♥♥♥ this game has heaps of weapons, actually reminds me of Borderlands/Borderlands 2, I know I know, this game came first, haha. Definitely your kind of FPS if you enjoy advanced technological weapons or old timey western guns! The concepts & designs are amazing for the futuristic weapons, my personal favorite is the ""Q-35 Matter Modulator"", the name is a cronky one, but how it looks is simply sexy & dangerous!Characters:Very unique character designs & clothing. However, as I stated, I loved the clothing, some of the clothing was completely Overused. I mean, I get it, it'd be pretty expensive to have every single character have different clothing! The ragged & digusting look of the raiders in this game is absolutely amazing! Originality blasting in this game, such as a car tire for a shoulder pad, haha.Voice Acting:Let's be honest, this game had so little voice actors. I didn't really mind it, but it kinda got old after awhile hearing the same voices over & over again! Some of the voice acting could use a little more work, such as the NCR soldiers & how almost every  civilian had the same dialogue.Soundtrack:Coming from a person who absolutely loves retro soundtracks & music, this game has to have my favorite OST! As for the ambience while you're roaming around or in battle, it's pretty intense & may get a bit creepy from time to time. The ambience really depends on your location & state, which is a pretty sexy addition to the game!Story:How I loved the story! It gives it a realistic vibe due to the fact you can literally slaughter important people.(Not that you should...) You have about 3 whole main choices in the game, Neutral, Bad, Good. Neutral being you forget about everyone else & fight for no one excluding a certain robot. Bad being you side with the Legion & plot for Vegas Domination. Good being you side with the NCR, New California Republic, taxes up the ♥♥♥ but that's what it will take to get the world back into natural order.Conclusion:Well, all I gotta say is you should really buy this game! I enjoyed it so much, I still play it! It'll give you endless hours of entertainment & fun, especially if you add in additional content, such as mods. Exclusive mods can be found at: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/?10/10 ♥			"

And I'm not even covering the DLCs. In other words, GET THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.			"

												 Fallout: New Vegas, is possibly one of the most successful video games published to the Steam Community. Not only becuase of its sense of real life war, conflict of nature, and real grasp of a post apocalyptic world, but also becuase it allows to feel yourself as you might in the real world. An example of such is how it allows you create your own character, with your own tastes in style, color, and even gender.  It also gives you the feeling of bonding with other NPC's as they as well have a design, much like one you would find in the real world itself. Another very popular and inspiring thing for this game, is its open world enviroment. You can do what you want, go where you want, take who's side you want, and say what you want. Along with a more then wide variety of armor, weaponry, and most anything else you can think of, to choose and select from. And if that isn't enough to satisfy your tastes, you also have the ability to install mods, to perk up the enviroment, change many differant aspects of the game, the people, places, and things you interact with, and even yourself. Though this is a spin-off from the Fallout games, 1 2 and 3, this world still allows you to imerge in a whole differant world that you would likely never find in any other game. And if you're the type who is up for a challenge, you can even use a feature, known as ""Hard Core Mode"", where hunger, thirst, sleep, and radiation, will be allowed to play roles in your gameplay experience. All in all, this game is a excellent piece of art made by the game industry, and I would highly recommend buying this game, if you are the type of gamer who like post apocalyptic, open worlds, as well as a throw-back to what seems to be as far back as the late 1950's, yet mixed with a futuristic element at the same time. I would with no doubt support this game, and encourage the Community to give it a shot. Game on, Fallout Universe!			"

												Ok, now that I'm waiting for Fallout 4 to come out, I guess I'm going to go back and visit the Mojave for a while.  The counter above the block where I'm writing this says I've played for 490.9 hours.  I might be willing to concede that such a thing is not necessarily healthy.Nevertheless:  if you consider yourself a gamer, and you haven't played this, you need to snap it up and find out what you've missed.  Some may wail about crashes:  cry me a river.  Save periodically.Yes, you may find some graphical oddities from time to time...but if you want richer stories, or more authentic post-apocalyptic atmosphere, you're probably going to have to wait until the real thing happens.  On the plus side, your wait might not be that long...so there's that.There are an endless supply of mods out there as well, so even after you've played through, you can still revisit and find new things.  Don't like the color of the post-atomic sky?  There's a mod for that.  Want real firearm textures? They got 'em.  Want to own your own casino?  You can fix up the one in Primm.If'n you don't, folks will be saying that 'Clint Eastwood' is the biggest yella-belly in the...whoops...wrong review.What are you still reading this for?  Step to!

												War, War never changes. But Bethesda has.When Fallout 4 Launched, those who survived did so in Fallout 3. When the steam reviews rolled out the community set out across the ruins of the old franchise to build new mods. As 48 hours past, what had been the Fallout community, united underneath the flag of the New Fallout Republic, dedicated to old Fallout values of non-voice acted protaganists and actual RPG elements. As the Republic grew, so did it's age, modders spread east seeking better storylines and intelligent speech options the dryer mercilless expanse of the Fallout franchise could offer. They returned with tales of a game untouched by Fallout 4's terrible launch that had scorched the rest of the world and a great wall of its mods spanning the Fallout Nexus site. The NFR mobilized its army and sent it east to occupy the Fallout 4's steam page and restore it to negetive reviews that actually made sense. but across the Nexus another society had arrisen under a diffrent flag. A vast army of Fanboys who had never played an RPG in their life. Forged from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ communities of COD and just about every EA game, Todd's Legion. 4 days have passed since the Republic held the steam page just barrely against the Legion's fake possitive reviews. The Fanboys did not retreat. across the Nexus the legion gathers strength. Dialoge options release, re-textures come out. Through it all Fallout: New Vegas, stayed open for buissness under the control of it's mysterious overseers obsidian entertainment and their army of rehabilitated fanboys.You are a reviewer hired by IGN to deliver a review for Fallout 4. What seemed like a simple 10/10 has taken a turn for the worst. IGN representitive 1: You got the review you wanted, so pay up.Todd Howard: You're crying about a review pally.IGN representitive 2: Guess who's community is wakin' up over here?Todd Howard: Time to cash in.IGN representitive 1: Will you get it over with?Todd Howard: Maybe EA kills franchises without looking the community in the face, but I ain't EA. You made your last honest review kid. Sorry you got twisted up in this buisness. From where your review stands, it must seem like an 7/10 run of bad luck. Truth is... The Franchise was rigged from the start.ASteam Community ReviewFallout: New Franchise			"

												A great rpg with a steady pace throughout the game. If you want a new generation fallout game that better represents the originals then this is the game, it follows a greater focus on character development and how you interact with the world; appreciating the fact that not everyone cares about pure run and gunning (you can still do that but there is a high chance of death involved). It may be a sudden change from the atmosphere of Fallout 3 now that they have somewhat of a more civilised stable society and its rather reminiscent of the wild west styled games but that only serves to continue the atmospheric development. If you can embrace actual adventure and actually role play then you are in for a treat of post apocalyptic wild west vibe. All I can say is give it a shot and don't try to compare it to Fallout 3.

												I never appreciated this game enough when it first game out, still riding the high of Fallout 3.  That really wasn't fair, I wasn't as familiar with the previous games and I was playing them all on console at the time.  Years later, after writing this game off, I came back to it here on steam and by then I was deep in the PC modding community, which only enriched this rediscovery.  Even without mods, I can say that Fallout: New Vegas is a GREAT GAME!  In improves on the gunplay of Fallout 3, adds a gigantic arsenal of new weaponry to enjoy and brings back a lot of the cooky humor from the previous games, as well as a few homages to classic characters, storylines and items.  It's not the bleak, incredibly atmospheric experience of Fallout 3, that game still gets all those points right on the money, but if you want fun gameplay, to not take things so seriously and play your way, this game has it all!  It's before the sytem was streamlined in Fallout 4 and improves on all the favorite features of Fallout 3, making it probably the best Fallout game to date, in my humble opinion.If you get onto The Nexus and start throwing mods at this thing, prepare for a of the best gaming experiences you can have today!  There's still people putting work into this game right now just a browse will help you increase performance, fix various bugs and glitches, overhaul the graphics with HD texture packs, lighting and weather effects and even give yourself an alternative, roleplay focused start that can give you an entirely new loadout and starting location based on the decisions you make at the start!Great game, fun game, please buy and play it NOW!

												A game of limitless choices, possibilities, and complexity; something an RPG wants to be at its core. Fallout New Vegas is truly an 'epic' experiance, with a whole world of choices and options at the players fingertips, all of which is explorable and playable space. Want to be a space cowboy firing lazors and lever action rifles, sure. Want to be a swat trooper who bashes peoples knees in with a katana, you can easily do that. The game just has a lot of things to do.These choices, compound into its ultimate game strength; the sheer amount of content there is. The game has a massive world, with easily 110+ quests, and probably even more unmarked quests. As well, the vast arsenal of weapons, the variety, and the balencing the game has in regards to these are phenoninal. Any playstyle is viable in this game, and it is an experiance where everyone can flourish. The game is perfecly paced as well, meaning that at no point are you this indestructable God of death, you are fragile, you are not the best, you are mortal. The game teaches you that very well, that you are human, nothing more. You live in this shattered world, dealing with your own human nature; whether it be the mortality, the drugs, sex, disease, or just plain stupidity. But despite the games humanity, it falls into one major trap. That is, the game encourages metagaming at its finest. For instance, to get the best stuff/ending/quests, you need to know how/when to do things. This can be argued in the whole nature of the complex choice system as well, but because of the no turn back attitude of the game, it highly encourages veterans to play the game rather synthetically, rather than let it all flow together as it may. Yes, this does mean replayability, but its not as fun as a purely organic gaming experiance.Despite the main criticisms of the game, and other factors I chose not to mention (for length restraints), the game is not bad. On the contrary, its quite good, very good. Why is it good? Because it emplifies its core concept excellently: Humanity, and what it means to be human. That focus in what its about, makes it a must own.			"

												Fallout New Vegas:-Make a Charactor-Make Freinds with the first town-Help Bandits take the town*ProfitReal Reveiw: This is a game a deeply recommend, if you are ok with the many crashes and glitches. I was able to finally (hopefully) make the crashing a little less servere. I actually ended up stoping playing because of the crashes, but now I am once again addicted. The game has alot of replayablity because you can make so many types of charactors. In the end I recommend it			"

												Fallout New Vegas is basically a MASSIVE expansion pack to Fallout 3. Nonethless, it is an amazing game. You can never go wrong with some Fallout 3 or New Vegas. I play both of them back and forth, and I always have the same fun experience everytime I pick up the controller. The game begs you to explore, be creative, and adavnce your character. It is thrilling and exciting! BOTTOM LINE: If you have played Fallout 3, and you crave more Fallout, New Vegas is a MUST.~Enjoy your Stay!			"

												This game has the potential to be so much more. Anyone who has ever visited Nexusmods and seen the library of content created as an addition to New Vegas, can attest to the potential of this game. Bethesda, off the heels of success with Fallout 3, in my opinion rushed New Vegas and released it before it was stable. Non-modded, Vanilla versions of New Vegas with and without DLC, are prone to random crashing. Now, even with that most annoying of pet peeves for all gamers, New Vegas is another post-apocalyptic, immersive sandbox, Taking place in the Mojave wasteland, and with the DLC content, surrounding areas. Instead of playing the intrepid vault dweller, you are a courier for the Mojave Express, who is gunned down. You must uncover the reason behind your attempted murder, find your stolen package, and unravel the mysteries within. The Brotherhood of Steel makes a brief appearance, but does not play the central role of law and order, the way they did in Fallout 3. Now we are introduced to the government and military of The New California Republic, as well as the despotic and sadistic masses known as Caesar's Legion. Fallout New Vegas is a game that must be played with all available DLC, for the full experience. Despite all the flaws, there are hotfixes, such as official game patches and player created Mods, to combat game crashing. If you enjoyed Fallout 3, you will love New Vegas.			"

												Yet another phenomenal addition to the Fallout IP. Fallout: New Vegas touches on many of the original concepts and mechanics of its predecessor but also improved on them. The amount of content in New Vegas and its ability to immerse you into its lore is astounding. How you shape yourself in New Vegas is virtually limitless, almost every choice to be made has several alternate paths that affect your experience greatly. Leveling in New Vegas feels more rewarding and desired than most games, sculpting your skills and traits are perfectly done here. In combat your options are huge, ranging anything from fists to laser rifles to mini-nukes. With the addition of Steam Workshop, your options and the amount of content really do become limitless.Fallout: New Vegas truly peers on top amongst the greatest in the genra. If you are a fan, you won't be disappointed. If you're new here but love immersive open-world RPG's and have an interested for post-apocalyptic scenarios, you're in for quite a ride. 94/100			"

												I'd played New Vegas when it came out and not since the last DLC. Then I played Fallout 4 and had fun, I played it for over 100 hours! I just recently picked up New Vegas again and god damn, Fallout 4 is nothing to New Vegas. I think this is absolutely the best Fallout game and I hope that the rumours of Obsidian creating a Louisiana spin-off with Fallout 4 engine are true!This is the best RPG format to me. Ally with pretty much anyone or no-one and do it in your own time. My only criticism is that there is no after-game. 10/10			"

												I was writing a huge review, but I'll summarize it with one of the game's own quotes. While tacky, it perfectly describes my initial approach to the game, and modern videogaming as a whole.""There is an expression in the Wasteland: 'old world blues.' It refers to those so obsessed with the past that they can't see the present, much less the future, for what it is."" New Vegas is as close as you're gonna get to a contemporary update on the 17 year old fallout 2. And would you know it, they even had the decency to update and modernize the crashes, bugs, and glitches, so the new audience wouldn't miss out on such a crucial element of fallout gameplay.A masterful blend of old, new, and yesterday's news, that even in 2015 sees mods, fan content, and updates. More importantly, it's got heart, and while the base game shows some obvious signs of being rushed, the huge DLCs and fan patches take care of that.Above all, the game prioritizes player agency, and not the cute 'kill the guy, spare the guy' kind that's thrown around as a buzzword.Highly recommended.

												Despite what Hideo Kojima would tell you, war never changes.Fallout New Vegas returns the Fallout series to it's west coast roots, sort of. While little of the action actually takes place in The New California Republic, the state DOES play a heavy role in the title. The player embarks on a quest of mythical proportions starting as a simple courier caught up as a pawn in the affiars of dicatators, emperors, and corrupt senators, and offers satisfaction to any who step into the wastes, in several ways. One can endavor make the post apocalyptic, post divergent hell (as opposed to pre-apocalyptic, pre-divergent hell, or even conteporary hell) a slightly better place through feats of heroism. Alternatively one can take out their aggression at the powers that be by establishing new orders under nefarious leaders of varying degrees of nefariousaritynessnessism (sp?). Or one can simply say ""screw the rules, I have ______"" where ______ is ""money"" or ""all manner of fictional designer drugs and booze"" or ""a collection of exotic guns that would raise Heston from his grave"" or ""300,000 piles of scrap metal, duct tape, a radioactive toy rocket, and some bubble gum!"" The morality system is still in place, and the game can be heavy handed with this, though in addition to ""break stuff steal things, versus fix stuff, save idiots"" are a series of factional based fame meters. Remember how back in high school, you accidentally peed your pants in the cafeteria? Well instead of immediately gaining the same amount of infamy among all the cliques, the art kids, and tweakers thought it was kinda cool, in an ironic way. Same thing goes in FO:NV. Blowing the facial bones out of a random scumbag with a kids BB gun, maxed skills, and the ""Bloody Mess"" perk may toque off half the factions, but it may just earn your a little bit of positive feedback from other groups - maybe that guy pooped in their Sugar Bombs. Added to this iteration of Fallout is also increased crafting as a mechanic. One can skill up abilities in making medical and food aid items, which come in handy if one plays the real game (hardcore mode) and not just ""Cousin Timmy's, I'm Too Frail to do Even Live Hard in a Simulated Reality Weekend Adventure"" (regular mode). Hardcore mode requires the player to consume food and water, as well as sleep regularly or risk stat debuffs or even death. And healing items take longer too work, along with stat buff items risking negative side effects like addiction, far more frequently than in Cousin Timmy's experience. All said, FO:NV is what Fallout Fans were hoping for from FO3, Fallout franchise based setting, more guns, more items, huge map, hours of gameplay and sidequests, but still with all the bugs one can expect from Bugthesda, though you shouldn't complain - If you're reading this, you're in the PC mustard race, and therefore console is always a tilde away, and through tilde, all problems can be solved. Some may not enjoy single player only, but this is the apocalypse. All your friends are dead. JK, you never had any friends, that's what the charming classical radio tracks are for.. All in all, one of my personal favorite.Final score: 875/1000 RadsProtip: Generally speaking, honest heats will tell you the DLC was lackluster, however, while it was a lonesome road to get to this point, for the current going price, I'd say all are worth the dead money. I'd have something clever to say about Old World Blues, too, but out of all the DLC it was the only one worth the initial cost, as it was clever enough on it's own, and is this reviewer's personal pick.

												I really can not recommend this game enough. Easily one of the best RPG's ever made thus far. I may get some hate for this, but in my opinion, Fallout New Vegas has out done Fallout 3 in nearly every regard. The story is pretty great. It can be slow at times, but when you make decisions, they feel like they actually matter. The setting is something many people used to praise Fallout 3 for, including myself, and it is no doubt one of the best game settings ever, but after several play throughs of New Vegas, I feel the Mojave has that extra bit of charm that the DC wasteland didnt have. Some disliked the Mojaves bright skie's and bright City for a post apocalyptic game, but for me it just felt very right. The writing for some of the Side Quests in this game, is truly phenominal, and I hope Obsidian gets another shot at a Fallout game once Fallout 4 is out. Overall Fallout New vegas, and the Fallout franchise as a whole is a master piece, with rich and interesting Lore, great characters, excellent gameplay, and HOURS of replayability. Expect 100+ hours per playthrough, and even then you'll still have not done everything. My playtime on steam for this is only about 128 hours as of 2/14/16, but when I used to play this on console, id say my time on it is around 600+.**EDIT: Having now played Fallout 4 and its overly simplified rpg elements, i've come to appreciate this game even more than when i originally wrote this. Here is a summed up list of the Pro's and Con's of Fallout: New VegasPRO's-Amazing and vast, variety of weapons.-Interesting and Fun characters.-Extensive character customization.-Great leveling system with awesome Perks.-Excellent setting.-Good story, and great variety of story paths and Choice's.-V.A.T.S-The Pip Boy 3 thousand, Enough said.-DLC's add a good amount of content for your character to take back to the Mojave. The way the DLC story lines tie in with the main games narrative is ♥♥♥♥ing excellent, making this games DLC some of the best i've ever played.-Very well optimized for the PC. Runs better on my fairly average computer than it did on my Xbox 360.CON'S-Occasional crashes, not as big a deal as people make it out to be. You should be fine unless your trying to run this on an Etch A Sketch or a Potato.-Sometime's a glitch will interfere with a quest or you might get stuck in a ledge. This is also Very occasional and not a real problem at all.If you dont already own Fallout New Vegas, why are you still reading this, go buy it. NOW!.10/10, Would herd Wind Brahmin Again.			"

												This rather divisive entry to the Fallout franchise is, for all real intents and purposes, the true Fallout 3.  If you can get past the general derp of the Gamebryo engine, you'll find one of the most beautifully realized gaming worlds of all time - all fleshed out with a myriad of well written and interesting characters.Only real downsides are the general glitchiness of Gamebryo breaking immersion, and the rather easy/weak combat.

												The current game in the Fallout Franchise, New Vegas awaits, to entertain, to corrupt, or just to provide you with those home comforts, like that 12gauge you just never get tired of pumpin'. Gun firing a bit crap? Go upgrade it at the Gun shop by trading all that crap you found lying around, for that shiny new recoil compensator for your 5.56mm Marksman Carbine!! This game is an excellent RPG/shooter hybrid. I personally love the V.A.T.S combat system, allowing you to momentarily step out of real time to select those body parts that you think will look better being severed from that body, you don't know why, but you just wanna see the guy's head explode ha ha ha! Hrm...who's that over there, hey! It's a companion, make friends, get them to carry all your stuff, on first name terms already? Great, Why not give them a gun and some ammo too and you can double team those mutated Wasteland horrors like they were the best days of your life! (well they were for me mmkay..)  Choose wisely on the course of action to take when encountering strangers, or just  generally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the army. Not sure about that creepy looking character you met in that strange bunker? Hrm...do his bidding? Or betray him, up to you! Run off with the loot or give it to the homeless people for street cred, the reputation is yours for the making as everyone you interact with has the potential to aid you, or slow you down (cos you spent waaay too much time zooming in on her ti- ♥♥♥♥..) After over 200 hours of playing this game, I'm lightyears away from getting bored of this Titan, I aint never growing up !!! 8/10. There's room for improvment..but that's what sequels are for, fool!

												Fallout: New Vegas is the next entry to the critically acclaimed Fallout series. Taking place 3 years after Fallout 3, you find yourself tied up, and being shot in the head by Chandler Bing. New Vegas was made and produced by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda, unlike Fallout 3 which was produced and published by only Bethesda. Fallout: New Vegas has some improved gameplay elements from Fallout 3, like the ability to aim down sights, a new reputation system, and a better companion menu. The story is well written, with a lot of star power voicing the characters, and a story that has 3 or 4 branching endings. Like the game that came before it, it is also an open world game.PROS+ Improved Gameplay elements from Fallout 3+ Open world, with many more quests than the previous entry+ More weapons and enemies+ Great voice acting+ Returns to Fallout's dark sense of humour that Fallout 3 more or less lacked+ Includes a ""Wild Wasteland"" perk that adds tons of easter eggs, and is in my opinion, the only perk worth getting at the start+ Large map with many interesting cities+ Big city near the top of the map, New Vegas, that includes casinos, and hotels. New Vegas also has a ghetto north of the city, that has more than a few quests to enjoy+ A new reputation system that effects how factions (and their enemies/allies) will treat you+ Great radio soundtrack+ Amazingly written, interconnected DLC storylines+ Amazing DLC environmentsCONS- Sparse towns make the map seem too big at times, and can be a pain to walk around- Very little change in landscape- Radio soundtrack can be very repetitive- Companions can be hard to locate, and are sometimes overlooked. - Main quest is very short, and can take only about 4 hours to complete- Armor can be hard to find and acquire without the Courier's Stash DLC- A few bugs and problems here and there.Overall, a great game with a story that (in my opinion) is better that the one of Fallout 3. Buy the Ultimate Edition when it's on sale.9.5/10			"

												This game is a game that if described as ""Skyrim with guns"" could not justifiy it. this game is a masterpiece, with well-executed combat, a huge and expansive lore, great creature diveristy, and always feels challenging no amtter what. the levelling system is well made, and well created - a great and smart way to do things in the Mojave. everything in this game feels right, and the DLC? oh my god, there are few things that fit this game so well as the DLC. its 16 quid in total. but it's all worth it.  the world is open, and not ONE character is unkillable. this is truly a free game, the definition of a sandbox in some ways. it is my second favorite RPG, my first favorite gun game and easily my number one least suspected like of all gamingtry it, you'll love itCOMPLETIONISTS NOTE: this game isnt hard to complete, and at no point will you feel like the game is unfair (except Deathclaws...)

												I recently played a game titled, Fallout: New Vegas, it was developed by Obsidian Studios, which many of the company’s members happen to be former members of Interplay Productions’ Black Isle Studios, the ones who brought you Fallout 1, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, and Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel. The game was published by Bethesda Softworks, the Makers of Fallout 3, as well as one of my other favorite game series, The Elder Scrolls.The game takes place in The Mojave Wasteland, which is the Post Apocalyptic version of the areas of Nevada, California, and Arizona. The game follows a The Courier who has a package delivery go wrong, as you find out at the very start of the game. This is one of the few games that I recommend watching the intro all the way through on, as the intro is very well done, in fact I enjoyed watching it my first playthrough, and then after I had played the game through several times, after which I noticed many different things that you would only notice after having played the game in depth. The game is played in 1st/3rd person perspective, and the player interacts with the world and with items using a GUI called a Pipboy 3000, which can be upgraded to the Pimpboy 3 Billion (Which is a gold plated version of the Pipboy 3000.) after completing a certain quest. The game has a nicely done crafting system for creating items for the player to use/sell. You can make items from a few different hotspots, those would be, a fireplace or hot plate, a workbench as well as a repair bench. This game unlike so many of its kind, actually has a nonlinear questline, which basically means you can chose who you would like to side with, as well as how you want to handle a situation in most cases. The games main factions that you can side with during the main questline are Caesar’s Legion, Mr. House, the New California Republic (NCR), and for an independent New Vegas, you can side with a overly friendly and forthcoming robot named Yes Man. Caesar’s Legion is led by no other than Caesar, aka Edward Sallow, Caesar co-founded his legion with a man known as Joshua Graham, whos name is not to be spoken within The Legion without punishment. Mr. House or Robert House, founder of RobCo Industries, is a man who spent the latter years of his Pre-War life, planning for how to keep himself alive indefinitely, and protect the Vegas Strip from nuclear attacks.The New California Republic is a fairly large democratic federation that is the absolute enemy of Caesar’s Legion.The music choices in Fallout: New Vegas are fantastic, it perfectly fits in with the early 1900’s feel of the game and while a few may disagree the music itself is very good, with selections of the greats of the 1940s and 1950s with genres including classical and jazz. I feel like this revived a great period of time for music, so that new generations could enjoy it for themselves. This game is amazing and I would recommend it as a must play for gamers everywhere.

												This game is one word, ""amazing"". I purchased it on Xbox on release day then on PC in summer 2013. This game gives you so many choices to choose from, you pretty much have four storylines to go with. There are tons of quests in the game that are actually really fun to complete, I liked them a lot more than in Fallout 3. The storyline is amazing, something I felt lacked in Fallout 3, New Vegas really makes you feel like you have a goal to accomplish. The combat system is highly improved from Fallout 3. The only thing I criticize the game about is the empty spaces, there are a lot of them but then again it is a desert after all. This is one of my favorite games of all time, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get into the Fallout series. I give the game a 9/10.			"

												Personal Rating: Not a bad game - I expected moreClassic Rating: ★★★☆☆New Vegas doesn't add too much to what we saw in Fallout 3, in my opinion: there are companions, enhanced crafting (which is pretty useless anyway), maybe more weapons and mods but it's the same old game - I can't tell one true change in game play or UI.Main story falls short in comparison to FO3: NV it's mostly made of side quests - some of which very interesting, I have to admit - but all the Courier's story starts and ends in a flutter (not going to spoil).● I loved FO3 dark setting, I liked New Vegas.● I loved FO3 story, I liked New Vegas.● I had some crashes in FO3, I had many more in New Vegas.● I don't remember any particular bug in FO3, I found a lot in New Vegas - from mid game to end I had to open the wiki almost every time I played.● I had to fast travel very often in NV because of silly quest while I spent more time actually playing in FO3.● Factions implementation is not good in New Vegas, in my opinion: if you don't pay attention to what armor you wear, your playthrough can get f****d up.As you can see, there's a lot of things I didn't like, BUT I cannot say New Vegas is a bad game; I can just tell to whoever is still doubtful about choosing Fallout 3 or New Vegas, go with the former, you won't be disappointed.

												The best Fallout game, period. It has a great storyline that makes you consider your actions and question them afterwards, factions that behave realistically and have fleshed-out backgrounds, great gunplay with tons of unique weapons and it's perfectly challenging-- you die just enough so that progress feels like a real victory but not enough to make the game frustrating. On top of this, every single DLC is top quality and the game has an amazing, active modding community. I beat the game twice already and I keep coming back years later. Fallout New Vegas is one of the best games I've ever played, hands down.			"

												Frankly, I'm astounded by how good New Vegas is. It brought back the true Fallout feel, especially the clever and witty humor. On top of that, it completely overhauled everything that Fallout 3 had, producing mechanics that actually work rather well, a world that gives you incentive to explore and reward for doing it, a great deal of solid difficulty, much improved combat, and a TON more role-playing ability. The only problems are that the story is somewhat weak and it has a MASSIVE amount of technical issues. Still, this is what Fallout 3 should have been.			"

												I used to think no game could come close to how good Fallout 3 was but all my friends would say to me ""You bought Fallout: New Vegas collector's edition on launch day! Why haven't you played it yet?! It's so much better than Fallout 3"" and how right they are.Fallout: New Vegas is a First-Person Shooter / Role-Playing Game / Survival Horror game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and is set in a post-apocalyptic western United States, an area largely untouched by the events of the great nuclear war of 2077. You are a Courier, delivering messages around the wasteland and have been assigned to deliver a package containing something very special. Unfortunately, you are captured, package stolen, and left for dead in the wasteland. What happens next will eventually determine the fate of the thousands inhabiting the Mojave desert for years to come.The huge open-world of Fallout: New Vegas is well constructed and very atmospheric. I found however, that it feels slightly less interesting than Fallout 3. In Fallout 3 you would worry all the time about what is around the next corner. In New Vegas, the landscape, at first, looks fairly flat and uninteresting. Is this a fault of the game or is it to be praised for being authentic to the area in which it is set? I have friends that have visited Las Vegas and they tell me ""Yes, the area around Las Vegas is pretty much how it looks in the game"".Which ever way you look at it, you'll get lost in the atmosphere in no time. The ambience and music gives the game a great western vibe as well at the nicely crafted musical score (which also includes tracks from Fallout 1 and 2 for added nostalgia)The world is also not immediately open to the player. Going North is pure suicide early on in the game so the player is encouraged to explore the south before venturing north. By closing off certain areas to the player early on, I found that it really helps to emphasize just how much of a dangerous place the Mojave wasteland really is and it increased my wanting to explore those areas later once I got some better gear.The plot in Fallout: New Vegas however is a lot more open and is better written than Fallout 3. Right up until the very end of the game, you have total freedom to choose your own path in the world. The story also doesn't take itself as seriously as Fallout 3 does; the characters you meet, situations you are put in and overall tone of the game is lighter, funnier and doesn't centre around one specific key character. You have a world, an event is happening in that world, get going and help shape what happens!The game mechanics are deep, very very deep. There are almost System Shock 2 levels of complexity in this game; It keeps pretty much all of Fallout 3's FPS/RPG elements and statistical goodness everyone has come to expect from a Fallout game but also re-introduces mechanics from Fallout 1 and 2 back into the mix. Damage Threshold and Damage Resistance are back and really well implemented into the combat. I learnt pretty quickly that it is futile to chip away at a creature's thick hide or somebody's metal armour with a 9mm pistol, you're going to need the right gun for the right situation which means thinking on your feet. Guns can also degrade in quality over time and depending on what ammo you use which means keeping your gear in top condition is very important.The game also allows you to create your own food and ammunition. Different types of ammo will require different components you can get from either de-constructing existing ammo or finding them in the Mojave and will affect different opponents in different ways; Use 12 Gauge, Slug rounds to pierce through Armour or use 12 Gauge, Dragon's Breath rounds to set squishy things on fire!The game introduces an optional 'Hardcore mode' which, amongst other things, requires you to eat, drink and sleep in order to stay alive. Ammunition has weight to it and getting health from Stimpaks occurs over time. It will drastically change the way you think about approaching situations and provide you with a more survival horror type experience.Not only all this but your actions will affect people's opinions of you. Do good things and people in that region, town or faction will like you and will come to your aid in times of need. Do bad things and expect to be hated, shot at and have general abuse hurled at you.I've only scratched the surface of what the game can do here but now it's time to talk about the Downloadable Content that the game contains. There are four packs and they all differ widely in settings and theme but they all tie together cleverly to create one big story to play through:Dead Money DLC - Holy crap this is one atmospheric ride! You are sent to uncover the secrets of the Sierra Madre and I can't say much more as anything else would be a spoiler. This is probably the creepiest DLC out of the four, It's bursting with places to explore and things to find. Anyone who finds that a lot of Fallout: New Vegas feels quite empty and void of small detail in a lot of places will have nothing to complain about here. Great characters and very nicely paced with amazing atmosphere.Honest Hearts DLC - You are hired to travel with the Happy Trails caravan to Utah's Zion National Park. This is the first of the DLCs to give the player an open world to explore. The world is, once again, very nicely crafted with real attention to detail but unfortunately it suffers from being quite boring story-wise. It's nice to meet characters that aren't your average wasteland survivors though but sadly, most are largely forgettable and the story can go out with either a small pop or a whimper depending on what you want to do.Old World Blues DLC - This is probably the funniest and most bizarre DLC made for New Vegas. It was even nominated for a 'Best DLC' award! This is a real turn around from Honest Hearts; hilarious from start to finish, incredibly well written story and characters, a new huge open area to explore, perfect pacing and the DLC will prove a real challenge for players of all skills. Absolutely worth playing and taking your time with.Lonesome Road DLC - The final DLC and it is something quite special. This is really worth playing if, like me, you disliked the game giving you a character that was both a blank slate and had some kind of past that was a complete mystery. This will definitely fill in some of those blanks and make the Courier more interesting. It's a return to a linear world like Operation Anchorage but it is so full of more interesting places to see and things to do. You will find yourself backtracking to either find all the hidden secrets or opening up new areas but a lot of the time, it's worth doing. There are cool set-pieces (which is a must for this kind of DLC) and what happens to you (and/or others) at the end is amazingly good. A great end to an impressive series of DLC.With all of the praise I've given the game, it has its faults. Bugs mainly. There are a few hanging around and whilst they aren't game-breaking, they can range from floating objects to random crashing to desktop. Another issue depends on your point of view, the game falls into the same trap Fallout 3 fell into by letting the player level up too much and becoming too powerful making most of the RPG elements like speech-checks largely pointless. An RPG isn't an RPG any more when you're good at everything!I'm already planning my next play through of Fallout: New Vegas and after playing it, it makes Fallout 3 a very hard game to go back to. Fallout: New Vegas is just an all-round better game, despite it's small flaws and if you enjoyed Fallout 3, I urge you get your hands on this as soon as possible! Hundreds of hours of enjoyment guaranteed!Recommended Mods:JSawyer and Mission Mojave. Use these to make your game a better RPG and fix over 27,000 in-game bugs.			"

												This is gonna be one of my first reviews, so it may not be perfect :)Fallout : New vegas is usually overlooked because it's not made by Bethesda but for me it's the best fallout game :)It has more RPG elements than 3 and 4 where there are tons of playstyles to go by. If you like a western post apoctalyptic setting then this is the best you're propably gonna get. The world is what you would expect from a western post-apoctalyptic world, deserty , old and destroyed towns and irradiated places but also some unique places like red rock canyon, new vegas and faction strongholds.There are a few places you can discover that really don't offer anything besides 4 tin cans and an empty nuka bottle which leaves the world a bit empy. Combat has gotten better from fallout 3 like adding ironsights in to the game. It definetely isin't a typical shooter game like the others, and definetely not as good as Fallout 4 but it's still unique and fun. Factions really offer you many choices. Do you wanna go bad and enslave the entire mojave, go with Ceasar's Legion.Wanna have order and a more civilised mojave? Go with New California Republic.Wanna bring back New Vegas to it's former glory? Side with Mr. House the so called mayor of New Vegas.Or if you wanna rule the Wasteland all by yourself then there is Yes Man .NCR and Ceasar's Legion also have unique clothing and weapons, the other's don't really have any unique equipment.If your near finishing the game then you should check out the DLC, in my opinion NV has better DLC than 3 and 4. Before I finish you must try out NV's  mods, they add a ton of stuff like bugfixes, better textures that make the game stunning, make it more realistic with better combat and better guns or add a ton of new quests and unique companions like Willow, she's the best companion I have ever seen in a video game lol.

												Fallout: New Vegas is Obsidian Entertainment's take on the Fallout franchise using Fallout 3's engine, character building system, and assets, but the similarities of the two games pretty much end there. Saying Fallout 3 is ""bad"" just because I happen to like New Vegas more would be too harsh. It's still a great game in its own right, and let's admit it, New Vegas wouldn't even be greenlit if Fallout 3 weren't a commercial success, but in my opinion New Vegas surpasses it in almost every aspect. Here is why:Crafting in New Vegas is more extensive and rewarding than carrying some scraps to a workbench and making goofy makeshift weapons which belong in Road Runner cartoons. Instead, you can craft potent consumables and powerful ammunition, and more possibilities become available as you improve your skills and learn perks. The quests and dialogues branch out with observable consequences to your decisions (for the most part) instead of pseudo ""choices"" which always lead to the same result. And last but not least, hardcore mode lets you immerse yourself in a desperate post apocalyptic world where every bullet and every drop of clean water is worth its weight in gold, instead of always packing absurdly high amounts of ammo and consumables. It forces you to manage your resources and basic needs at all times. If you want to add another layer of difficulty on top of hardcore mode, I suggest checking out project leader and lead designer Josh Sawyer's namesake mod[fallout.gamepedia.com], which he made in his free time for personal use, and then decided to release it as a free download.Oh, and you're a professional courier in this game. So doing a fetch quest, which makes you feel jerked around in most games, is for once in character. So chop chop, work those legs!			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is Obsidian Entertainment's take on the Fallout franchise using Fallout 3's engine, character building system, and assets, but the similarities of the two games pretty much end there. Saying Fallout 3 is ""bad"" just because I happen to like New Vegas more would be too harsh. It's still a great game in its own right, and let's admit it, New Vegas wouldn't even be greenlit if Fallout 3 weren't a commercial success, but in my opinion New Vegas surpasses it in almost every aspect. Here is why:Crafting in New Vegas is more extensive and rewarding than carrying some scraps to a workbench and making goofy makeshift weapons which belong in Road Runner cartoons. Instead, you can craft potent consumables and powerful ammunition, and more possibilities become available as you improve your skills and learn perks. The quests and dialogues branch out with observable consequences to your decisions (for the most part) instead of pseudo ""choices"" which always lead to the same result. And last but not least, hardcore mode lets you immerse yourself in a desperate post apocalyptic world where every bullet and every drop of clean water is worth its weight in gold, instead of always packing absurdly high amounts of ammo and consumables. It forces you to manage your resources and basic needs at all times. If you want to add another layer of difficulty on top of hardcore mode, I suggest checking out project leader and lead designer Josh Sawyer's namesake mod[fallout.gamepedia.com], which he made in his free time for personal use, and then decided to release it as a free download.Oh, and you're a professional courier in this game. So doing a fetch quest, which makes you feel jerked around in most games, is for once in character. So chop chop, work those legs!			"

												I bought the GOTY version of Fallout: New Vegas during the last Christmas sale and it was the first foray into the Fallout world for me. I had played none of the previous games and was not willing to fork out the money to buy Fallout 4, a game that was released just prior to the sale and thus was still at full price. I wanted to see why people like the Fallout universe so much and since New Vegas was the most recent entry into the franchise after Fallout 4 and was quite cheap, I decided to buy it. Needless to say, I have no regrets. New Vegas is one of the best games I've ever played and it's easy to substantiate that claim.  To get started on the good points of the game, New Vegas is a very rich, albeit not in a monetary sense. The characters, story, and the atmosphere are breathtaking. The quests were really well-done and I didn't feel bored while completing the main and side quests, although the side quests were the ones that really stood out. Most of the game's content comes from side quests and it was really rare for any of those quests to feel mundane or lacklustre in any way. I constantly looked out for quest givers so I could complete the side quests they provided, and it felt fulfilling to complete them. Almost every location in the Mojave has a quest or more tied to it and it was great exploring the Mojave while doing the task that has been set before you. NPCs are numerous and you're sure to have memorable interactions with many a character in the Mojave, whether it ranges from doing stuff for them or popping a cherry in their forehead. Moreover, the choices you make will have an immediate and sometimes far-reaching impact on the world around you. Although you do get to decide the fate of the entire Mojave Wasteland during the main questline, your actions in side quests also affect the individual communities and organizations operating within the world, which also extends to having an impact on the main questline. The role-playing element is certainly very present in this game, and coupled with the amout of freedom presented to the player, it does make for an awesome experience. You have plenty of freedom to do whatever you want and be whoever you want to be. The game doesn't rush you or push you to do or complete quests; you can take your own sweet time by exploring and doing whatever you fancy in the Mojave. If you so wish, you can be a homicidal maniac and murder everyone in sight (and risk breaking quests in the process), or you can be the stereotypical western hero-type that engages in more benevolent activities. Your actions carry weight and it feels really good to know that you're shaping the Mojave in one way or another. In addition, New Vegas has a great modding community. Although the modding scene has slowed down over the years, there's so much good content available on the Nexus for download. I have 130+ mods installed and it has really enriched my experience of playing New Vegas. New weapons, gameplay overhauls, minor tweaks, new world spaces, more quests, etc can all be added if you manage your mods properly. You can even make the aged New Vegas look more aesthetic through the use of hi-res texture mods and lighting mods like ENBs although you have to be prepared to suffer performance losses, the magnitude of which depends on the power of your rig.However, as it is with any other game out there, New Vegas does suffer from some flaws, some of which are pretty blatant. The devs had a very short development cycle for this game and some of the cracks really show. For instance, this game is pretty buggy and it runs on a very dated engine, the same one that Fallout 3 used waayyyy back in 2007. Compared to other games released around its time, New Vegas looks and plays quite badly. Animations are rather clunky and combat is not as smooth as I would like it to be, being pretty awkward and not quite responsive (Graphics and animation mods can somewhat mitigate this problem). Most of the time, I just found myself using VATS instead of aiming down sights due to hit detection issues and not wanting to deal with the whole unresponsiveness of gunplay. (VATS is awesome by the way) Crashes can occur quite frequently although downloading some mods can patch that issue. Also, locations are rather disappointing. New Vegas, which is supposed to be a bright, bustling hub in the center of the Mojave feels really empty and small, being made up of several main buildings. Casinos are dark and lifeless, and towns are quite small and lifeless. Yes, some mods can add onto those locations, but there is only so much a mod can alter. However, I must say that this doesn't detract much from the exploration and roaming experience.   To conclude, New Vegas is a fantastic game and I'm sure if Obsidian Entertainment were granted a longer time to develop this game, it would have turned out to be a greater masterpiece. Much work has been put into this game and we can see it in the role-playing, story, and character elements, and I see myself putting many more hours into this game. Overall, 9/10.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is an awesome game. Add in the 4 major DLCs and 2 minor DLCS, and it is arguably one of the best RPG's of recent years. With a massive wasteland to roam, a great storyline, and an interesting wasteland, it can provide more than 100+ hours of fun, not even including mods.			"

												This review was requested by a bunch of my friends!Fallout: New Vegas is Obsidian's attempt at recreating the Fallout games after Bethesda's attempt at Fallout 3 (And I thought they failed at that attempt) but this time, I think Obsidian was successful.The visuals are mediocre at the most, but there are a few times in-game where the graphics look great. The faces for the NPCs and even yourself seem awful. Plus, the big con above the mediocre visuals is that the atmosphere, where Fallout was dark, scary like the previous entries (Yes, even 3) seemed to bright. The enemies didn't seem terrifying thanks and I couldn't fully enjoy a real Fallout experience. The gameplay is smooth, and I enjoy using VATS (The more tactical approach to the gunplay) and people who don't like the full-out shooters that don't require thinking will enjoy it too. However, I can't put that as a con due to Fallout 3 having this too, so why should I? But like I said, the gameplay is smooth. The shooting is simple and the melee too, but the explosives and such can be a bit useless. However, the hardcore survival experience is highly enjoyable and makes up for the useless explosives. The gameplay does not disappoint.The story is pretty solid, and also if I'm not mistaken, Fallout: New Vegas actually holds the record for the most lines of dialogue in the game. Why am I saying that? It's a major pro for some and a major con for others. Because I enjoy strong storylines, it's a pro for me. If you like ""Get to the point"" NPCs, be wary that you won't find that in Fallout. Benny (The checkered suit guy) is a solid villain who legitimately tricks you at one point in the game and is able to smoothtalk you into nearly killing you. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but I can think of only a few antagonists who successfully manipulated the character with ease, Benny among them. The con to the story though is the fact that the game ENDS, meaning you can't play anymore, after you do the main storyline. The story is great, just be wary of the fact that the game ENDS.The audio is very impressive. The voice actors have more personality than your average Call of Duty, Halo, and whatnot. Plus, I enjoyed the songs that played on the radios and just made me think of the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie. Fallout: New Vegas and GotG both have something in common: Despite the fact that it takes place in modern/future time, the primary soundtrack uses songs from the 50's-80's. It's good to see a game like Fallout (3 too) not use your average dubstep/epic orchestral music for a soundtrack. You will definitely enjoy the audio from this game. The sound effects, the voice actors, everything.I'm a one-and-done kind of guy for replayability, this game included. However, I've seen people get hundreds and hundreds of hours in this game. The replayability, much like its cousin (or brother, or sister) Elder Scrolls have high replayability. After you beat the game, you can create another character, and then another character, and another character! The replayability is some of the strongest in the whole series.In the end, Fallout: New Vegas is nowhere near my favorite RPG, but it's still an amazing experience. I didn't really enjoy the experience as others did, but if you get this game, you will probably side with them, so I recommend this game for any RPG fan.Graphics- 4.5/10Gameplay- 8/10Story- 8/10Audio- 9.5/10Replayability- 9.5/10.:8.0/10:.+High replayability+Amazing hardcore mode+Outstanding performances by the voice actors+Clever antagonist-The game ENDS for real-Awful graphics-Explosives are useless-Bright atmosphere			"

A great experience from start to finish, Also a decent amount of DLC to keep you going. My only real problem is the games actual geographical location, personally I am not a big fan of desert type games but ill make an exception with this game. What are you waiting for?

												I have a good 250+ hours worth of play of Fallout:New Vegas, and I have to say that it is one of my favourite games, ever.Obsidian have always been great with RPGs, but as my first experience of the Fallout franchise, this remains to be one of my favourites.I have explored every possible element, looted every corpse, cabinet and dead Brahmin that I could find; there is SO much content, and with 3 DLCs, you have plenty to work with.Some of the voice acting gets a little...groovy within dialogue, corpses fly to the ceiling with V.A.Ts shots, rescuing followers from behind boulders becomes a frequent chore, and if I have to listen to one more run of Johnny Guitar, I may scream...but a solid 10/10 overall from me.In short; if you enjoyed Skyrim, give this a try. For a lover of stories, I would say this still holds a lot of weight despite the new game now launched (just don't expect the graphics to be on-par.)Guns rather than pew-pew magic.			"

												Whether or not you will like Fallout New Vegas will most likely depend on your personal preference. For example, it depends on whether you prefer the blade or guns. After playing Oblivion and Skyrim, I tried this game and was both pleased and turned off. The cool stuff:I got a mod that imported Star Wars droids into the game, and they are awesome.The costumes can make your character look awesome!There is a jetpack mod......http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/37140/?The main city of New Vegas is pretty nice, and Freeside is fun to explore. The Liberty Loft is the house to get there.http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/41822/?In addition, it is easy to be a total bada** in the game, which is pretty fun.The guns are also diverse and fun, the gunplay is solid. There are also throwable weapons (which Skyrim should have).The soundtrack is good.The uncool:Oblivion and Skyrim spoiled me with beautiful worlds and exciting combat, so I expected a world ripe for exploration and screenshots. However, while it may be great for exploration, its sheer ugliness completely turned me off. On top of that, deadly monsters roam the bleak landscape and serve as bullet sponges, so I ended up being content staying in the City.The NPCs seem fake and are not interesting (if that makes sense).There are some annoying mechanics such as dehydration and radiation. It is fun sometimes and annoying as all heck other times. There are great ENBs, but the game looks bad without them. I now know that I much prefer Elder Scrolls over Fallout. Although Fallout has its perks, I will always rather invest my time in Oblivion and Skyrim's gorgeous worlds, spells, potions, sword combat, and quests. New Vegas' ugly and unrewarding world, unfortunately, dampened my excitement to do a serious playthrough.But: Do not let this deter you. Try it out for yourself and see if you like the elements this game has that other games do not. Plus, check out the Nexus Mods. There are some pretty cool ones there!			"

												The Fallout series is one of the most acclaimed that has also a retro-futuristic touch that charms you when you see it for first time until you finish the game. New Vegas is no stranger to it's predecesors.The player visits the city of New Vegas and it's Mojave desert that are just ruined by the radioactivity and the different factions that are in war. You, most known as the Courier, were hired to deliver an unknown package from the Mojave to the New Vegas Strip but you were intercepted, shot in the head, and left for dead by an also unknown man who steals it.Afterwards, you are found and healed by a local doctor and then, your story begins. No complains on the writting department from me.Being an Open World Action Role playing game gave Bethesda give the gamers so many things to do in the map: from following the main story, or just not and complete side quests; or from being an explorer of the wasteland to wander just in populated places. This game gives you freedom to choose what do you want to do in it and how do you want to develop your     story and character (as you have speech,lockpicking and multiple skills to upgrade by playing). This game even lets you choose how you want to end it as you choose your side in the faction crisis (NCR,Caesar's Legion, Mr House... or none)shown through all of the story. This is what keeps the player so connected to the game: the freedom of playing as you want.The gameplay is  similar from Fallout 3: the Pipboy is back with all it's previous options modified a bit to fit in this game (radio included, lol), the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System or V.A.T.S for the specific aiming of a limb and the real time effects of it (brilliant), the karma and your reputation (good or bad, your choice), companions, weapons modding and the adding of the Gambling (cheating is included) are the most unique things of the series and of course, it's signature. Even the new players can blend in without any problem.Fallout: New Vegas is one hell of a game and will not steal minutes from your life because you will enjoy every second of it.You won't regret the experience.

												This is an amazing addition to the series, highly underrated. Has to be one of the best RPGs to date.I highly recommend getting the Ultimate Edition to enjoy the brilliant DLCs, the game is much more complete with them.Game-play is as amazing as ever, pretty much following the same game-play as Fallout 3 with a few improvements here and there. Strangely they decided to add an iron-sights mode when shooting, which would be fine, but seeing as this game doesn’t have the best graphics, it can sometimes feel like your aiming down a brick. This can be easily corrected by disabling it and going back to Fallout 3’s zoom, however. All the guns feel great, all with a specific purpose and good against certain enemies, there is a great deal more strategy to the gun-play than with Fallout 3, with many more available stats, weapon mods and weapons which are useful in particular situations. This game also introduces hard-core mode, where the game is set to the hardest difficulty (very hard) and forces you to eat, sleep and drink on a regular basis in order to survive. This mode tends to start extremely hard, with endless treks searching for water or supplies and provides a hefty challenge for experienced players, but once you’ve played this game to death, you’ll have enough supplies to not really have to worry about impending starvation any longer.I could go into much more detail on game-play but many of my points would also apply to Fallout 3, which if you haven’t played, I recommend doing so before getting this.As far as visuals and soundtrack go they are beyond exquisite, with a great mix of a western style Mojave theme and the classic 1950s twist that was evident in earlier games.The story is excellent, following your life after being shot in the head. The game has over 62,000 lines of dialogue, holding the Guinness World Record for the most dialogue ever produced for a video game. It also has has some of the best written characters I’ve ever seen in gaming, most of them appearing the DLCs. The actually story, well, that’s up to you. Do what you want; don’t do what you don’t want to do. This is the definition of strong story-telling in a truly free game world.Where the game has many of its problems is in mechanics. Perhaps it was rushed out, thanks to Bethesda only giving Obsidian 18 months to make the game. Very small aspects of the game do sometimes feel unfinished, or the remnants of an idea that was originally in the game are left lying around. There can also be a number of pesky bugs, most of which can be fixed by a few easily installed community mods.What truly should sell you on this game is the endless supply of amazing mods on the Nexus. These mods with the game and DLCs combined will give you endless hours of fun.			"

												Ah, Fallout. My first true RPG, and one true love. Full disclosure, I prefer 3 to NV, but it's almost solely because of the radio personalities; Mr. New Vegas is just kind of...blah. Luckily, there's an all-music station, and the in-game sound track is pretty damn good, too.So, hey, the actual game. For starters, super-fun story. I've always been a sucker for games that have you caught between large warring factions. New Vegas has three of them. Not two. ♥♥♥♥en three. AND, you can say to hell with all of them and throw in with the faction of Me, Baby, taking the riches of New Vegas for yourself. But whatever choices you make, they're all apparent during the final battle, which somehow manages to put Liberty Prime's curb-stomping rampage to shame.The world is beautiful and makes me wish I had a better graphics card. The vaults in particular are very well-written. I still get a feeling of dread whenever I crawl through Vault 34, and Vault 22 is supremely fun with fire-based weapons. The world is solidified by the fact that, unlike in F3, there are a number of large, well-established settlements, with whom you can gain or lose reputation as you and your shooting sprees see fit. The terrain itself is varried, from sprawling dessert to rocky cavern to lush forest to snow-sprinkled mountain, all within about a day's run of each other.Mechanics are glitchy but good as always. Love the condensation of Small Guns and Big Guns into just Guns, and the addition of Survival. I actually wrote my own physical copy of The Wasteland Survival Guide with all crafting recipes in it, just so I could better manage my inventory and decide what crap I could sell safely. I can't mod weapons to save my life, but based on the public achievement stats, I think I'm the only one with this issue. Doesn't bug me much, as there are enough unique weapons in-game to make moding almost pointless. I am, however, a huge fan of the new ammo types; armor-piercing rounds making it so much easier to kill higher-level enemies, and coin shot gives you something to do with all that worthless Legion money you're going to collect.Buy this game, Ultimate Edition. Everyone talks up Lonesome Road, and while enjoyable (partly because it gives you access to the best companion in the game), it's one of the slowest points in the game - and filled with Deahclaws. Old World Blues is hilarious and gives you invaluable resources, Honest Hearts is beautiful in its simplicity, and Dead Money...well, Sierra Madre Martinis make Tin Cans worth something, and there's some good loot towards the end that does help your midgame. God damn, just writing this review makes me want to play again!			"

												Take fallout 3, expand it, add more diversity, add more interesting locations, triple the amount of factions, add a better theme, and add more immersion and you have fallout NV. Obsidian has taken a decent game and made it great. Really a lot more depth in the world and just overall better. It manages to capture Fallout I and II spirit far better than FO3. Bethesda should learn, not everything is about saving the world.A game for explorers and people who like good stories.Far better than FO3.			"

												Ya know after putting a lot of thought into I can honestly say Fallout 4 is a great shooter and builder game, of course others do it better but beside that it's good at its one thing.The down side is, this ancient title that was dug up from the tombs of Bethesda way back in the fantastic year 2012 still somehow managed to be a better game. Which is upsetting to me in a lot of ways, but this game is truly a fantastic RPG in almost every regard of the word. It's not a simple Yes simulator like Fallout 4 is. I feel connected to my character in this game, I feel like I can really play someone give them a backstory, a life and a reason to keep pushing through the mutant rampant lands that we call the Mohave. Is it perfect gameplay? No. But mods fix that. And moding is 100% free (as long as you aren’t playing on a toaster). The melee system is clunky no matter what, the gun play is fun and you can mod weapons, it's very limited yes. But it's not overwhelming and you don’t have to lug around the entirety of a hoarders belongings in order to make sure you can upgrade your pipe pistol from the start of the game to still be relevant. I love this game, I played it for hours back when I still had a functional PS3 and I'm probably going to play it for way more then what I have right now. Get this game, it's the best Wasteland survival RPG on the market. "

												I typically prefer to play simulation and strategy sandbox games because I can get countless hours of replayability versus games with a storyline as eventually the story ends. Reviews and trailers for Fallout 4 caught my attention, but I wasn't quite ready to dish out the money for a genre I've only started to dabble in recently. Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas caught my attention when it was discounted during this past Winter Sale, and I went with Fallout New Vegas because I was worried about Windows 10 and Fallout 3 not being optimized past Windows 7.  I am soon to be 30 hours in and there is someone with almost 4,000 hrs of gameplay out there, I do not regret my choice and it speaks to the opporunity to replay the game when I am done with my first playthrough.Fallout New Vegas welcomed me in without the need to play the previous Fallout games, the storyline is captivating and well-planned thus far. The quests help me to explore an almost open world, exposing me to various creatures and gangs. I am not an expert and no where close to ending the game, but I like the fact that I can choose to replay the game differently by altering my choice of SPECIALS, skills, and choices that in turn affect how the game continues. I have restarted a few times while learning which SPECIALS and skills work best with the character build I am interested in. I finally have a better understanding of the setup and I find that the game provides a challenge without completely sinking and frustrating me as a new player to the genre and franchise. I imagined originally that I wouldn't like it because I don't typicaly play first person shooters but the whole aspect of combining elements of an RPG that I am dabbling with as of late with FPS has suddenly made me more fierce with a gun and explosives. I LOVE that I can cause damage but on the side of good. Some day, maybe I will walk on the darkside to see what else Fallout New Vegas has to offer in terms of quests, but until then I am shooting ghouls, creepy crawlers, and gang members in favor of those in need.

												Perhaps its greatest strength is the fact that everybody can play it differently. Rigidly follow the main storyline – or wander off and ignore it entirely. Try and be as moral as possible – or kill and rob the first merchant you come across. It's a tailor-made gaming experience where everything can be done at your own pace and in your own way – no wonder it resonates with so many people.Fallout: New Vegas, the latest addition to the FRANCHISE, exemplifies all these great qualities in the series' best outing to date.The action this time takes place on the US west coast – the setting for the first two Fallout games – a decision which has granted Obsidian much greater scope for variety in landscaping and colour than the washed-out Washington DC of Fallout 3.Being further away from the game's titular nuclear fallout, there's blue skies, singing birds and more signs of civilisation – a marked tonal shift from the unremittingly bleak scenery seen previously.Aside from the familiar burnt-out cities and trailer parks, the centrepiece of this new setting is the New Vegas strip – a wonderfully distorted and dark version of its real-life counterpart. Vomiting drunks, voluptuous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and a selection of fully playable CASINOS(better max out your Luck rating first) make it every bit as vivid and memorable as the decaying US capital of the last game.In terms of the story, there's next to no foreshadowing this time around – players are expected to be familiar with the Fallout universe – and the main narrative follows your attempts to unravel the events leading up to your near-death, which prefigures the game.Fallout: New VegasI've been asked a few times whether it's 'better' than Fallout 3's central plot and to be honest it's hard to say. It's a looser strand to follow, meaning side-questing fits in much more easily, though the blank nature of your character means it's hard to care too much about what happened to you – especially when there's so much fun to be found elsewhere.

												There are two main groups of the Fallout fanbase as of 2011: people who played all the Fallout games and the much larger amount of people who only really played Fallout 3. I'm part of the first group. Leaving aside the fact that said group is the most toxic fanbase on the Internet, suffice to say that I think Fallout 2 was a big improvement over the first (awful opening area aside).Fallout 3-gen fans tend to dislike New Vegas. But to people like me, Fallout: New Vegas is what I've been waiting for. It's designed by many of the people who made Fallout 2, specifically New Reno. The shortcomings I felt with Fallout 3--the lack of region/NPC-specific endings, the quest solutions not really having much of an effect on the game or world, the dialogue/writing of the NPCs, etc--have all been fixed here. The VATS targeting system is no longer invincible and targeting is redone to use FPS mechanics (where you aim = where you shoot). It'd be hard to go back to Fallout 3 from this, & I liked F3!			"

												Despite what some people might say, Fallout: NV is the better game compared to Fallout 3. It has the same basic ""Fallout 3-esque"" gameplay but it's much improved. They took many popular mods from FO3 and implemented them directly into the game and it's much better for it. I'd even go as far to say that ""hardcore mode"" is the way you should play Fallout: NV. It feels much better with that turned on...like a real wasteland and you're trying to survive in it.NV is exactly what Obsidian does best - They take a good IP and improve upon it in almost every way....especially the writing. Bethesda couldn't write a decent story to save their lives. Their writers are down-right horrible and every one of their games' story was a joke. They make nice lore, but they never write an interesting and involved story in a single game.The only thing FO3 has over NV is easy to see (literally). It's the visuals. FO3 takes place in a  ruined downtown DC area in the USA. Very iconic even to people who don't live in the US. The cowboy-esque visuals from NV are nice at times too, but nothing compares to a torn-up iconic environment most people have seen pictures of in real life.  It's the one real advantage that game has. Everything else though? Fallout: New Vegas actually does it better. Don't get me wrong, I liked Fallout 3 for what it was, but most everything was improved for New Vegas.Do yourself a favor and pick up NV today!			"

The glitches give it that charm that lets you know not to take things too seriously, many laughs to be had.

												Fallout New Vegas. The Fifth official installment in the brilliant Fallout series is wholly welcome.Carrying on faithfully the looks and feel of the much loved franchise it's a brilliant addition and definitely elicits a huge amount of enjoyment.The game depicts the adventures of 'the Courier', a man shot and left for dead in a grave yard in the town of Goodsprings. His quest was to deliver some sort of message... But it was stolen.  Venturing through the game you meet a wide variety of people and groups (including fan favorites such as the Brotherhood of Steel) and on your quest to recover the message you become involved in things much more important than you could ever have expected. The entirely new location allowed the Game Devs to include various new creatures and factions, allowing for interaction with strange new peoples.The visuals of the game are slightly different to it's predecessor Fallout 3, the altered, now orange-y colour scheme is a bit alien to the normal colour pallete however is not too disappointing. An issue with the landscape that I had, is the fact that it doesn't look enough like it's 'just' after an apocalypse. The environment seems a bit too lively, but in fact, it may have looked a bit too repetitive if it carried on looking like Fallout 3 (I'm excited to see how Fallout 4 will look with its rumored Nuclear Winter environment.)There are not many alterations to the gameplay as opposed to the last Fallout game - a style of gameplay which i have come to love with a passion. Fans of the series will be happy to return to using familiar mechanics such as V.A.T.S. which newcomers will quickly get used to.Basically, the game is pretty damn good! The new environment and story line, as well as glorious DLCs (like Old Time Blues) make it a must have in any gamer's collection.80/100			"

If god sent down a game it would be something that isn't so unpolished but dont get me wrong, if Jesus could send down a game he would of sent this game.Fallout New Vegas is a game that is quite frankly buggy and semi-broken but this doesn't sway me away from the fact that it is ever expanding and the gameplay and exploration and even the atmosphere is almost ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic, completed the game? that's no problem with fallout because of the vast array of mods up to download I'm actually half way through a mod called new vegas bounties II which adds 3-4 hours of gameplay with fully fledged dialogue and lip syncing.If I had to rate Fallout New Vegas out of 10 I would give it an 11, a masterpiece that is slightly inconvenienced by the occasional quest bug or game bug, I highly recommend this to anyone with a taste for a good open world game.

												Fallout New Vegas is a very nice video game. From the story to the gameplay, it has eaten the past 100 hours of my life and I'm  very pleased to waste my time. From the art style to the music to the characters, it all just fits in so well. You could say that it's no different from Fallout 3 but unlike Fallout 3, this is a much brighter and much more difficult and polished up experience with only a few flaws within the game. The DLC is fantastic, offering lots of new content and areas to explore. However, there is the problem that it's a Bethesda game. Why is that a problem? Because it's buggy. You have to be careful with the game. If you can get over the annoying save bug (where you can't load your save, requiring you to start the game from the start in order to be able to load your oldest save), to some quest breaking bugs that require you to cheat in the console (I had this occur for me once, but still). The other problem is that the battle with Caesar is very very badly executed. But, that doesn't stop the game itself from being good. If you're looking for a very fun and enjoyable experience, I highly recommend you try it out. And the game itself isn't that expensive with all it's DLC anyway.			"

												TL;DR - Just by sheer length, you should be able to realize that I would recommend this game to everyone. This review is about WHY I recommend it so highly. I do not use the word ""awesome"" very often, but to say “New Vegas's writing and characters are awesome” is true. And I mean, they can create a feeling of awe in YOU. It is especially obvious in the companions that join YOU during YOUR game.SPOILER WARNINGS FOR FALLOUT 1, FALLOUT 2, FALLOUT 3, AND FALLOUT: NEW VEGAS ULTIMATE EDITION!It's easy to see why Boone is a great character. Or how much of a story you can actually give an eyebot. You should sympathize/empathize with Veronica, while being frustrated and understanding at the same time with what Christine had to do. Getting to choose which brain gets to be Rex's replacement, and finding him a mate in Roxie. Being able to help the Nightkin with a high enough science skill and Lily. Getting Dean and Dog/God to begin again. Helping Arcade and Raul choose their own future path in helping the wasteland. Aiding Follows-Chalk in deciding if exploring the ""civilized world"" is worth the time. Helping Waking Cloud with her family and uncovering the mysteries of her tribe's past.They are all interesting characters, because of their abilities to help you, and because they all have different stories. But Cass's story is different, even though it does not seem different. You find her drinking alone on the edge of New Vegas. Trapped between going home and trying to uncover the problems of her caravan business. You can help her several different ways. First you can convince her to go back home and not ""sellout"", or ""sellout"" in order to uncover what happened. And you help her choose how to deal with the assassinations, whether to take them to court and hurt them in their pocketbooks(the reason they did the assassinations in the first place) or deal in ""An eye for an eye"" justice, and kill them all. Regardless of your choice, she is never mad at you for helping. But you literally help decide what kind of person she will become. Now this might not seem very special. You are right, when only taken as the story from Fallout: New Vegas, her companion story lands somewhere in the middle to upper range.But Fallout: New Vegas is not the start of the series. And Obsidian had members that worked on Fallout 2(most importantly Chris Avellone, since he is also the writer of Cass and the Mohave Outpost where you find her, and he created Vault City – more on this later), and are close friends with the people that made Fallout 1. So it was not difficult for them to understand the entire narrative and expand upon what has already happened.To really appreciate Cass's complete story, you have to go back to the start of the series and understand your role in the Fallout universe. In Fallout 1(1997 in our world), the Overseer of Vault 13, sends YOU(""The Vault Dweller"") outside of Vault 13 in order to find a replacement for their failing water filtration system. The solutions to YOUR Vault's water problems cause the otherwise secret location of YOUR Vault to become known. The Overseer is angry that YOU have endangered Vault 13, so he sends YOU back out to save the Vault from YOUR mess. Once YOU are finally done ensuring the safety of Vault 13, YOU return home. The Overseer recognizes that YOU are no longer a Vault 13 citizen, YOUR travels have changed the person that YOU once were. He feels that YOU would be a danger to Vault 13's society. So after all YOUR hard work, YOU get exiled from YOUR home.Some of the other members of Vault 13 are angry at the Overseer for the choice to exile “The Vault Dweller”, and they all join ""The Vault Dweller"". They travel for a bit and eventually create the village of Arroyo. ""The Vault Dweller"" gets married and has a daughter. This daughter becomes the leader of the tribe. A generation almost completely passes before Arroyo falls onto hard times. They need a technological boost to survive.Fallout 2(1998) opens with ""The Vault Dweller""'s daughter(the leader of the Arroyo tribe) explaining to YOU, her child(""The Chosen One""), to leave YOUR tribe to find the required technology to help save everyone. Along the way YOU stop in Vault City. In the outskirts of town there is a bar. The owner of the bar is John Cassidy. YOU help him with his unfair debts. He wants to escape from Vault City now that he does not owe money and joins up with YOU. There is not much else to say. For the next 12 years(in our time) there is not much to talk about. John Cassidy was a popular choice to bring in YOUR party. He had a bad heart so YOU could store YOUR drugs with him without fear of him ever using anything but stimpack, but the man loves to drink. YOU can ask him what weapons he is good with. He tells YOU that he is mostly good with guns and knives, but is ashamed to tell YOU that he can use a spear(since it might make people think that his is just a tribal). The main character development seemed to be explaining to him that YOU are just a tribal, and he has learned his lesson about being judgmental of tribals.So why was all that back story about the stories of Fallout 1 and 2 important? And why did I capitalize all the ""you""s and ""your""s when talking about the Player Characters? I capitalized them to remind you that it was your choice for these things to happen. These are the canonical events. Even though you do not have to recruit John Cassidy, the official story states that you did.So jumping ahead to Fallout 3(2008). It is based on the opposite coast from the rest of the series, and barely tells us anything about what happened in Fallout 1/Fallout 2, like Fallout 2 did with Fallout 1. That is all that needs to be said about Fallout 3.Back to Fallout: New Vegas(2010). If you do not send Cass back West, she joins YOU. When YOU ask her about her name YOU learn it is Rose of Sharon Cassidy. Cass for short. YOU learn that she can use guns, knives, and spears. She gets annoyed with YOU, if you talk to her while high on any drugs, but gives you bonus for drinking alcohol. Especially her favorite kind, Whiskey, which gives YOU another bonus. When YOU ask more about her life growing up, YOU learn that her mother was sick and did not raise her much. Her dad just left one day, when she was young. All of the evidence should show that Cass is the daughter of John Cassidy. YOU!!!!!!!(""The Chosen One"" from Fallout 2) are the reason why John Cassidy leaves Vault City and Cass. YOU are the reason Cass's life has turned out this way. YOU are the cause of all her problems, just because YOU wanted a party member that was really good with a gun.The developers are the reason why Boone had a such a rough life. The developers are the reason why Christine was so obsessed with being in the ""Circle of Steel"" and solving the internal problems of the ""Brotherhood of Steel"". Even at the cost of her voice and her relationship with Veronica. The developers are the reason that ED-E is broken and that Rex is dying. The developers are the reason that Raul is locked up, or that Arcade has run from his past. The developers are the reason that Lily is going crazy and Dog/God's personality is split. The developers are the reason that Dean got caught up in the Sierra Madre. The developers are why Follows-Chalk and Waking Cloud are struggling with different aspects of tribal life.Sure, Josh Sawyer told Chris Avellone to do something with John Cassidy when the game was being developed. It is not completely YOUR fault. But you actually caused Cass to turn out this way. If YOU did not find John Cassidy's character to be useful, then Josh would never have told Chris to use that storyline from Fallout 2.YOU now recruit John Cassidy because if you don't, he doesn't help save the world, but still leaves his daughter and wife. Now this is the part of his story that YOU get to shape.Cass is one of the many examples of why I recommend this game to everyone.			"

												A fitting love-letter of a bygone era known only as the '50s, it reminds me of a dusty ballroom recording, with its crackles and pops, genuine improvisational finesse, and its propensity for dryness. It seamlessly blends diverse modes of visual art, ranging from retro-futurism to Art Deco to modernist sensibilities into its quirky and idiosyncratic world.You, the Courier, wander the vast expanse collectively known as the 'Mojave Wasteland', a post-apocalyptic, divergent vision of the United States in 2281.On a quest to seek revenge against a mystery man who left you in an unmarked ditch to die, you are inadvertently thrown into a quagmire between three major factions: the 'New California Republic', 'Caesar's Legion', and with the enigmatic 'Mr. House'.The main story revolves solely on these three factions, which I'll get into in relative detail. (Spoilers below).The 'New California Republic' touts itself as a last bastion of a democratic federation, structuring its government and its system of laws after pre-War United States sworn to egalitarian ideals. This ideology was handled rather poorly by bureaucrats and serve as an annoying hindrance to civic order. (They are now dealing with a conglomerate of loosely connected but independent city-states.) Problems arise regarding but not limited to: laissez-faire capitalism, populism, rampant corruption, extensive senatorial infighting, and most recently, aggressive expansion.Edward Sallow was a former member of the Followers and the NCR. Here is a man who took charge of his life, as a true anarchist like himself would. He familiarized himself with the 'Commentarii', Julius Caesar's firsthand account on the Gallic Wars and emulated his character, even taking on his title. He quickly established himself as a man to be reckoned with, resorting to shockingly barbaric ways to make his point, and established the monolithic 'Legion'.One might think Caesar's Legion would serve as a direct dichotomy to the NCR, but they're very analogous if you think about it: both are nationalistic (strictly in the traditional sense), militaristic, imperialistic, and arguably totalitarian. The Legion takes it one step further and ""obliterates the identity of every group it conquers"", a homogenous culture of racialists, galvanizing under one banner.And of course, you have Mr. Robert Edwin House and his roaming army of Securitrons. A mysterious and undoubtedly interesting figure, a staunch antitheist, and an ambitious, calculating autocrat with great oratory skill and prowess, he practically owns the New Vegas strip. He is also a self-described visionary of technological and economic gambits, and wants total control of the Wasteland.(I won't even mention all the fracases you can get into with minor factions, specifically with the Three Families, the Boomers, the Great Khans, the Brotherhood of Steel, the Remnants of the Enclave, etc. simply because there's no room for it.) These storylines are just as enjoyable and original, if not moreso than the main quests.This is a game that's politically versed, wholly engaging, dark and humorous, and always fun to play. Mod it to your heart's content, and explore the Wasteland, a dried-up canvas that keeps on giving. Fallout at its best.			"

												This was the first of the Fallout Series that I've played and I am thoroughly impressed. The creators and successors of Fallout truly love their creation and put so much passion into their games and related items of interests. Only finishing FO:NV, I realise that I have only touched like 5% of the whole story. It made me curious and so I read the timeline of events in the whole Fallout universe and pleased myself with the reading of the whole story. I really enjoyed that as well!(From a first-time player of Fallout) FO:NV has great FPS gameplay including the VATS feature. The leveling, skill, S.P.E.C.I.A.L, perk and reputation system is vast and astonishing. I enjoyed starting new characters with high strength and luck and yolo it out in the Wasteland. The mass amounts of items, armor, weapons, ammo and drinks you can find is another aspect that'll make me enjoy and not get bored. Storyline is very non-linear and links up few quests so you don't have to got through too much trouble. The A.I is nicely designed for the era of the gaming industry when FO:NV was in. Companions are cool and there are many options to do with the companion (fight, stay, disband or just have a nice chat). Overall I just think FO:NV as an incredibly badass game.The main reason I played FO:NV was because of the massive hype for Fallout 4 that provoked me to try out the Fallout Series. I know now that I will definitely buy Fallout 4, when I have the money ofc. I am proud of Bethesda, Obsidian and the original creators Interplay. 10/10 I write poetry in my Brotherhood of Steel armor. Lasers are my ink. My enemies are my paper.  "

												Fallout: New Vegas may seem like an expansion for Fallout 3 than a stand alone game, but that is only at first glance. Fallout: New Vegas takes the focus of the Fallout franchise back to the west coast and does so in a very good way. The story isn't exactly amazing, however it lends itself to letting you create your own backstory, and making your own decisions. There really isn't too much to hold you back from doing what ever you want? The base game alone has hundreds of hours of contnent in it, and has a huge amount of replay value, from four different major endings and dozens of smaller end pieces. That being said it is not without a few flaws: namely the glitichs and instability. It manages to be worse than its predecesor in that regard, as well as numerous bugs; some hilarious, some that can ruin a run through. The only other real complaint I have is that you CANNOT continue the game after you beat the ending, which is a shame. Still there is more than enough to do in New Vegas, and with all of its DLC this is a must have for any Fallout fan, as well as anyone who likes RPGs.			"

												A great FPS/RPG game.  It’s longer then most normal games with tons of replay ability and I’m still finding stuff I’ve never discovered.  NV also makes for a good follow up to Fallout 3, as they are build off the same engine and for the most part have very similar play style.  On top of that they reworked combat outside of VATS to make if feel more fluid with the ability to actually shoot down your sights even at low level over FO3.   Another improvement was to repairs for weapons were now you can fix a gun to max condition even with low repair  vs FO3 not letting you do that.  Lastly the change to companions and making them more useful over FO3 is great.  I liked having companions to help out and all of them have missions and stories their own that add even more to narrative of the world you play in.New Vegas does come with a little baggage (Few bugs/CTD) but other then that, as long you have auto save on your ok.  The only thing that puts me off little on this game is it don't really have the apocalypse feel as much as FO3 does.  I'm ok with the more old western feel but I do miss the large destroyed city feel most of FO3 had.  Mods also can help add to your world, change whatever you want.  You choose how things turn out but as always, war… war never changes.***9.5/10***			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is all about more. There's more to do in New Vegas than in Fallout 3, its superb predecessor; there's more complexity to its gameplay mechanics; and there are even more secrets to uncover as you roam the postapocalyptic wastes. Fallout: New Vegas' familiar rhythm will delight fans of the series, and the huge world, expansive quests, and hidden pleasures will have you itching to see what other joys you might uncover. Occasional glitches and performance issues occasionally intrude upon your travels, along with the scorpions and geckos that might accost you. Don't let the quirks frighten you away, however: New Vegas' nooks and crannies are bursting with grimy treasures waiting to be dusted off and admired by intrepid explorers.There's a wild, wonderful world outside Vegas, just waiting to be explored.This latest trip into the desolate American landscape possesses many of the same elements that made Fallout 3 such a successful role-playing game, but its story doesn't boast as many memorable moments. The large-scale combat scenarios are less epic, and the surprises are less dramatic than Fallout 3's mid-game reverie. Nevertheless, the main tale provides a solid skeleton from which to hang a dumbfounding number of tasks and stand-alone parables. Many of these quests are lengthy, and great dialogue and good voice acting will invite you to learn more about the characters, as well as keep you wondering about what will happen next. A society of ghouls with pie-in-the-sky aspirations is creepy enough to make you squirm, yet blind devotion to their dreams still inspires empathy. Socialites in formal attire run a casino known for its creative menu choices, and if you play your cards right, you might get to make a menu alteration of your own. You investigate the disappearance of a sharp-tongued wife in one town and bring star-crossed lovers together in another. Some of the most fascinating occurrences are the wittier ones. During one quest, a robot with a specialized skill and a gut-busting name might offer a service that surely no game character has ever offered before. A poet in an unlikely place mumbles aloud his difficulties in finding the right rhymes. Like with Fallout 3, the greatest delights aren't in the central storyline but on its periphery.While the tale isn't as evocative as it might have been, the way it blossoms as you advance, giving you any number of ways to proceed, is extraordinary. The choices you make might lead to a dramatically different experience from another player's experience. The same is true of many supplementary quests. There's a ton of flexibility in how you might approach certain tasks. Maybe you'll fend off the robots defending a long-forgotten museum, but you might also steal an identification card that allows you to walk around (mostly) unharmed. You might provide a drug addict his fix, but if your speech skill is high enough, you can convince him to get on the straight and narrow. One lovelorn fellow will try to send you on a scavenger hunt for spare parts, but a high science skill means you can recommend another schematic and avoid the job altogether. However, there are certain cases in which the game funnels you down a specific path that might come as a shock if you prefer peaceful ends but are forced into a combat scenario with a single viable solution. And in certain cases, the quests just aren't designed particularly well. Searching for a key in a vault overrun with vegetation can turn into a major hassle. Avoiding an artillery bombardment isn't fun in the least and feels out of place given the measured pace at which you move. And an optional quest in which you hop from one computer terminal to another to isolate a virus leads to frustrating trial-and-error guesswork.Ghouls don't like it when you say 'eewww' to their faces. It's better to talk behind their backs at a later time.Large personalities give an edge to your undertakings. A mysterious man known as Mr. House presides over both the Strip, as well as your own adventures, and his singular focus on fulfilling his needs looms dramatically over the later hours of your escapades. The leader of a Roman-inspired legion is also an ominous presence and a violent counterpoint to the upright and learned leader of the Brotherhood of Steel's local contingent. A ghoulish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, a potty-mouthed head waiter, and a wealthy-but-desperate father all make an impression in spite of their very minor roles. You might even find an interesting kindred spirit to accompany you. As with Fallout 3, you can bring a companion along with you; this is handy not only in combat, but it also gives you an extra inventory for dumping detritus. Interacting with your companion is simple, thanks to a wheel that lets you choose behaviors for your fellow traveler. You can only have one at a time, but you'll encounter multiple individuals willing to join you, and they all make interesting and funny quips when you interact with them. They also open up different quest opportunities, giving you a chance to learn more about what makes them tick.Fallout: New Vegas' major addition is that of faction favor. You establish a reputation with various towns and organizations by doing them favors or annoying them in some way or another. Which factions you align with has both subtle and profound consequences. If you're liked, a random somebody might run up to you bearing minor gifts, such as an iguana on a stick. (Mmm, tasty.) Or if you've gained a more violent reputation, a mugger might accost you with violent intentions, only to run off when he recognizes you. It's a pleasure to hear random citizens remark on how they feel about you as you pass by, even if the canned comments repeat a bit too often. (It's sometimes bizarre to hear two characters standing side by side deliver the same line, spoken by the same voice actor.)That Great Khan is no match for a sword made out of a bumper.Your faction relationships also have much more dramatic consequences on your adventure, opening up new quests while closing off others. The game is sometimes a bit opaque regarding how your actions may inadvertently affect the way a particular faction sees you, but this complexity manifests itself in awesome ways as you near the end of your travels. One great twist to this system is that by dressing up in faction-specific clothing or armor, you can disguise yourself and avoid a confrontation. Though, conversely, you might get dragged into battles against allies if you forget to change gear, which might damage a relationship you're trying to cultivate. This reputation system is a bit abstract, but it's a great addition to the Fallout formula, adding even more layers to a template already lauded for its flexibility.Glitches may give you a few minor fits, but the PC version of Fallout: New Vegas is not in the same rough technical shape as its console counterparts, possibly thanks to a sizeable patch delivered a day after its release. That doesn't mean there aren't problems here. We encountered some bugs, such as a friendly quest giver inexplicably attacking us, even though he didn't show as an enemy on the directional radar. Characters might still randomly freak out as if you're about to attack for no discernible reason, only to return to their normal locations a moment later and act as if nothing had happened. But we encountered only a few scripting problems, and the game never crashed. Most complex role-playing games suffer from technical hitches, and this one is no exception. However, the oddities in this version aren't exceptionally disruptive, which makes it easy to stay invested.Hacking is one way to solve your problems, but if you aren't good at it, there's probably another way. Or three.If you played Fallout 3 or The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, which used the same game engine as Fallout: New Vegas, then you won't be surprised by some of the other minor foibles, although many of them seem exac			"

												Fallout New Vegas really reminds the player of the original fallouts.Unlike Fallout 3 (which i highly recommend as well) New Vegas gives you choices that you may be morally conflicted with, yes Fallout 3 had choices in it, all good fallout games have, but New Vegas gives you more options. In addition to more choices the developers have introduced a reputation system, you do something good like help a community you will be liked more, but if you do things they do not like your reputation will go down. All of this matters in the endgame, who will support you depending on what side you took.Like many of RPG you will encounter people, you will talk to people. Throughout your travels you will meet interesting people you either like or dislike, all characters of importance are interesting, they have a story to tell, from Mr House overlord of the strip to the super mutants in Jacobstown.The graphics honestly are not anything to brag about. There is little change from Fallout 3, a few things have been brought over. But Fallout has never been known for their graphics, it has been for the story. If you are really bugged by the graphics you could just go and get a mod for it, there are plenty.VATS is back, along with other gameplay elements that made Fallout 3 popular. There have been changes made as well, more immersive elements have been added, like making ammunition, more crafting options, more weapons types, gambling and many more. I would not be recommending this game if there was no change, but there is change and it is a good change.Active community, Mods! The community is super active for mods, so many mods mods mods mods.Lastly the DLC. Lonesome road, Dead money, Old Wolrd Blues and honest hearts. All of them are good in their own respects but this review is looking at the core game, reviews for the DLC's will be on their respective pages or elsewhere.Fallout New Vegas is a game that is a game I will definitely recommend to anybody that asks.

 I just love this gameI played it without Steam some years ago for about 150+ hours and want to recapitulate this experience now with some Nexus-mods. Took me about 4 hours to get it running smoothly and without crashes, but it's totally worth the time and money!! For me  NMC-textures and Nevada Skies crashed the whole game. So this was a bummer. I recommend the following mods:  Western Sky!!  Active Wasteland  db enhanced Blood Textures  Full Character Overhaul!  Improved Sound FX!!  Sprint Mod  NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash  EVE - Essential Visual Enhancements!!  The radio stations: CONELRAD and Old World RadioI also recommend to start the game in Windows 7 compatibility mode (Windows XP Service Pack 2).But also without mods and stuff this game is absolutely great and except the grafics totally up to date! If you're from Germany, be shure to buy the UNCUT Ultimate Edition!!For More Blood etc. open Fallout_default.ini Config file found in:...Steam\steamapps\common\fallout new vegasand find the following lines:fDecalLifetime=10.0000iMaxDecalsPerFrame=50change the numbers to:fDecalLifetime=720.0000iMaxDecalsPerFrame=512 Bottom line: This is one of the best RPG of all time and can keep up with games like Morrowind and Skyrim!Update: It's still running pretty good, but every 2-3 hours it's crashing...But so what?!Update after 150 hours: Done most of the side-quests and it's still fun to scavenge and explore the wastelands. There's sooooo much to discover and I realized that last time I played it I missed many many cool quests and locations.Right now, I'm starting the Dead Money DLC with my level 34 character. This DLC seems to be quite out of touch with the ""normal"" Fallout NV world. There's something about ghosts, radios which will kill you if you go near them (you're wearing a booby-trap-collar (Battle Royale?!), which will detonate on approach) and some guy is forcing you to enter the Sierra Madre casino with some companions...Mhh, I'm eager to find out how this turns out!! I'll keep you updated!Update: Okay, totally got addicted again to this game! Played every DLC and maxed my character out...Mhhh, let's see, how long it takes until I play it again :-DI WILL BE BACK!!Update:   Okay, maybe I won't be back, because, people, hear me out: FALLOUT 4 HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED!!!  So for all of you who can't wait, get this game and prepare yourself for the wasteland!! "

												War? War never changes. Neither does Fallout. Between Fallout 3 and New Vegas not a whole lot had changed. Heck, usually a sequel adds significant technical improvements. Not New Vegas. New Vegas trades out the setting for a slightly different one, trades in its story for something that Bioware would be jealous of. And adds a few new weapons and options. Other than that, New Vegas and Fallout 3 are pretty much exactly alike. And that is not a bad thing. I would have loved a more intuitive interface, or higher walkspeed, but I guess the developers held true to their creed of ""do not fix what isn't broke."" They also didn't fix was was broken, but big games have these small issues, and New Vegas is big. Huge. Ginormous. Not just in scale, but also in scope. There are so incredibly many things to do; if you'd try to do them all, you'd go mad. It is impossible to do it all in one playthrough; many quests have different angles and outcomes, and your alignment plays a big role. Oh, and this game isn't cushy with good and bad alignment. No, this game has a tonne of factions, and each keeps tabs on your relationship with them. You can suck up to all of them, or a few, or just go full paraiah and just kill everyone. Also, the game generally doesn't care about how you finish up a quest; just that you put an end to it. New Vegas is a true, and both technically and literally a sandbox game. Most of the world is desert. Miles and miles of barren, irradiated sand, rocks and broken roads. This is where the tedium sets in. Because for all its superfluence, there isn't much variation in the design. All the buildings look the same. Someone built the same dingy shack about 18 times over, all across the Mohave desert. You can only distiguish the various derelict factories from the name on the door. It's a shame. For all its complex relationship mechanics and over the top gore, it is easy to see where the developers cut costs.None of it really matters. The narrative just sucks you in, then spits you out to the side so you can go fishing for airplanes, only to draw you back in as you are rummaging through random hotel rooms. When you finally hit the climax, you'll have no idea about what and who you were working with. All the more reason to play it again, and waste even more time, looking for snowglobes in a giant desert while the future of mankind is at the mercy of antiquated fanatics who like to nail people to crosses for fun. Serious business.			"

												A great FPS/RPG game.  It’s longer then most normal games with tons of replay ability and I’m still finding stuff I’ve never discovered.  NV also makes for a good follow up to Fallout 3, as they are build off the same engine and for the most part have very similar play style.  On top of that they reworked combat outside of VATS to make if feel more fluid with the ability to actually shoot down your sights even at low level over FO3.   Another improvement was to repairs for weapons were now you can fix a gun to max condition even with low repair  vs FO3 not letting you do that.  Lastly the change to companions and making them more useful over FO3 is great.  I liked having companions to help out and all of them have missions and stories their own that add even more to narrative of the world you play in.New Vegas does come with a little baggage (Few bugs/CTD) but other then that, as long you have auto save on your ok.  The only thing that puts me off little on this game is it don't really have the apocalypse feel as much as FO3 does.  I'm ok with the more old western feel but I do miss the large destroyed city feel most of FO3 had.  Mods also can help add to your world, change whatever you want.  You choose how things turn out but as always, war… war never changes.***9.5/10***			"

Sequels that stay true to the cannon? Well fanboys of fo1 and 2, your sequel has arrived! Its not without its flaws, but if you can forgive the small bug here and there and the rather dated engine, you're in for an adventure. Pick this up, i dont think you will be disappointed.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is easily and undeniably one of the single greatest games of all time (at least in my opinion). From the moment Ron Perlman mutters the simple opening line to the point in which you look back upon all that you have accomplished before your final decision at Hoover Dam, you experience a world filled with colorful landmarks and memorable people. On the surface, the game and its world seem crude, dirty, and vulgar but once that surface is cracked and you look inwards, you see an arrangement of mysteries and philosophies all waiting to be explored and experienced. Unfortunately, nothing can be perfect, every shining jewel is tarnished in some way or another- and in the case of New Vegas? The game is broken and unstable. You can not spend an hour in the game without experiencing the consequenses of an incredibly low budget and a development time of less than 2 years. Clipping issues, assets becoming distorted, quests not allowing you to progress, and so on. Not to mention the crashing. The game has some of the most insufferable crashes, often forcing you to sign out or restart your PC entirely. The final drawback of the game is its graphics. The game is ugly. It recieved no enhancement over Fallout 3. In fact, a noticeable percentage of assets and textures are borrowed directly from its predecessor. Of course all of these problems listed can be fixed with one simple method: mods. As one of the most heavily modded games of all time, its very difficult to run out of content, whether it be vanilla or added in at your discretion. Six years later and I still play this game regularly, and I'm hoping that Obsidian is given one more chance at the helm of the Fallout franchise.(Oct 2016) Nvidia and Windows have made this game absolutely unplayable. Can't even load a save, the game just automatically crashes. Thanks for the memories, New Vegas. We will never forget you			"

												Before you read this review - let me just say this: buy it. Just buy it.Fallout New Vegas is a FPS/3rd-person/RPG/adventure game hybrid that for most gamers it would be common to compare with Skyrim. Because after all, the two games were developed by the same company. Almost. Bethesda and Obsidian respectively  Based upon an equal foundation, at least. But New Vegas is so much more than Skyrim in a post-apocalypse setting.New Vegas shows some of the most intriguing, creative, funny and emotional writing that I've ever experienced in a game. It sets the perfect tone with the western post apocalyptic 1960's combined with a bunch of Vegas Baby-backdrop for an adventure about war, ruthless criminals, survival, and endless discoveries. It encourages an alternative approach with a seriously dialogue-driven storyline. With you as a participant, you can influence almost everything that happens. IF you're a charismatic speaker. If not...well, I guess you could go for the (ATTACK) option. This bothers me much with other games, because there's usually no ""pacifist"" game mechanic, you usually end up straining yourself to avoid things the game want you to do, because it doesnt tailor to what you want for yourself. This is not the case with New Vegas. If you want this or that to be the fallout (meh) of your several quest and individual storylines, it's fine. It's possible. The combat may feel a bit disjointed and ""hack'n'slash""-like, with little weight behind motions. I would like more impact. There's not really much physics involved, except for the ragdolls when someone dies, lol. Even that is lackluster.Graphics... pretty..bland. At least my vanilla game (the normal, not modded version) doesn't really drag me into an immersive world, and it hasn't aged that well. BY ITSELF. Not anymore. that's my curse though, I'm a bit stuck up when it comes to graphics and visuals. I just didn't manage to get AS into it as I used to. Then I started modding, and got ENBs functional. My Fallout now looks incredible, runs good, and for me is one of the most complete experiences to date.When I get past my own cursed liking for good visuals, and actually got the game looking sweet... There's nothing bothering me with this game. The writing and story, the characters, locations, the exploration, the factions you fight for and against, the dynamic and deep companions, the action and reaction, consequences of your choices, and how it's all just...Its a good trip.One of my favorite games. No doubt. about 40 hours checked on this playthrough, and I haven't even reached the Strip!A couple of years ago I got 100+ hours without a hitch.Ring-a-ding-ding baby			"

 Fallout: New Vegas Alright, before you read the rest of my review let me get one thing straight, on the whole ""Fallout 3 vs. Fallout: New Vegas"" argument,  I believe Fallout: New Vegas is better  in my opinion Fallout: New Vegas is better than Fallout 3, now hold on, before you call me the devil himself,  I don't dislike Fallout 3 by any means  , it's still one of my favorite games of all time, I just believe that New Vegas is better. I'll be going over my reasoning for believing that New Vegas is better and generally comparing it to FO3 a lot.First of all we'll have to go over some pros for Fallout: New Vegas Fallout: New Vegas Pros  Improved Gameplay Mechanics: One of the biggest improvements over FO3 is the improved mechanics such as the widely improved crafting system, the weapon modification system, ironsights, nerfed VATS, gambling, and etc. Improved Character System Mechanics: Faction system, better karma system, almost no essential (unkillable) characters, hardcore mode Branching Storylines: One awesome addition was the branching storylines (I'll cover the FO3 storyline later) one great thing about the branching storylines was the replayability, I'm about the do my 4th playthrough of the game, the factions you could choose from are the  New California Republic, Caesar's Legion, Mr. House, and Independant Vegas.  Modding: The game itself is amazing, and mods just make it more enjoyable, fix bugs, or add more content, it's all there within the Fallout: New Vegas modding community. Fallout: New Vegas Cons  Bugs: FO:NV, just like any other Fallout game, or Bethesda games for that matter, are plagued with bugs. Whether it's clipping into the ground, mission glitches that make them uncompletable, or missing textures, even though a mod has probably been made or a guide that can be found with a quick Google search. Similarities: One problem I had when first playing is how it was too much was similar with Fallout 3 such as the user interface and it just felt like a Fallout 3 reskin at first. Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3 Comparisons  World Design: I personally like the vibe that FO3 gives off more than FO:NV, while New Vegas gives off a ""humanity rebuilding"" feel, FO3 focuses on the apocalypse more and I personally like that about FO3, when I was gambling in casinos on the New Vegas strip it sometimes felt like a Las Vegas Simulator. Storyline: So this was my main gripe with Fallout 3, it's storyline, you would think I would have some choice, in Fallout: New Vegas there were 4 different storylines, all with different missions, and even side missions would affect the endings Fallout: New Vegas Verdict

												This game is brilliant. it fixes allot of what fallout 3 did not (iron sites ect...) the choice and influence that your charicter has on the world is increadable. you can end up making new vegas a utopia in the waste or enslave/kill all of his inhabitence. The DLC alone is enough to buy this game as it adds so much in terms of story, gameplay and maps. Although if you try to describe this game to someone it can seem a little wierd. ""the world has been nuked and a mail man gets shot in the head only to survive and go on a mail man phsycotic rampage, nuke two places, rob a casino, extermanate tribes and be the most baddas mail man there is"". I think that this was the true falout 3 (not that it was bad or anything it was realy good) but because most of the people, factions and references are for fallout 1 and 2, so it feels like this should have been were fallout 3 is, and 3 be a spin off game (a very good one at that)i give this game 5 stars and bannana out of 10			"

												Perhaps the greatest Fallout game, right up there with Fallout 2.Much better than Fallout 3. The game feels more alive and vibrant. I found a lot more of the towns and NPCs to be more memorable, and the DLC added a lot of fun and interesting things. (Some not so fun too.) There's a lot more feeling of choice and effects. Your companions are interesting and varied enough to have along most of the time.I still need to play through again before jumping into Fallout 4, and I look forward to trying new things in the game. It's worth playing again.			"

												One of the Best Apolalyptic RPG games out thereStory 9/10Gamplay 9/10Replayable 10/10Achievement 7/10Fallout New Vegas is the fourth installment to the Fallout franchise. This game is a big step up from the previous game Fallout 3, one of my all time favourite games. It added more of a survival aspect and weapon upgrading to the already ideal nuclear apolalyptic world of Fallout. It seems that Bethesda wanted to take this game into more of a cowboy feel to it and  move away from the big city and the Brotherhood of Steel heavy power armour to the deserted Mojave wasteland with the NCR soldier look and The Legion Roman battle armour. Adding new and old weapons to aid on your journeybut still keeping the same look and style of Fallout 3. This game uses idea and references from the previous game studio Blackisle Studios plan for their Fallout 3 before Bethesda rebooted the franchise with more of a first person shooter.The story can be told in many ways and the actions that you take on your journey as the courier, the choices that you make truly make your character to survive the wasteland.At this time the game is easy and cheap to buy the game and all the DLCs and not break the bank but adding more whispers in the wind of the Mojave wasteland from the  science labs of Big Mountain to the cloud ridden get away Sierra Madre to the forgotten Divine, or to travel to an untouched land where the trees are green.I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys the idea of apocalyptic worlds where you are the creator of your free will.Cause.War, War Never Changes.

												Fallout: New Vegas is pretty much the post-apocalypse game I always wanted. You have a gigantic world to explore, countless number of side quests in addition to the already meaty and choice-based main quest The gameplay is satisfying and is is the perfect balance between RPG and action shooter. The game easily has over 150 hours of content with all the DLC. It is a proper RPG, letting you play how you want, be it a suave diplomat, a sneaky thief, or a thug with a very big hammer, and has multiple factions to side with for the end-game.As someone who played the hell out of this on the Xbox, I got the game again on PC primarily for mods, and if anyone is considering re-buying for that reason, I whole heartedly say do it right now. Modding makes an already great game fantastic and utterly unique to you with thousands upon thousands of mods. Never a fan of any of the armour or weapons? There is probably a mod out there for you. Not a fan of the fast travel system? Get XRE cars and drive around the wasteland. Have Fallout 3 and want one huge game? Get Tale of Two Wastelands and combine them into one big game with the same character. Want the game to be less of an RPG and more of a shooter, with high damage numbers, sprinting and hotkeys for grenades and melee? There are indeed mods that do that. The possibilities are endless, and the main modding website for New Vegas is easy to use, letting you both manually install mods or have an app that does it for you if you aren't confident enough or unsure.  Pretty much any kind of mod you want, it's out there.The main downside to a game of this scope if the stability, and while generally stable there are some very common bugs everyone will come across when playing the game. Of course, if you have played any other Bethesda-style RPG you will expect this anyway. I made a post on the forums which has the main ones you will need to make the game stable and mostly bug free:http://steamcommunity.com/app/22380/discussions/0/522730700736948013/I can not recommend this game highly enough. One of the best RPG's of the last generation. If you want to see how awesome this game looks, check out my screenshots.			"

												Easily one of the best RPGs out there. The engine is a bit outdated, but still makes a great Job in being fun. Specially if you mod the ♥♥♥♥ outta it. Skyrim may have better graphics, and be more stable, but like most Elder Scrolls games, it lacks roleplaying. The TES saga is great for it's lore and dungeoncrawling. But in New Vegas you can REALLY play a different character. You can be a gay guy who's a smooth talker and doesn't need to fire a shot to get ♥♥♥♥ done, for example. The different ways to solve the quests, according to your skills is what makes the Fallout saga really great. Of course, that's not the only thing this game has to offer. An awesome ambientation, the whole Fallout lore is so rich and unique. Since the smiling guy from the pipboy and all the 30s related humor, to a faction that tries to live by the rules of the Roman Empire, or the super mutants, and a lot more stuff. If Fallout has something that makes it different from other post apocaliyptic settings it's its humor and its uniqueness.Comparing it to Fallout 3, it's better in pretty much every way. The decisions now aren't all ""be a good good person or be a evil evil man"". There are more quests, more factions, a better reputation system. The companions actually have quests and personalities, you can really get to love 'em.  The combat system is better, with the weapons having iron sights and mods, and different types of ammo. Armor is more important now, etc. And to top it off, there's a really nice hardcore mode that allows you to have needs. Yes, now you need to eat, sleep and drink to survive, and can only heal limbs with the not-so-common doctor bags or by actually visiting a doctor. It definetly makes the game harder (Though it IS pretty forgiving in some aspects).The game has its flaws, obviously. The most serious being its bugs. But even like that, the game is a lot more stable than Fallout 3 and is fully playable. Anyways, I could keep talking, and I know I left various aspects of the game uncovered in this ""review"", but this is Just a general recomendation. If you like old RPGs where roleplaying was more important, or simply an unique and open world to explore and get into, this game is for you. Just buy it, you won't regret it.			"

												If you haven't been diagnosed with ADD prior to playing Fallout New Vegas, you definitely will be after playing it. There are so many places to explore, people to talk to, and things to do that it's difficult not to get distracted. But the game remains fun even when you happen to run off on some wild goose chase because the story flows so seamlessly. It never feels like you are on some irrelevant side mission. I love the stress-free freedom to do what you want, when you want to do it.The game left me in awe as to how intricate virtual worlds like this can be experienced in such stunning detail--definitely worth spending my time and energy. Its biggest disappointment is the inability to continue character development and exploration once the main quest is finished. You are forced to load an old save...			"

												This game is great, but it also has many, MANY BUGS AND GLITCHES. Pros: - Good Story - Many Quests, a lot more than Fallout 3 - Great Weapon Variety -  Good and bad voice acting - Many Followers - References to the previous fallout games - The best dlc's i have ever played - Many different paths and factions to follow - Great locations and level design  Cons: - Bugs, frequent crashing, glitches - Terrible Gunplay, you will probably rely on vats for many battles - Bad Graphics, terrible for 2010 - Character Creation is lackluster, your character will most likely not look like you  I know i probably missed many things about this game, but this is what i came up with. I recommend this game to anybody who enjoys the fallout series and the dev and published Bethesda, then this is a must have game. If you enjoy western rpg's there is no better developer and publisher, however this is developed by Obsidion, and is made in a different sort of mood than Fallout 3. This game is bright and interesting. Fallout 3 can be interesting, but it is most often dark and gloomy. This is great game that anyone who enjoys rpg's should buy.			"

												First review in quite some time, but I'll keep it more short and simple.This time, Fallout: New Vegas!Holy S#!% I love this game. The Fallout franshise has ceased to dissapoint me. However, New Vegas has to be my favorite. I just don't know, the characters and amount of content are just plain baffling to me. I spent HOURS trying to ally the Boomers and Brotherhood of Steel. I put my all into saving Goodsprings and Novac. It's just that these characters are great to love, like the King or Benny.  Graphics in this game are pretty alright too. My laptop set the game to medium, so I didn't really experiece the fullness of the detail, but it still looks great.Although there are several bugs, I haven't found anything gamebreaking, and that's just normal in a game.Fallout: New Vegas is possibly one of my favorite games of all time, and you may love it too.I totally recommend this masterpeice.9/10-Dynamic			"

Really surprised that Bethesda being the masters of innovation that they are,didn't think of that for Fallout 4™!Conversations are more fleshed out,the characters are interesting,really loving the writing in this,which improved a lot,so huge props to the writing team over at Bethesda™!They even added the ability to holster weapons and have them attached to your body which Fallout 4™ didn't have.Overall very good game,improved a lot on Bethesda Game Studio™'s most ambitious game ever!

												This review is titled: In My OpinionFallout 4:Pros: The most exploration of them all, best combat, a large city enviornment without borders, the best leveling system, base building, Far Harbor, best crafting systems and customization, most interesting companions (and are not completely broken mechanically), most badass power armor, most brutal survival mode, best setting. Not green or orange.Cons: THE ABSOLUTE WORST DLC (literally a rip-off except Far Harbor), almost zero amount of roleplaying (I dont care about that anyway tbh), you get the achievements and never play again, a slightly more classic aesthetic feel to F1-F3 but still odd like New Vegas.Fallout New Vegas:Pros: Roleplaying, decision based main questline with multiple branching paths, lots of replayability, best vault locations, best minigame (caravan), saving up caps actually matters, slaughtering factions you don't care about whenever you want, anti-material rifle (the most badass gun in any fallout game), most interesting easter eggs (and there are a lot of them).Cons: Cazadors, frustrating combat, small map size with a lot of forgettable locations, okayish DLC (some are better than others), cazadors, odd artistic style compared to F1-F3, huge amount of game breaking bugs at launch (i lost a 30 hour playthrough because of it), worst setting, cazadors, boring NPCs, Orange.Fallout 3Pros: Most memorable side quests, best plot of the main story (imo), most badass brotherhood of steel, most classic artstyle, best radio music, best radio host, best score, most interesting NPCs, best overall DLC, feels like a post-apocalyptic world, lots of locations that have depth and multiple zones.EDIT: I forgot to add Liam Neeson to the pros section because I mean... do I need to explain?Cons: Downtown is chopped into chunks that require hours of subway exploration to access different areas, large map however everything is very spread apart, more replayability then Fallout 4, but still not as much as Fallout New Vegas, NO STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS, runs like crap on Win 7+, I believe you cant aim down sights not 100% though on that, Green.

Fallout: New Vegas is a Post-Apocalyptic RPG that is a great change from common Fantasy-Themed RPGsIn the game you play as a courier about 200 years in the future where america has been turned into a Post-Apocalyptic radioactive wasteland by a war with China in 2077. Small towns dot the lands, while remnants of large cities are ridden with bloodthirsty junkies and criminals. While there is so much danger in the world, there is one gem that sticks out and attracts wealthier people from all around: New Vegas. A city protected by a mysterious overseer called ""Mr. House"", New vegas contains gambling just as much as dirty criminals and squatters.You were delivering a package for the Mojave express when you were shot in the head and buried alive by scheming businessman and had your package stolen. You wake up in Goodsprings, a quaint town on the very outskirts of New vegas. The doctor patches you up and sends you on your way. Your Mission: find the man who tried to kill you and get revenge. On your way, you may be having to decide the fate of New Vegas, and maybe, the world.The Pros:The gameplay stays true to regular RPGs, with a balanced level system but a low cap at level 30. The game is easy to get used to and does have a more challenging mode for when you become a veteran at the game. Hardcore Mode is a mode that increases the difficulty of the game by giving ammo weight and adding hunger, thirst and the possibility of sleep deprivation. I dont reccomend playing on this mode on your first playthrough, but is a fun twist on the traditional game. The arsenal of guns is truly AMAZING, some obtainable through with expensive purchases while others you may have to do some hunting for. there are a large variety of locations in the game and there is even more if you buy the DLCs. All of them are great in my opinion but you may want to pick up lonesome road and old world blues before any of the others. Both give you interesting new areas to explore and cool storylines (lonesome road is a direct continuation of the story!) and maybe up to 10 hours each of additional gameplay. The game also has an INSANE amount of mods and a great mod community. Head over to the Fallout New Vegas Nexus for most mods.The Cons:The Graphics are a little dated since it uses the same engine as Fallout 3. The Game also does have a long tutorial period for learning the game, Which can almost stop you from replaying the game a third or fourth time. The ""Dead Money"" DLC is absolutely horrible, full of ugly puzzles which make you feel like you're not even playing Fallout, More like a horrible and buggy indie stealth-puzzler. The vanilla game is also buggy, some that can even stop you from progressing in the game.Despite these cons, Fallout NV is a great Shooter-RPG to pick up, and a cheap one at that! I give it an 8/10.

												I ♥ the post-apocalyptic vegas style, with the grimy feel of what once were grand buildings, casinos and neon lit streets overlooking a vast, scarce and dangerous wasteland, full of weird and sometimes wonderful things.Customise and create how *you* want to play by altering perks, skills and attributes from the beginning and developing whilst levelling up. Shun or gain respect with different factions and choose a path of destiny with the bigger factions that play core roles in the main storyline. The game is not really too difficult in normal mode but I enjoy playing this game in hardcore mode because it adds more realism to the gameplay, where carrying ammo is counted as weight, injuries take time to heal and ensuring to keep tabs on eating, drinking and sleeping enough.The battle system uses VATS, a targetting system that is entertaining to use if  zoned in on an enemy and they happen to have the weirdest expression or pose at the time!What really creates Fallout is the psychological dialogue of the characters encountered, giving clues to a history or a side-story in the background. Some of the characters are so quirky and memorable that it made me gain a thirst for knowledge about the fallout world. I think you will ♥ this game if you enjoy a combination of RPG, FPS, exploration. Plus there is a lot of DLC to dig into along with completing the main story and exploring all of the wasteland.Overall, this is one of my most loved games and I have to recommend it as one of the best games I have played, not just for the gameplay but simply for the character and role customisation that has been presented as an adventure. ♥			"

												""The New California Republic needs YOU strong!  Do not eat irradiated food!""Having played through Fallout 3 twice over the course of the past half of a decade, I was looking forward to giving Fallout: New Vegas a go but I always seemed to forget that it was in my library when I was choosing what my next 'main game' was going to be.  Finally, with the announcement of Fallout 4 being released in the near future, I pulled it together and started it up with the goal of completing it before the new release.  I was not disappointed.Fallout: New Vegas feels like a standalone expansion to Fallout 3.  However, this particular standalone expansion brings so much to the game that it may as well have had a 4 slapped onto the end of the title.  The roleplaying aspect is drastically improved with a faction alignment system, a balancing of the skills (all of them are extremely useful throughout the game now), and an incredible and deep storyline that alters the world and the ending based on choices that you have made throughout the game.  As opposed to saying that I enjoyed the story as I did in Fallout 3, New Vegas pulled me in and didn't let go until I'd finished the game in its entirety.The more action-FPS aspect of the game was significantly improved in this iteration as well.  Fighting outside of VATS seemed much smoother this time around and was genuinely enjoyable as opposed to merely acceptable.  Crafting was completely overhauled with several different skill lines unlocking hundreds of recipes that were invaluable at differing stages of the game.  The lands around New Vegas were a blast to explore and seemed packed full of life from one side of the map to the other.  Every trip I took across the wasteland resulted in discovering a new location to explore, a caravan being ambushed by the dreaded Caesar's Legion, or any number of other events that were a breath of life in the world.A great game, and one of my favorites now, that I highly recommend to RPG, FPS, and Post-Apocalyptic fans. I'll definitely be taking at least one more trip back into New Vegas to see what other events, quests, storylines, and endings I can discover by signing on with one of the other factions in the game.

												A lot of people don't like this game as much as Fallout 3, but in my opinion I find New Vegas better than FO3. Like FO3, you explore a large wasteland and take on different quests, explore different locations, encounter different people/creatures/things trying to kill you, etc. I like New Vegas more because of its larger selection of weapons, cool DLC (My 2 favorites are Old World Blues and Lonesome Road) and a vibrant modding community that adds even more weapons, gear and the like. Also, there's a Hardcore mode where you really have to pay attention to your hunger, sleep and radiation levels, as well as not lug so much ammo around (ammo has weight in Hardcore mode).			"

												Has some issues. Read the update below.ORIGINAL POST:Great game until it stopped working. I'm not sure if Windows 10 updates caused it but the game is useless now. The game loads to the main menu but crashes when I select continue or new game. A window pops up that says the game has stopped working. Bummer.UPDATE:With an outdated driver installed this game works again. It is a great game if you're willing rollback your driver anytime you want to play it. A spicy ravioli dropped some knowledge on me to use 368.81 nvidia driver and my particular problem was solved.			"

												Released 5 years ago and still great mods coming. If you're wondering if your computer can run it, the answer is yes! (My laptop is potato and it can run it fine!) This game is beautiful in all aspects and you'll have lots of fun patrolling the Mojave. There's always something new each time you play this game and there's always more to the story each time you play. TL;DR BUY THIS GAME. IT'S AMAZING. AND YOU'RE AMAZING TOO. *edit* This game is better than Fallout 4.			"

												When New Vegas came out, late 2010, many billed it quick as a mere ""data disk"" of popular Fallout 3. Six years later, not only it vastly superceedes Fallout 3 in every aspect, but proves itself worthy even compared to brand new Fallout 4. The writing and choices are superb (usual masterwork by Avellone himself) and the feeling of being part of postapocaliptic Mojave is unsurpassed. I reccomend this heartfully, but please apply adequate modding (the plain vanilla experience is quite... jaggy).			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is a open word post apocalyptic role playing game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda Softworks. The gameplay itself is very simlar to Fallout 3. New Vegas took Fallout 3, and gave it a new location, and vastly improved game mechanics and player choice. I think there is nothing wrong with that. Some people do not like New Vegas because of this. While it is true that New Vegas is quite reminiscent to Fallout 3 , it is not a reason to jump to conclusions and assume that the game is not good because of this. Fallout: New Vegas is an amazing game. It has tons of freedom and choice, and it lets you do whatever you want to do. The game even set up the Intro to the game in a way that you can decide who you are. You are a player with no past and have no memeory of anything. This leaves massive space for role playing. I can be a badass sheriff in one play through. In another playthrough, I could be a cold blooded asassin looking for revenge, that will do anything he needs to get what he wants. In creating a backstory for your character, your imagination is the limit. The quests in this game also do not fall short of great. There are many choices within the game, when it comes from choosing how to deal with a faction, choosing which faction to side with, choosing to kill everyone you see etc. Some choices will even test your morals and you will never really know if you made the ""good choice"" Speaking of good, there's another thing to mention. None of the factions in New Vegas are just good. There is no plain good faction, or plain evil faction, as they are all debatable. The political side of New Vegas is sort of morally grey. Each faction has their good side, and they also have a bad side to them. It is up to the player to make the final descision which faction they will side with. The game even shows you a slideshow before the credits showing you all of choices you made, and the outcome or consequences of those choices. It really does make you feel mixed emotions depending on how you played the game. The game also has great and memorable music, that will get stuck in your head right away! Since there are 4 factions to side with in the main quest, and tons of role play oppertunities, this game has tons of replay value. This game is a must have for any PC owner. Excuse my hours on the game, I played a lot more hours on the consoles before I had a PC. If you do get it, I recommend you get the Ultimate Edition with all the DLC, because the DLC is great, and if you are going to mod the game, a lot of mods require you to have all DLC. Good luck and have fun!I give this game 10/10 spurs!			"

												I have looked at this game in my review list for months, of all the titles in my back catalogue Fallout: New Vegas is by far the most daunting. I feel that regardless of to what extent I praise FNV, I will still not be doing it justice.Fallout as a series has grown from some seriously humble roots, and what it has become is one of the finest post-apocalyptic open world RPGs to date. The world is alive, desperate, detailed, immersive and a true wonder to explore. Within this incredible world are some of the most spectacularly realized NPCs and stories ever conceived by Bethesda. The last time I remember being so aware of the lives around me was when I first played Morrowind.As if the vanilla game wasn’t amazing enough, the modding community is seemingly limitless. From tower defense, to a first person shooter overhaul, to countless add on stories and scenarios, there are hundreds if not thousands of hours of content to lose yourself in. The ultimate kicker here is that Fallout: New Vegas is CONSTANTLY on sale. And not just dinky 15% off specials, during any given steam sale, FNV is almost always on sale for 2 or 3 bucks at some point. At this price, it is absolutely ridiculous not to pick up this masterpiece RPG.			"

												Ah, fallout new vegas. A story of grit, deceit, and revenge. The story of a courier who got caught at the bad place at the worst time. After being shot and left for dead, the courier is seemingly brought back from the dead by Doc mitchell. After being let loose into the small town of goodsprings, and learning the ropes of the new survival system, you are set loose into the Nevada wastes. Dead set on revenge, the story is wonderful with many endings. Each one of your actions with the factions, your followers, the main story, the route you take, and even the smallest things (such as replacing a cyborg dogs brain ). The gameplay has not changed too much from fallout 3, using the same engine and all. The endings are all written to perfection, the legion, the ncr, and the independant vegas endings are all satisfying to accomplish. The followers system has been improved on in many ways, the most standout being the new companion wheel. Being able to give your companion stimpaks and orders is much more simple. That and the followers are amazing, and the way you recruit them is more interesting than Fallout 3. The soundtrack is what you would expect from a fallout game, 40s to 50s era music, and its wonderful. How do I know all of this with only 13 hours? I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of the playstation 3 version. The game is a must buy. Also Cazadores are my nightmare fuel.			"

												War. War never changes. Except for the occasional crash and bugs, but that's typical of a game with little development cycle.Fallout: New Vegas is a first-person action RPG, much like its predecessor, Fallout 3. Developed by Obsidian Entertainment, it is set in the Mojave Wasteland, closer to where the original games were set. Your customizable character’s a Courier, shot and left for dead by a man named Benny interested in a package you were delivering. Following through your trail for revenge, you find that the major factions in the region--The New California Republic, Caesar’s Legion, and Mr. House--vying for complete control of the Mojave wasteland. It’s up to you whether or not any of the three, or yourself, would take over the Dam.The NCR is a lot like the US, both the good and the bad. Most of the time, they mean well. In the game, they spread out a lot, using up quite a bit of their resources to cover their new land in the process. This puts them at a disadvantage after the first battle at the Dam against the Legion. Caesar's Legion, in theory, is supposed to be the Roman Empire. But it's filled with misogyny, homophobia, and slavery. There's Mr. House, an expy of Howard Hughes. While he wants to improve humanity in his own way, he's extremely ruthless in his dealings. And there's the Wild Card path, where you set the Mojave down a path of independence and anarchy, alienating the other main factions in the process.In addition, there are four major DLCs (Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues¸ and Lonesome Road), each having its own story, and two additional DLCs (Courier’s Stash--pre-order bonuses--and Gun Runners’ Arsenal—more weapons).I really enjoyed the game largely due to the writing, along with a lot of replayability. However, I feel that there was a lack of real motivation deciding which faction to assist in taking over Hoover Dam, and I felt that your character lacked a bit of personaity compared to other RPG characters. Even the Lone Wanderer had plenty of personality (c'mon. ""No. ♥♥♥♥ you.""). As mentioned earlier, there were a lot of game-breaking bugs, especially at launch. But thankfully mods and patches had gotten rid of them, but a few of them are still there, so mind where you travel.Because of the small development cycle, there are plenty of missed opportunities, like exploring Legion territories and continuing the game after the second battle of Hoover Dam. My suggestion for this game? I would recommend getting this game and its DLCs, which is easy to do with buying the Ultimite Edition. But do take your time on the Nexus; they got plenty of mods that'll enhance the game immensely.			"
