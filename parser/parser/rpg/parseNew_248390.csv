Early Access Review
								Okay so, I'm not exactly sure if i should upvote or downvote it, because both would be true.First of all the good part. The first 10 hours of the game or so, maybe a little bit less, 8 hours - seem magical, astounding and absolutely amazing. It reminds you of old masterpieces - dungeon keeper, Knights and Merchants, even survival games. It's all great - I mean you can dig, create stuff, decorate it, smash monsters, level gnomes up, craft, you can craft a lot. More advanced crafting requires gnomes with specific skills. So the idea's great, you unlock more and more recipes by crafting newly unlocked stuff, the world seems a better place with this game around.And then you get to midgame.You start lacking resourses, especially the most important resourse ingame - iron, which is non-renewable. You start going to edges of the map, which takes gnomes forever to just reach, not to mention they prefer spending their time doing something you didn't really even ask them to do. Even with teleportation to the right place, you just no longer control them, the AI gets dumber the more you build and explore, while gnomes never get faster, nor you get a huge army of them. By midgame you require at least 5 times the amount of gnomes you have!The crafting turns into hell, because you need to unlock 5-10-15 more levels to reach a needed crafting level by crafting stuff you clearly do not need need in huge amounts: like 50 book cases, or 15 stone statues. You exhaust your resourses on trash, just to get over it. You also got to build that trash, which requires you to use pretty inconvinient system of placing the newly crafted item into one of 20 fast access slots, which in midgame are already filled out with important things like spells, food, walls, bridges etc. And then restore the previous one the same way.By that time you get the feeling that you'd rather stare at the wall doing nothing, than play on.Awful late game balance and AI management completely kills the game.But at least you can enjoy first 8-12 hours.

												This is a nice 2d dwarf management game, kind of like a mix between Dwarf Fortress, Terraria and Minecraft. I've enjoyed the time I've spent playing it and I recommend it. However, it does have a few problems.I wish levels didn't take so long to complete: I've played this game for 60 hours and I've only completed 2&1/2 levels. There's no real reason for the game to be so slow, there's just not much to do on a map after you've secured your fort except more of the same stuff you've been doing from the beginning.There's a research tree, but it sucks. New techs have too many prerequisites. You need all of the prerequisites and most of them don't make any sense. Resetting the tech tree each level is also pointless and just makes levels take longer.Dwarfs are also pretty dumb and still get lost while pathfinding. They'll also gather up junk resources like dirt and sand which you simply won't ever need or want again after a certain point.I'm not sure why this game has a Minecraft style crafting grid either. It just means every time I want to make something I need to drag each item onto the grid. There's no need for this, the game gives you the recipe, it could just give you an inventory count for the ingredients on the crafting grid so that you could make stuff and be aware of how many of your raw resources you're using without any dragging.Last but not least I would say the game is very easy. Just kit out all your dwarfs with some good weapons and armor. A few melee dwarfs and the rest with bows or wizard staffs and you're set. You can also just armor your base well and wait out the hourly monster sieges.I guess that's a long list of complaints but I really do enjoy building up my fortress and fending off the monster waves while I gradually expand my mines deeper and further away.

												First 10 hours - AwesomeNext 10 hours - FunNext 10 hours - okNext 10 hours - TediousNext 10 hours - Arrrghhhh!Ok, so why overall positive review? Great value for money! You will get 30 hours of fun out of this game, which makes it money well spent. What happens that makes it a mind numbing tedious grind? Basically there are 3 worlds. You start the first and work your way up in tech to fight the final bosses and move on to the next world.  Now here is the kick to the nuts, every time you start a new world, you start completely over!! I started my third world and couldn't take it anymore. The worlds are a little different so that is kinda fun, but the tech is the same.  Grind fest by gameplay hour 40.  Still, would reccomend you try it. 30 hours of fun! Better bang for your buck than movie or amusement park.			"

Early Access Review
								If you are looking for that next crafter/builder sandbox adventure, then this is the one.  It has the basis to be great as long as you understand that this is an Early Access game meaning there is a lot more to come.  Better graphics than Terraria and does everything different enough to keep it interesting.  Instead of a single hero, you get a team of dwarves to do your bidding.  Tough to rate an Early Access game and would suggest Steam considers against it.  Tough to speak negatively in a review on an Early Access game when I have no idea what will be added until considered released.  So at this point, all I will say is it has the basis to be one of the great ones.Update #1 (3/1/14):   The dev continues to update this game, it continues to get better and I still feel that it has a strong enough foundation to be considered great.  Add mods and this could be legendary.Update #2 (4/14/14):    Same as the last update.  The game is continually being updated with fixes and additions.  A perfect example of what I expect from an Early Access game, and trust me when I say that it's only a small fraction of EA games that get updated this frequently.			"

												Please don't let the Negative review fool you- Craft the World can be a really fun game when it wants to be. I bought this game after Terraria, Gnomoria and Dwarf Fortress were feeling a little stale, and after reading that from the Store Page that it draws so much from similar games, I thought ""Well, this is the game for me!""CtW does a LOT right- it has a great allocation of resources, a Tech Tree that rewards the player (though still in need of a good bit of work on some of the later technologies), graphics that inspire a friendly and positive player experience, and a great base-building simulation.So why is it a Negative review?Because it's a Mobile game. Everything about CtW reeks of ""The App Store is our major goal"". No key bindings, a crafting menu COMPLETELY designed around touchscreens, and even a big Dwarf holding an iPad when you load up the game just ruins the experience for me. Despite it's initial release on Steam, Craft the World makes PC users feel like an afterthought. Everything is dragging, everything is awkward, and you'll need to head to the wiki if you want to figure out any Hotkey shortcuts. However, my overall negative review comes from more than a moral standing-The game fails to deliver on population management completely. If you select an enemy, ALL of yours Dwarves will drop everything they do to fight it. If you mine a tunnel, you're going to have a conga line of Dwarves picking up resources in the LEAST sensible way possible. If you start a task, cancel it, and restart it, you're going to have a Dwarf standing around while another Dwarf, often from the other side of the map, comes to handle the task for some odd reason.The Evil Portal event feels like an artificial restraint on my fun, making me have to pause everything I'm doing for a night while trying to herd my Dwarves into their home quick enough to survive, and the zombie waves are just a lot of ""keep smacking them until they go away(win)/until they break your door down(lose). The Goblin events are frustrating at best; I don't know how the developer thought putting in a random surge of enemies without ANY warning would be a great idea, but it's still more fun than the Evil Portal event.A lot of mechanics are frustrating to deal with and calling them unintuitive would be a major complement. Selecting a single space and having four different options for that space pop up makes me think ""How much better could this have been if they'd put effort into making it better for Mouse/Keyboard users?""All in all, Craft the World is fun. Sometimes. Every time I play this game, it wants me to have all the fun in the world, right up until it trips over its own shoelaces and falls face-first onto the floor. When Dekvoir makes a release better tailored for PC users, I'll gladly change my review. Until then, don't pick the game up until it goes on sale.			"

												After much deliberation, I decided to give the thumbs up to this game - but with a bunch of stuff in mind.First thing's first - the developers made true on their promise, and this game is indeed a mix of Dungeon Keeper (you can control one of your dwarves, which is actually recommended during difficult encounters), Terraria (2D mining, hidden underground rooms and enemies, nighttime attacks) and Dwarf Fortress - well, dwarves and equipment for them.Secondly - this is not a game that will keep you glued to your PC as your dwarves are being killed left and right. Actually, this is a game that doesn't really take itself seriously - you have unlimited freedom over the things your dwarves do - sometimes, it is just as fun to watch them go about their daily stuff (sleep, snore, eat, talk to each other, make funny sounds, etc.). It is a pure sandbox game with some survival factor. Let your creative juices flow, and build yourself a nice fortress or castle. Experiment and take pleasure in it - completing the level isn't really mandatory. Sometimes just making something cool looking just to screenshot it and post it somewhere is just as much fun as completing a level. With that in mind, be aware that your little dwarves will♥♥♥♥♥♥you the hell off quite often.As far as replayability goes, you can expect to be dumping a lot of hours in it. Completing a single level is 12+ hours on a small map.Let's quickly outline what's good and what's bad about this game.The Good:- Sandbox game with huge replayability- Very pleasant graphics and cute dwarves making all kinds of funny sounds- Rewarding exploration of the world above and below- Extensive tech tree- Promotes creativity- Player is actively involved in everything that happens- personally, I haven't played a more relaxing game in a long time, without feeling any constraints or need to finish a levelThe Bad:- Dwarfs AI - the dwarves are plain stupid (look at me using both US and GB plurals in one sentence). Hmm... on a second thought, that is an understatement. They are brain dead and really need you to react to situations or just plain do something before you start... um... how to put it mildly so I don't get banned... Ricking your dipps off.-- And this is a huge gripe. It outweighs everything else. If you do nothing, you will see your dwarves doing the same idiotic thing over and over again, likely resulting in death. Example: in a Boss fight (Big Undead Guys with lots of HP, good armor, using sword attacks and hurling fireballs which you need to kill to advance to the next level) if you lose a dwarf or two before the fight is over, you are in very deep sh... trouble. Unless you explicitely order your dwarves to stay inside the shelter, they will go one by one to pick ther fallen comrades valuable gear, in essence getting slaughtered themselves in the process. You can decimate a whole 10+ dwarven colony like that easily. HOpe you have nerves of steel and don't ragequit.- the pathfinding - oftentimes you will see the dwarves taking weird paths to their goals (can be remedied with portals, thank god)- Techs need grinding - unless you have something specific in mind, expect to be building the same thing over and over to advance to the next tech- Resources are limited - some resources can be recrafted (like coal) but the valuable ores (iron-mithril) can't, so you might face a mineral shortage- Bosses can be cheesed out - if you manage to put the turret just outside their range and you are patient enough, you will have yourself a dead boss.Conclusion: as you see, only the combat part of the game is actually a problem. Everything else promotes casual gameplay, sandbox feeling, relaxation, laughs and smiles all around. I would characterize this game as a builder with softcore survival elements. It is the perfect thing for the casual gamer who likes to throw in an hour or two in it, have some fun and switch it off. If you are a hardcore survival game fan, stay away from it, as you will likely be terribly disappointed.			"

												After 30 hours I am finally on my way to world 2.  Do not let the cute graphics fool you, this is a very challenging game. The more I play the more I want to beat it. If you like crafting, building, fighting, unlocking, gathering, and exploring you will probably love this one. It has an incredible amount of unlocks for you and your dwarves.			"

Early Access Review
								I just broke 100 hours this weekend with this game, so figured it was time for a review. I've been on Steam for years now, and this is the first review I've ever written here. While I've enjoyed other games as much, or more than this one, what made me want to write a review, is how ""quiet"" this game has been. For being so immensely fun, I had never heard of it, quite the sleeper, even more so than Terraria was.I'm a big fan of Minecraft, Terraria, Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, and Don't Starve. This title is definitely as good as those, combining elements of all of them but still delivering a unique gameplay experience. The graphics are superb for what I've come to expect from this genre, and add a lot of character to the game. If it didn't have the ""Early Access"" label I wouldn't have known it was.Do not let the ""Early Access"" label stop you from trying this if you've had bad experiences with them before, so have I (Towns, Castle Story.)  This is not like those and will definitely deliver. The fact that the developers consider this early access makes me really excited to see what else they have in mind for the game, and it gets updated quite frequently.My biggest gripe with the game is the lack of a job priority system like other village management games have, and it can really frustrating here. As of the writing of this review, I frequently have to de-construct/re-construct crafting stations to get my dwarves to craft at all, and their highest priority seems to be hauling right now. Great. -.-I've gotten used to the system now, but it has numerous quirks the player will have to learn and get used to. I could definitely see less patient or experienced gamers quickly getting frustrated with their dwarves and some of the glitchy behavior. That aside, unlike almost every title I mentioned above, the game comes with a built-in tutorial and task-based system to guide you through the game. I really liked this and thought it was really well done. For those who don't like to have their hand held or just want more freedom, there is a custom sandbox style mode that has a few settings to play around with. TL, DR: Great ""Early Access"" game that doesn't play like ""Early Access"" at all! If you enjoy Minecraft, Terraria, Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, Don't Starve or any other game like this, add this title to your collection!			"

												Nope. Not a fan. Looks good from the outset but it's really poorly designed. The biggest and most pervasive issue is it takes way too long to get anything done. I put in at least 15 hours to complete the first world and almost all of that was waiting around while making decisions of very little value.The Dwarf AI is really terrible. Their prioritisation is all over the place. You'll have a dwarf with 90% mining skill and your best pick cutting trees while your brand new dwarf with no skills and no gear will be haplessly hacking away at the toughest rock in the game.  Your cook won't cook. You'll set a job to kill a chicken and find every dwarf you have chasing it around the map. Possibly worst of all - your dwarves regularly refuse to pick up after themselves, rendering all the work you (finally) got them to do moot. What's the point of chopping down trees to collect wood if they never bring the damn wood back to the storehouse? This last complaint is mitigated somewhat by the spells you receive later in the game but they are neither a solution and they invoke the game's fairly terrible magic system (but I won't get into that).The tech tree is really awful. It's mostly linear - if you recognise a tech further down the tree you need you generally have to unlock everything that comes before it, regardless of that tech's use to your or relation to the tech you want. Perhaps this is somewhat permissable as a way of gating your progression through the game, fine (though its a terrible one). But when the tech tree is 50% useless decorative elements it's just infruriating. Decorative stuff does have some use in the game (though its effectiveness is extremely unclear) but generally you'll be forced to produce far more than you'll even have the room to use, let alone the desire. In a game where it can be hugely frustrating to produce the items you  DO need - like a sharper axe - it's just insane to have to sit through the AI's nonsense and the giant travel times to produce items that have both no use and have been forced on you by lazy developers.To add to the nonsense and the endless walking-in-molasses feeling of playing this game, the items that are most useful - extra stockpiles, minecarts and elevators - are all at the very end of the tech tree. After spending the whole game managing dwarf travel times with the portal system (again, utilising the terrible magic system), actually reliable and interesting transport solutions show up at the point in time I didn't need them anymore - I could have just finished the game at the point I was at and was simply closing out the tech tree.There's heaps of other issues I could get into (holy crap the 'Minecraft inspired' craft system is awful) but I'd be here all day.I do not recommend this game.

												This game showed a lot of promise when it was first released. Now, only four levels have been created , it still has annoying errors and they are trying to get customers to pay for extra things that should just be part of the main game, like female characters. Also, once you have done the first level it starts to get boring because the next 3 levels have little difference. It's just the main graphics that change really, but the items collected from the gathered blocks are the same graphics.			"

												I've played Craft The World twice, in two sittings, the two of them equal the playtime you see with this review.What the hell was I doing? Why is this review negative?I got roped in, I got sucker-punched with the all too psychologically powerful allure of mobile-game design.I understand that phrase is considered an ill one in the gaming community, it smacks of tedium, tasks drawn out to the most painful extent possible, and constant, tiny, new goals that move you a modicum forward for dozens of minutes of effort.That's really what it is. I mean, what's here is done fairly well. Your dwarves are automated little cretins with terrible AI who go out, collect resources that you assign them to collect, build what you want them to build, and come back to sleep in their shelter when their health is low, or eat food after they've exerted themselves and built up some of them good old munchies. The game works, it's relatively bug free (I had one crash, and sometimes dwarves get stuck trying to get out of water, that's about it), the mechanics are fluid, and the game is generally competent. Whoopee.At first it's impossibly addictive. This game is deceptively simple, and what I mean by that is that there's a great illusion here of this game having a lot to it at first, you look at the fairly large tech tree, the needs and behaviors of your dwarves, the monster waves with the promise of ""tower defense"" style strategy, and mechanics like farms and being able to husband animals in them.It's fairly cool at first look, but everything here is surface level. There's very little automation of tasks, you can't instruct your dwarves to automatically sheer sheep, or plant, harvest, and replant wheat, or automatically build and rebuild structures. I'm kind of stretching here, but with games of this type, I expect a certain amount of ease of use features to make it more fluid to play, but like I said, this is a mobile-style game, meaning they WANT you to perform as many actions as possible to drag out the playtime.That basically means doing every little simple thing takes a very large amount of button presses, if you want to craft something, you first have to manually arrange the recipe yourself, then craft it, then drag it to a hot bar, then place it, then wait for your dwarves to put it down, after they've dropped it off at the stockpile, then picked it up, and finally gotten on their way.It's that kind of maddening tedium that somehow becomes addictive for a brief period of time, and in my tiredness and desire for something completely mindless to distract me it did its job, but when I finally finished the first level, I felt a profound sense of disappointment and a total lack of feeling of accomplishment when the endgame portal appeared with a ludicrous green ""EXIT"" sign above it.There's not much to get out of this game, moment to moment it will suck the minutes away from you as you fiddle away with its time wasting mechanics, but the game isn't difficult, it doesn't require much thought, the combat is mindless and so is defending yourself against the hordes of enemies that appear. I felt tired after playing this game (yes I know I spent an insane amount of time in single sittings on it).Honestly I really don't know what was going through my head, it must have been my profoundly apathetic mood at the time, but somehow I slogged through this game twice a year apart.I'm still completely confounded by it. My soul drifts through the aether looking for answers it will never have.I don't recommend this game. If you want to waste your time go play Skyrim or something, or hell, play Dungeon Keeper or Terreria or anything that has an actual sense of accomplishment.			"

												As with so many games, this has potential of being a decent, even good, little game but there is just too much wrong with it to make it an enjoyable experience. 4/10The game is a interesting mix of 2d resource gathering with minion management and crafting. The store mentions Minecraft, Terraria, Dwarf Fortress, and Dungeon Keeper which really means a whole lot of confusion on what the game is acutally trying to acheive. It really is not any of those other games but tries to be all of them at the same time. Spinkle in a host of not-quite-there development issues and you got the jist of Craft the World. To start off I will list the game development issues, a series of problems aside from any of the game mechanics that make the game tedious. The worst two offenders are the poor CPU AI and the poor sloppy controls. The computer AI gets stuck and confused regularly throughout gameplay. Your minions often have to ""reset"" in their pathing or decision making processes. This shows in game when the dwarves will be pathing to a spacific task and will just stop and idle for a minute, then the AI will reset and they will go about a different task that is easier to compute. This makes for some frusterating issues when trying to work in a certain spot either mining or building and the computer AI just doesn't quite understand whats going on, making you have to repeat you commands a few times before it clicks. Combine this with the poor sloppy controls that often make the game perform unintented actions and the AI just gets even more confused. Each click, anywhere, on the screen will initially flag a block to be mined. No matter what that block is. Most commands in the game use just the left-mouse click to do, so this means often you will be trying to build or simply move around the map and suddenly your minions are mining down their own house because you clicked somewhere in that space. Very frusterating process.Even after you get over those two hurdles the game promises some interesting gameplay. The interface and graphics are nice and over-all while the concept isn't really new, it is one that is not done all that often and a genre that I wouldn't mind seeing more of. Unfortuntely, as mentioned above the game really doesn't know what it wants to be and none of the elements really blend together well or are done well enough on their own to warrant a good experience. Some are even thrown into the game, it seems, simply because the dev liked the mechanic in another game and threw it in without any real thought to how it effects this particular game.By this I mean the crafting system, which I think is my most disliked part of the game. The crafting system utilizes a crafting system where resources have to placed in a crafting window via a very specific pattern, similar to Minecraft. There really is no reason for this other than to make the process tedious and annoying. I honestly have no idea why it is setup in this manner other then to claim the game is more like Minecraft. Riding on its coat-tails of success. It is pretty awful and combined with poor UI controls it makes it even worse.The other aspect of the game that I don't quite understand and that only makes the game drag on way logner then it should is a pointless leveling / research system. To progess through the crafting items and to get better equipment, the game requires you to ""level"" through gaining experience. You gain this experience through crafting a set number of items of lower quality to get access to higher quality items. This means you are forced to waste resources crafting pointless items you dont need just so you can get access to the better items in the game. Take into the fact that gathering of resources takes way too long, and the AI issues mentioned earlier and the game feels more like a pay-per-play free moble game then anything else. Forcefully making the game take longer for no reason just to try and get people to buy the powerups. But this is not that type of game, which means, I have no idea why it was developed in this way. So overall, just a game that seems like a poorly mashed together group of ideas with no real thought process or goal that brings those ideas together. Combined with the poor development issues the game is simply frusterating and boring after the first few hours. I really cannot recommend it, even on sale. There are much better options available, like any of the other games mentioned in this review and even some others that are not.			"

												It looks like a simulation, but don't be fooled. It's an obstacle course. You must build six items from group A to build 8 items from group B to build 10 items from group C to finally build something that you actually want. So you have no meaningful choices. You can run the obstacle course efficiently or inefficiently, based on how well you understand the system. And learning the system is fun for a while. But once you've learned that system, you'll play every map in exactly the same way. There's no room for individual taste or trying out different strategies. To win, you must do exactly what the designers intended for you to do.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought the first day it came EA on steam.  Best purchase I have made in a long time.  I play this over CoD:G and Bf4.  Those games were a release disaster... being a ""finished"" product that was not ""finished"".  This game is EA and is more playable/enjoyable than most retail games.  The devs are a refreshing suprise too, constant feedback and replies on the forum.  A patch has been released each day since launch, most are fixes for what the community has reported/suggested.  The community on the forums are helpful and supporting too.  All around, this is too good to pass up for 14.99$.  Join us and support this game, lets make this a great title!Get it!  That is all...

												BEWARE: This is not real co-op or multiplayer. You cannot play the singleplayer game with another person.The ""co-op"" mode basically involves inviting a friend to a mini-quest in a small arena world from your existing singleplayer game to defeat a boss. You cannot save the game in the ""co-op"" mode, but at the end, you can bring back some of the supplies to your singleplayer world.			"

												There are two main things to like in this game, that is research and base building. Your research progresses proportionally to what you build. What a nice idea. You build some useful things - also many useless things - and after a while you reach the next level. New things to build are always fun. The first time, that is.Base building is agreable, the many decorative blocks available allow to personalize your castle, to set up a workshop, to improve morale, but also to fortify against zombie attacks that happen regularly. Which is one of the mechanics the game uses to slow down your progress.The interface is clear, easy to read, even the tutorial is well done, and the cartoony graphics are nicely drawn.Why the negative review then?Because you lead a band of morons.Most of the game is spent exploring and retrieving resources far away from your base. You select a resource and your dwarves should go and fetch it. You even have a magic portal to travel instantly from your fortress to the resource.Instead of seeing your dwarves do their job, you'll watch them stay idle around the totem chatting - you can see the icons over their heads - and laughing their asses off. One, sometimes two, dwarves come to observe what you asked them to do, then decide that there is no path going to the task (what? it's in front of you! collect this damn rock! I opened a portal so you can do your job!!) and think about the best path to stay where they are. Meanwhile the portal timer goes on and the portal closes before they can go back home. This is the moment they decide to walk back.You'll end up digging straight tunnels to different parts of the map, which puzzles the dwarves considerably, as the icon over their head shows. They must think a straight tunnel is too easy, maybe it is a trap, let consider every single other path for the next five minutes.Attacks happen regularly, a clock tells you how much time is left before the next evil portal opens, spitting out each time more dangerous enemies. Not really a bother, your dwarves can take up a fight, because it is still better to fight than go through a portal to collect the resources needed to build a better fortress or better armour.Iron and coal - main resources to build armour and weapons - are limited. Once finished you will not be able to build more weapons. They are not regenerated. The last resources are so far away, and your dwarves so lazy, that it will take ages to dress them all.The game seems unable to manage more than half a dozen dwarves, the others stand there idle, chatting and eating and laughing at their own jokes. All things considered, this game became tedious before the first planet was even finished. I don't like watching these dwarves idle whatever I do to make them move. I don't like being forced to send the dwarves at the very end of a map to collect three miserable pieces of iron ore, because there is no ore elsewhere. I don't like seeing them thinking about a path for MINUTES (real minutes of sixty seconds). If you ever click on the wrong block, then click on the good block you wanted to dig, the ♥♥♥♥ing dwarf that was just there ready to dig the block stops, thinks for a minute, then wanders away, all the while other four to six dwarves are doing nothing in the middle of your base.The same thing happens during an attack : dwarves with limited life which are ordered to go to sleep don't know where to go (go to bed dummy, this is the order I've given you), they stay there and can eventually be killed, because they can't move.Settlers 3 (1998) had a better characters management than this game, and far more settlers to deal with. You had things to watch, because of the great number of units the game moved, some of them where lost, certainly, but they were so many you could play with the others. Contrary to this game, where the extremely limited number of dwarves means you can identify each one of them, and see that they mostly spend their time doing nothing.So, depending on your ability to resist frustration, this can become a very long and tedious game of watching lazy dwarves chatting.Oh, and do not believe reviews of people that haven't reached and played with at least 12 dwarves. As a matter of facts, the game doesn't allow more than 20 dwarves - sign the AI is not able to compute for ""so many"" dwarves.			"

Early Access Review
								I am going to add a weak ""not recommended"" review, though I should be clear that that applies to the game's current state -- there is a ton of potential here, but due to some questionable design decisions I don't know if that potential will ever be realized. For reference, some of my favorite games are Gnomoria and Dwarf Fortress, though I did enjoy Terraria a lot.First the good:* Cute art and adorable dwarves.* Detailed and interesting world design, though with very limited ecology.* Deep and varied tech tree.* Solid-seeming tech foundation for a builder/sim game.* Ant farm full of dwarves!The bad:* Terrible user interface:  * tons of superfluous click-and-drag for crafting -- it gives you the recipe but you still have to click and drag into a grid. Maybe for the first time but subsequently producing an item should be easy. Few games make me long for DF's UI.  * generally lacking polish -- highlighting items won't tell you what they are, meaning you spend time guessing what an icon/sprite means. You cannot speedup time and the game proceeds at a glacial pace, a 2/4/8x bar would be nice, especially in early game.* obnoxious leveling system -- this is by far the worst part of the game. You don't tech up by building structures, doing research, etc, nor is the entire tech tree available ala Banished -- you tech up in two ways. By crafting 10 ladders you don't need so you can make torches, etc, and by ""unlocking"" recipes that are ""locked"" by earning XP -- yes, a builder game with XP grinding, like some casual Facebook game. this mechanic might be able to be kept in if improved, but as it stands it just makes the early game a boring, frustrating clickfest. And the game pauses while crafting, which compounds the already slow speed.I know these sound like minor complaints, but taken together they really ruin what could be an enjoyable experience. This game has solid technical design and ideas, but I'm not sure where the authors are going with it; the concerns I mention raise alarm bells, for me at least.I still got some enjoyment out of the game (not done playing yet), and it might be worth picking up on sale, but I really can't advise paying $15 in the current state. Maybe once the dev gets further along or the price drops.			"

Early Access Review
								I've played DF, Towns, Gnomoria, AGoD, and other more or less failed attempts at making a Dwarf Fortress for the common man. Craft the World is the first successful attempt at making a playable, entertaining, and aesthetically pleasing version of Dwarf Fortress. It has a somewhat less ambitious scale but that is perfect in that it makes the game accessible and opens up this style of game to a much larger audience of gamers.A lot of people have misconceptions about this game and seem to be comparing it to Terraria or Starbound which is really a faulty comparison. This game is nothing like those. This is more like a strategy/simulation game in which you manage your resources and utilize your dwarf's time wisely. The graphics and music for Craft the World are top notch. The big sprites change appearance to reflect the armor/weapons you give them. The luch color palette is easy on the eyes and makes identifying different types of material easy. For an Early Access game this is in amazing shape. No crashes for me in 20 hours of play and very few bugs. The balance feels good and really it seems the only thing the game needs before going gold is more content (which they are working on, we should have another world soon). If you are on the fence about this game I encourage you to give it a shot. If you are fascinated by the Dwarf Fortress style of game but are daunted by DF itself and found the other DF mass market attempts wanting as I did then have no fear this is not another Towns.This game was one of my big surprises of the year and I believe before all is said and done I'll be putting 100+ hours into it once all of the difficulty levels are implemented.

												STOP! YOU THERE! Did you like Dwarf Fortress? Did you like Dungeon Keeper?Then give CtW a chance even if it may not look like it could be interesting to you!I've playing since release, and knew this cute little bugger will make it to release and now it finally did!And it just got better :-)What it's all about?You control the world like you do in Dungeon keeper. You say dig here, build there, gather this, kill these. And the dwarfs will decide when to do what. Your job is to... keep them alive (craft good and diverse food, watch what you'll attack and so on) upgrade their weapons and armory give them jobs (they level in up to 3 specialisations each like fighter, miller, smith, archer etc.) loot ruins & discover secrets find rare ores build a nice shelter to increase the comfort so everyone is happy and can chill in their luxury bed craft things to be able to craft other things with these things that finally let you craft this one thing to...do...thingsOne example:Need fish for a recipe but there is none? Build a pool with a bridge, gather snow, craft ice, put ice on bridge, watch ice melt, water drops into pool. Rinse, repeat until fish consider your pool frigging awesome and move in. NOW GO FISHING!If things get complicated you could, like in Dungeon Keeper, control one dwarf and do it yourself!So what are the positive aspects? Addictive gameplay In 3 playthroughs (which will take quite a while) i have not discovered a single bug or crash. Looks more done like many major AAA-titles that call themselves ""finals"" The dwarf-AI is considerably clever. They pretty much always do what you want WHEN you want them to. E.g. they're busy crafting 100 ores and you want ONE weapon NOW? They will probably make that ONE weapon and continue back to their original task. Somethings laying around somewhere? They'll get it as soon as time permits and so on. 3 different worlds. Well ok, differences are marginal and mainly only visible on the surface but at least it gives some replayability-value Music and sound effects are pretty fitting and not annoying even after hours Regular updates, the dev seems very commited. While being in EA that is.But there are negative aspects too: The UI could really be optimized in some aspects (like said in most negative reviews). Crafting can become a pretty frustrating finger-click-party Even though the AI is pretty cool, some things suck like building narrow trenches where they start at the beginning not the end and can't continue. You either have to do one block after another or control a dwarf and do it yourself Sandbox-mode can get pretty frustrating if you're needing one special recipe but EVERYTHING ELSE drops first and you're stuck doing nothing (recipes drop randomly while diggin instead of a tech-tree) Most people find the tech-tree stupid. Although it can sometimes be very stupid (craft 10 of this one thing you don't need but would need the resources, just to be able to craft the next tier) it still makes sense and gives a sense of progression and a target to work for. Some people seem to have problems with the AI. Well, *I* never had any and i played through 3 or 4 times yet. Nearing the end of a map, resources can become scarce as they don't respawn/regrow. So if you need ONE stupid Gold-ore to reach the end and you've wasted all gold for cute gold-fishes (bad pun!) and gold-doors and goold-spoons and goldened silver and gold...you get the point? :-)tl;dr:Considering the cheap price, this game is a keeper! It's also now one of the shining examples of Early Access.I *LOVE* Dungeon Keeper and played it a thousand times and this cute fellow comes pretty close (gameplay wise not visually). Although it's still quite different (instead of War For The Overworld) it's more than enough to keep you hooked.More depth? Try Gnomoria!More casual but still quite complex? Buy this one!			"

												Do not buy for Multiplayer. The Multi player setup really sucks. We played for an hour last night trying to get to the point to be able to play together.......No bueno, almost there. Then looked up Gameplay trailers for multiplayer....you aren't even working WITH your buddy, you are on the Opposite side of the map. Yes, you both have to kill the monster in the middle, but by the time you get to him, you've already unlocked and geared and dont need your buddy.  Fun game, Bad multiplayer attempt.Edit - 30 hours later:  We've played all 4 maps. I can send resources to my friend and open up expensive portals to help him out, but that's the extent of it. By the time we get to each other we do in fact have enough gear to complete the level. I still do not recommend this game for multiplayer but for single it's pretty fun.  If  there was a Thumbs sideways option, this game would get it.			"

												This game is fun for some time. The idea behind it is certainly nice: you are building, exploring, and nursing your gnomes. Until you notice how bad the AI is.It is atrocious.Your smith takes a break after every smelted ingot and goes to the other end of a castle for a little chat? That's normal.You mark the ore deposit and some random gnome starts to pick it with the basic tool while your master-miner chills out nearby? That's normal. Your gnome picks the armor piece you just crafted and goes with it through half the map to pick a ball of dirt? That's normal. You click on a snail and gnomes all over the map drop everything to charge for an attack? You see a gnome who picks one piece of ore but not the other because the other is assigned to some other gnome who is currently on the other end of the map? You order the ladder to be build and the gnomes do it by bringing one piece of ladder at a time althoug they can carry 5? This is all very normal.So in the end you have no control over your gnomes. Bunch of them are going through the map looking busy, but you never know who is actually doing what, and when anything will be done. By this point the game stops being fun, and becames frustrating.

								A rather strange, side-scrolling crafting and survival game. I can't quite place my finger on what I like about it, but it is fun. You are limited in what you can make, and many of the things you can make, can be found in underground rooms if you are willing to dig down and explore, but figuring out ways of surviving the waves of enemies who come every 40 or so in game minutes, is fun when you get into the higher levels. If you are looking for a game that lets you sandbox, this isn't for you. On the other hand if you don't mind that and want to have fun trying to survive, maybe you will enjoy it.			"

YouTube™ Video: Craft the World | E18 | Basic Alchemy and Imps! 

			Views: 45,922		

			Let's play Craft the World! In this episode, our dwarves make a basic alchemy lab, brew up some potions, and summon Imps! Please leave a LIKE if you enjoyed the video!		

This video pick might seem strange since it's episode 18, however I felt that it would give you a good idea of what the game is like. If you enjoy exploring a new game for yourself, then you perhaps don't want to watch it!GeneralI bought Craft the World about a year ago during Early Access. This game has been a good experience for me. Although there was a bit of a rollercoaster when it's OS requirements got changed from a minimum of Snow Leopard to Lion. A few of us objected to the basic OS requirements being changed because it meant we could no longer play the game, and the dev did change it back. I was very appreciative that he listened to us and was able to stick to the original game requirements.However, you want to know whether the game is fun, not how honourable the devs might be. It's very fun, although sometimes I question why it is because it can get quite monotonous and I begin asking myself what the point is. And yet I keep playing.GameplayYou control a bunch of dwarves. As you gain exp you gain levels, and with each new level you get another dwarf. Don't panic if a dwarf dies, because after a few minutes (you'll see the timer) he will respawn. You get your dwarves to execute two major actions - dig, and build. They will also gather materials that are on the ground by themselves. It may not sound like much, but now consider the zombie hordes that will spawn as the game progresses. You need to build strong walls and a good defence against them. The ultimate goal of each level is to complete five portal pieces to rebuild the portal and move onto the next world. If you're the sort that likes building games though, you will definitely get distracted along the way as you experiment with building a fortress for your dwarves.ControlsAlthough you can control everything with the mouse alone, it makes life easier to use the keyboard. WASD lets you pan around, and there are various hotkeys for selecting dwarves and telling them to go eat or sleep. StorylineThere isn't really much of one. I'm not sure why I'm controlling these dwarves and sending them through portals. I have no idea why there are dragons. I haven't even grasped why the zombie hordes are attacking me. But considering how many hours of my life I've already had consumed by this game, I guess I don't really care too much either!SoundIt can get a little monotonous, but on the other hand I find the music is quite addicting. I'll find it starts playing in my head when I feel like coming back to Craft the World for another session. The music is informative, telling you whether or not you're under attack, or whether it is night time. Otherwise, there isn't anything phenomenal here, the sound supports the game.GraphicsAn interesting art style that I quite enjoy. The inventory and crafting screens are a bit clunky in their design and functionality, but they get the job done. I enjoy the bright colours and the various monsters. The trees are quite fun to watch grow and get chopped down. An important tip for players concerned with aesthetics - for things like paintings you can right click a painting with a painting and it will change the image that is being displayed.Pros+ addictive and fun to explore the world and build a fort+ digging+ building+ hotkeys+ zombie hordes to destroyCons- bit of a clunky UI- not sure why I'm playing it- dwarves are stupid, and with time they get even dumber (dwarf AI needs work)Help Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you.

Early Access Review
								This is a fun little, casual, game. Won't satisfy any hardcore gamers' gaming appitite. However, it is a great game to pick up and play for those casual moments.This game is a lot like Terraria meets Dwarves. A bit of a mix and match genre. You have your 'craft the world' genre, allowing you to build anything your imagination allows you to. Combat system for stratagies. Tower defense. Exploration and minning (reminds me of Miner Miner). Instead of playing the whole game as you control the player, you are more the overlord telling your minions what you want done and when.I was dissapointed by the fact this game feels very much like any game you play on a smartphone or tablet (pretty sure it was designed for tablets). It takes too much to click and access certain items. I really think the crafting system needs an overhaul just to be easier to use. If not an overhaul maybe: 'one-click reciepes' instead of constantly having to add the items to the reciepe box. 'Auto craft' items like food, where the dwarfs will automatically craft food and/or fill the table.I would love to see more customizablity to the game, such as making your own dwarves. Assigning jobs or duties. Being able to sell stuff to the shop. I would also love to see more item options in the crafting menu and tech tree!! What this game REALLY needs is more tower defense items to help against the attacking hordes. More traps.If they can step away from generic tablet app design and more cross platform full feature game design, this game has a lot of potential.(sorry for any misspelling)			"

												I absolutely love this game. Been playing it on and off for a fair amount now, maybe a year in total. It's a bit like Sims, you'll go out marathoning it, then maybe put it down for 3 months, but then you find another update and you're right back into it. Though I think this is the longest I've been playing it because of the new Biomes feature. Skip off to another world with/out friends; destroy and strip mine the place- come back and you've got a bounty of goods waiting for you to start your crafting all over. I've built libraries, castles, bridges and countless other things. With the new updates it all gets better. I love this game and honestly have spent WAY longer than I probably should on it hahaha. The time you see there is literally a 6th of my actual game time because I started on my mate's account, loved it so much I bought it myself.			"

												Its Terraria except you issue orders to a small group of dwarves rather than directly controlling a single character. Combat involves just marking targets and watching your dwarves do the work. You can directly control a dwarf but I only found myself doing this in specific building situations where the AI was inefficient.Pros:- Fun and fairly simple building sim with just the right amount of recipes and crafting materials.- Randomly generated worlds with lots of things to discover underground.- Great way to lose track of time.Cons:- Dumb AI, often getting themselves killed- Earning all of the recipes takes longer than I would like- The invasions (large swarms of enemies) come too often- There are only a few options for defending your baseThis game is a fun little time sink that doesn't make you think too hard.

												Ultimately I feel like this game isn't actually finished. It still feels like early access to me. So the fact that they have been working on ios and are now supporting two platforms for the game is a bit annoying.The biggest reasons why the game still feels like it's in early access/ beta are:- The Dwarf AI is still pretty bad. I find myself frustrated by it more often than not- The AI still feels clunky and not very friendly- Lack of control over dwarfs. Seemingly not enough buttons or commands to do some mass orders- Lack of ability to just tell a specific dwarf to go somewhere. Instead I need to manually move him there- Pacing of the game just feels off. Most people seem to be finishing the first level in around 9-11 hours- Game feels too easy but is just a tedius waiting game most of the time. The difficultly is in staying focused for so long to play a level- Tech tree still feels like it needs work to be more fluidTo address some of the comments: If what all of you said is true then they would have addressed the issues more before releasing and before deciding to divert attention to an iOS version.

I've played a jumbo jets worth of Craft The World now and its gotten me through some really tough times where I just needed to 'get lost in a game' until my illness got a bit more bareable.

												Very nice combination of Terraria and Lemmings. I definitely recommend, it's very casual, relaxing and enjoyable game with nice graphics, sounds and music.Cons:- AI need some work, the way how AI select which dwarf do what is crappy, very annoying thing is to order dwarves to attack enemy, seems AI just remember the destination and until dwarves reach it, they ignore anything (aka other enemies on the way, or even that enemy if he moves, dwarves just keep running ><);- Some things are not easy to discover and they definitely needs to be in tutorial with a good explanation: deconstructing, farm + trap, comfort level, professions...- AI basic control of dwarves is not the best one, it would be much better to select dwarf and give him an order (or even set of orders), portal spell is a good way to set priority (because dwarves always choose the job close to stock and portal ""move"" that point to stock in reachability).- Some predefinition are wrong or missing clear hints: level at which tree grows, at which snow falls, at which anything grows in cave. Digging one tile lower and suggenly you have no more resource (as wood or grown food) to replenish. E.g. different earth color placed by player could indicate that.- Grow rate is broken and annoying: tree may keep instantly grow at place where previous one was chopped, preventing that peace from digging, there must be a delay at given tile after removing resource from it, will it be a tree, bush, mushroom, crystal, etc.- Teleport spell should cost 1 mana and last longer, this is the only right way in the game to travel. On large map it become very annoying to move dwarves back/forth (it take too long to travel), elevator is bugged, train is not reliable and required investments (inculuding time), which not worth it.- Even after finishing game I have NO CLUE how many resources can one dwarf pick up or what 100 archery does. Tooltip and ingame help is way too casual.- Balance issue (archery is the only way to go, melee makes health management more intense, while magic is simply not reliable), swarms of enemies required escaping until tesla tech, then BAM, they are not a problem anymore at all suddenly and further gameplay become less intense (and more boring).Pros:- It's simply beauteful game with variaty of activities.- Company, while consists from only 4 maps is in fact quite a long journey: every map is different, brings something new and each map took for me 30+ hours (!) to finish.

The game has been out for years and yet it's very obvious mistakes are still not fixed, addtionally a DLC was released which on the one hand features new content, but on the other hand it contains basic things, which should be included in the game anyway (we all know that kind of DLC).About the game: You order your pack of dwarfes to do various and all kinds of quests, gathering and processing resources mostly. The processing becomes more advanced throughout the game, just as the fighting. The graphics are sweet, the music alright and theme specific. There are different biomes and there is much to explore, although it's kind of all the same, after a while (unlike Terraria). Now the bugs/annoying things:Dwarfes sometimes won't do anything, instead of carrying out pending tasks, which is really annoying.Dwarfes fail to find a way back, even if there is no obstacle hindering them (e.g. a portal is above them, on a block and they won't climb upwards in order to reach it).Dwarfes cannot attack certain foes 1v1, if the enemy is one block above -> the knock back will cancel their attack, thus a Yeti can kill a dwaf with end game armor/weapons.Sometimes Dwarfs stay in/enter a fight with low health, which results in quick death.Not bugs, but just annoying parts of the game:The crafting system: Where to start? You have to follow the technology tree and in order to build the better stuff, you have to go through a lot of redundant bad stuff, every single time you enter a new world. You always have to build a lot of furniture/vanity items, which drains your resources and you don't need that many, not - at - all. You end up with a lot of items, which you have no use for, never had.Furthermore you have to drag and drop the crafting recipes every single time you are on a new map: Once you crafted the item, the pattern is safed, but if you enter a new map, you have to do it all over again.Dwarfes have perks, like miner, cook, fisherman etc. which allows them to fulfill certain tasks faster! But when there are any number of tasks queued, dwarfes fulfil them randomly and then the fisherman ends up mining, while the miner ends up fishing -> the perk system, a core feature of the game = uselessYou cannot prioritize certain tasks, which makes it hard to keep all dwarfes busy, while at the same time have the important tasks done!Often Dwarfes won't pick up goods/resources and instead they will do -> 'nothing' again!(TL,DR)In conclusion I have to say that the game is definitly not worth 20€, though you may buy it if it's on discount. It is playable, but not for too long, it gets repetitive and the bugs will become very apparent and annoying.Highly addictive at first, but that wears off, after a while. Great for Terraria-players!			"

												The Ugly:  UI is extremely clunky where you have to manually drag and drop items to craft objectsThe Bad:  If you're not ready for the long haul, games and progression will take a long time to complete (40 hours on one area) This could be a plus if you're looking for something to really pass the time with. The Good:  Pretty fun and addicting if you are able to look past the 2 above.

								What happens when you cross an RPG, an RTS, Lemmings and Terraria? Fun! That's what happens.Craft the World has you controlling a group of Dwarves, a group that will grow over time. You begin by researching a tech tree and building a home. After that you can keep expanding on the home while exploring the world for valuable resources and treasure. Each dwarf has an inventory where you can place items such as armor, weapons and tools. Each item can be crafted with upgrades available as you progress the tech tree and more resources become available. Each dwarf also has a set of skills which can also be increased by finding skill books throughout the world.While you build, research, craft and explore, the game will send periodic waves of assaults on your new Dwarven home. Each wave is advertised with a countdown timer so you have time to build defenses, set traps and prepare.All in all, Craft the World is a completely unique and thoroughly enjoyable experience. Recommended without hesitation.			"

												Though not a Game of the Year by any means, Craft the World is a fun game that will keep you entertained in short bursts.  It can be best described as Terraria if it were an RTS where you were in charge of a tribe of dwarves instead of just your hero and, of course, there was significantly less content to discover.Your tasks in the game include gathering resources, feeding and caring for your dwarves, researching technologies, building defensive structures, and digging deeper and deeper.  Each and every dwarf is an individual with skills that can be learned and improved and equipment that can be upgraded as you develop the technology and acquire the neccessary resources t ocraft it.  Though it was exciting to acquire new technology, it was often tedious working through the previous tech to fill your research bar as you are required to craft the same three or four items many, many times.Though it is enjoyable and I believe that it is worth it at a sale price under $10, the game does grow old rather quickly and, if you're anything like me, you'll find yourself burning out toward the end of the first of five worlds.  I recommend this for fans of resource gathering and building games (Terraria/Minecraft), though, as stated earlier, it is more of an RTS as you are in charge of several dwarves at a time.			"

												Craft The World is an amazing game. It's challenging, it has depth, and allows the player to just dig in, have fun, and design their little world pretty much how they want it. I've logged 100+ hours already. My only gripe is that in spite of the best efforts of the developers, the little dwaves are frustratingly stupid. However, since the devs are aware of that fact (likely, painfully so), it's something that is very easily overlooked.			"

												Edit: Reviewed for Multiplayer Below.If you love giving orders to minions, watching them build a shelter and defend themselves, and then proceed to build an industry to survive in an unkind world you'll love this game. In all honesty, one of the very few early access games I would rate highly. Its fantastic at what it does, and it gets regular touch ups to fix bugs (at this point). I've played since it was a much earlier beta, and I can safely say the game has definitely improved over time (except maybe the font, which used to be much simpler and more elegant). The developers have also recently added multiplayer to the game, and I'm going to be blunt: its not great. Not to say its not fun, its more like its rather... unusual. Coop is fun especially if you get to spend it with friends. Versues is ... uh... rubbish? It would be fun if it wasn't so mind breakingly boring to watch I guess. Its odd, building up to fight is fun and strategic, actually fighting is a cross between trench warfare patience and looney toons violence. Its not ideal. PVP isn't really worth mentioning to be honest. I just pretend it doesn't exist. Personally would rate 8/10. Its not action packed, but for a lazy building game its ideal. Great singleplayer game, passable multiplayer game (its about average, lets be fair). Would easily bump up with the inclusion of slightly more content (for example: pets/farm animals, real risk attacks, prayer system [to get additional mana, by sending dwarves to pray], higher difficulty, more items, etc.).------------------------Edit: Would honestly rate it closer to 7 out of 10 right now. As the game has developed theres been a few things which have stood out to me as existing problems. These are as follows:1) The largest flaw the tech tree. It is extremely grindy. You essentially are forced to produce garbage that you wouldn't want or need normally, and produce a lot of it. Should be an unlock system where you produce 2 or 3 of the items in that block and it unlocks the next tier. Now not to hammer this point home too hard, but this turns what otherwise would be a fantastic building and survival game into basically a furious grind at time. You grind for resources to proceed through the tech tree. You produce mountains of things you don't want or care about. That is the reality of the tech tree in Craft the World.2) Dwarf AI is better, but still leaves something to desire. This is sorta a nuetral point honestly, I dial up the speed to 2x so I don't have to deal with it normally, and when I do its easy to control one and do it myself. Recently, the focus has been to fix it, and its gotten much better. 3) This might just be me, but the store really needs to be focused on more. Would be nice to have an ability to turn 10 mana into one gold just to get some money to replenish unobtainable materials. Lot of maps where I just simply ran out of coal for cooking or had to resort to waiting on minion waves to get money to buy basic metals because I couldn't find any. For example, the elevator requires a wheel, a bit of gold, and some other things I can't be bothered to remember. And its basically a must buy - no question about it. Building 10 of them though gets to be expensive on rare resources.			"

Early Access Review
								This game deserves to be looked at. Made by a russian developer, this game doesn't fall short.Pro:+ updates, Updates, UPDATES! This developer stands for early access, this game never laggs behind and delivers new content on a very common basis.+ Gameplay: this game is morelike, you give orders, and somedwarf will do it. If you dig for this ""indirect commanding"" this is your thing... if not... take controll of the dwarf and do it yourself.+ Progression: there are many things to achieve, enough to build and enough to kill.+ ""Settler-effect"": you can see those little dwarfs running around your monitor, and watch them doing the housework.Neutral:* Grafics: it's a matter of taste, if you love this tableski style of game, alright, if you want battlefield-4-grafic's engine... well, tough luck* Progression: You can't craft everything ""right away"" you need to, build enough of the previous items in the ""itemlist""... it's not for everyone's taste.* Sound: also matter of taste, I switched off both right away (snoring dwarfs... snoring dwarfs everywhere)Negative:- routing and object-retrieving: it's still not very polished, right now. Still some issues with the ""item-grabbing"" from far away. You can't tell a dwarf to ""pick something"" up.... he has to do it himself.- no defined jobs: While now dwarfs have skills, it's still not save to give a attack order, and believing, just melee dwarfs (or archers), will get to it. No, gueriilia-style. You can loose your best miner/workshoper, when he fails to retrait. - skills are only gained, if they know the basics. They CAN use the item (cooking-base, while no cook is around), but won't gain any skills; while a cook would get some. New skills can only be unlocked with books. There are pretty rare.Overall: Solid game, worth the money and effort. If you are not sure, wait for the next sale to come up. I recomment it fully!			"

Early Access Review
								If you want a short summary, this game isn't anything special, but it IS fun and worthwhile if you're willing to be patient. The main problem is it's relatively slow-paced and all its flaws make it SLOWER.  If you like games like Banished, this might be up your alley.  If you're looking for something where you can get a fully functional base up and running in an hour or two, pass this one up.The good:-The art style and graphics.  You can tell a lot of love and care went into making this both look and sound cute and pretty.-The overall idea.  It really does combine a lot of what made Dungeon Keeper and Terraria good.  A healthy amount of variety in what you can build and encounter, enough differences in the maps to make different environments stick out, etc. The bad:-The AI... has character.  Dwarves are prone to hesitating, double-taking and getting confused on occasion.  It's not nearly bad enough to ruin a game but don't be surprised if one or two of them die simply because they backed into a corner, then just stood there taking a beating.-The dwarves have to actually pick up items and carry them back to your stockpile after harvesting, mining, etc.  They can only carry 3-5 at a time depending on how you equip them.  This isn't a big deal at the beginning of a level, but the further away they need to go the longer it takes.  They walk at a leisurely pace, and while there IS a teleport spell to make things easier, it isn't perfect, and it costs mana, which also regenerates slowly.-The difficulty curve.  It's a halfpipe.  The vast majority of the enemies, while plenty dangerous in the very beginning, can be dispatched by a determined horde with leather armor and maces with relative ease.  What passes for 'mid tier' enemies are generally only found in the most dangerous places on a map, and the one legit endgame monster species can send even the best-prepared army running for their beds, battered and bruised.The downright ugly:-The tech tree.  In the campaign mode, you advance through the tiers and learn new recipes by crafting a set amount of components, tools, etc. in a particular category.  Sometimes it's intuitive, you need to forge iron weapons to get the knowhow for steel.  More often, and especially in the mid-late game, it's ridiculously arbitrary.  For instance, you'll have to make precious vases in order to make stone sculptures to build battlements to weave yarn to build couches to FINALLY get that shiny silver sword you've been eyeballing.  And all that decorative crap you just made?  Well, if you weren't planning on using any of it, you've just spent a ton of resources and hours of time making things that are just gonna sit in your stockpile.  Because of this, worlds that should realstically take 5 or 6 hours to complete take like 10.So would I recommend it?  Well... yes, if you've a lot of free time on your hands and a lot of patience.  I got this half-off, and frankly 8 bucks, even for a deeply flawed gem, ain't bad.			"

Warning: The following was written during Update 0.9.006. [Prior to 12/1/2013]0.9.007 Introduced key updates which show improvement and updates, including a sandbox mode.----Warning: The following was composed while the game was released in Alpha 0.1.0. IntroductionCraft The World, the beta has a great deal of potential; it highly depends how the development of the beta goes to see if I would recommend this game when its finished.There are many features of this game which are interesting; it is just that the methodologies of the features are really monotonous. GraphicsYou’ll notice that most of the games graphics look highly polished in a nice 2Dish format.InterfaceThe interface is highly cumbersome, there is only one direct toolbar to utilize things, place things, and cast spells. Otherwise you are working with a really cumbersome menu system to either equip, craft things, view objectives. With all honestly at the current stages of development it feels like much more time was spent on giving it a glossy look rather then utility of the interface; like this game was made for a tablet, or a touch device. My opinion is it that is lacks greatly in the interface and should utilize an in-game expendable interface, expand the quick slots and expend the use of shortcut keys. This happens to be one of my current gripes with the game, same with the Dwarves AI, Crafting and Materials. Sounds / MusicSound can start to be annoying after a while, which is fine. Music has a problem where it just stops playing until you either exit and resume the game or exit completely and start it again.CraftingAdvancing you have to follow these blueprint tree layouts, which means you have to build useless things a good amount of the time to advance. Within this case it would benefited from a type of freeform of crafting or trees which actually make sense. One of the examples of this is, early game you can gain access to materials for better weapons and armor. However you are unable to actually build them until you craft the other things to build them; which are completely unrelated. It should be noted that many resources are highly used however are rare or hard to get too. Which makes the early stages of the game completely unbalanced, which will be noted below.DwarvesGenerally the Dwarves have their own ideas about things, this concept is generally alright; worst part is the AIs decision making process; it is extremely hard to affect until later in the game. Currently the AI likes to run off and basically die on whims, until you are able to advance up the crafting tree; however that make take 30+ minutes to actually have the Dwarves somewhat manageable. The first 30 minutes or more of the game you should expect to lose Dwarves a good amount since you will not be able to properly equip them, or deal with the feeding system. Path finding for the Dwarves can be problematic also; the portal spell they tend to ignore. You are also able to take control of a dwarf however that does not do you much good and the interface seems to be rather ‘make shift’, at an attempt to fix their path finding from being broken.Also feeding them, you’ll find the AI will refuse to eat the same things over again; this becomes a problem since you have limited resources and must advance up the crafting tree.HousingThe housing system is interesting with the comfort concept, however it is far to easy to create problems with it, or the totems all and all stop function until the game is restarted. For the most part of the game, you will just have a wood house and walls since you have to horde materials to move up the crafting system to actually build anything good, or make it so your dwarves do not up and die. So currently do not expect your house to be really grand until you wasted a good amount of time hording materials. Housing and comfort items needs to be in their own tree of advancementMonstersThe monsters are alright, late game they still cause problems due to general AI decision failures. There is also the problem they can become overwhelmed easily. Monster waves are currently broken to the point that you can make it so your house is level with the rest of the ground with two doors and build everything downwards or upwards. By doing this the wave will either come from the left or right and you can position all your dwarves inside with bows and just fire from the inside. This will disrupt the mob from breaking the door and killing them over time.SpellsThe spells need to be in their own tree and should be completely revamped. It takes far too much time to actually make them useful, beyond the portal spell. The light spell is useless early game until you start abusing it to find materials underground. The growth spell is useless; you can just basically craft a line of flat dirt and have better results and not waste mana. Fireball is received to late in the game due to the crafting system.ConclusionHopefully while the game progresses things change before the end of beta.Work HistoryUpdated: Dec 09, 2015 @2:58pmFormattingAdded Work History.None of the complied review text was changed.

												Why, you might ask, am i not going to recommend a game that i have played for (so far) roughly 150 hours? Well, most of my complaints are similar to others who've reviewed the game, but i'll enumerate them all the same.Firstly, i found the UI to be either merely acceptable at best and cumbersome at worst on the PC. Why make me click and drag to craft things for the first time? It feels like an attempt to copy similar mechanics from similar games, but here it feels much more forced. Secondly, controlling the dwarves is extremely frustrating, as there is no way to assign particular dwarves to particular tasks or particular types of work. Designate an area to get tunneled out and it's anyone's guess which dwarf will actually get started on it. Have an enemy at the door no one's paying attention to? Well, you could click on it to tell your dwarves to attack it, but then everyone nearby will drop whatever they're doing (or carrying) and run over to attack it. Lastly, the portals feel like a failed attempt at applying some pressure to the player. In the beginning they're not bad and maybe even a bit fun in that i get to watch my dwarves beat up some undead, but eventually they're simply something that i have to sit through for several minutes so that i can get back to business. So why have i played it so much? Because i bought it and sometimes it almost scratches a particular itch i have. That and my kids enjoy it.But, overall, whenever i play it i just wish it were better.			"

								Okay! So.This is:Terraria + Dungeon Keeper + Delve Deeper/Dwarfs?! + obviously everyone's favorite Dwarf Fortress all combined in a pretty package, with a CiV-esque tech tree, Minecraft-ish crafting system and a bit of Tower Defense. What you get is the campaign and sandbox modes with adjustable difficulty settings (that includes permadeath and various world types/sizes), so there's a good amount of replayability and whatnot even after you beat the campaign. Fun fun. No story though, but who needs a story in these types of games, right? Go whack a tree. Beat some chickens down with a large stick. Pick up all sorts of useless♥♥♥♥♥♥ WHO KNOWS, YOU MIGHT NEED IT LATER. (Hint: you can disassemble items \o/) It also may look like a mobile/casual game with microtransactions due to the art style but it actually has none of that bull. Dekovir Ent. have apparently only been making Popcap-style games prior to this so it just kinda shows. It's a pretty solid game, especially for something that's still in Early Access. What a shocker, right.It's 50% off at the moment of writing (which is a STEAL), and is about to get out of early access, with new content on the way. Cool! Go get it.			"

Next 20-40 hours as your dwarfs get further away from home and the enemy waves get harder you will be suicidal*some might drop out at this point, ♥♥♥♥♥ about the AI and leave a negative review*3. Next 50-600 hours you learn how to work with dwarf AI while countering all waves If you like base building, colony style, tower defense style games you will get your money's worth out of this game, period (20 hours). If you have the patience and brain power this game could become your ""go to time sink veg out game""  for the next 500+ hours.			"

								This game is good, it feels like ants when you go underground which is awesome. I like the night setting and visbility of the underground caverns needing light. This game is worth getting. At first I was a bit frustrated with the AI and a couple of other things so left for a week, decided to give it another crack and was suprised the developer added such needed and major (imo) changes. The developer does listen and is helpful in getting this game to where it needs to be; polished. Being early access it's just gonna keep getting better. So hang in there if you like it now, I hope this game goes far. It's worth the wait. The changes with the tech tree being able to see and craft specific things more specifically feels like it opens up the game ALOT more, like now I can say this games for me. I'm crafting that because I'm want to not because I have to. I like the new AI it seems alot smoother but will keep an eye on it as it progresses. All in all, if you ever liked the game Sim Ant, or Plants vs Zombies this is for you. Have no regrets with my purchase and glad to see how things become of this already awesome game. Two thumbs up.

												268 hours into this game and I cannot recommend this game to anyone.  I really love the concept of this game and it can be a lot of fun.  Then a laundry list of glaring issues pop-up all over:-  I just noticed my Miner is chopping down trees, My Logger is cooking dinner and my Cook is mining ore.  WHAT!?-  I have to practice building furniture so I can learn to make leather armor.  I have to practice making leather armor so I can learn to make a steel sword.  Is there any rhyme or reason to this tech tree?  Why do I need Expert Cooking to be able to craft Mithril weapons and armor?-  My dwarf just killed a boar and went back home.  An hour later, another dwarf walked 3 miles to pick up the boar's meat and hide.  I also cut down a row of trees and the logs were not collected until a few hours later.  Terrible.-  My dwarf can't get out of the water and will drown if I don't take over manually.- I tried to build a bridge over the water and the dwarves, instead of building it from point A to point B,  put one at A, swam across the water to place one at B, placed a second at A, then swam across the water again to place another at B, etc, etc.-  My archer has been firing arrows into the ground at his feet for five minutes trying to hit a zombie below the archer's perch.  If he took half a step forward he could have a clear shot at the zombie's head, but he just can't seem to figure it out.  So he will just keep shooting arrows into the dirt.  Forever.-  My dwarves will climb down a sheer surface and face possible death instead of using the ladder 5 feet away simply because the perilous cliff is a slightly shorter travel distance.-  There was a zombie banging on my front door, so I wanted to send a dwarf to go dispatch the menance.  Instead, my entire army drops what they are doing and runs back home.  Sorry.  But this game is fun for about half-an-hour at a time.  It's just long enough to remember why I stopped playing it the last time.Score: 40/100Dwarf IQ:  40/100			"

												Surprisingly a very very fun game. Tons (TONS) of crap to craft to fill your settlement, lots of enemies which are just the right difficulty, and a very well thought out variety of stuff to encounter. Love this game, like Dwarf Fortress simplified!			"

												I really wanted to like this game and kept my eye on it for such a long time, but over all, it doesn't quite scratch the building/crafting itch for me. Much too grindy with a very restrictive UI and AI that isn't worth paying attention to. Not a bad game, and definitely has a lot of charm, just falls short of what it could be.			"

												First of all, if you do not enjoy games with levels that take several hours (or days at higher levels) to complete, Craft the World is not for you. However, if you are a patient player enjoying the more long-term building games, then Craft the World is a very fun and addictive game that gets you hooked for hours. You dig your tunnels, collect resources, build your stronghold and fend off attackers. Although the UI could do with some updating for the PC version, having played the game on both PC and tablet, both are very fun and easy to play.			"

												Fun game for a time, eventually I realised that the vast majority of resources in the game are non-renewable, which coupled with the lack of any sort of dismantle/scrap function, ultimately killed the game for me. Also the game seems to lack replayability since the maps are semi-samey and the gameplay doesn't change.Ultimately still enjoyable and you should try it if it's on sale but don't expect to play a single game forever, so if that's what you like to do, try something else first.Edit1: As Corsaer thankfully pointed out in the comments, there is a scrap/dismantle function. However not everything can be dismantled, Edit3: thanks to mad_myke for letting me know that any item crafted in multiples can't be scrapped.Edit2: The ai in it's current state needs work, dwarves often don't listen when ordering them to rest and won't consistently rest on their own. In addition, could use an option to have dwarves drop everything in their pack (Items theyre carrying not the ones they have equipped) when running back home to rest since a full pack slows them down significantly. Extremely frustrating to have your best dwarves die this way.			"

Early Access Review
								At first I thought it was going to be a waste of my time, now all I do is waste my time on this game! There is alot more to it then first meets the eye. Balancing deffensives, food harvesting, general material harvesting (mining and such) and much more, really keeps you busy and wanting more. It IS a slow-ish pace game to start off, and feels like you're going nowhere for the first bit untill you start getting about 10+ Dwarfs, but then it starts kicking in and you're getting things done.A lot more planning and thinking goes in to this then originally thought, take care of your resources, plan around them, or you might just find yourself in a delema and hard pressed to get out of it :)			"

Early Access Review
								Ignore for a moment the fact that this games visual presentation gives the impression of an Iphone app. Once you've set that aside, this game turned out to be a shockingly good building title in which you grow your force of dwarves from obscurity to prominence. The tech tree is enormous, there's loads of gear to craft, furniture to be whittled, and more than enough randomness to keep the gameplay tongue in cheek. I came into it expecting very little, and ended up publishing a full series through my youtube channel on it simply because I felt like Craft the World had snuck under most people's radars. I'm glad I gave it a chance, and would urge others to do so as well. In all respects it's a fun, lightweight civ management title. 8.5 / 10			"

												Appendix, 06.07.16:The new DLC is nice aswell. It delivers a few new items, stats, pets and dwarves. You don't need it but to be honest, the female dwarves are a nice addition.Also, some of the visuals changed. The dwarves were reworked and have a new appearance. Even if not every update brings major changes, you can feel that this game is constantly under construction. You can always feel the progress. I never experienced any crashes or gamebreaking bugs. And I can't wait to see how the multiplayer will evolve. This game would be the greatest fun if two people could actually play one campaign.Original review:Craft The World is what it looks like. Its full of crafting, macro- and micro-management, lovely, survival and progression. At first, the game had some serious issues. Or lets say, the AI had its issues. But its constantly updated and you will feel that it gets better with every update.The visuals look alot like any BigFishGames game. Its plain, but lovely. The gameplay itself can be pretty addicting. Many people are annoyed by the techtree progression system, but if you do not like to use it, you can just play the game in sandbox mode. It will replace the techtree with recipes that you will find throughout the game. If you do not like this either, just open the wiki website, pretty much like in minecraft, and craft anything you want. A pretty neat feature is that you can either give commands to your dwarfs or take over any of them and do the work yourself. That can be really helpful when it comes to crafting complicated structures. Or just sit back, relax and let the dwarfs do all the work.The AI, as mentioned, sometimes struggles from pathfinding problems and such. But there are many ways to get around those problems.(Sidenote: I constantly killed giants in Skyrim by simply running around an obstacle and shooting lightings at them while they were too dumb to figure out how to get to me.) There is NO perfect AI in any game. But at least the devs in CTW always try to improve your precious minions.A few weeks ago, they launched the multiplayer mode. Right now, you have to unlock this mode. You need a certain amount of dwarfs, but thats not bad. It just means, you have to advance a little in singleplayer and than can join multiplayer matches. There are pvp or coop matches. You will join a new biome and have to beat the main boss. But first, you have to dig, collect and craft. Its really nice and the unique rewards will help you improve your main biome. The only sad thing about the multiplayer is that there is no way to start right off with a friend and play on the same map ... yet.I was truly amused when I first found a Jason mask that can be worn by the dwarfs. So, its clearly visible that the devs keep adding fresh content. For an early access game, it is very stable!If you're into management, crafting without being the active part in the game, you should give it a try. And hey: There are no freaking micro-transactions in this game. Only micro-management.			"

												I have almost 500 hours played for this game.  It has some fiddly bits, but I think there is plenty to reccomend this.I'm not sure exactly how I would describe it; ""town builder lite""?  It is an excellent game for wasting a few hours then putting it away until you get the bug again.  It is great comfort food, and if you pick it up on sale price, you're getting a great deal.The main con up front:  Pathfinding can be annoying...especially as you fill the earth with miles of tunnels and shafts.  This can be alleviated by closing off old paths you don't use anymore, and putting thought into just how you develop your ""settlement"" and mining.  It is not game breaking, but it can be annoying when you want one thing done and the dwarves instead run across the map to pick up a loose stone.There is a large tech tree, which you advance by making whatever is cutting edge at the time.  There are multiple tiers of armor, tools, weapons, structural components and acrhitectural items.  Dwarves themselves have up to three skills each, so you should put thought into what skills you give them.  Skills make a big difference and also affect which dwarves get sent to do which tasks.  Between gear and skills you can make dwarves very effective if you plan them out.You can directly control one dwarf at a time, and that is very useful for speed purposes (especially since they don't have to run back to a stockpile to grab items you want them to place on the map), but in general, you set up tasks and the dwarves do for themselves.  You explore, do a LOT of mining, build, cook, fight, and perform other tasks.  Your ""goal"" is to  build a transport gate from one world to the next.  There are multiple worlds, and each provides some interesting twists.  There's a generic world, also an ice, desert, and underdark-type maps.  There are also escalating enemy attacks that portal in every (45 minutes?) that you have to prepare for.Overall, this is a nice addition to your game stable if you would like a break from more complex town sims.  I also like that graphically it is clean and attractive, which many of the popular town sims are not.			"

Everyone is tired and injured and hungry. When will this all end? Our destiny is revealed now, we have found a purpose.

												A game of Dwarfs, huh? Well, let's take a look at.First of all I must point out, that while this game is quite interesting — I had a difficult decision on whether It should be recommend or not. There are good sides to it - it's quite fun, that good ol' fun. Not ever since minecraft had digging into the mother Earth's crust to be such a delightful way to spend some time over a game. It's just like terraria, except that instead of one goof you control a whole bunch of em! And they don't cope with you well! Think of dwarf fortress, indeed like the game states, but increase the IQ of your minions by two handfuls of fairy dust, add a splash of hair balm and there you have it - Dwarf Terrarius! If you're a fan of such games — you should give this one a try.Next stop on our list is — the way you command. Just with one push of a button you send out your minions to chop, dig, fish and slaughter in your Godly appendage! Yeah, there isn't much complexity into it, as far as I got - one click and there ya go, no Blaze blue combo memory required.Step number three — crafting! The tech tree is quite big. It contain plenty of stuff that will help you turn your dwarfs into raging digging machines filled with roasted fish, salads and beer. But like the good sides of this game there are a few bad ones, especially for me, which later from just bad turned out to be extremely frustrated.The tech tree. Yes! I know, I just said that crafting was a good thing. B---u---t.... it also makes it a bad one. From the start you can see the whole tech tree, so you won't get any surprises at all. You can take a peek at what goodies you'll be getting in the end. Not to mention that a lot of tech is just an upgrade of previously used one, as with weapons, cooking or furniture - it just gets improved a bit.  Oh, and to finish the game you pretty much just need to develop all the tech tree to the end. And each time it's just the same - chop, build easy sheit and then build enough of it to get tech to make improved sheit. After one level you can pretty much turn the table and say - I beat Craft the World. Go take a sip of champagne, slice the celebration cake - you are the winner! «Can't you beat the game without improving all the tech to max?» - you'll say? No. No you cannot do that. The problem is that at the end you need mithril bars to make parts of the gate to go to another level. Not to mention that the recopies for those are dropped from an extremely deadly mob that, frankly, goes down fast if you use mithril weapons on him. But they are way back at the end of tech tree. Developing the tech tree is frustrating as well, especially on the first level. The amounts of recourses you're needed to build up the tech tree is just azz. Not sure how others play, but I found myself lacking those a lot. I just had to dig over almost the entire map to get enough to acquire some mithril and then just send out my dwarfs to murder and get murdered by the guardians of the gate recopies. That's how frustrated I was, just rushing, to finish that 12,5 hour long game which was going out at 2x speed most of the time. And I don't have anything about long games. But this game isn't long, it just psz you off by making you have to dig all the map over, chop/rechop thousands of trees to get the tech levels up and gear. And it's not necessary. Not at all. I'm not even kidding, there actually isn't much of ""world crafting"". Not at all. The first level in all its ""glory"" will be your bane. You can't send out dwarfs to ""chop trees"", you need to click every single tree (or right-click swipe em) to get those lumbers down. Then you wait for those to grow back or use magic to grow some at an instant. And then you can sit back to recover your mana for a couple of real life hours.You can't just build fun stuff, you need to develop tech, and you develop it by making useless, not needed, simply wasted items you'll barely use.  At the end my stockpile was filled with loads and loads of sheit like traps, cages, etc... which consumed a ton of resources and didn't do much favor in return, other than increasing the tech-o-meter. The lack of resources is another thing — there are certain resources that are limited on the first level that much, that it will make you pull your hair out of your nostrils due to that. Especially iron and coal... oh God... and trees.... It will make you rage. Oh, and those recourses are required by a lot. A lot of tech uses it and as we all know - you can't win without tech!In the end I decided on placing a ""don't recommend"" on it. The game is hard, but it's that very bad type of hard here. It's not difficult, but it turns the game into a routine. You just do sheit over and over most of the time, thus increasing your playtime by a whole god damn much. And it's not fun. DF was fun, because loosing was fun! In here you just don't get much fun. The game is a jack of all trades but a master of none, it took juicy parts of cult games, mixed it up with their creativity and in the end that sweet, sweet cocktail, that should go layered is just mixed up into brownish liquid. Cheers! SO currently it's not worth it to get the game, maybe later it will work out but now- go download DF and lose fun! "

												Craft the World is a mining/building game.  In it, you play a clan of Dwarves who must brave the elements and the local hostile fauna to find the Great Portal and escape... to a bigger, scarier planet where you do it all again...This is a 2D side-scroller like Terraria. Unlike Terraria, the graphics are designed to be slick and gorgeous, rather than deliberately retro. Your characters are adorbable, grumpy little Dwarves, each with a special name, look, outfit and job. You can have cooks, miners, climbers, swimmers, fishers, mages, lumberjacks, etc. They go about the world collecting resources so you can help them build their fortress/castle/home in the manner you see fit. And yes, you really ""Craft the World."" Crafting is the major goal of this game. You can play in craft-tree mode, adventure mode or sandbox mode, learning each new crafting recipe and building your repetoire of wonderous items you can make, from armor and weapons, decorative building blocks, furniture, foods, potions all the way up to a Tesla device to help fight off hordes of rampaging skeletons (or mummies, or yetis... or goblins...)You can equip each Dwarf with items you have them craft, bettering their skills for their jobs, and protecting them from baddies. You can also take control of an individual Dwarf to speed up the building process if you like. There are also several magic spells you can use to help out your merry band of Dwarves, such as magic portals, fireballs, magic imps who will help them carry resources back to the stockpile, and more. The maps range from small/med/large (sort of like Terraria.)The first time I played the game I said to myself ""this is only in BETA?"" It looked finished to me. Then Dekovir, the creators, kept on adding new content... tweaking AIs, finding and fixing glitches... It's a blast, and I highly recommend it.Gameplay - 7.5/10Visuals - 8/10Sound - 6/10Replay Value - 10/10			"

												Very good game all around & is pretty much what youd expect & hope for from a game like this & is mostly what youd expect from watching the store vids of it.  Wont bother going into great detail on all the pros/cons as many other reviews nail it pretty well.I will say in brief summary that for what this game does & is sposed to be & advertises itself as ( excluding MP ), it does it very well & is one of those very actual few games out of the vast majority that does manage to pull it all together very nicely & makes the single player quite enjoyable & fun to play & gives you that worthwhile feeling.The 2 main cons I can think of that to me are really worth mentioning are that yes; the game does kinda get a bit stale & repetitive after completing one level & then jumping into the next level.  Different environments but basically like 90% the exact same thing as previous levels; really just feels like starting over from scratch & rebuilding & redoing everything all over again, just to complete that level & once again do it all over again on the next level & so on.  Not quite as bland as that may sound, but for me, wasnt enough for me to want to keep progressing through each level.Which brings up the 2nd most prevalent con to this game.  When there was talk about MP being added, myself & many others were very interested & really looking forward to the exciting new life that MP would breath into this already good but somewhat repetitive & eventually boring single player game...but then it happened...this games version of MP was released & ended up disappointing a great many players & causing quite a bit of upset & disappointment.  The MP that was added was not what most of us were waiting for & wanting & expecting & hoping for & instead was made so that you have to play single player a while & then can shortly thereafter join up with another random player from their own single player campaign & then play one of a few random, isolated solo mission maps together, completely outside & separate from your own individual main campaign maps...While this version of MP was definitely somewhat unique & original, it felt like & still feels like, that should have really just been added after, & only after, Real proper online MP coop campaign/sandbox mode was put into place first.  But this is the MP we ended up with & to date, real MP has not been added & may not ever be.  Its understandable that the devs designed this game to be single player focused from the beginning & not coded from the ground up to easily be real MP friendly, but its still a shame & to me will always be a bit of a blemish, on an otherwise pretty solid & well made, fun game to play.  Theres been a few improvements to the originally introduced version of this games version of MP from what Ive read, but to me & a lot of others, just still isnt enough to make me care about it, as it just isnt the MP that many of us really wanted for this game.That all being said, this is still a pretty solid, pretty good game & most people cant go wrong with this game & should still give most people many hours of enjoyment from the single player end of things, for those that like games like this to begin with.  Despite the couple of main flaws, this game still does a lot of other things quite right.........for single player mode anyways...also seems to be quite a few posts about bugs & other related issues from some people, but it seems maybe those are mostly isolated issues for a select few people out of the vast majority.  Out of the 100+ hours, I cant recall a single game breaking issue or even small bug that occurred that even made me think twice about it or ever took away from the gameplay experience.  All important single player gameplay aspects combined scorewise; Good solid 8/10 Id say.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has restored my faith in Early Access / paid beta releases, so Godus, FortressCraft, Space Engineers, Castle Story and Kinetic Void take note: this is how it's done and you are shamed by it - if you are asking for money, try giving people a game like this one, that is actually playable. Although not fully featured yet, Craft the World is highly polished with excellent music, character design and attention to detail. Gameplay is highly addictive - if you like RTS or other micromanagement games but thought Terraria was a steaming pile of pants, you'll find that this game is what you were missing. My only wish is that it were voxel-based. Craft the World 2?			"

												A simple yet fun game, you control a horde of dwarves in a randomly generated world gathering supplies and building stuff.  Unlike games like Terraria and Starbound, you don't gather the supplies or fight yourself.  Instead, you instruct the dwarves to do everything, which they may or may not do at their leisure.  I've often had them gathering something only for them to stop doing so after making their first run back tot he stockpiles only to stand around and wait for you to give them another command when there are still things to be gathered.  Even so, it's not often enough that it's a major issue as much as a minor annoyance.  There's a distinct lack in the game telling you how to accomplish things, however.  In the first mission, the game tells you to make a totem and build a home, but doesn't tell you that you have to reach level 4 first to do so and it will just give you one.			"

												This game is awsome in the first hour than you start to realize the glitches and you get more and more disappointed. After a few hours in the game I became so frustrated I had to quit. Main reason is the AI. Your dwarfs are SOOO F...ING DUMB. If they mine a block usually they don't mine the neighbouring ones just standing there like a huge pile s..t looking their legs or something and waiting for another dwarf to do the job. Can't prioritise job types nor individual works so you just have to wait to the ""important"" stuff to get finished before the job you would like to be completed. I can't stress enough how frustrating it is. It's just needlessly time consuming. The inventory and qiuckbar system is complicated to use, should be a lot more user friendly. And so on so forth...Playing this game is like doing math, you have to be enthusiastic to enjoy it otherwise it's slow and painful.Shame, 'cause it could be a good game.			"

												This is my ""Test of Time"" nominee, when the newest title stops holding my attention or I just want to chill and not spend a lot of time thinkning or reacting I play this.  You tell the dwarves what to do and they do it at their own pace but you can select and dwarf and take direct control when you want something done now or done a certain way.  Every night the zombies attack and every 45 minutes there's a blood moon and LOTS of zombies attack.  During the day you mine and craft and build a bigger shelter and upgrade your wares.  Each time you level up you gain a new dwarf and can customize each build individually to select their crafting skills and combat styles.  It's a really fun game and they update it all the time.			"

												I have sunk Hours into this game and I love it. The Dwarfs do need some tuning and the last level with the big deity is driving me nuts because im spending half of everything to please him and then not much left for me cause having to fight the goblins underground and the ones trying to break in. This is one of my top Favorite games. I have the exp and the Owlcats and Froglisks are adorable. I do like sandbox mode but we do need a bit more of a way to level better after we get a few levels on us. But as for deity i do love the idea that he gives gifts if he is pleased but i just wish there was a list we could  follow or some guidelines on what to give to get what we would like from him. I need iron desperately and it would be nice if i know how to please him enough to get it. I do wish there were more worlds or more to do after you finish the last campaign and everything. I am on the last level and im gonna be sad its over, i really would love to see more from this game. Its great as it is but it has so much potential to be really spectacular. I would get more stuff from the store for this game if there was another expansion or add on. Keep up the great work. I wish more games were like this.			"

												I picked this up on a huge discount during the summer sale and really got my money's worth. In fact, I find it addictive to the point where I should probably uninstall it and get some stuff done... nah. I've only played one, abortive, multiplayer game-- the other person quit. So this review is based on single player.Long story short? It's a simplified Dwarf Fortress with a big dose of cute. Plus it has a campaign.It's hard to put my finger on why I like Craft the World so much. I guess it's largely because the progression of the tech tree is well balanced so there's always something not far off to work toward, and usually on multiple paths. The tech tree itself is nothing special-- in fact, it's littered with useless items I only craft to level up-- but well balanced so that by the time I need some materials for the next tech, I've either already stocked it or it's near to hand.The campaign is a series of worlds, and so far I've played grass, snow, desert, and ""underground"", although for some reason it gets rain. The successive worlds aren't exactly more challenging in themselves, but the monsters are more deadly. You seek out portal pieces, which are guarded by fairly powerful creatures, and once you go through the portal to the next world, that's that for the one you just played, so far as I can tell, you're on to the next one.The game itself is not challenging, either, following the trend of recent games that have challenging moments but are difficult (or impossible) to actually lose. I'm not even sure if Craft the World has a loss condition. Every so often waves of enemies, individually weak but deadly in a pack, will assault your settlement. While I've seen images of impressive defenses posted by players, it's easier to just build walls several blocks thick and ignore the waves or treat them as a way to gain experience (the dwarves have skills like warrior and archer, among others, that increase through use) by picking off stragglers, aided by the handy Portal spell.I do lose individual dwarves, though. Sometimes I have no clue how difficult a particular monster will be and it can kill with two or three attacks. The dwarves themselves are pretty dumb-- other player reviews deride this as bad AI but I consider it to be flavor-- and will sometimes fall in lava or ignore an order to retreat. A replacement soon appears, though, so all that's really lost is experience and possibly equipment.There's a few things I wish were different about the game, although I wouldn't call them negatives to the game itself exactly. For one thing, the maps could be smaller. I'm pretty methodical, if sloppy, and it takes many hours to clear a map in campaign mode. The community could be stronger, too. For example, the game's wiki is sketchy. Of course, it's a fairly simple game, so you don't need a manual, but the game has hotkeys and so far as I can tell, doesn't bother to tell you about them. It would be nice if the opening quests in a new world in campaign were varied. It's been cut down a tree, dig a tunnel, complete the shelter, etc., same thing each time.I've gone on too long, especially as I rarely bother reading long reviews myself. I just wanted to get my thoughts down about this game. Also, just felt that some reviews harp on bugs an awful lot when I haven't noticed any definite ones. The game is certainly stable.			"

												This is a good colony simulation game. It is not the ultimate simulation dream and is far from being flawless in terms of bugs and technical performace but still it is a solid game. My only complain is the amount of grinding getting on the way every time you want to start a new map. I just can't imagine a good reason behind the tech tree design other that forcing the player to see all the content. It is kind of a questionable choice but again every developer does whatever he/she think is best for his/her audience. I do think it was a poor desition to have such a intrincated tech tree but again that's just my opinion. The game is solid give it a try you may have a great time.			"

												I like this game, however, there is only 3 levels to sandbox mode.  After playing 3 levels, I was stunned to find out that I was finished.  The developers need to spend much more time developing the Sandbox mode and worry about ""multiplayer"" later.   Appart from having only 3 levels total, there are pathfinding issues, balance issues, a non-existent story-line, the tech-tree (although kinda cool) doesn't flow well (especially on level 3).   Overall great concept and great graphics, but because the developers have been side tracked, this game is missing it's spot light and will soon be doomed.  People will move on to other games and by the time the developers figure this out, their game will be dated and eclipsed by a smarter one.  So sad.			"

												This game is insanely addictive. So much so it should come with a warning label.It's basically a side-view version of A Game of Dwarves. It's very easy to get into, and once you do your creativity can just run wild as you harvest, craft, dig out or surface build tunnels and rooms at your own pace. What you want to do and how you want to go about things are totally up the player.Lots of different resources, buried treasure and small caverns. Cooking, fishing, mining, logging, farming...pretty much a crafter heaven. It has optional quest-related goals that you'd eventually probably be doing anyway, so you're never really taken out of your comfort zone when it comes to your play style.Four different worlds, involved developers...I could go on....but I want to get back to playing so I'll end it here. Did I mention how addictive it was....?Honestly, if you're into crafting, world-building, exploring, playing at your own pace then you should already be clicking the Buy button on this gem.			"

												Craft The World is a funny, little game, easily swallowing up some hours of your life. It is easy, even though the AI doesn't always follow your intentions as in controlling your dwarves.In short: It is your interactive antfarm, and you don't even have to watch out to not knock it over.

								Really addicting game where you are tasked with helping (via giving commands, casting spells, etc) dwarves build and maintain a base while mining for minerals, crafting items, exploring the underground, and fighting off the waves of the undead (and goblins, but mostly undead) that lay seige to you every 45 minutes. Nearly everything is done through indirect control. You mark where to dig, and where to place items, tell them what to craft, who to attack - as of now (I should state I'm writing this while the game is still in early access/beta. So things are still being added and tweaked and balanced and etc) there are a few things you are more actively doing - during bigger fights if your dwarves health gets low they'll run away, at a point you'll be able to tell them to craft health potions. Right now, it seems the only way to use them is by you using them on the appropriate dwarf when their health is getting low. You also have a few items you can place and remove without the dwarves doing it for you - the main item that you'll be using in this manner is scaffolding that you can place to help the dwarves climb up something that would be hard to climb on their own and you only need a temporary item for them to use to climb. Portable ladders...) Er, anyway, the description of the game says it's inspired by Dungeon Keeper, Dwarf Fortress, and Terraria. I can see the Terraria inspiration, but the gameplay is not like Terraria at all. I'm pointing that out because Ive seen some comments on this  game lamenting (whining) about another Terraria clone and the ways that Terraria was an inspiration to the developers of this game are not ways that led to a clone. I would say the graphic style and some of the mechanics for what defines a home are the big things that seem Terraria inspired. Anyway, it's really fun and I can't wait to see what each update will bring! So if you like buildy, crafty, strategy, dwarfy, explory, games then I totally recommend this game. And I would even recommend it in general since it feels like it's a game that is not so heavy (*cough Dwarf Fortress cough*) that you have to be hardcore about the style of game to get into it. In short, RECOMMENDED. *imagine a loud kind of stamp hitting a document sound...like ... I don't know, it seems like it's used a lot in crime shows and court shows. USE YOUR IMAGINATION*			"

												Been playing this game for awhile, really enjoyed it at first though there was quite a learning curve figuring out how to get past the first world in campaign mode.  Not a bad thing though, made it feel very rewarding when I did get the hang of things and stopped getting overrun by monsters before getting far enough.But now that I've put some hours into it and gotten to later stages in the game it's quickly becoming less enjoyable as the increase in difficulty reallly brings out some major flaws in the game that have been mentioned before, but I'll say it again.  The UI really needs work.  And the dwarves AI needs major work.  I don't know how many times I've gotten to the point of screaming obscenities at my monitor because no matter what I do the stupid dwarves just act like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and run straight to their death, without even being told to.  Not to mention how often they don't do what you want them to, run around in circles or go way over to the other end of the map for seemingly no reason (path finding is horrendous) and seem to build things in random order, to the point of where you told them to build something important 10 minutes ago but all they want to do is build stupid crap that you end up cancelling because they won't do what you already told them to do previously.  Gets to the point where you feel like you have to only give them one build job at a time if you want them to get done in proper order, which makes the whole process way more tedious and time consuming than it should be. If you want to build a ceiling to a new building or new upper floor of one you literally have to take manual control of a dwarf and build each block yourself or it will never get done.  They can't seem to figure out how to build one block, and then the next, and then the next in a series.  They instead just build one and then give up because they can't get to the one way out in the middle or somewhere instead of THE ONE RIGHT NEXT TO THEM.  DUH.Extremely frustrating, especially when little things like this really start to make the difference between life and death in later levels.  Really fun game otherwise, but really needs a lot of work on these issues before I'll continue playing it any more.I get that the developers probably want to keep adding more content to the game in order to keep people interested and make it more appealing to new players, but I feel like their priorities are a bit off.  Multiplayer, quite frankly, seems pretty pointless and poorly executed.  You're in the middle of a level, got a bunch of dwarves and everything, then you open a portal... to an entirely different level, where you have different dwarves and start out from scratch again and can't even go back and forth between this entirely new game and the one you were just playing.  At least, not until you finish this entirely new level which takes so long you don't even remember where you left off in the last one, and in the end you're not even left with much to show for it as you can't really take much of the stuff you got back with you. And frankly I think they should be more focused on trying to make the exisiting game better, fix the major AI issues and the like before worrying about adding extraneous features like this ""multiplayer"" which doesn't even seem to have much of a purpose to begin with.

												I bought that game for the multiplayer, sadly that mode is really bad. First you have to play solo and build something that allow you to play multiplayer, the idea looks pretty nice. Then you appear in a multiplayer world with your buddy, first off, theses are only underground maps. then you have the vision of your buddy that you have to kill. in between each bases their are some monsters, but there is no monster waves, you cant really play with your mate. The way they created the multiplayer mode turn me off quickly. As i mentionned before, i bought that game to play with my friend.And for a solo game i would highly recommend Gnomoria instead of that game.			"

								I thought it was surprisingly good. at first, I thought ""egh... another one of these huh?"" the good reviews though seemed to work in favor of the game, so seeing as it was on sale I grabbed it. what ensued was four hours of exploring a decent new game and gawking at what looks like some fairly ""bleh"" graphics from a distance, but are actually rather nice graphics when you actually look at them up close. the update log for the game shows updates being a fairly regular thing, meaning fixes for bugs (I only saw one bug and that one crashed the game) and new content could be always just around the corner. the game is also surprisingly well polished for an early release game. in my mind I see the devs saying ""yeah, its good as it is, but it can be better.""

												This game had a lot of potential to be great, but it has way too many shortcomings for its own good and it detracts from the rest of the game.You control dwarves that do everything for you, and all you do is tell them what to do (and craft items for them). The AI for the dwarves are absolutely terrible, the amount of dwarves I've lost because they stood there not attacking an enemy is insane, and I'll tell them to go dig out a hole here or place a wall there and they just stand there doing nothing for an indefinite amount of time.   When the game is organized about having little AI creatures do what you want, the AI needs to be smart enough to perform those tasks. For the tasks, even building a structure is very difficult because of the AI, and even then they only have a small range of placement so you're needing to construct and deconstruct ladders and platforms that they will hopefully place and remove in an orderly fashion so you can actually build something.  The rest of the game is organized around mining and chopping wood for materials, gathering food for your dwarves, and keeping them alive to fight the boss underground and beat the level, unlocking the next world which is bigger and harder.  Managing the dwarves can be a pain and with a clunky and slow crafting system, outfitting your dwarves is an obnoxious task on its own since they have nearly no defining characteristics and only small titles on their character page, and needing to craft more tools for every new dwarf you get just gets tedius after a while due to the need to fight the AI to get more materials (and rarer ones at that as you progress) to properly outfit your tiny army so they can survive their own stupidity, let alone the actual dangers of the world.If they fixed the AI and made it responsive this game could instantly become a game worth your time, but with fighting the AI, relying on random drops for many items, a very odd money system, and just overall clunkyness, you're better off finding another game that plays similar.

												The 2-d world and resource harvesting mechanics are very much like Terraria, but having a colony of dwarves instead of a solo adventurer means it also fills the void left in my gaming life by Towns dying in a fire. Some bits of the tech tree are not terribly intuitive (why do I need to learn weaving before I can make steel armor?) but my guess is they're laid out where they are so that you can't just ignore half the tree until you've built a complete powerhouse dwarf crew who are threatened by nothing, and then finish everything else at your leisure. The rain mechanic is really nicely executed, though you can accidentally drown your entire sheep farm if you lay things out wrong, and the difficulty of the monster waves ramps up at a pretty good pace.It made my old computer (a 2009 MacBook) crash occasionally if I was trying to run other programs simultaneously, but that was definitely a function of hitting obsolete hardware limits. Bought computer made in this decade, no longer have crash issues.48 hours in this game in the last two weeks and I'm jonesing for more. I really like that the campaign mode gives you a series of goals to accomplish (and then re-accomplish in the next world), because completely sandbox games tend to lose me after a while. I get a base built and stable and equip my guys and... then what? Well, start over, I guess. Campaign mode makes starting over into progress. The resource limitations in the ice world are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but it's livable and gives you all the more motivation to get the portal rebuilt and get the hell out of there.The thing I'd most like to see in future releases is the ability to set standing orders so my dwarves have tasks they will return to any time a condition is (not) met: when food in inventory drops below 10, grill meat. When wool in inventory drops below 5, shear sheep/llama. Lower on my priority list but also good would be an option between the current ""stay in the shelter"" and ""go wherever"" modes for the dwarves' movement range -- either a defined distance they could forage outside or a set of markers you could place to limit how far they explore, so you don't have lone dwarves trudging off to the end of the map and getting lost because there's a ball of dirt to pick up somewhere.Good stuff, though. Totally glad I bought it.			"

But unlike terraria you dont control a single person. you kinda boss around the dwarves and if you truely want to, you can even take control of one if you want. Some people on the forums have complianed about bugs, crashes, not beenable to start it. but sense ive owned this game(i bought it last march) i havent had any crashes or bugs. the only problem i have had, is that the dwarves dont always take the best route. but i think it is TOTALLY worth the &15 there asking right now 9.5/10 very addicting and different than most games out there			"

The co-op and PvP in this game are basically like an instance/deathmatch.  You have 1 goal, succeed, and the game ends, both players are kicked back to their own single player worlds.

								This is a great game! I played this alot and i never get tired of playing it. But everything cannot be perfect... I´ve found to flaws with the game this far. The thing is the AI is not always as you would like it be (it´s a bit stupid) and becouse of that the second flaw comes, the dwarwes die easily of enviromental things when there are other ways...  So lets think that youre favorite dwarf goes to colloct some stone you found in some tunnel you dug. and then u put up a portal and what do he do? He travels over the water instead and drown, so then the resources and next dwarf comes and get it and you have to stop it and use the imp spell or the collect spell that transport the items to your stockpile and you loose a dwarf for nothing. How will you get a new dwarf like that? You wonder later, and the thing is you have to wait until a dwarf with the right skill comes and then you need two new books to give the dwarf the skills you wanted it to have. But that can take a long time. So becouse of the not so smart AI it comes a second flaw. You cannot replace skills. Overall it dont ruin the game experiance that much and i would give it a 8,5/10.

												DLC seems to be this game's answer to endemic issues with the game, such as gameplay that slows down exponentially and resource choking that leaves the player eager to not craft anything other than what is absolutely required for progression. This really feels, in many ways, not least of which its design, like it should have been a 4.99 Tablet Game, not an 18.99 game with 8.98 worth of DLC that adds so much less than 1/4 of the game's original content or functionality let alone half.Avoid this unless you're so into this kind of management/base building game; the kind of person who buys twenty DLCs for Train Simulator kind of dedication.  It's average amongst its peers but its DLCs feel more like the kind of updates that would be sold add-on to a free-to-play game, rather than a Feature Product build for PC.Edit: Oh wait, it IS a 4.99 tablet game!  Right there on the App store! Steer clear of this price gouging.			"

												Good game - some very interesting ideas and combination of gameplay elements - I would describe it as a weird cross of Dungeon Keeper with Settlers and Mincraft. For me the biggest issue was with the controls, those are not very good and it is getting in a way of the experience in the long run - the more items you can craft. I do not understand some limitations that the UI has was the UI designer frozen in time for the last 10 years?Same goes for Dwarf AI, dumber then the Lemmings. They drop everything they carry to go help another one fighting like miles away, no chance to ever reach him before the fight is over. Don't even get me talking about constantly dropping from the ladder why trying to attack monsters. The command queue is also a mystery for me, orders are often not executed in order but more at random.As with some other games it is a shame that you do not have neutral score you can give. I spend 10 exciting hours completely glamored by the game, however, issues with controls and dwarfs AI eventually just overwhelmed the fun after 14th hour of gameplay. I normaly expect more playtime - before the game stops being any fun - from a sandbox type game so I'll be going with the negative review this time around.			"

 Do you want to Craft The World? TOO BAD. Avoid this ""game"" like the plague. From the videos and screenshots it looks like a mix of Terraria and user-friendly Dwarf Fortress. It's not.This is a mobile game masquerading as a desktop game. There is no content here past ""leveling up"" and that feels like a hollow and pointless experience.Probably the worst part of this whole game is the ""Tech Tree"" which seems like it would be a feature. Instead it's your chains. Do you want to craft a single wood helmet? Do you have the wood? yes? TOO BAD. Instead first you have to craft  5 ladders first because.... you wouldn't know how to make a helmet without first making ladders. You want a wooden door? Do you have all the required materials for it? yes? WELL TOO BAD you still have to craft 10 ""Locks"" first. I'm not kidding. This ruins the game as even if I have the materials for things I can't craft them until way later because of the tech tree. The prerequisites for items don't even make sense.The one upside of this game is that it's fairly well polished. It's pretty, has decent music, and runs smoothly. Unfortunately the downside is pretty much everything else. Save yourself the money and more importantly those hours of your life that you cannot get back. Avoid this game.			"

LIke Dungeon Keeper and Terraria had a baby that then had its way with a Lemming, and this game is the result.Then there is that one loading screen, in which one dwarf is staring lovingly at the dwarf in the foreground.  Its like the poster for some Dwarf-centric LGBT Rom-Com.Homoerotic dwarves aside, i love this game.  It has quickly earned a spot next Civilization, Minecraft, and Heroes of Broken Land in my list of games to play when I'm bored or multi-tasking.  I laugh as my wee bearded barbarians go chasing sheep, or like their Lemming forebearers, go plunging heedlessly off of high cliffs because taking the ladder two blocks behind them would have been to easy and not given them a concussion.   And I swear, every Ori i get loves to run the wrong way away from monsters, and ends getting butchered by the swarm of monsters between him and the shelter.Seriously, Ori, stop making eyes at Blayne and get back to work.

												This is a fun and relaxing game.  You guide a small clan of dwarves through a crafting tech tree and you guide their search for all the materials for crafting via mining, hunting, etc.. There is a timer for monster attacks....and their are random monsters.  I'm basing these comments on having played only the first world.  Starting the second world now.  There isn't any real tutorial so I recommend looking a guide briefly to help avoid some of the tediousness ....Some tips....- you can disassemble any item once you have better tech- you can place portals to transport your dwarves directly home- later you can use imps to transport raw materials home- you can SPEED UP THE GAME during slow times, just click on clock in upper right corner of the screen- While holding a block, you can click on an already placed block to change it's orientation- you can craft coal and iron etc..later in the tech tree "

								My Dwarves are like a second family, an extremely dysfunctional and disobedient family but we still pull together when portals from the underworld open on our front door step and demonic spawn comes to run us all through, then we go back to being dysfunctional.It's a very simple world builder with RPG elements, I really wish though that there was another way to get Dwarves other than levelling up, it feels really really really slow like that.You'll never have enough Dwarves :/			"

												OK guys, I have played the first level of this game for 20 hours, now I am through, and I am through with the game.First of all, it is a sandbox game, where you can dig deep in the dungeon, build your cave or castle for the dwarfs and watch them poorly perform and managing themselves. The good things: - nice graphics, cute dwarfs, nice user interfaceThe bad things: - the game machanics suck: you mainly select where to dig, what to build etc. and the dwarfs walk along and do it, very very slowly. I had to play the game at 2x speed, which is available, a 10x speed would be better. - No goal: Maybe I do not get it, but as you dig along, you find resources, you expand the tech tree just to get to the good stuff, and then all the ground is digged up, and that's it. The only thing that you can reach is: - attention spoiler - 5 parts to build the exit portal, so that you can leave the level. Really. Then you can start again to work 20 hours on a new level. - The AI is bad. So you have to do the work: The dwarfs are stupid. If they clear a bridge, they start with the first two elements and fall then to the ground. When they should dig up a place, they start with the lowest blocks and then they cannot climb anymore up to clear the higher blocks. Come on. I have then to micromanage = control a single dwarf to do it properly. Lots of micromanagement needed to make up for the extremely slow speed of the dwarfs.- Whats the point for the enemies? In the night and even during the day, sometimes bad guys visit the dwarfs. They always win, if you did not prepare with either lots of traps, wood cannons and such. Or you just build a 4 stone thick layer  on the ground and keep your dwarfs below that, the bad guys remain above. - No story, no reward for anything you do, a dissapointing end to the level.- Unnecessary tech tree: In order to build complex set of things you have to construct a specific amount of the simpler sets of things. So in order to get to the mithril weapon set, you have to build sufficient wall decorations. Right? Makes sense? No. At the end, I had a pile of crap built that remained in the stash and was never used. If I would have wanted to decorate nice houses I would play with a doll house. The dwarfs might be happy or not, it does not make a difference.So at the end: If you like sloooow games, with sloooow characters acting like idots, this is a game for you. If you like to decorate sweet cute houses, this is a game for you. If you like to micromanage slooow characters without any reward, this is a game for you! I rather play something entertaining.			"

												I've sunk a good amount of time into this so far, since it was in early access. This game tackles many different ideas at once to great effect. It's got the 2D sidescrolling world of Terraria, above ground and below ground, but not as vast in size. It's got the god-game system of Dungeon Keeper, in which you can give orders to your dwarves and have them go about the business of accomplishing it (or take direct control of one of them specifically, also like Dungeon Keeper). And you've got the fortress building aspect of...well...Dwarf Fortress. This is one of those interesting games where starting out can be brutal, especially for a new player, but gets easier as you go, as opposed to other games that start small and scale in difficulty. But that's really one of its strong points, as it has you learning on your toes and makes you think about your next move and how you spend your resources. But that doesn't mean it'll let you off easy, even after you've learned the ropes.Like most sandbox games, CtW gives you time to build up, and time to be wary. Daytime offers a peaceful chance to work and get things done, while night brings the potential of undead raids on your treasured home. Every 50 minutes of real time play, a portal raid will begin to truly test whether you've prepared properly, or not. And they keep getting harder as well, to force you to think faster and beat the level to ultimately survive. The crafting is smooth and easy to manage, the graphics are bright and colorful (never really feeling dull thankfully), and the fighting system isn't complicated while still offering plenty of room for strategy to aid the dwarves. Seriously, you'll think of plenty of tricks and traps to make the deadly portal raids easier as you go along, and coming up with said strategies is a large part of the fun. You'll see some people complain no doubt about resource shortages in the late game, but resource management is important, and it isn't a game problem, it's the players fault for wasting items. This isn't just a sandbox game. It's a multitude of genres at once. It's a sandbox-fort building-management-strategy-survival game with three worlds each between 20-40 hours a piece. It's not about making a beautiful world like Minecraft or Terraria (though you'll love building your fort/home) it's about the brutal survival of moving your dwarves to the next world, towards (what they hope) will be their new home in escaping an undead menace. 10/10 Easily one of the top games of 2014. You'll start playing and look to realize in horror that you've played for hours on end and it's time to sleep. But you won't sleep.			"

												This game is extremely addictive and very good. It's a sandbox game similar to Terraria, yet it certainly remains distinct. The game looks very beautiful. And, it's fun. It's fun to control all of these dwarves, but it can be like trying to herd cats at times. You have the option of controlling one dwarf, while ordering the others about, or you can take an overview of the map, and tell them all what to do. The AI is pretty good, and they usually do a great job going where you tell them to, and taking the best routes. They're very responsive too. There are a ton of things to craft and learn how to build, along with a ton of materials to discover. The enemies can be very dangerous at times ( e.g. during waves). The controls are not very intuitive at first, but once you catch on it's pretty easy.			"

Dwarves, check. Fortress, check. Stupidity, check. Deaths and hilarity, check. Nice graphics.. wait what?Craft the World is for want of a better term ""My first Dwarf Fortress"". It's Dwarf Fortress made accessible to the market, and it's about time someone actually got around to -doing- this. Initially released in Early Access, this title has been something of a rough gem that has, over time steadily been sanded and milled into a shining diamond, just waiting to be plucked from the dark underdepths by grubby, stubby hands and long, curly beards.All of the dwarves, none of the terrifying ASCIIDwarf Fortress is a very ""marmite"" game, because in part it's one of those games that requires the kind of in depth understanding of all the systems and sub-systems that go into it that usually come along with multi year degree courses. Not so in Craft the World, no, whilst the Dwarves do exhibit elemental stupidity in buckets, much like their DF cousins, they are quite able to follow simple instructions and they are able to manage their tasks in a vaguely dwarfish manner. Those skilled in their jobs will prioritise things accordingly, and the dwarves with weapons will actually kill things, as opposed to stabbing themselves in the foot. There's none of this ""Fey mood"" malarky either, thank dieties. Instead you'll be dealing with nightfall bringing undead knocking at your door and ghosts who wreak havoc with your stockpiles.A rich and engaging system that will have you whittling away for hoursWhilst the tech tree was ""servicable"" to begin with, now it's a monolithic thing that requires time and effort to unpick, with dwarves being forced to live in fairly basic digs with leafy beds before they are given homes suited to their dwarfly status. The game systems now support farming, fishing, and a full complement of other activities, so provided you can keep your dwarves alive, you can eventually have a busy, thriving little fortress, able to stand up to the worst that the world throws at you. Well, most of the time...Throw in trading with the locals when you acquire precious gold coins, skill books which teach your dwarves such vital skills such as how to climb without plummeting to their doom and a simple RPG-lite system of skill building and you've a recipe for quite entertaining gameplay. It may not have the absolute depth of Dwarf Fortress, but it certainly will slake the thirst of anyone wanting to get -into- the DF genre, and in that, it serves as an excellent introduction.Dawwwwh, they're so cute...The graphical style is well thought out, opting for a very cartoonish and well furnished design that uses sweeping colourful flourishes and a wide palette, ensuring that there's always something interesting going on, and that the dwarven holdings -look- the part. Furniture goes from being something that shames you to being something that shines. Enemies range from comical looking skeletons to nasty beholders and trolls and goblins, all well thought out and whilst not perhaps going to win awards for animation, they -do- look well designed and everything in the world is consistent.The sound? Well. I'll be diplomatic. If I hear dwarves snoring one more time... *eyetwitch*Closing thoughts.It's ""My First Dwarf Fortress"", and it's a very good place to start, there's been other efforts, and those have done pretty badly in comparison, this one however nails the mark, striking a good balance between being accessible to the newcomer yet offering enough of a challenge to keep experienced players at the whetstone long enough that they should feel suitably stretched out enough to consider graduating to the 'real' Dwarf Fortress, if that so pleases them.Verdict : Recommended - Especially to fans of Dwarf Fortress, or to people looking to get into the DF genre.Writer and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

												I really wanted to like this game , the concept was good . But there are just too many issues that are just irritating about this aswell.  Here are just a few points. #1 COMBAT : Getting knocked around by a starting level zombie every single time it hits a stout heavily armored dwarf in steel/Silver/MITHRIL armor. IS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ . I would understand if this happened without any gear on . But its 100% all the time knock back. #2 The HOARD : The undead zerg that attacks your base every 45 minuts gets out of hand the longer you play a level making it almost impossible to enjoy the game when all you want to do is max a level before moving on . Making the game less about enjoying the core of the game and more about HURRY UP AND GET WHAT YOU NEED TO ESCAPE.#3 Combat AI : They are mentally handicapped . Having one dwarf charge into a group of 12+ mobs just because he is melee only to have him hit one mob and get juggled around due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ knockback system in the game is just beyond stupid.#4 NO SHIELDS : You can make alllllll this special gear . Auto turrets (that barely work) LIGHTNING TOWERS , TRAPS  but you CAN""T strap some wood together and make a SHIELD....... that logic .#5 Can't SELL : I don't know but the idea that you can only buy stuff from a store ....... kind of stupid also . I guess the devs never heard of a bartering system . Later on you ammount masses of USELESS items ......that just sit there .#6 Crafting Tree : The crafting tree is ok , but it lacks a lot of common sense . As some of the most BASIC ideas such as burning wood to make coal and farming for example are among some of the highest tier crafts .All in all the game needs a decent ammount of work and balancing at this time . So it's not worth the price for the overall aggrivation it causes .			"

Early Access Review
								My main concern with Early Access games is that it's sometimes hard to tell if you're getting something in a close to release quality or if you're going to buy a game that has another 2 years of development before it's close to worthwhile. While there is currently only one level available, with some minor glitches, it is definetely release quality. Beyond just the state of the game, it is pretty addictive. I played until 1 am last night and didn't even realize it was so late. I've played about 13 hours and I'm only about 2/3 done with the tech tree.  The leveling/task system does a good job of guiding you through the tech progression and guiding you on what you should accomplish as far as base building.I'll admit that it did take me a little while to figue out some of the basics. I didn't know that after you placed a backround block of dirt/wood that placing a second one will build a solid wall. I didn't realize right away that when one of my dwarves die, they respawn. Also, I didn't realize that the ""2"" next to the Portal spell ment that it cost 2 Mana not that I only had 2 uses. Admitting this does make me feel like kind of a noob but considering that these weren't readily apparent to someone who has played similar games, such as Terraria, to completion, it would be helpful to have a better indication of this.(Maybe tasks that make you do these things)The AI could use some improvement, the Dwarfs won't automatically use their highest skills when you queue a task, but over the game is well worth its current price and is a lot of fun. I would highly recommend it in it's current state and I'm looking forward to future updates.			"

												Yet another game in the ""Dwarf Fortress did it right so let's see if we can do that as well"" genre. This one, unlike quite a few others I played, is actually fun.The dwarves are as dumb as bricks, for starters. The number of times I've seen one of my foolish bearded minions remove the ground they were standing on only to fall into a gaping, lava and spider filled abyss should probably cause frustration. But it doesn't.Why?Mostly because the game has a surprising amount of charm and complexity, without becoming tedious. You probably shouldn't play it for an entire day, or the invasions will get old quickly. But you will. Craft the World is pretty good at catching your attention, just to mine out another layer of minerals, or to equip another one of your suicidal fools in something that might keep him alive...If you have time to spare, and like dwarven fools blundering around in a landscape you will probably flatten and rebuild entirely, give the game a try. I found it suprisingly amusing.			"

												On the surface, Craft the World seems like a Terraria lite kind of game. I would compare it to a mix of Terraria and Game of Dwarves. On its own Craft the World is a creative digging/crafting game where you encourage your motley group of dwarves to do your bidding as you tend to their needs; things like comfort, food, and guiding them for self-defense.The game is brightly animated with an easy to follow control scheme. The interface alerts you to the vital statistics of your dwarves when they are low health, when they die, and even if they are drowning.The game itself keeps the challenge interesting with a nighttime cycle and then an occasional evil portal that wll open up and spawn groups of enemies. Encouraging a somewhat tactical mindset while playing the game when it comes to where and how you construct the home for your dwarves.Overall I find this game amazingly fun to play and have lost quite a few hours with it since purchasing it. If you're unsure about what the game is like you can also find some Let's Plays by Splattercat, who has done a great job in the past of showcasing the quality and enjoyment of the game.			"

												Its a great game but...100hrs in, had to mod the game (or its awfully ""slow"") but I'm only giving this negative review because the devs keep going in the wrong direction and won't fix problems that the community is screaming for. Dwarfs have horrible AITower Defense style combat that was somewhat lost in translation (you'll see what I mean when the hordes get big)Extremely slow (I mod their movement speed, Devs increased block durability... to slow you down more)The levels are Worlds, which you have to beat to unlock the next, no biggie but if a bug prevents you from proceeding, lol start over. (they took care of most of these) You have to pump in tons of hours to get through these worlds, so getting there and reporting a bug to which no Dev responds in the forums is a waste. MultiplayerJust browse the forums to see how messed up this is. Let's just say less than 1% have the achievement that they played it. The recent DLC release...Playing as a female dwarf costs money... okay, well they also added pets which automatically kills rats (which they introduced in the update with the DLC) but if you don't have the DLC, you have to manually kill rats that pop up in your base.... a lot.... see the forums to know what I mean.Great game but wish they would listen to the community. I'd grab it on sale and you'll enjoy it.  "

												The love-hate relationship with an addictive videogame can be a thing of beauty.Silly dwarves at times can add frustration, but mostly humor in my opinion, and they are improving with time and the more I know what to expect, despite them seeming to have their own agendas occasionally..To me, it is very unusual to actually enjoy an RTS of any kind.  This may not be your standard RTS anyway, if at all, but it can be both challenging and relaxing, with hours disappearing before you realize you are still on the first level.  It doesn't force you to progress any further or faster than you want to, without holding your hand either.  Dwarves will perish, tears will be shed, but you will learn from your mistakes at your own pace.And love every second of it, at least I do.(got for free, as gift from a friend, so I assume that is what the checkbox is for..)

												I've played for 25 hours while writing this review. At this point I just finished setting up a solid basis for level 2 after several attempts. (I don't play a lot of management games, which this is).Level 1 was a lot of fun. You get a dwarf, explore, gather, build. More dwarves, more stuff, more eploration. After a while I found this game to be a lot about improving processes. You start doing something and you see what works and what doesn't so you improve. Exploring how to get the whole show running is a fun process and now at lvl 2 this gets harder, so more learning by doing.I recommend this game because it's fun and you wanna improve on what you are doing. I gotta say that the dwarves sometimes are really stupid, which is annoying. If you wanna mine a 4x4 piece of earth you have to guide them through it. Otherwise they hack away to later find out they can no longer reach the top pieces. Also if you wanna close off a dead end, they sometimes close it off in a way they trap themselves in. Another example is them going kamikaze on bosses. All in all they work well enough and actually guiding them around their stupidity seems like just another challenge.I can easily see myself spending another 25 hours to reach higher levels to see what they have in store. (I haven't done multiplayer yet, but it's there).			"

												It's a game that brings us a certain amount of fun and a little laughs, with easy learning and complexity and medium difficulty. The individual dwarves control of the dwarves gives it an interesting peculiarity, I felt like an improvement over ""Lemmings"", though it's complicated to control them one by one when you have a lot of workers and the game AI kinda force you to do that because it seems to take your pawns to horible places and taking awful paths. Multiplayer mode seems too restricted, looks like an unfinished job... Low replayability, probably only in multiplayer mode for fun with friends (not nearly the appeal of Terraria and similars). It worth the 75% off sale price, not more.			"

												There's a lot to like about Craft the World. The art is good, the music is great, the theme and overall gameplay is pretty good.However, you progress through the game by either chewing through the entire tech tree (Dozens of hours worth of work), or by taking out two preposterously tough creatures which require mid-grade gear to have a prayer, and high end gear to reasonably take on.Once you beat a level, you get to move on to a different biome theme and grind the same tech tree over again until you either research everything or take out a couple preposterously difficult monsters.On top of this, the ""quests"" really don't give an indication of the end game, just that you need to build seventeen flower pots to level up so you can learn the next weapon crafting so you can learn farming.If they revisited victory conditions, and the tech trees, this would be a really pretty cool game.As an example: Forest Biome - Accomplish 3 of the following (Create a lake of X size, Harvest a bajillion wood, Build a keep of X size, Kill supertough badguy, Complete the tech tree, etc). For the tech trees, if they split them out into Military, Resource, and Keep trees with specific recipes requiring levels from other trees (such as traps being in the keep tree, but not being available without iron weapons) it would go miles, as currently it seems like the progression is driven by a pattern rather than a logical progression.There is a lot of good in this game, but progression is stymied by the victory conditions literally being ""grind tech for ten hours to get to the next level to grind tech for ten more hours"". I can't recommend this game as a result.			"

												I'm annoyed because the could have really been a good game but fell short. The Dwarf AI is garbage, they constantly will mine blocks they are standing on and fall, block themselves into tunnels, and poor group priority makes them into a digital joke about union workers. I guess it was worth it for $6.74, but the money would have been better spent to Starbound or Terraria.			"

												This is a seriously addicting game!  I keep thinking that I've spent enough time playing and I should try one of my other games, but every morning I wake up thinking about what my dwarves need to do today, how to do things a little more efficiently ... and how I am sooo glad that if / when all my dwarves get killed it doesn't make me start all over again.  I knew I loved this type of game (I own / have played a lot of them), but I had NO idea this one would become a Top Favorite for me!  Absolutely recommended.  Thank you, Dekovir!!7/29/16 - over 600 hours into the game and I am still very much enjoying it.  Working great on Windows 10.			"

								Yes, it looks and sounds like just another Minecraft/Terraria clone, but it's far from it. Instead of being the lone adventurer out to build a massive sprawling castle or making pretty blocky statues and such, you're the overseer of a group of dwarves. You select where to mine, chop, fight or build and they do their best to fulfill the orders while acting autonomously.Many games let you whip together every item as long as you've memorized the recipe. In this, we see items gatewayed behind a Tech Tree, which requires you to build and equip/use/place each type of item to unlock the next items. The game also presents you with a series of Tasks, mostly boiling down to advancing the Tech Tree, but it helps guide your building and exploring instead of endlessly digging through random terrain. You always have at least one goal to work towards.Your Dwarves will require food and shelter and protection, as the denizens of this world will actively seek to plunder your resources. Build your defenses well and craft new weapons and armour to keep it safe. Each Dwarf can learn up to three skills which help them in combat, crafting or movement; a new Dwarf starts with one random skill, and the second two can be added by you with Skill Books which are found throughout the world.While Craft the World may look like Terraria, it's closer to a 2D Towns or Dwarf Fortress or Dungeon Keeper. For an Early Access game, it's feeling very much like it's close to launch-ready. I'm sure there are more features to add in and refinements and optimizations to go, don't get me wrong, I just mean that it's a very well-done beta; it feels like a full game instead of a skeleton with promise.The initial learning curve is fairly easy as long as you stay focused on building a proper shelter (I recommend underground) ASAP. It can be easy to get distracted by exploration or mining and then night falls and your Dwarves are all tired, hungry and under siege by skeletons or goblins.			"

 Examples of flaws in this game I told my dwarf to fill a tiny gap in the mine but he decided to moonwalk and drop to his death in a pit of lava.(Not going to lie, pretty fancy way to die)Every so often you get a  wave   horde  of enemies that attack you to keep the game a challenge. But if today is not your day, then you can simply place some dirt combined with some ladders (to  really  confuse them)  in their path and you've fixed the problem, they wont be able to pass. SImple as that.  An entire freaking army blocked by DIRT   kinda sad The local wildlife are all phycologically unstable, and thus have come to realise living is not an option. Most animals commit suicide through drowning in tiny puddles across the plains. If it rains you can find corpses of deceased animals littered around.The tech tree is a cool idea, but        I dont want to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ roof    IM A DWARF FOR THORIN'S SAKE  WHY DO WE NEED FANCY ROOFS TO MAKE WEAPON'S OF WAR. FLOWERS AND STUFF ARE FOR ELVES.This brings me to another problem, RAIN IS LIKE FLOODS. If you decide to burrow underground you will have a free aquarium. But honestly the game is not bad.  The art style is nice, I enjoy the content and the dwarves are all adorable :3. i really wish that the devs could improve on it though. By making the characters more custumizable. If one of my dwarves die, like the one stated above, I didn't feel much 'sadness', just another dwarf that was suicidal. i just wish that each dwarf is more unique to the others, and when he gains skill level he gets power ups or miscelleanious changes, so that he is different to the lot. I enjoy the game but it sometimes becomes boring due to the tech tree which is a forced manufacture of items you will never use and are expensive to make in order to reach the things you acually want, this concept is in its primary stages and has the potential of improving the game, but at it's current state, the tech tree is more like a forced line of actions, not a choice based decision.So please devs, improve the A.I., make each dwarf more unique and special to the player, and make a better tech tree.

								UPDATED REVIEW:This is a great game.  It has great art direction, sound, challenge, options, etc.   It is my favorite city builder/simulation style game from a 2D side view perspective.    I actually like the this more than Terraria, Starbound, etc.   However, this is a different type of game.  In those games you control a person.   In this one you designate things you want people to do.  This is like a side view Dwarf Fortress and it is very well made.    It is still early access.   I played it a lot months ago then stopped playing it for awhile.   I revisited it yesterday and have noticed a lot of changes and improvements.MY FIRST REVIEW OF THIS:So far I haven't gone far enough into this game to have an opinion on the difficulty curve, and I am writing this review when it is still in early access.   This addressed the aspect of the Terraria style game that did not appeal to me as much.   This game does not have you as an individual but, rather you designate tasks for dwarves that you accumulate over time so it is a lot like a side scrolling Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria.   This is very appealing.   Throw on top of that a superb art direction and I think we have a keeper of a game here.  Well done!   This has the best art style of any game in this genre so far in my opinion.   It is great for the base building fans, survival fans, etc.    It is still early access... I am excited to see where they take this.   I also have only played 99 minutes at the time of writing this, but I very much have enjoyed the time I have spent.			"

												A very nice Terraria/Starbound type game, with exploring, gathering resources, building, crafting, monsters, technology, magic, beer and DWARVES. Neat funny graphics, quite big technology tree, numerous resources, mobs and items. I have a lots of fun playing this game. As for the disadvantages, I see three or so:1. Need to start every level of the campaign completely from scratch, with one dwarf, no tech, no home, no items.2. Basically only 2-3 musical themes - menu, nice/day and spooky/night. These become annoying after some 10 hours of playing and you're probaly not far on the first level yet then.3. Artificial Stupidity of the Dwarves and, fortunately, monsters.The gameplay in a world consists of three stages:1. Balancing on the brink of doom.2. Building a vast and well defended keep.3. Sweeping the world in search for THE five secreet rooms to rebuild the portal and advance to the next level.And one piece of advice - do not try to build anything above the ground in the first step - go under.

								First of all, I only have 10 minutes of playtime logged because I played most of it in offline mode. Even though I haven't played much with this game (I have a HUGE Backlog).  I really enjoyed taking a sneak peek into it. The graphics and artwork is cute and beautiful and the game itself is in a more advanced stage so I think you can already have hours of fun with it. (so it's not an ugly looking beta or a tech demo)I'd especially like to praise the UI. It's really polished and streamlined with big, easy to see icons and descriptions. I have difficulty to see (even with eyeglasses) and quite a few times I have to squint when looking at things when playing Terraria for example. Probably the only disadvantage is the lack of a tutorial. The game is updated fairly often, and it seems like the developers really care and they aren't planning on abandoning it. If you like side-scrolling games like Terraria and Starbound with a pinch of Dwarf Fortress but you want to see a different, non-pixel art graphics and a more good looking user interface then I wholeheartedly recommend you this game.

								Wow, I can't believe this game is an alpha!In my opinion Craft the world is a mix between Terraria (the 2D world with the mining and the dungeons), Gnomoria (controlling several gnomes to build your own home) and Minecraft (the crafting system).I really like these kind of games and I am happy to have Craft the world in my collection! It runs really good and without errors, although it is an alpha.The gameplay is really fun. You start in the world with only one dwarf, but with every level up, you get another one and so you can build your own dwarf castle and you have to defend it against several monsters, which are also getting stronger. You can equip them with weapon and armor and you can improve their skills with special skill books.			"

Early Access Review
								READ!!This game has a lot of potential. It's like terraria with minions that do the work unless you take control of them. The building aspect is a lacking and doesnt interact with neighboring blocks really well. For example all the brick blocks have only one texture so they look like checker board when you lay them down like the brick wall. One item takes at least a whole block. If you place a wall block, its limited to what form it can take which could lead to some walls looking sawed off instead of aesthetically pleasing. Theres other pet-peeves here and there. The game currently doesn't feel like they have an end game content since there's no plot, missions, many point of interest or crafting/building is still limited. However in the time I did spend with it, I did enjoy. I'm expecting the devs have a lot of great plans for this game.It's irresponsible for any reviewer to bash this game saying its a Terraria or Minecraft copy. It has some similar traits but the play style and visuals are different. We can say all the platformers are copying Mario or the puzzle games copying Tetris.-= Suggestions for Devs (since I'm lazy to post in their forums) =-- Simplify the crafting. It can get tidious with the whole drag and drop thing.- More variety of items, building synergy and textures- A sense of direction. I feel like I'm just trying to grind my way up the tech tree because i dont want to waste my limited mats on stuff that'll be replaced quickly in the future. - Giving quests, main story and the like gives players a stronger sense of purpose along with/or besides the I just want to build s**t. - Defeat epic enemies to unlock powerful spells, uncraftable items, building technique or technologies? No different than the tech tree style.- They can choose to partake in these quests/story or just explore and build stuff. For the uncraftable stuff. It could be randomly crafted through a machine or craftable in sandbox mode or something. There's more to recommend but these are good starters.It might seem like a negative review but I actually recommend people to give this a try. I'm expecting this game to be great in the future!			"

Early Access Review
								This game has serious potential to be a great game, however, there are several game mechanics that are handled in the wrong way.Firstly, the tech tree. Whilst a great idea, it forces you to build pointless items for which you have no use for, in order to unlock some of the more basic requirements in the early game. In my personal opinion, it would have been better to have several seperate tech trees to allow you to work towards the things you need. For example: A tech tree for weapons, armour, tools, furniture etc.Secondly, you can't control groups of dwarves. You can either select one dwarf and control him manually (or give him an order to sleep/ eat), or select all dwarves to do one task. I was hoping that I would be able to select a few dwarves to cut down trees, some to mine, some to fight etc. You also cannot select a few dwarves and tell them where to move to, unless you are controlling each one individually, or giving them a task to do (e.g Mine that block). This becomes particularly annoying when you are being attacked by monsters in the early game. Your dwarves will just run in and die fighting and there is nothing you can do to stop them unless you purposefully trap them underground before the attacks.Lastly, with all these things in mind, you are attacked by monsters every night. Whilst not as devestating as one of the full waves of monsters that occurs every 45 minutes or so (If I remember the time correctly), there is the occasional monster that is just too strong for your 2-3 dwarves that you would have by that point. Having not being able to unlock some of the better weapons/ armour (because you essentially have to learn how to make a salad before you can construct a furnace, to make steel) and with your dwarves charging in carelessly, you will find yourself losing all your dwarves within the first 20 minutes of the game. That aside, if you lose all dwarves, one will respawn at your stockpile around 2 minutes after everyone else was wiped out.Problems aside, this game looks fantastic, especially for an Early Access game. If you like Terraria, this game is a good choice for you. Just take into account the things I have mentioned before buying. Whilst slightly disappointed, I can see the potential, I will wait before uninstalling it, hoping that some changes will be made for the final release.			"

												If you want a cross between Terraria and a super simple base building game (like say Gnomoria), I recommend this game, although you might want to check out some gameplay vids to see if it matches your preferences. I enjoyed my time with the game a lot.You control a squad of Dwarves, you ""research"" tech by completing earlier tech, and you get spells to cast. Waves of monsters come at night so you have to defend your base. Underground digging can unearth dangerous monsters too.Don't get it for multiplayer. I read about how to get that working a couple months ago, I gave up before even trying. No saves and it requires an advanced single-player game structure or something. High points for me was enjoyable digging/exploring experience, fun managing a group of guys (something I enjoy a lot, as opposed to singular direct control ala Terreria), building infrastructure like elevators and railroads, building up a base structure. Low points include tedious craft UI, fun techs come late in the tech tree (railroads come after you've had to build a ton of infrastructure already), low variety of enemies, night-time enemy waves get annoyingly strong eventually.I'm glad I played it and I do recommend it for fans of the genres mining and base-building.

												I like this game, it is far from perfect, the AI is legally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in so many instances ( no offense to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people) and it feels grindy at times with the tech tree.. but these kind of 'harvest the resources while you make base' games like this are seriously crack for my brain. Its not even the best example of this kind of genre, but it does it good enough that when I pick it up I am pulled in for several hours at a time. The first time I played I played for something like 8 or 9 hrs straight. I know this game isn't for everyone, but if you can forgive its  minor flaws and enjoy the kinds of games its styled off of, I would say give it a shot, especially if its on a good sale.While there is no native Linux version, I had no problem running it on WINE in Mint 18.1, so bonus points for that.

												Craft the World: 6-7/10.-4 World types to build the ultimate dwarf fortress.-Each world has it's own unique dangers and environmental challenges. -Each time you get a certain amount of experience points, you get 1 more dwarf (up to 13 I believe) and unlock new things to craft.Con: A very poor crafting system. Each recipes has to be hand placed the first time, before you're allowed to mass produce an item. When you have dozen upon dozens of crafting recipes these can be very irriating. Plus the craft tree made you have to craft every recipe to get to the higher ones, with the game progression this often meant having useless gear that just needed to be crafted to get to the next tier of crafting. Mindless grind. Con: Complete lack of a storyline, even though story like elements appear in the game.Con: Each dwarf has three skills that can be leveled up. Although those skills don't seem to actually benefit the dwarf in any noticeable way. Nor are the dwaves drawn to their choosen profession. Just because a dwarf is a logger, doesn't mean they'll be the ones cutting the trees down (and again the skills don't actually add anything).Con: And this is huge. While the game doesn't take up much space, every time they come out with a new DLC, it automatically downloads into your game and needs to be unlocked (purchased) to be used.  And what's more the DLC's all seem to be a feature that should have been part of the initial game. For instances one DLC allows for faster dwarves that look vaguely female. Another allows for multiplayer. If you're going to download it onto my computer, and then require me to buy a feature that should have come out with the normal game, it's going to♥♥♥♥♥♥some people off. Honestly while I'm normally against pirating games these DLC's make me want to break those personal rules. Conclusion: I know I've listed mostly con's, and if you can pickup this game at a large discount I'd recommend buying it to try if you like sandbox games. But overall it's a very shallow game. It has a tablet game type feel that tried to be a real PC game and failed horribly. Overall with the fact it automatically downloads the DLC without purchasing the game and then requires you to unlock it, when the DLC should have been a normal feature of the game instead of a ""we want more money"" DLC; has me thinking I'm going to avoid games coming from this company in the future. A side note to the Dekovir Entertainment. Here's a suggestions for a future game DLC. Call it the ""Options"" DLC. For just 10 bucks you get the ability to adjust sound settings, maybe change screen resolutions.  "

												The game is fun for a little bit but gets really frustrating how slow, dumb, and tedious things get real quickly.Ore is incredibly sparse and will find myself with 300 dirt for a dozen pieces of iron. Sometimes I end up gathering more mythril than anything else because how sparse iron and gold are. You can't sell to the trader which would be great if you could because I have a tremendous amount of worthless dirt I wouldn't mind trading for just a single piece of wool since these dwarves are too dumb to invent shears or produce cotton; Or make rope out of plant fibre would be nice. Why do I have to kill sheep that spawn at the very edges of the map for one piece of wool? Tedious. Another miserable aspect is the stockpile. It just spawns at the beginning of the game wherever it damn well feels like and you can't pick it up or remove it even with stockpiles unlocked in the tech tree. It is always located in a worthless spot and gets dwarves killed because their ai is so bad one or two always end up trying to protect the abondoned stockpile. But don't worry, according to posts back in 2013, the developer is going to get right on that. Yep, riiiiight on that.Ironically, the dwarves just ruin the whole game. You can't manage them in any sane way. They just do what they feel like in the most un organized and inefficient way possible. One dwarf will mine a rock, then go mine a different rock on the complete other side of the map because a dwarf on that side of the map decided to mine the next rock while a third dwarf will decide to pick up the rock mined and then go lumbering back to the other side of the map to pick up a leaf. When giving build orders, dwarves are too stupid to do more than one task at once. So to build a ladder 4 down it would take 4 dwarves instead of the logical idea of having one dwarf just carry 4 damn ladder pieces since they have the inventory for it. On top of that all, dwarves keep having the pathfinding lost bubble over there head because the ai can't remember how to walk down a straight corridor at times so they just sit there, stupidly, several seconds at a time before remembering how feet work. Also, you get skill books you can give to your dwaves but overall they seem like a complete waste of time. You can't control who does what job so the person I used all my smithing books on will still just be chopping trees while the person with the miller stats prioritizes smithing and cooking as much as any other dwarf. Stupid design choice.Overall, go play Dwarf Fortress. It can be hard to start but the wiki is really in depth and contains way more fun frustration than this game ever will and it's free; plus you don't have to pay 5 dollars more for girls to be in the game. Not that they added anything to craft the world so what a waste of $5 that was.In dwarf fortress, dwarves could breed. You know, when one dwarf sticks its pick in another dwarf and a baby is mined out. And then die usually in some horrible way to a forgotten beast made entirely of fire. Then you could setup an orphanage with all of your masterfully crafted wooden tables and chairs. Then flip a switch and flood the orphanage with lava. Orphans live very tragic lives in dwarf fortress.			"

								In the state that I've played the game, Craft The World is far from finished. Bugs are still being ironed out and features are added. Does that mean that the game is un-enjoyable? No, quite the contrary. Even though the game is not a finished product I've enjoyed every single minute of gameplay that I've had the chance to experience so far.The learning curve may be a bit steep (not compared to Dwarf's Fortress of course) and new players may have a hard time getting a proper shelter built before the waves of goblins and hordes of the undead start to harass your poor dwarves. You will however get the hang of it after some time, patience is a virtue after all. A small tip for all the other new players: If you want to get a good first impression of the game, do not make your first map a huge one with sandbox mode and permadeath. It'll drive you insane. Go for the campaign instead.The graphics are similar to games like Terraria and Minecraft but every dwarf still has a nice and personal touch to them and the world is looking lush and fancy in general, do keep in mind that I have yet to try the snow map. Gameplaywise I find it hard to describe what other games this title is similar to, especially since I've only played a few hours of Dwarf's Fortress and I haven't even tried Gnomoria (it seems like CTW is most commonly compared to these two titles). There are some occasional bugs here and there, longer work queues tend to make your small workers utterly confused and the not having the option to move your original stockpile may feel a bit annoying at times but for me that still doesn't prevent me from having a good time. Overall I really enjoy Craft The World and I would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of sandbox-style games, crafting and dwarves.			"

												This game is incredibly fun but isn't without it's problems. The AI is often a bit weird and clunky.. I found myself watching my dwarves going about their business and sometimes getting frustrated about their pathing and who does what. Even attempting to manually control them via giving them commands to Eat or Sleep can be weird, sometimes I found myself having to give them the command more than once before they'd actually go and do it. Taking direct control is also clunky and usually not even worth it. Even with their AI and pathing problems it's just easier to let them figure it out themselves than to take control and immediately feel confused about how to do anything and be slower about it. They also aren't 'smart' enough with some commands, like digging.. if you want them to dig in an area you have to be ready to babysit them a bit, because if you mark a bunch of stuff at once the game will sometimes cancel all the options because the blocks behind the first block are not 'reachable'. Still... I did enjoy this game. I would honestly have more hours on it if I didn't keep myself from playing it, because once I start I keep on playing until the afternoon of the following day and I regret it. It's incredibly easy for time to slip away from you as you play this, it's a very 'well one more action here, and oh, i found some new stuff, and I need some wood, so I'll queue these up and then I totally will take the dog for his evening walk oh♥♥♥♥♥♥it's already 4am' sort of game.

												... This game is an interesting introduction to casual games for me.I chop a tree.  You get an experience.  You kill a skeleton.  You get an experience.You learn how to put a wooden helmet on.  You get a lot experience.You mine rocks?  Oh wow, I must be amazing or the Second Messiah or something!... I think Ive played so many games that actually encourage challenge and immediate death to your vitals that playing a game like this is much like shaking a rattle in front of a baby who is in fact armed with a morninstar and several gallons of Red Bull.      After gaining several levels in the first campaign consecutively for figuring out how I did a Torch, I am so afraid of progressing in this game simply because of the PTSD flashbacks from Dark Souls.  I didnt even know you could get those from a video game.        Regardless, play it.  Have fun.  Because its a casual game..... right?   Just...  Im watchin you game.  Any game that gives you THAT much stuff at the beginning is plotting death at the end.  Im onto you.			"

Now hope that my review is helpful and that you will buy this awesome game!Have fun gaming!			"

								I was unsure about this game at first; yet another sandbox one might say! However, Craft the World expertly mixes multiple genres into something interesting to play. While only in 'early access' at this time, it already has more than enough to count as a 'completed game'. It is a nice alternative to more intense games (Dwarf Fortress), that is easier to pick up and play- or return to, after a break. Short bursts are better managed by the slightly more casual style, and the 'tower defence' aspect is well implimented.As an individual who is rather picky about games, and who doesn't often (ever, really) write recommendations, the very fact I am should speak volumes on this game. While Craft the World is not perfect- and could use some better pacing in areas, possibly a refinement to the crafting tree at times- it is better than anything I've played in a while. You are unlikely to be disappointed should you acquire this title.			"

												**WARNING** This review is extremly bias towards the game as I find it amazing and a shame that these awesome devs are not more popular, so here's my extra two cents to try and help the game out.Let me tell you about this beautiful gem of a game. It starts on the outside with very light dwarf fortress gameplay meets gorgeous terraria like art, but that's just what you observe without playing it.First, the community, players are super helpful at answering questions, content sharing is a bit on the low here, the subreddit has more of that http://www.reddit.com/r/CraftTheWorld/. This includes the devs, I've wasted around $30 on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ early access games that take the money and run, the constant news and updates here are looking promising that this is not the case, I see a lot of potential still in this game and hope many updates are to come.Now, actually going into the game, first thing I noticed just looking around, the artwork, again, is amazing and unique. The background, the sky, the underground all beautifully polished. Next is the amount of resources, wool to mythril resources and everything in between are in the game, I'll let you mostly imagine the possibilities this leaves, but I'll name a few: Statues, carpets, walls, bookshelves, ect. Pretty much whatever you want your base to look like, you can, and it will turn out awesome, I'm guessing you can't picture this through my words so I've taken a sample http://imgur.com/F3LYqH8. What was guarding his base you ask? Turrets, definitely something new brought to the genre with this game is wooden and tesla turrets that protect your base from the waves of monsters that come. These turrets are well balanced and on their own don't completely wipe the monster waves, normally that's up to your men while the turrets support, though, as seen here, you cheese base designs to effectively let turrets do all the work if you so choose.Next the monster, anything from your average skeleton and zombies to goblin tribes that set up shop acrossed from you and giant underground demons are in this game, if you've played terraria, the large demons are close in scale to their bosses but changed gameplay wise because of this being a rts.Well, I hope I've done the game some justice, ultimately it's your decision on if you get the game or not but I STRONGLY recommend it. Cheers!			"

Early Access Review
								I normally do not buy ""early access"" games, simply because I hate paying money for an unfished buggy game that only contains a fraction of the content you have been promised. And I am also too impatient to wait for the game to finish before playing it, so I always end up with a bad experience of the game.After seeing a video of the gameplay for Craft the World, I fell in love with the simple design, yet rather good looking. I have to admit that this is no AAA game with perfect graphics like Crysis, but it is not anything like many of the Indie games you find on greenlight. The artwork is good looking, and the animations are just good.So, what works?Pretty much everything. Although there is currently only 2 levels out of what seems to be 5 when released, each level still offers about 10 hours of gameplay before finished. This does not include the ""endless game"" option you also have, which could have as much as 50 hours of gameplay. Each level can also be continued, as you don't have to go through the portal into the next level until you want to. Nice touch.I'd like to state that this game has a few bugs still, but the devs have been very good at fixing these. I saw 3 patches just before christmas, a week apart, fixing pretty much everything I had to complain about. So, what doesn't work?Well, the pathing of the dwarves (your minions) is sometimes strange. The UI cannot recognize a ladder, and when you take control of the dwarves it gets worse. If he is climbing while you possess him, he will fall down the ladder. Apparently dwarves cannot multitask.Also sometimes when you have possession of a dwarf he will not use the ladder but tries to scale the cliffs himself, but the code does not allow this as there is a ladder. So there are a few annoying bugs, but most can be solved simply by stop possessing him for a second, before regaining control. Annoying, but something that is being worked on right now (read more on the forum for known bugs).Conclusion:I have seen many released games with more bugs (X-rebirth anyone?), even big AAA titles (Yes Rome2, I'm looking at you!). Had this game contained all 5 levels (As it seems they want to include in the final game - I still hope for more levels as DLC), I would not feel this was a bad purchase for 12-15€ or whatever I paid for the game in its current state.With the developers being very good at maintaining a frequent patching frequenzy I am sure this game will soon be without bugs. Then this game is an absolutely must buy!Final verdict:Graphics: 7/10Gameplay: 9/10Replayability: 8/10Value for money: 10/10roughly 10 hours gameplay pr. level time 5 levels = 50 hours of fun gameplay. Add another 50 if you want the endless sandbox mode and want to obtain everything. So 100 hours of gameplay for 1/3 the price of an AAA title? This is a must buy title!!!Oh yeah, and when the Dwarves charge to battle, they scream something incoherent that sounds like ""On to da turd"". For that laugh alone the game is worth it's pricetag.

So my genius dwarfs go inside to pickup the loot and take a f- ton of damage. I opened a portal for them to leave, but they keep coming back to get the loot! Ahhhhh... they all died trying to get the loot.10/10 - Would watch Dwarfs loot again			"

												I recommend this game to anyone who is thinking about buying it. This game is an enourmous amount of fun and as it is still in its beggining stages and its already as good as it is, i can only assume future updates will make the game even more fun and user friendly. For anyone who is thinking about buying it but still is kind of wondering what its about and what the game will bring, let me give you a basic rundown of my experiance with the game. I am currently 46 hours and 23 minutes in and im just beggining to bring my world to life. There is endless amounts of things to do and in this game no matter what you do theres always a way to expand onto what you already did. The monsters are very creative and at 46 hours and 23 minutes in they are not to be taken lightly. So really to anyone thinking of buying it, it is well worth the 19 dollars or however much it is when you are reading this.			"

								A great game that will draw you in and then never let you go.  I have restarted this game who knows how many times and each game play just makes it that much more fun.  The developers are constantly updating so no fear that you are buying into a ""dead"" game. As for the game itself it is a sandbox styled game that is reminiscent of Minecraft. (Hate to compare games, but when the shoe fits...) Instead of having one person however you have a team dwarves that go around and complete your assigned task.  I will note that this does not seem to be a perfect setup as several times I have had major needs unfulfilled and yet my team is off digging randomly. In short, great game, few bugs in my opinion really worth giving a go.Thanks!			"

Im kind of guy that really get bored of games really fast but this keep me playing.Love how pretty this games is, it has the fresh kind of color, especially the light source.Really like the scaffolding, this is my first time play game that have this, is really amazing how they work.Its quite a challenging game, there's wave monster that spawn around 50 minutes everytime, if you not prepare you probably going to screw up.There's also magic which you can use with your mana, it really help you alot in the game.Hate it when the dwarf climb on the wall, and if he slip or something they will fall, they will get injured.The mana really takes forever to regenerate.Description on the item sometimes aren't clear and no idea how it works.8/10 For the price it definitely worth a try.

												As of late i've been pretty picky about what i play and dont get to dedicated for a game for more then a few hours unless its immediatly intrigueing in some way or draws me in.This is one of the special ones for me, I had this sitting in my library and never even touched it for quite a long time, out of boredom i decided to try it and the first hour or so i wasent to impressed felt like something people have already done similarly but as I learnd the game i found out just how great it really was.So the biggest factor about this game for me is probably the versatility in what you can do. you have to have food. you have to get resources to build your structures and better equipment and theres a multitude of ways to go about it all.The dwarfs get bored if you dont feed them a variety of foods. theres constant dangers even after you get pretty well situated theres not really a way around the challenge as i have yet to come across.The replayability is also there. one thing i fear only playing for the 20 or so hours i have. is that once you do it once you did it all but..the cool thing is theres different environments which add unique challenges and makes you think about things a little differently the next time through. and there is definitly a learning curve to efficiency.Another really nice bonus about the game that i really enjoyd and one that i didnt realise was in the game untill i playd it was the fact that each dwarf is unique in himself. you give him the equipment you want, and they all come with a different skill. you can also get them new skills so it's like having a bunch of mini playable character. except you dont play them. although theres that option aswell to a extent.while everything in the game doesent sound all that impressive or new. its the combination of it all. it's got a little bit of everything in it and i think thats what makes this game ultimately great.Another good thing about it is the devs are still working on it and its continually getting updates and they even go the extra mile to add in holiday events and do their best to respond to what the people are interested in most.this game is well worth it as is, and in the future this game could be perfect. i would spend good money on this if i knew what it was before i playd it. and im a bit of a tight wad.This game in its current state though does have a few bugs i dont particularly appreciate but it doesent break the game for me at all its still incredibly enjoyable. just ocassionally frustrating. all games normally have something wrong with them and atleast the ones ive expirienced so far doesent degrade its value its very well built and polished considering the minor issues ive expirienced.With that said i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a fairly casual sandbox/rts/simulation type game. anyone who likes games like Terraria, 7 days to die, minecraft, city builders, and other types of games like that im sure would enjoy it. it's worth trying out if thats your thing and your looking for a new game to play for awhile.

								Craft The World is a unique game that is fun for everbody. It is great for lovers of Sandboxes and Strategies such as myself . This unique game is easy to learn but really does test your skills. I knew that Craft The World was my sort of game as soon as i saw it on steam and i bought it the very next day. With simple but beautiful graphics CTW works with even the slowest of computers. Over all Craft The World is now one of my favourite games and i enjoy even second of playing it and hopefully you will too !                                                                                                                                                                                                  9.4 out of 10                    The Lord Of Pigeons			"

												Quick review for my Friends list, since this is on sale today. Craft the World is a great little indie game! Elements of Terraria and base-building games like Dungeon Keeper, combined into something new. It's a slower-paced game than Terraria, and rewarding in a different way. A great deal at $5.			"

DOnt trust of ""NOW WITH MULTIPLAYER"" on steam store! Waste of money if u want to play single player the game seems the copy of terraria and gnomoria but definitely not bad!			"

												So, I've obviously played enough of this game to judge it. The AI is horrible. It would be laughable if it weren't so mind-numbingly frustrating. The number of times I've watched my dwarfs glitch off of ladders and fall to their death, carry my new bed around for what feels like hours instead of TAKING IT TO THE ♥♥♥♥ING STOCKPILE, stand dumbly right beyond the portal that is closing (costing me another cast to get their dumb asses home)...it's frustrating as f*.The *game*, the fundamental idea of the game, is fun. With some tweaks and patching, it could be really fun.The tech tree is terribly flawed. If it must artificially gate progress, it should be reworked into a more simple tiered setup: wood, farming, stone, iron, steel, silver, gold, mithril. Far too often the game is artifically made difficult and the pace slowed because I have to build 30 lamps before I can make armor. It's nonsensical and clearly artificial.The animation is stiff, the new dwarves *don't* look as good as the old ones, but they're passable.You can control a dwarf directly, can and should. Must, even. The AI is so bad, what you want done will never happen unless you do it yourself. You can easily clear blocks 3-5 times faster manually, since the dwarves will go back to the stockpile after every few chopsI can't speak to multiplayer, that's not my preferred gametype. What it should support is Minecraft/Terraria-style cooperative base building: one base, 2+ players. I do not believe it does, though.If they can fix the AI situation, this game will be a definite ""Recommended."" As it is, though, I just don't think the fun outweighs the frustration. 10 hours of relatively fun base-building *easily* gets wiped out by one glitchy death thanks to autosave.			"

								In a nutshell the game takes influences from Dungeon Keeper, Dwarf Fortress, Minecraft, and Terraria.You start out with a single dwarf who has to pave the way for a maximum dwarven industrial revolution on a pristine world. Your only hindrance being native goblins, ant nests, and rampant undead trying to make your day worse. The gameplay is rather casual, and involves a lot of waiting, but the presentation is fun, and you end up staring at what your dwarves are doing as they go around their menial labour that you've set out for them. The biggest challenge seems to be the first few days in the game, after which you have probably, and hopefully, unlocked more dwarves, and cleared most of what the game has to offer. Rest is just going down the technology tree towards the final unlockables, which by estimation takes around 10 hours of gameplay, after which you have the chance to start again on a slightly larger map with a little bit more challenge.Sadly, the game gives all the crafting recipes as unlockables, so there is nothing to actually discover, and you end up moving the ingredients one by one into grids. All of which could have been replaced by simply having a craft menu with required ingredients listed. Makes one wonder if the function was added for the sake of copying Minecraft.Many hours of fun if you're into designing your own private haven, sadly the limited resources mean that you have to restart the cycle in order to keep the game fresh. Apart from building, the game has very little to offer, and I would suggest taking any of the games which the game takes influences from. They all do what Craft the World does, except better in their own niché.The game title is misleading, you don't craft the world, you make a base in it and exploit the natural resources. "

												This is my chillout game.AI is far from perfect but i gotta look after my dwarfs, yo.Lot's of fun.Good balance of chillax and challenge.Hope there's more DLC's.Sequel would be winning.I would advise you buy this game if it seems good by the reviews you've read.Read a few, get an idea.I got over 250 hours in.Events can be fun but rock your dwarves some OP stuff.Fun but a button to switch events of would be nice.I wanna go back to vanilla.Anyway all in all a fun game and relaxing yet challenging.

			Join my Steam Group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GeniusPieTrap Get the game here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/248390/ Craft The World is a unique sandbox strategy game, the mix of Dungeon...		

I really like Craft the World and give it a reccomendation, though I do have some issues with it.Keep in mind that I have never made a game in my life. Well I made some simple ones with the help of programs like RPG maker and the such, but I really can not speak on how difficult it is to make games of this scope. The reason I say this is because all though this game is a lot of fun and totally worth a buy it has some problems that seem like they would be very easy to fix.Why on earth for example do we need to drag and drop every single ingrediant to the crafting table? Or why do the right and left mouse buttons do different things depending on what you are clicking on? Why can we not change the key bindings? Many other examples of minor but annoying design issues exist that seem like they would be a quick fix.Still, nothing that you can't get used to. The annoyances are worth the fun.			"

												This is a really solid little sandbox game. Takes a lot of elements from games like Dwarf Fortress. Add an RTS element and gives you a retro 2D perspective with tons to explore like Terarria. Really solid graphic design also. The learning curve is a bit steep but it's really fun once you get going!			"

												I asked for a refund when I first bought it, I decided to give it a chance again.Now, I'll keep it but I'd like the developer to take those concerns in note, and to fix them.Overall, it's a good game; crafting, survival, building, it's pretty cool.Like it says in the description, it is a mix between Dungeon Keeper, Terraria and Dwarf Fortress.It is not as good as any of those games though.First problem is the AI/pathfinding, it's pathetic how dumb it is, I just can't stand it, that's the reason why I asked a refund the first time, you want them to do something in particular, nope, they'll leave the home to get some items on the floor that could have wait and then, they're dead because they did not listen to you.Yeah sure, you can make them not leave the house but then they don't seems to do anything even if I tell them to.I could seriously go all day long but I'll stop it here about that part, all you need to know is that the AI is horrible, you though that the AI in Battlefield 1942 was bad? Wait before you play this game, you'll discover a totally new stage of AI/pathfinding... It's sad.Second problem, the lack of content, there's barely any of everything (weapons, monsters, maps, it could have more biomes).The random generating isn't so good.Third problem, the ""sandbox"" isn't that great in this game, you can't create new Worlds and play on many at the same time (like in Terraria) so you're stuck with the Story Worlds.I am not sure about that so it may or may not be a fact unlike what I previously have say.It is that you cannot get back to your previous World once you're advancing in the World after having completed the previous one.  Like I say, I am not sure about this part so don't take it for guarantee.Other than that, it is a good game, but it has lot of flaws that makes you wonder if it is really good.So the problems in a few words; AI/pathfinding, not enough content, bad sandboxing.The good; The concept is cool, the graphics are fine.I'm giving it 4.7/10 and a negative feedback so hopefully the developer can see it and fix it, even if I really doubt that they'll do anything unfortunately.

Early Access Review
								Feels Like a Freemium game on IOS/Android.  A lot of this game was designed to waste your time.  I know it's still early access but some stuff just makes no sense as to why the DEVS chose to make those choices.Crafting is a ton of click and drag.  You can't just auto make something if you have resources.  The least they could do is let us drag a stack so we can put the mats in quicker the way minecraft does.  Instead you can only move ONE SINGLE item to its slot.  Dwarves are randomly selected by the game to do a task.  Rather then the dwarf with the cook skill running over to cook.  The dwarf with the carpenter skill runs over to cook instead.  You have to make a TON of useless items BEFORE you even get access to the items you actually NEED.   The crafting tree doesn't let you actually focus on just the tools path.  You have to learn how to make walls, lights, furniture, food, glass, materials, wooden armor all before you can even use the steel ingot that the tree gives you access too.  You'll be mining silver and gold with an iron axe BEFORE you are using a steel pickaxe.  The crafting tree just needs major overhauling.  A SINGLE replacement dwarf takes 5 minutes.  A SINGLE Mana point takes 5 minutes to replinish.  So if you used up all 60 points of mana.  It'll take SIX HOURS real world time to fill back up fully.  The only way to make it go faster is if you level up.  Then it fills completly.  This is a freemium game mechanic.  Designed to make you want to buy mana refills for real world money.  Can't move your starting stockpile.  So its totally exposed and you have no way of really making a shelter before night fall.  Just not happening.  Ghosts will be upon you way before then.  Also you won't be able to make any doors to use for your shelter until you travel the Civilization like crafting tree which limits you heavily in the early game. Your ""inventory"" is horrid cluttered.  You have to sift through tons of useless stuff to find what you are looking for.  Instead of going to the section that only shows the lighting.  You go to the section that has the lights, armor, tools, traps, walls,.  Can't sell your items.  Once you upgrade your gear you end up with all this old gear that you can't do anything with.  Have to cycle through your dwarves in order to find the one you are looking for rather then just pull down a menu that you can look at and quickly find the dwarf you are looking for. Hopefully all this will change.  Spend so much resources collecting.  Some items take a ton of mats to make.  And there are just so many useless items and some items that make no sense.   The game has you have to make a fishing pole to fish.  After you make one then everyone can freely use it.  So why have to craft it at all?  Why not just let them fish automatically.  You don't even need to equip it.  Same with the buckets.  Dwarves move horrid slow.  And they have to travel back and forth.  You can use a portal but for somereason when they use it the timer on it speeds up.  So rather then be actually open for 4 minutes.  It ends up only open for like 2 minutes from the constant use.

								Craft the World is surprisingly polished for a game in Early Access, there are some relatively minor issues with the game but nothing that can't be overcome to find an enjoyable experience. While it takes quite awhile to really get your dwarves to the point where they can defend themselves in an unforgiving world, most of the progression is relatively straightforward. Some of the early game quests could be ordered in a more logical fashion, the game won't mention that you have to place food on tables in order for your dwarves to consume it until well after your dwarves are complaining of being hungry. *This has since been addressed*Some resources are still being balanced as far as scarcity in the early stages of the game, but the recently introduced store means that if you're in need of some wool and haven't seen a sheep in ages you can always buy some for a few gold coins which you'll find interspersed throughout the landscape.If you enjoy 2D sandbox style games you owe it to yourself to check out Craft the World, an attractive art style and entertaining gameplay along with regular updates ensure that this title is well worth the price of admission.

								I have been a long time fan of Terraria and also Minecraft, so I was a little hesitant about getting this game in the fear of it falling way short. I was badly mistaken. This game is a great and addicting game. The artwork is great, the gameplay is loads of fun. It's Terraria meets tower defense. Plenty of items to craft lots of space to explore and build. What I like is that you have these elves that you control and have them do your deeds. If you like the game Gnomoria, this is exactly what that game is, only so much better graphics and sound. I bought this game during the Winter Sale 2013 and I'm glad I did, but even so well worth the $15 it's on the store. Again, if you enjoy those types of games, this is a must to own.			"

								This is a fun little crafting game where you control a group of dwarves. You start off with one dwarf who has nothing but a knife and you collect basic resources from the world, such as wood, earth, food, etc, and store them in your stockpile. Once you begin to collect resources, you are able to craft different items (for example, wood + stone = pickaxe). You can make armor, weapons, furniture, cook, fish, and a bunch of other things. Crafting allows you to level up. Every time you level up, your population of dwarves grows by 1 and you are able to accomplish more in a shorter amount of time. You will want to build a shelter before too long because monsters come out at night to attack your dwarves. You can either try to fight them off or hide in your shelter instead. Your dwarves can die, but when one does, another one generates in 5 minutes to take his place, so it's never really an issue.It's a pretty easy game to get the hang of and you'll probably play for hours at a time like I do. The only negative thing about the game for me is that your dwarves can be kind of stupid at times (especially when you have a lot of them at once - I have 10 at the moment), such as attacking monsters when their health is low, getting lost in tunnels, doing things that don't make sense, etc. But I think that's a small price to pay for such an addictive game. I'd definitely recommend picking it up, especially if you can get it cheap. I think I got it for $7 and it was worth every cent.			"

								Craft The World has its roots visible in such games as Terraria and Dwarf Fortress, taking from both (and several others) and making something thoroughly enjoyable.I was a little skeptical at first, but this is one of those games where you start playing and the next thing you know there are birds chirping and the sun is rising.Campaign mode revolves around building a safe haven for your dwarves to eat and sleep while they search for pieces of a portal to take them to the next world. While that seems to be the extent of the story, it's more than enough to keep you and your dwarves digging deeper, darker tunnels, upgrading equipment and fighting increasingly difficult monsters.Still in development as of writing this, the game is not without its flaws. The tech tree is a little baffling in its design and you'll often find yourself mass-producing items you'll never use, but this is a minor quibble. The dwarves, while entertaining, lack depth in that they literally have no personalies or relationships beyond having a unique appearance and name.The game's shortcomings do nothing to hamper your fun, however, and as mentioned before, you may find yourself losing an evening or two watching these little guys trying to survive.

								A combination of Dwarf Fortress, terraria, minecraft, mixed in with a little more tower defense game. It's an early release of the game, so there is only one world/level. It's plenty of fun, but it's far from complete, it still feels like an early beta stage testing of the game. The dwarves are dumb (but i'm use to that from dwarf fortress) and there is no tutorial, no website, and no instructions, the guides are almost non-existant and still being worked on.  So I mean there's a list of things wrong with this game, but...The ideas are solid, the gameplay is fun and addicting, it just need to be polished and built up more.

Early Access Review
								I have been a long time fan of Terraria and also Minecraft, so I was a little hesitant about getting this game in the fear of it falling way short. I was badly mistaken. This game is a great and addicting game. The artwork is great, the gameplay is loads of fun. It's Terraria meets tower defense. Plenty of items to craft lots of space to explore and build. What I like is that you have these elves that you control and have them do your deeds. If you like the game Gnomoria, this is exactly what that game is, only so much better graphics and sound. I bought this game during the Winter Sale 2013 and I'm glad I did, but even so well worth the $15 it's on the store. Again, if you enjoy those types of games, this is a must to own.			"

								Craft the World...what can I say except that this is Early Access done right! Now, be mindful, this is a very niche type of game. It's a 2d crafting/strategy/survival type game. You guide your dwarves to victory by showing them where to mine, cut, harvest, and fight. You gather your resources, build yourself a secure base and then seek out the parts of the portal to the next world. Survive, thrive, and build through your technology trees and ultimately build the portal and head to the next world. The pathing is a little goofy at times but in those cases you can take direct control of a dwarf and provide a bit more direct guidance. So far I have been looking for the downside to this game and I really can't find anything that stands out. It's well made, fun (if you like this type of thing) and good for spending lots of casual hours exploring, crafting, and in general just having a good time with your stalwart little fellows. It has a fairly large technology tree and the only one I had a bit of trouble with was the rail line which I am sure was my fault. I look forward to seeing what they come up with next. More tech, more enemies, and more fun? Maybe guns or crossbows? Either way, I am sold on this one and if you like games of this type then pick this one up for sure!			"

								I purchased this game after watching videos of it on YouTube. I was intrigued since I'm a big fan of Terraria and sandbox/rpg game's alike. I must say, CtW is serious fun for serious-to-casual gamers. The crafting tree is excellent. I mean, that's one of the best things I liked about Far Cry 3. However, this game does crafting extremely well. The only problem I have is with the pathfinding, which I'm more than sure will get fixed as the game develops. I just don't like building a bridge to get from one side to the other and my crew swims under it; almost drowning in the process. But it's early access so no biggy. If you like 4x sandboxing, you should definitely get this game NOW. It's a ton of fun being a dwarf leader in this game. After two hours I finally got the go-ahead to craft some armor. I mean, it's a HUGE tech tree and the fun's just barely begun.			"

								It's awesome! How the game looks, presents itself, the small things like skeletons making a ladder out of themselves helping other foes get your dwarfs... fantastic. I've played Dwarf Fortress a bit, seen Gnomoria and played Minecraft and Terraria a lot and I'll say that Cratf The World is indeed a combination of those mentioned above but still provides a unique experience.On the other hand, there are some bugs (it's early access game and you really feel it sometimes), the AI acts weird and restarting or replacing dirt helps new trees grow... seriously xD I run out of trees/wood and had to restart the game (not start over from scratch, just turn off and on again) to get some. Despite bugs it's still quite playable and I personally can't wait for the final release. Good job devs! I've been waiting for something like CTW for quite a while. You've got my pickaxe!			"

								Craft The World has its roots visible in such games as Terraria and Dwarf Fortress, taking from both (and several others) and making something thoroughly enjoyable.I was a little skeptical at first, but this is one of those games where you start playing and the next thing you know there are birds chirping and the sun is rising.Campaign mode revolves around building a safe haven for your dwarves to eat and sleep while they search for pieces of a portal to take them to the next world.

The tech tree is a little baffling in its design and you'll often find yourself mass-producing items you'll never use, but this is a minor quibble. The dwarves, while entertaining, lack depth in that they literally have no personalies or relationships beyond having a unique appearance and name.The game's shortcomings do nothing to hamper your fun, however, and as mentioned before, you may find yourself losing an evening or two watching these little guys trying to survive.

								It's fun, looks good and well put together.  Good value at the price too and very playable in early access; better in early release than some full release.Some pathing issues with dwarfs running into danger rather than out of it (especially archers).  Archers fire into the ground a lot.  Crafting tree is not logical - not sure that's a big issue but it does feel wrong.  It could probably use item tiers and item stats as per WoW and Terraria as well as an item class structure.  I'd suggest some routes of the crafting tree should preclude others, some could also only appear on accessing a new biome - which would give variety and a chance to explore different options later.  Save game at branch points would be good too. For me there's currently not enough gameplay to make subsequent campaign maps compelling.  They essentially just seem to change biome which tweaks a few aspects but not many and you're forced to rebuild & relearn the same crafting tree.  Better off I'd think with one world but multiple biomes (perhaps unlocked at edge of map) and the ability to set-up secondary bases in them.  Given that this is early access and it's quite good now there is plenty of scope for this to become an all time classic.Wish list - add multiplayer and PVP.			"

												Another rehash of Dwarf Fortress (though I feel somewhat more faithful than others), Craft the World follows in a similar vein as Terraria and every other 2D side-on, grid-world game accused of being a Minecraft clone.What appealed to me specifically about this one is the ability to delegate tasks among a team of controllable characters, allowing them to build skills while creating increasingly better gear/environs for them to live in.Unfortunately - again, as is the case with so many Dorf Fawtwess remixes - the actual end product is a lot more stripped-down than I would have liked, with tasks almost arbitrarily assigned and a hell of a lot of struggling on the AI's end of things.Firstly, don't think you can leave your dwarves unattended:  They'll chase a pebble down a cliff into the waiting maw of some hideous monstrosity if you let them.  Alternatively, their AI might just choke, leaving them sitting on the spot until you give them a kicking (taking direct control for a while or recalling everyone to base seems to shake them out of it).  Furthermore, your dwarves are thick as bricks when it comes to combat, so you can expect them to die a lot on the higher difficulties because of their habit of leaving cover to crowdsurd the enemy horde.Secondly, there's no such thing as a quick game.  The fastest you can speed things up is double time and even then, your dwarves walk slower than a funeral procession.  Take into account some of the massive worlds you can generate and getting from one end to the other involves either spamming portal spells until your mana runs out or watching a movie while you wait for your guys to pick up a single log from the edge of the map.The tech tree feels a little restrictive, forcing you to create a certain number of objects before allowing you to progress, which can get super frustrating if your base spawned in an area almost devoid of, say, iron.  I understand that a 'sandbox' tech tree mode is available, I'm just saying that in the campaign, it feels a bit cheap to have to make bucketloads of nails when what my dorfs really need is a good pickaxe.Mind you, I've still managed to pour 65 infuriating hours into this game despite these shortcomings, and I'd say it's almost purely because I've got an unhealthy addiction to delegative fantasy sandbox worldbuilders with rpg elements.  This wasn't a great way to scratch that itch, but I'll recommend it to that very specific audience until I find something better.			"

								A combination of Dwarf Fortress, terraria, minecraft, mixed in with a little more tower defense game. It's an early release of the game, so there is only one world/level. It's plenty of fun, but it's far from complete, it still feels like an early beta stage testing of the game. The dwarves are dumb (but i'm use to that from dwarf fortress) and there is no tutorial, no website, and no instructions, the guides are almost non-existant and still being worked on.  So I mean there's a list of things wrong with this game, but...The ideas are solid, the gameplay is fun and addicting, it just need to be polished and built up more. I would recommend pirating it first just to test out the very first verison. Of course it's full of bugs and problems, but if you like the game play, buying it on steam will get you all the patches and upgrades, which is worth it if you like the concept.The art is different and refreshing; so many indie games have 8-bit art, seeing something that doesnt' do 8-bit and also uses some more modern graphics is nice. Also about patches, the developer seems way into patches every 2/3 days ( it's been out for 10 days I think and there's already 4-5 patches/fixes).

Early Access Review
								I have really enjoyed this game, I have.  There are a few things I think would make the game more enjoyable, and in some cases less of an aggravation.1) Allow the  sandbox mode to eliminate the regular invasions.  As of now the invasions occur about every 40-45 minutes, and they last quite awhile and often times early on it's just too much to handle without incurring some losses and more importantly the loss of time it takes to recover from said invasion.  If you are like me, and you've played through a campaign or two and you just want to build, the 40-45 minute invasions, while it may seem a long time is much much too regular and completely aggravating when all you want to do is clear out that last tunnel to make room for your long railroad. As of now, Tech mode, Sandbox, and the campaign all allow for these pesky massive invasions.2)More actual useful spells.  Magic light isn't all that helpful, imp spell doesn't help a whole lot and in some cases crashes the game, horn spell can be buggy.3)The AI is a bit odd, it would be nice to be able to assign multiple dwarves to specific tasks rather than have a few dwarves pass up the loot on the ground to go after that one block you qued up a long time ago at the very edge of the map.4)Speed up dwarf movement a bit or increase the carrying capacity.  I know the portal spell is suppose to remedy this situation for large mining excursions but damn they still move slowly when burdened and lug only, what 3 items?5)A second earlier back up save to each game might fix the problem I currently found myself into the game.  30 hours in and I have a critical crash bug at the point where the game decided to save.  So now any time I attempt to load this game it immediately crashes to desktop.  No I did not use imps, just 11 dwarves, massive invasions and way too much loot got to be a bit taxing I suppose.That's all from me I think, As I said before, I've really enjoyed the game and I highly reccomend it.  I really hope some of these issues are addressed in the future, and look forward to what's to come.			"

								Long Time ago... Terraria was Born.... i playd this a very long time, nights to days and so on.... an now here is Craft the World my absolute favorite at this time..... + very very many Recipes+ nice graphic + high playable - at the Beginning is it hard to beat.... Goblins to hard and the first 2 Monsterwaves are very strong - Try and Error at Beginning.... many Fails but every Fail is a learning situation xD The Following Cons are because of the Early Access and i hope this would be fixed - Magic Timer (i hope so.... than many TImes the portal runs out without my known)- Intelligent Wayfinder (at this stadium are my dwarfs stupidier than a nut)- Goblin invaders run beyond open Doors but Zombies not?and so on.... But this game is so very nice.... and i hope so that the potencial is used....(sorry for broken English...:) )			"

												One of the most addictive games you will ever play.To the oldies : Have you played Lemmings ? , well you will find lots of similarities with Craft The World.So lets review :+Addictive as Hell !!!!!!!!!+Very nice Graphics and Sounds +Easy to learn+Unique game+Lots of improvement since Early Access that I've made the first review + a DLC (which I am afraid I still haven't been able to obtain it , I hope I will it this xmas) Very nice job here Devs.Lets go to the few negative ones-Only 4 world in the main Campaign-Music repeated all the time-Task Bar is a bit hard to master I would love to see it expanded so more items could be inserted.In General the game is awesome , it is a definite YES to buy it , worth every cent , 100% of fun and Developers really into it and updating very often.Dear Devs I wish you the Best with more success.Thanks for a great game D.T From Hellas (Greece)			"

								Ребята, если любите симуляторы развития, то эта игруха точно про вас. Она стоит каждого рубля на неё потраченного. Обширное дерево технологий, несколько биомов (второй куда сложенее первого), русский разработчик постоянно улучшающий игру (в последние пару недель его не слышно, но такое бывает) и оперативно фиксящий баги, приятная графически и по геймплею.This is the perfect game about not direct building and crafting whre you just giving the tasks and all other ups to AI. Developer operatively fixes bugs and listens carefully for the users opinion, and implementing new features.			"

								I've had this game for a little while and I have to say that I think this is one of those good examples of Greenlight done well. The developer is prompt with updates, they're frequent and noticeable, and all of it enjoyable. More content keeps getting added to an already well polished game, and I think it'll just get better. Highly Recommend!			"

												The Video Game equivilant of crack! I've been a big fan of games like Terraria and Minecraft and Craft the World kinda/sorta falls into the same Catagory but actually has direction and in my oppinion a lot more challenge. You will find that after dedicating hours of your precious time (and losing sleep and those you love) the game does start to hit a repetative streak, but you can't help but fall for the same ""Just one more block!!"" feeling that you get in games like Minecraft.A really well made game that can entertain for days/weeks. I found it fairly bug free and the performance was fantastic. I had to turn the music off after a while as hearing the same song over and over as each day passess almost drivesy you to murder.  My only con is that after you've been stripped of your life force to the addictive nature of the game the repetition hits you and you will just suddently stop playing. That being said, you will give it a few weeks and find that you miss those Dwarves and owe it to them to return. :)One of the best and addictive games i've played in a long time.			"

								Awesome game. Now I'm not going to sit here and throw names like Minecraft and Terraria and Towns or Gnomoria at you......fiddlesticks, I just did. :p Look it's a little sprinkle of all of those titles with some great retro kids TV character animation. Been playing several hours and haven't felt that I was in an early access experience yet (you know the feeling). All current content looks polished and ready for the market and can't wait to see whats to come.Did I mention this is an awesome game?UPDATE Nov 2015: I am still playing and still enjoying this game after nearly 2 years. I can only say that about a few games spanning decades of play. Brilliant game.			"

Craft the World ReviewTL;DR - For those of you who don't want to read a ""wall of text"" this is for you. The game can be addicting, there is a lot to do, however, there is a lot of grinding involved and if you do not micromanage your dwarves later in the game you'll often find that they're off dying to something underground, on the surface or at night when you are telling them to go somewhere else to do something just because a ""threat"" is near the base.If you like grinding, repetative cycles of doing the same things over and over or mindless games where you click on things and watch your own personal minions...errr dwarves doing things then this game is for you. However, if ignorant AI killing themselves would seriously frustrate you then I would stay away from this game because later on the dwarves get their brains eaten by zombies.If you can master building a good base, good defenses early on, and get your dwarves with some decent gear on and pets (MUST HAVE SISTER IN ARMS DLC) then it can help a LOT. I highly recommend making everyone but your archers wear solid armor, shields and weapons. Otherwise the beholders and bigger skeletons make mince meat of your dwarves.The Long Rundown of CTWPositive:Immersive gameplay with a lot to do. There is a bit of a grind and it takes HOURS to get to different tech trees (although some of the tech trees make no sense like why do I have to know how to make beds before I can make a spear to have better weapons than a stick to bonk zombies on the head with) The more you unlock the better comfort you can have in your home and the happier your dwarves are in general when they rest, they rest quicker, and plus it does look nicer (who wants to sleep on a wooden shelf of a bed anyways).The graphics for the game are quite nice and it's lovely with soothing music and it flows together quite nicely.Early on when the monsters are NOT overpowered and you have a decent base up on a hill, a tower of stone (2-4 bricks thick) or something of similar nature then you're almost impervious (later on though it's quite awful we'll get to that later on) and you can have fun building, mining and etc without much of an issue. If you can get some walls up blocking the entrance to your base, and then make your base only have one entrance you can avoid some hordes, night raids and put lots of traps down to make the monsters suffer before they try to rush you and kill you. Later on though the monsters can be a bit difficult so learn the tech trees ASAP for better weapons arnd armor.There are a lot of helpful ""guides"" on Youtube and some people that can give tips on the forums/discussions. The player base is usually friendly and willing to help if you ask a question. There is a wiki on the game too that is also helpful.There are a lot of save files and you can do Multiplayer coop maps for more resources and things so you don't run out on your ""base map"" so you can keep going almost indefinately until you ""complete"" all the objectives like killing scroll keepers, finding underground areas to explore and other things. They now have a multiplayer DLC where you can ""survive"" with friends and build a base to defend against the monsters, renewable resource veins and some other things to do so there is more ""replay"" value if you have friends who play CTW.Negative:Dwarves as smart as a box of rocks, and I mean a box of rocks...even the box is made of rocks. Later on in the game you'll have dwarves run into Troll areas, into lava, or into other areas that they shouldn't even be in. Warning signs are your friends and you have to use them liberally otherwise all you hear is the dwarves ""battle cry"" and a message popping up saying "" x Dwarves have died"" and their little Dwarven souls flying away. If there is an area that is ""dangerous"" such as an ant hill, troll area, etc, then it is best to put warning signs on BOTH sides of the area (use portal spell to get the dwarves there) so they don't EVER try to go into that area. If you don't ""block it off"" then they're likely to run in there and try to 1 vs 10 ants just to get eaten.Monster waves becoming increasingly and liberally more overpowered and bigger later on. I mean every game should have a challenge but when you're at level 10, you can't make steel armor yet or anything that's decent comparable to the enemy waves and you have 20 skeletons knocking down your door, some flying gargoyles, giant trolls and beholders coming in to eat your face. You know it's time to pack up shop and use your ""horn spell"" and have your dwarves rally somewhere else (but then you run into problem 1 and they fight stupid stuff on the way and die sometimes).Finding resources underground can be a bit obnoxious at times. Sometimes you'll find BIG clusters of iron, other times you find a few sparse areas here and there and the biggest issue is when you find some but it's the lining around an ant colony. Good luck fighting them any time soon in the game to get resources. You'd best dig elsewhere or you'll be meat for the masses and they'll pick their ant mandibles with your Dwarven bones. To face those foes you need solid armor, weapons, and all your dwarves fighting them at once with your fireball spell to help clear them out (the Horn spell will rally the Dwarves to the area you want just make sure they have no other assignments anywhere before battling ant hills or boss monsters).NOOOOOOO in depth tutorial. There are a few tips here or there about ""use this thing, use this spell and make sure you upgrade Dwarves"" but there is no in depth ""use these weapons against this type of enemy, or use this armor for this type of person, or this Dwarf is best if you use him here, or there and etc. It would be nice to have an in depth tutorial guide (not campaign) that says what you need to know to learn, do better and not be stuck later on going ""how do I decontruct tools, or what's a horn spell do, and etc"" and you are left searching Youtube to find answers to things you don't know or spending a lot of time on the Wiki trying to figure out how to progress when you get stuck or run out of resources on single player only to learn you must make a new portal to go to a ""multiplayer"" world that you can go into alone to gather coins, come back, and purchase what you're missing, rinse and repeat.There is no guide to the icons above Dwarves heads. Sometimes they have no meanings but other times they do have specific meanings. Like a mountain with a blue arrow means they're trying to find a path to what they need to be doing. Sometimes they'll have the same icon over and over and I can only wonder what my tiny little min....errr Dwarves want or need.The ConclusionIt is an aboslutely FUN game, but later on in late games when the Dwarves all lose their brains, die and can't do anything without dying it becomes an ABSOLUTE game KILLER until you learn how to manage them, keep them out of harms way and it's frustrating for new players. Once you understand what to do it's okay. If the AI was a bit smarter, we could get some kind of Workshop mod to fix their pathing, judgements on decisions or an option to ""retreat sooner"" so they don't wait until they have low HP it would be great. For the standard gamer that wants to kick back, relax and have some fun I have to say it can be frustrating. Maybe they'll put in a tutorial, scale down monster waves,  or make tech tree pathing unlockable in different ways so you can get better armor, weapons and other items you NEED sooner.Hope you enjoyed the review and I hope you found it useful. Thanks for your time reading this review and have a great day! :D Edit 1  After purchasing SISTERS IN ARMS DLC the game is easier and more fun to play. I HIGHLY recommend the DLC to enjoy the game, so I am changing it to recommended.			"

												I *love* this game!  Very fun gameplay and kinda addictive too.  :)   The one thing I want the most in a next improvement would be the ability to rename the gnones.   This would help me to get attached to them more.   It does not really have any documentation on how to play, but this is good in a way because there is a lot of fun in figuring it out and especially satisfaction in learning how to be super efficient in it.  : )    The only problem I had in the game was there is not enough iron ore in the small size map and you need a lot of that over time.  But?  I found that certain colors of earth can give me all I need and more.			"

												Take the simulation, community management, and crafting aspects of games like Towns, Space Base DF9, and Gnomoria and the 2d graphics of terraria and wrap it in a very well designed interface and you have Craft the World. I have very few complaints about this game but here they are:- Gnomes sometimes fall through the floor if you are changing the shape of a wall piece they are standing on and they are unable to path their way out ofthe hole, you have to take control of that dwarfand jump out, quickly fix the hole and hope that another dwarf doesnt find his way in there while you are switching the block (pausing works but takes just as long to pause the game as it does to fix the hole)- Playing without the tech tree can leave you without some of the basic crafted materials until late in the game. I didnt get the recipe for clay untill after my dwarfs were decked out in silver armor and weapons.- There does not seem to be enough ore to go around in the small worlds, I found myself mining huge swaths of the underground to find a few pieces of iron or silver to finish an itemOn the plus side, this game was worth every cent og the $18.99 I paid for it. Craft the world fits every expectation I have for a crafting/simulation game and it stands strong where others have fallen short. - The game play is easy to learn and the in game tutorials hold your hand at the begining but then let you run free when you are ready - The Gnomes do a great job of collecting every single piece of material left behind, sometimes it takes a while if you have dug a huge hole, cut down a bunch of trees, and purchased some stuff from the shop. The dwarf's carrying capacity is very limited and carrying 3 leaves is the same to them as carrying 3 chunks of stone but they get the job done eventually. Sometimes you just have to sit back and watch them scurry around or use one of the magic spells to help them along. The portal and imp spells work great for gathering large amounts of material left in one place.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is actually very good and i've had plenty of fun playing it. Absolutely was worth it to get into the early beta, many games at this stage are not as well polished. There are bugs, and it seems they do updates fairly often that help. Personally, i've not gotten to the point where i've unlocked everything in game because enjoy the starting point of it so much that I keep restarting.			"

												Terraria style game but with a strategy game control scheme. You build a shelter for a growing number of dwarves as you explore a world by digging down, mining materials and using them to craft a large number of items to better equip your dwarves.Slow paced but highly addictive and hard to put down. The game is relaxing to play but presents a good challenge at times. Has a charming artstyle and seems to run well on a low end laptop too. "

								Love this game. Really, really really, hate the fact that I can't play it... at all... because it now won't even start up on my computer- I got to level 8 like 5 or 6 times, only to have it crash. Now I am sad. I know it is Beta, or Alpha... early anyway... but I really like it and want to play it, and for some reason it won't run.			"

												It's fun for what it is. A simple goal driven game with a random map generator to keep it intersting. I do wish the crafting was actually fun..It's not. it's just the means to get to the next level.   One gathers the required resources each round, craft, and go to the next harder level...with the exact same crafting goals.Even with that said, I do recommend this game, as I have had a lot of fun playing it. I LIKE resource gathering and hunting for that last boss room.			"

												When I first got this game I sat down to play it for about half an hour to try it out with the intent of moving on to other games I bought. Four hours later I was still playing XD It's definitely addictive and for all the right reasons.The game is straightforward in its mechanics and so I didn't have to muddle through a long drawn out tutorial. Just here, have some dwarves, you should build a shelter, and then further prompts were given through the missions/quests. Crafting recipes made sense and nothing was unreasonably expensive. The things that were expensive were either the really strong stuff or the luxury decorative stuff. I also really liked that wood was not slow to get. A lot of games that rely on crafting will have the trees grow unreasonably slow and since wood is a component in just about everything that can really drag you into a waiting game. In Craft the World the trees resprout quickly so it's just a matter of getting your dwarves out to cut them down.A lot of games like this will have you research a new technology and then after doing so give you the option to craft. This game skips that and you fully research a technology by crafting. Given that you don't have a huge number of dwarves to work with (so far I've gotten to 12 dwarves on the second world) this choice makes sense and frees up a dwarf from being stuck on a research table. Like the crafting recipes the tech tree has a reasonably logical progression.Equipping them is also straightforward with your usual grading up from leather and stone to iron and onwards to mithril. There's a good mix of melee, archers, and mages. The difficulty curve on the monsters matches fairly well, you don't see or can avoid the stronger enemies until your dwarves are reasonably outfitted. Once you hit level 4 you do get monster portals which unleash a wave of monsters on you so proper planning and fortification of your dwarves' home is a must, but that's what online tutorials are for XD It does get a little rough after a while when three portals are opening at once, but you can either build a stupidly thick wall with eight doors or go into the game files and tweak the numbers so the waves aren't quite as brutal.That's really the only major sticking point, though, and as I said there's options! It's definitely not enough to bother me for long. There are a few tiny bug issues, like sometimes when you call the dwarves home they'll get stuck, but if you take control of that dwarf for a second they bounce back and are cool, things like that which take a second to fix if that. Honestly the thing that annoys me is that there's no way to delete or possibly break down for resources older gear. My kids are running around with mithril, they don't need ten stone axes cluttering up the inventory XD But again, that's a nitpick and nothing that kills it.What I was pleasantly surprised about was the curve up. In campaign you have four planets that you unlock one by one. I was a little worried that the only difference in the second world was going to be a slightly larger map and maybe a few more monsters. However then out of nowhere the screen shook and my dwarves nearly got eaten and I probably shouldn't be as excited about that as I was XD There's tweaks to things with the second world and I expect the same will be true of the next two worlds to keep things interesting.I've owned this game a very short time and have already logged 50 hours on it. I definitely recommend it, just set an alarm to remind you to go to sleep sooner or later XD			"

DisclaimerAll that's following is an impression of a person who hasn't played MineCraft, Terraria, Starbound or any similar games so far.Addicting, incredibly addicting… Before start please be sure you currently don’t have important things to do.It’s about: helping little dwarfs to survive in dangerous world(s) by exploring it and developing technologies and themselves; crafting, crafting, crafting; “city management”, but in 2D and only on a scale of one house (or shelter); get into troubles.Why you should play this: because it’s good for you to help someone who’s smaller and can’t stand for oneself without getting a hand; you like crafting-oriented games; it’s just adorable to see how your dwarfs go through all troubles and conquering dangerous world; you’ve always wanted to try something like Starbound or Terraria, but they look for you either too big (content-overloaded) or ugly (I’m sorry, but it’s true); unlike Terraria or Starbound it offers indirect control - you just plan and point what to do, no reason to play solo on your keyboard or gamepad; unlike in Terraria, items and menus quite large - no reason to screw up your eyes; May, 21 - 4th world was added: finally, we can have GUNS and different craft tree. Why you may not like it: Terraria and Starbound veterans will be insulted with the amount of content for crafting and lack of opportunities; the craft tree is almost the same in first 3 worlds (there are a few tenuous changes): you develop it to maximum in one world, fix the portal to travel to another world and all that only for starting everything from scratch with the same technologies to explore; in my opinion it would be better to change not only the world's weather conditions but also time and add something truly new into craft tree; now there are 4 worlds available for playing – there’re no hints on any kind of story or campaign: you just have to travel from one world to another and survive walking through the same stages of developing, it makes the game quite monotonous; it doesn’t contain any save option up to your request: your actions are final, all your mistakes stay with you - you can’t replay it, game saves your progress only when you leave it; it’s probably will take over 130 hours to beat 4 worlds (25-35 hours per world plus replays if you want all of the achievements).Despite all flaws it’s fun, it’s entertaining – if you remember yourself playing Tamagotchi (or at least you know what it is), then give it a chance: highly likely you won’t regret.

												Just picked this up today in the Steam Summer Sale... for the short amount of time that I've played so far (2.5 hours) I've had a good game.  Its sort of a ""light"" dwarf fortress with graphics and such.  Seems to be amazing so far, intuitive controls, nice music and graphics, fun gameplay.   I think I'm really going to like this one.  I'll be streaming more of it and will make a final decision on whether or not I can personally recommend it, but for now I'll say thumbs up.Review date is 6/15/2015, will respond to this review as I learn more about the game...p.s. been really looking forward to getting this game (Have seen it on YouTube) and jumped on it when it went on sale.  I'm a variety streamer and this looks like an ideal addition to my library.			"

Early Access Review
								When I saw this game, I immediately thought that I'd just have to buy it. And I did. But at the moment (early access), this game is annoyingly confusing.There is no tutorial, so unless you went searching for a guide/walkthrough on Steam or Youtube, you'll just have to play guess work.Pros:1. Nice cute graphics.2. Random map/terrain for new game (I think, didn't really finish the two I games I started).3. Tech tree is quite expansive.Cons:1. So hard to build a simple shelter. Need level up techs of several items before you can build a shelter with wooden walls. I would have thought that the shelter would be the easiest to build. At least a basic one that you can upgrade later on.2. Leveling up the tech tree is quite confusing. You need several of the same item before you get to level up.3. Drag-and-drop system in crafting. It should be simple like auto-deducted from inventory.4. No 'rally' system to gather the dwarves at a set point (before shelter). Unless there is one, and I missed it (can't tell since there is no tutorial). Had to resort to controlling them individually to get them underground and close hatch when the monsters arrive.5. No tutorial level I won't give it a down vote since it is still in its early access. I really, really want to enjoy this game; I hope the next updates will make it better. At least have a tutorial where we can get the basics right.			"

												Craft the World is fun if a little bit weird. It's a bit like Terraria combined with Gnomoria.You have your dwarves and get more as you unlock recipes or meet other goals. You harvest, craft, dig and fight off timedi nvasions of skeletons and other nasty critters. You don't really directly control your dwarves, you tell them what to do and they SLOWLY do it. Sound simple? Well, it is...sort of. Recipes get more complex. The monsters get tougher and there are more and more of them. You dig down further and further, meaning you need to find ways to get your dwarves back to the surface quickly. You expand your operations, putting greater and greater needs on basic resources like food, ore and wood. There's an element of luck with what you may find, meaning that you face roadblocks that you have to find ways around.The real ""gateway"" in the game are the crafting recipes.You need to create a few of them in any given cateogry to advance to more complicated recipes in that category. Once you're at the end...well, I'm not going to spoil it for you but that's how you need to win. So the race is on between moving quickly enough to get the recipes before being overrun on the timed invasions. The game never felt frantic, but it did feel far more hectic and the end than during the leisurely beginning.The dwarves are cute, the sounds ok and overall it's a nice little package. The crafting interface can get a bit cumbersome but overall it works well enough. And there's enough things to build that you can create some interesting areas. Mind you it's more limited than some games but there's more than enough here. Personally, I only completed the first world. Going to the next one felt redundant. So while I'll ""only"" get 20 hours or so out of this, I got more than my money's worth because I bought it for less than $10 and those 20 hours were quite enjoyable.Looking for a cute Terraria/Gnomoria type of game with a colorful interface and isn't too challenging? Then this is for you. Enjoy.			"

												Craft The World is a survival sandbox game.  At the beginning of a level, you are given a single dwarf with no skills to boss around.  After certain milestones, your population increase one by one.  This game is challenging and frustrating at the same time.  I had to fail and retry over and over just to finish the first level.  This game is not really about building but more on survival.  There are some cave explorations and boss fights to do but they aren't the highlight of this game.  Resource balancing is crazy tough and you would really have to be very frugal with how you use each one of your resources.  For instance, not all my dwarves had the best pickaxes but only the professional diggers (even though they all dug at some point) or not all my dwarves had the toughest armors unless they were melee fighters.  Dwarves running out of food or lacking sleep can easily cost you your base that you've worked hard to build up.  There is a goal to this game though: open the portal to the next level.  The parts of the portal are scattered underground and you typically would have to defeat an end-game boss to acquire those parts.  I believe there are 5 levels - all in different setting but the same repetitive task.  Overall, this game was fun because of the challenge behind it but after defeating 1 level, I don't think I'm up to do another one again.  It is much too repetitive and the dwarves move so agonizingly slow.  Getting things done is an epic pain.  While this wasn't entirely boring, I'd recommend anyone who wants to try this to buy it on sale.			"

I need water to build a forge so I can further the tech tree. I buy the water from the shop with a few coins I have because you need to finish the forge before you get the tree that allows you to melt the ice for water.

They don't always attack as they should, either.Overall: 7/10-Paladeus			"

								This is a beautiful exploring, strategy, and adventure game that is honestly a ton of fun!  It's randomly generated worlds means that no two games will be the same.  You gather resources to try and craft weapons, armor, and a home.  You can build your home above, or below ground.  However, watch out for the night when the baddies come out, and also watch that timer that shows when the most dangerous baddies will invade you and try to destroy everything you've worked so hard to accumulate and build up!Watch my 1 hour+ video as I play and demonstrate this game my first time for a good idea of how it all works...

YouTube™ Video: Craft the World - first impressions gameplay guide DWARVES GET WOOD!!! 

			Views: 205		



I have played this for almost 20 hours now, it took me most of that time just to complete the first world, not sure that I really want to go through the whole process again in another world. There's a lot of really good things about this game which are enough to make it a cool game. But there are also areas which I believe could be improved, changed or added to.The games not 3D but I have no major problem with the graphics.-----But judging by the look of things I couldn’t help but feeling that mobile devices were probably in mind. Because of stuff like the size and simplicity of icons and menu items, and the lack of tool tips, as if it’s meant to be easy to use with a touch pad. My concern with this is that it could detract from having more detailed features in interfaces.-----You can zoom out quite far. This seems to be really well implemented. Although everything becomes much smaller, you can distinguish different tiles very easily and see where monsters and your dwarves are. You can still manage your dwarves well from this perspective. You're not having to switch back and forth to a map where you lose control, which is pretty cool.I really like the idea of the game Dwarf Fortress. I've tried that but I couldn’t get my head around it. This is a lot more accessible albeit much simpler and features less depth.-----I also loved the old Dungeon keeper game and this reminded me of it. You also virtually build a dungeon in this. The Dwarves are a lot like the old Imps in Dungeon Keeper. You give them tasks in just the same way. Casting spells works very similarly too.-----The game has a tech tree. Each time you reach a new tech you are provided with recipes for the new items they unlock. So you don’t have to look up the wiki on an internet browser.-----But I don’t see the need for a minecraft style crafting grid in the first place. It’s not even as well implemented e.g. you have to slowly place the materials one at a time. In addition recipes just seem to be spoon fed to you so there is no difficulty in finding them. It kind of makes sense in a game like minecraft where it’s sort of like a simulation of assembling materials to craft items. But in this case your peasant dwarves should be taking care of these particulars lol (but seriously!)-----Also I don’t think the game should necessarily pause when are you in the inventory or crafting screens. The crafting grid would be more forgivable if your dwarves kept working on tasks you gave them while have to mess around with it.-----This being a side scroller, I sort of feel restricted only being able to move in four directions Sometimes I kind of wish the game had a third dimension. It would give it more depth, get it?! (but no seriously!). Maybe not a whole extra dimension lol. But perhaps mine entrances found on the map which would allow your dwarves to access instances much smaller than the main world where more ore and loot could be found.-----Next, you don’t seem to be able to move your stockpile. This is annoying if you want to build a Dwarf Fortress underground. This is where you would think dwarves would do so, right? Presumably this is to prevent you exploiting enemy A.I. which might have trouble reaching your base underground.-----There needs to be a better way to micromanage your dwarves. The only way I could see to do so was to cycle through them one at a time. A detailed list of your dwarves would be nice so that you could just look over it and quickly see who needs equipment, as well as their health, hunger and tiredness.-----The game has a tutorial system, but I can’t really remember it helping me nearly as much as all the recipes provided by unlocking new tech. As long as you can get your head around a few concepts you shouldn't really have a problem figuring out what to do. It also has ‘notes’ aka an in-game guide which I think should be broken up into dot-points or something so that it’s easier to follow.-----Dwarves must retrieve everything that you instruct them to place from the stockpile. I think that’s a good mechanic. But when you equip them with items such as tools and armour, they don’t need to go and get them from the stockpile. I think it would be cool if the game went one more step and made it so that your dwarves had to collect gear from the stockpile, rather than having it magically appear on them.-----This game has no multiplayer. I would really like to be able enjoy this game with a friend somehow.-----Regular game-speed is like slow motion, I virtually have it at a constant 2 times speed (the maximum). I would like to be able to speed the game up even faster, because I still often found myself doing nothing but waiting for my dwarves.-----I really liked that dwarves' skills progressed. It meant that they weren't expendable and was an incentive to protect them. But there behaviour tended to be counter intuitive e.g. mages blacksmithing instead of your smith. I think you should have more control over your dwarves e.g. be able restrict your smith to the shelter so that their role is limited only to crafting items. -----I think a lot of things on the tech tree should be optional or unlocked coincidentally. I spent way too much time building things that I didn't need or want, in order to progress through the tech tree e.g. decorative items in order to unlock mithril. The tech tree has some small non-linear features but ultimately tech progression is completely linear.-----Higher tier techs can be hard to acquire due to a limited amount of finite resources i.e. you may have trouble finding enough iron to craft items needed to make progress. Once you've crafted an item there is no way to get the resources back and eventually I exhausted every vein of ore and coal. -----The end game (i.e. of a world) wasn't very satisfying. You lose all your progress and begin from scratch in the next world. This is where I've stopped because I don't really want to have to go through the tech tree again.-----The best thing about this game was that your dwarves are basically autonomous. You just say what you want done and they will take care of it. I really like being the one pulling the strings, rather than doing all the labour solo.-----If I find the time I'm going to try out a custom game using different options, this may address some of the issues I had with the tech tree and lack of resources.Click here for my YouTube gaming channel			"

												Dwarf colony sim. You start with a few amount of dwarf with no equipment. You have to build/dig a base so the dwarves have somewhere to stay when the monsters come. You will get more dvarves when you level up. You will have to get better gear so the dwarves survive and then you can explore so you can find more stuff.			"

												After playing the starter campaign for several hours, I'm pretty frustrated.Crafting is painful: if you want to create something you first have to manually create all the components.I'm used to Factorio style crafting, where you choose the recipe you want and it automatically makes the components.Combat is painful: I can't seem to issue orders to individual dwarves!When a battle happens, I want to collect everyone into a group, but instead they sort of charge haphazardly into combat as they trickle in to the area. So far I've won, but only because I'm playing on 'easy' difficulty.Equipment is painful too. I can make a fancy smithing apron and put it on a dwarf, but how do I know if that dwarf will assign himself to smithing duties? If I put a smithing apron on a dwarf and that dwarf starts walking halfway across the map to mine a dirt block, I've wasted my time.Keeping everyone healthy is difficult! Left to their own devices, they don't seem to rest. Five minutes before a battle, I have to manually click on everyone and tell them to go take a nap so they'll be ready.Building my fortress is kind of fun, but it would be more fun if the comfort rules worked better. My fortress is an expanse of wide hallways full of chairs, because chairs give +2 comfort and there doesn't seem to be a cap.There's a huge sprawling tech tree ahead of me, and I can kind of envision how the rest of the game will work -- sending dwarves down to mine resources so I can build tech levels, bringing them back up to fight off skeletons. I wonder if there's a way to build an unassailable fortress, either deep underground or up in the sky, so the skeletons can't get to it? But I'm not having enough fun to keep playing.			"

								Considering this is still early access and it does come with a few bugs/issues this game is absolutely a massive hit in my eyes. A fantastic game I highly recommend.If I had to compare it to anything I would say it is Terria cross Gnomoria. You need to build and survive while trying to find the broken portal. In order to complete the level you need to repair it via finding patterns from the boss's scattered across the map.There is currently 3 campaign levels and an open world sandbox mode. The game has tons of potential!  "

								First off I have had fun playing this. (written while still Early-Access)I don't like the built-in (very obvious) micro-transaction-system, I mean I'm playing it on a PC, so why would I be fronted with that system, I couldn't even pay if I tried?On the other hand, that is not such a big problem after the first ""grind"" of getting things started is taken care of.A few hours in you start noticing it is a game still-in-development, not a lot of game-breaking-errors but a few, some are solved by exiting and reopening your saved-game.Some are graphical (UI 30-50% gone), some are obvious scripting-issues with path-finding and prioritization that is probably not completed or even implemented. Some are objects in the game, that for some reason does not apply yet / at this stage.But it is fun, you don't finish a session in a short time (can go on for a loooong time), and with hard work they will definitely finish a very good game. Adding features and polishing things are the priorities they should maintain, imo.			"

								I would highly recommend this game. It should be noted that the game is still in early access. However, the game is already extremely well polished. The controls are straight forward and the way that the inventory system works, it never makes you feel like you have to consult google to find out how to build something as you do in minecraft and other such games. The game also has a way of easing you into it instead of dropping you into hell right off the bat. Nothing comes close to this game and I honestly find that when Im not playing it I look forward to the next time of playing that. Something few games can attest to.One final thing I want to say and that is the thing The Devs are doing VERY right; 1) they listen to the community 2) they patch the game quite frequently and stay on top of issues and bugs			"

Early Access Review
								Hello steam community :)I have decided to make my first review and the game is Craft the world. So far I have been playing the game for around 25 hours and it is starting to get boring now. The game is a 2d based survival/crafting game with a daily cycle where monsters spawn during the night. The monsters get a bit tougher the longer you play, but to be hornest it isnt realy a challenge. When not fighting monsters you are collecting materials in order for you to progress through out the techtree. The techtree is very long and even though I have spent many hours playing I have not yet finnished the techtree(mostly because of restarts). When you are collecting resources under the ground you will sometimes find secret caves, one of these caves will hold a damaged portal. To finnish a map you will have to repair the portal by obtaining different artifacts from monsters in other caves. Which you will need  some late game equipment for.All in all it is a good game but mostly because of the prise, I think i got it for 3-4 euro. There seems to be missing a storyline or something that keeps you playing. There is a lot of waiting in the game and sometimes it feels like you are just building stuff you dont need, in order to complete the techtree. I belive this game is still in alpha stage so I guess there will be some fixes in the future.I recommend this game based on the time played vs the money spent on the game. I hope someone can use my review :D "

								Craft The World is yet another world builder game in the huge list of games in the genre. Despite this, it does manage to add completely new things in the vein of simplicity. For example, play as an RTS overmind rather than one character, and although the player is given a similar room system to Terraria in which the player must build a room with an entrance to be able to construct beds for sleeping and tables for eating, it adds a new comfort system where the objective is to raise the comfort levels within the room. The comfort system is pretty much raised by advancing a cool crafting tree, though it's pretty large, so if you want to complete it-it will take a while.Which brings me to what's not so good about the game. I have had the room system bug out on me as it keeps getting confused as to where the rooms actually are. I've had dwarves ask where their own beds are when they're standing right next to them. So I would definitely not recommend this game until they fix it. However I love the game and enjoyed spending many hours with it.			"

								TL;DR: I know what you're thinking, but this game is really fun and way less cheesy than you're assuming.I haven't spent an enormous amount of time with this title yet. I was put off by the hokey facebook-smart-phone feel of the art, and the game is obviously being created with touch screens in mind. I've heard people complain about the developer creating lots of spammy fluff games, and my googling has proven the complaints to be true. Somewhere, I saw a commenter defend the devs by offering that as a dev, you're often forced into undesirable positions because, hey, you have to pay the rent somehow. I can definitely relate, though I know next to nothing about that poster or the developers, so I can't say how true that statement is.I can, however, tell you that this game is very, very fun! I bought the game assuming it would be a slightly hardcore strategy-sim. I loaded it up, saw the goofy art style, and muttered a ""god damn it."" to myself. I hit play anyway, and 45 minutes later I realize I'm engaged and having a lot of fun!This is a casual strategy/sim game, but offers plenty of depth and flexibility regardless of the ""casualness."" Very accessible for strategy virgins, and enough challenge and creativity for hardcore strategy gamers.			"

								Craft the World is an almost finished and well polished Early Access game, sounds like not right, right !Visually; graphic design and color palette is to my taste, cute, warm colors and roundy.Sound effects & Music; not too bad but there is still room to developGAMEPLAY; well this is the tricky part.  You should invest sometime to understand how you manage your dwarves as your control over them is mostly not direct (you can control an individual dwarf directly but its not the essence of Craft the World). Understanding management of your dwarves is essential as the pace of the game feels like a bit sluggish at the beginning. After starting to collect vast amount of resources quickly, it becomes easier to devise your subterrenian stronghold (or sky reaching) and it's surroundings. That is where the fun begins for me!Game has crashed a couple of times so far but other than this, not seen any major bugs or issues.My only serious complaint would be pricing; as I am not sure if this is a £12.00'er  game. I would happily pay an 8 or a 9er. Apart from pricing issue, keeping in mind that this is still  a (finished !) Early Access game, I am overall happy with Craft the World!			"

								I can't believe this is an early beta.  Yes, there are a few glitches-- big tip: leave your dwarves multiple exits in case of a pathfinding oops, which is indicated by an icon overlay-- but the amount of polish in this is really surprising.  First of all, the graphics are gorgeous.  There are no-- absolutely no-- graphics options to twiddle.  It starts up in HD (or, presumably, whatever you support) with a beautiful soundtrack and excellent artwork.  The tutorial doesn't ""talk"" you through much of anything, the interface succeeds by following the ""seven plus or minus two rule"", where there are few enough things on the screen at once that you can almost always figure it out.  Crafting has a brilliant layout where you drop the ingredients in the rough shape of the object and the icon appears to double-check; you can look up a recipe, but if you remember what you want (which is easy, for frequently needed items), it's really.  I'm a Terraria nut and wasn't sure how I'd like a cross between Lemmings and Terraria, but honestly, your little guys really are smart enough to be pretty useful.  It's a lot of fun, and definitely worth the money if you like these kind of games.  At the very least, it'll last you until Starbound comes out!			"

								I was somewhat hesitant to purchase this game on early access, but having spent a few hours with it I must say the game is very polished and somewhat addicting.At first blush you may feel like this game belongs on a tablet but after you play for a bit you will quickly realize there is a level of depth in the simulation that makes the game a real challenge at times. The level of detail is outstanding and there is so much to keep you interested and busy in the game I keep coming back for more. It is a great game to have open even if you can't devote 100% attention to it..just set your dwarves to work and you can easily browse the web or talk on the phone. But be careful because once nightfall arrives you may need to turn your focus to fighting off a zerg of enemy mobs.I am especially enjoying the campaign mode as it provides a good introduction to the crafting system and slowly opens up the world allowing you time to build up your resources. I do wish things were explained a bit better but at this stage in the development the game does a great job of walking you through.The developers did a great job with this gem of a game and they are very active with providing updates to the game. I am hopeful the dev's will add a few convenience features and better help text to the game, especially as it relates to building a suitable shelter early on in the game. But overall the game is very enjoyable and playable upon early release. Don't let the tablet style game graphics turn you off to this game. Give it a try and you won't be sorry! "

Early Access Review
								Early Access, Massive Fun!After riding the fence for a long time, I finally purchased this game based on the reviews and videos posted. The price seemed high (for me), but the game appeared to be exactly what I was looking for. I have only played a couple of hours so far, so this review is based primarily on first impressions.Pricing - A little high for my taste in games, but VERY much worth the cost. Especially if the developers continue their updates as frequently as they have done in the past. I was hesitant to pay so much for an incomplete game, but the finished portions of the game are well worth the price. And, unlike other Early Access Games I have bought, this game does not suffer from the glitches and crashes that I've experienced with other developers.Graphics - Simplistic, but effective. Everything is clear and runs smoothly. Thus far, I have had no hangups, freezes, or game crashes (playing on a WIn 8 64-bit laptop). My actual gametime is still low, so I may encounter issues further on. But, none of the technical issues that have been detailed in the forum have affected me yet.Sound - I can't really comment because I always turn the music off and lower sound effects in a game before I begin playing. I like the fact the you can adjust the ambient sounds, sound effects, and music separately. I would recommend leaving the sound effects turned on so you can hear the advancing enemies coming towards you (from off-screen).You start with a single dwarf dropped on an island. Immediately, you begin chopping trees and bushes for wood and food. Then digging into the ground to build your fortress. As you gather supplies, you can begin crafting items - better tools, weapons, armor, both decorative and useful items, etc. The list is impressive - hatches, bridges, workbenches, cooked food, furniture. Complete your tasks to advance your tech tree. As you level up, you'll receive additional dwarves to help out. And drops will randomly include textbooks to teach your dwarves new skills (each dwarf is allowed three learned skills, one is already included when they first arrive).The crafting system is very well done. Though I have not attempted the sandbox mode yet, I've read that the requirements and layout of the crafting grid must be memorized. I'm not sure that I'll like that part whenever I try it. You drag the needed materials into a grid to craft an item, but placement of the materials is important. Two crafted items may require the same ingredients placed in different positions on the grid. If you place them wrong, you may craft something other than what you were attempting.Personally, I prefer the exploration, building, and crafting over the fighting and defense aspects of any game. CtW allowed me a few day cycles to grow before throwing the enemy armies at me. There were ghosts and skeletons and zombies early in the game, but they are easily dispatched. Or, you can hide in your fort until morning when they leave. I finally quit my first run in the game when the first enemy portal opened - with armored skeletons, pirate ghosts, giant zombies, and (gasp!) a Beholder! My dwarves survived the night, but barely. I did not have enough beds for all of them (I did not explore enough of the world to find the supplies I needed).That first major wave of enemies was enough for me to exit the game. Not out of frustration, but because I felt that I had learned enough to do better the next run. LOLI can't recommend this game enough. My favorite game has been Lantern Forge, though it has some stability issues that have not been corrected yet (crashing after a short time playing). Craft the World, for an Early Access Game, plays like a final product. I can foresee many hours of my life lost whilst in this game world.A few suggestions for improvements: 1. Allow re-naming the individual dwarves for a more 'personal' experience. Possibly add some limited customization of their appearance & skills.2. Allow a 'roll-around' scrolling through your dwarves. My newest dwarf is always the one that needs the newly created weapon or armor. It would be nice to back-arrow to him rather than scroll through each of my other dwarves.3. Identify when an onscreen item belongs to a specific dwarf. I may have missed something, but I only had four beds for my six dwarves (due to a lack of grass) and the last two dwarves would not use the open beds. Apparently, another dwarf had 'claimed' it first. I have not found a way to determine ownership.4. Definitely open the Store. Even if you can only trade for decorative items or clothing options.			"

								The dwarves are absolutely stupid, and that is the only flaw I can think of. Portal management and the summon spell helps alleviate their stupidity, and the devs have improved the drawves' pathfinding and AI a lot since I first started playing it. Try to think of their stupidity as a challenge. ""Help these stupid dwarves stay alive!""Love the game, and the animations are really cute. Relaxing, and has huge potential. The frequent updates are definitely a plus, too!			"

								ok so i have played tell the last world (note 3 world's forest ice and sand) it was fun up un tell you get to were you need iron but the world only spawns in so much, you can't craft everything because of this. It's mainly a rush to get armor weapons and tools, then go on to the next world (you half to restart btw when you go to a new world) waves of monsters spawn and if you don't have 5 dwarfs with at least wood armor you will lose 1-3 dwarfs. game moves really slowly even with 2x speed (note its f1 f2 and f3 to speed up no idea why no one just asks) biggest thing i hate is, mana regen witch is use for your spells, It takes 5 mins to regen 1 mana of real time not game time. The wiki says that your mana is meant to regen even when your not playing, but gets bugged every update. o and the lovely crafting tree even if you are starting another game or world the crafting tree needs to be reunlock every time and even if you know the recipe it will not let you craft it tell you unlock the category.all and all it was fun while it lasted, but gets boring when you try to reply it, needs to have an unlock for the crafting tree after you finish the last world. 6/10 not worth more then $10 hope to see mod support later on, and more updates to add more worlds and more items and magic. might update review later on.

								Nothing about this is ""early access"".  Having played it CONSTANTLY for a week now, it is more polished and has more features than most ""finished"" games that have had half a dozen patches and DLCs.I'm actually sorry I bought this on sale, they have provided me way more entertainment value than what I paid for it.  If my friends don't buy it I'll buy it for them partially to support the developers of this game.After Minecraft, I needed a fix.  Once I found Terraria, I was in love.  Since then I have bout a dozen ""similar"" games found nothing that I wanted to play.This isn't Terraria, you have a dwarves and you get more and more, not one character/you playing, but definitely scratches the itch of that genre.  Though is some ways Terraria was better, in other ways this is a heck of a lot better!!			"

								Imagine Terraria except instead of controlling a single player character you give directions to a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dwarves.

								Hello All, This game is a lot of fun, if you don't at least beat the first level then you shouldn't even post a review. 2 thumbs up in its current state, even with the bugs that early access comes with. This game does have an option to speed up play for those who don't know. I typically play at 2x speed. There is a lot to get out of the game if you give it a chance. The artwork is funny the leveling system is the typical exponential XP leveler. So getting over level 13 will be almost impossible. The typical board should last around 20 hrs at 2x speed. Every 45 minutes of game time the game ramps up the difficulty. If you think you found the best defense think again, the AI seems to adapt. The first 3 levels are all different and the map sizes are also customizable if you play custom. So overall for an early access I have enjoyed this game longer than a ton of full releases. I have to admit that I plan on playing this game for way over 200 hours. For $15 that means I paid only 7.5 cents for each hour of fun. For the price of 3 coffees at Starbucks you too can enjoy this game for 200 hours. as well. Thank you all for reading.-Phatty			"

								Craft the World is what you get when Dwarf Fortress and Terraria go to a show, get wicked drunk, and proceed to hook up. The offspring of this demonic pairing is a game in which you work towards a Terraria-like goal (except with a tech tree in the place of bosses), but you ultimately have no direct control of your builders.If you enjoy a crafting/building game with a good amount of challenge, but moves at a relatively slower pace, this is likely for you.

												So Far I'm addicted to this game so I highly recommend it. My friend had it and I did a ""trial play"" with it. You can get trapped for HOURS playing if you don't mind the clock. I love the multi dwarf control and leveling aspect. Very much so like many other crafting games such as gnomoria, terraria, minecraft, etc but still with it's own special individuality. You can be very attentive or pretty lazy if you'd like. The game allows you to lay out tasks for the dwarves to do and so long as they're fed and well rested they do their own thing. Mind the clock however; swarms come every 40 mins or so as well as creatures during the dark. Unlocking new crafting tiers seems to be a chore later on as you level though but still fun.All in all a wonderful game!			"

								EDIT: The AI is improving, but the crafting grid still bugs me til no end. Might sound a bit extreme, but it can be a dealbreaker. I do like this game and I can recommend it to any fans of the genre, there are only two things that bug me about it.1. The AI is braindead. This is mostly annouying when giving orders to your dwarfs and they do it in a nonsensical order, as far as i am aware you can't priorotize tasks either, which makes controlling the basterds a hassle sometimes.2. WHY IS THERE A 3X3 CRAFTING GRID?? It adds abosolutely nothing to the gameplay, in fact its annouying. In Minecraft it makes sense, because you can guess recipies and stuff, here you have to research them before you can use the recepies.  For the love of god get rid of it.			"

Other wise watching your dwarfs drown cause they couldnt build a roof in time or killed by spiders cause you dug too deep too quick armed only with a stick is absolutly hilarious. Next time this game is on sale you should pick it up if you thought minecraft would be fun if you could control multiple dwarfs.			"

								This is the first ever review I have written for any game. I have been playing CTW for the last few days after acquiring it during a Steam Summer Sale. I have become thoroughly addicted since. This game is an almost perfect marriage of Strategy, role-playing and building sim. I look forward to seeing where this goes in the future with more content being promised. This is definitely worth the early purchase, and puts most other ""early acces"" games to shame with the sheer amount of replayability and fun it has in its current incomplete state.			"

								Crafting games are quickly becoming (or have already become) a dime a dozen in the wake of successes like Minecraft or Terraria. So one has to be careful picking up another title, and early access to boot.But you can't go wrong with this title.Craft the world presents with high quality visuals, is smooth and intuitive. Visually the game is very appealing!Gameplay is also very easy to pick up. At present the tasks do seem a bit haphazard, but serve well to drive the game forward.A little bit of Civilisation is apparent in the technologies that need to be unlocked granting access to better equipment and decorations.In short, you can look forward to plenty of gameplay and enjoyment in this title. Definitely an easy title to recommend!			"

It's a mix of minecraft and terrarria, but in my opinion, much more fun. With a large list of recipe's, many different playing styles, and the advent of multiplayer, id have to say this is one of best games ive played hands down. Have a few hours to kill? Try it, it seems like only minutes until you look at the clock. 9/10 easy.			"

For something so simple, it is incredible how long you can stay up just trying to finish that one more thing :)The game has its flaws, the AI is so stupid you sometimes want to hit your head against the walls just looking at your dwarfs doing everything but the thing you want them to do... Despite this, I love the game. The difficulty can get quite hard, but never is it too much, just enough to present you with a challenge and to encourage you to expand and build even more ridiculous stuff. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who has a lot of time to kill and likes to give way for his creativity.			"

I haven't had an issue with the dwarf A.I.; they do pretty much what I tell them to within the bounds of the system. They can't break a rock if there is another rock blocking it, or if it is not within reach. Lots of crafting, killing, and experimentation. What's there not to like?			"

Early Access Review
								Hello All, This game is a lot of fun, if you don't at least beat the first level then you shouldn't even post a review. 2 thumbs up in its current state, even with the bugs that early access comes with. This game does have an option to speed up play for those who don't know. I typically play at 2x speed. There is a lot to get out of the game if you give it a chance. The artwork is funny the leveling system is the typical exponential XP leveler. So getting over level 13 will be almost impossible. The typical board should last around 20 hrs at 2x speed. Every 45 minutes of game time the game ramps up the difficulty. If you think you found the best defense think again, the AI seems to adapt. The first 3 levels are all different and the map sizes are also customizable if you play custom. So overall for an early access I have enjoyed this game longer than a ton of full releases. I have to admit that I plan on playing this game for way over 200 hours. For $15 that means I paid only 7.5 cents for each hour of fun. For the price of 3 coffees at Starbucks you too can enjoy this game for 200 hours. as well. Thank you all for reading.-Phatty			"

								Craft the World is what you get when Dwarf Fortress and Terraria go to a show, get wicked drunk, and proceed to hook up. The offspring of this demonic pairing is a game in which you work towards a Terraria-like goal (except with a tech tree in the place of bosses), but you ultimately have no direct control of your builders.If you enjoy a crafting/building game with a good amount of challenge, but moves at a relatively slower pace, this is likely for you.

Early Access Review
								I tend to buy Early Access games and only play them in their current state.  I don't often return to games (mainly due to massive backlog and I don't stick with one game too long).In it's current state as of 2014.06.26, I've spent ~20 hours on this game.  It's at the top of my most played for the current Steam sale, so I think that's saying something positive about the game.I enjoy the ""spells"" - Imps can haul stuff, a rally point can be placed (vital against enemy armies), and most valuable is a portal spell massively cuts downtime, and I feel is a much better replacement for any sort of speed controls (except pause!).  When relying on speed controls, I'm basically sitting there *not* playing the game.  The pace can be a bit slow, especially in the beginning, but as more Dwarves are added, I find it more fun to spend my time micromanaging them.  The ability to play as a Dwarf removes any ""wait"" time, as I can possess a poor soul, and work him to death (it's great that I'm able to plop down anything from inventory while controlling a Dwarf, which removes the need for me to manually walk alllllll the way back to the stockpile, then allllllllll the way back to where I need to place it).  Exploring is fun, even though manually digging through a line of blocks can be tedious.Enemy waves are great - I love ""defend the fort"" games, so applying a bit of pressure from monsters keeps the game alive for me.  The game turns into a tower defense during invasions sometimes.Of course, the main ""feature"" of the game is crafting.  I'm able to get through the current crafting tree at a decent pace, although I question the placement of quite a few technologies.  Why is farming so far into the tree?  Twice now, by the time I've reached the ability to farm, I've had a massive stockpile of food - so when I reach it, I can go through over 400 seeds and set my cook to make food to last the ""rest of the game"" (whenever that is).  I think having separate categories for technologies would be a better approach, and have a more natural feel to tech progression; a ""food"" technology, ""weapons/armor"", ""building construction"", ""decorations"", and maybe one or two more.  I wouldn't mind having to grind more through each tier in this case - it would just mean a larger stock of inventory as I go through it.			"

There are issues, as is to be expected in early development, but the developers are responsive and the community is helpful and growing. It lacks multiplayer support at this time, but that will likely change, and is not really an issue for me. Some of the controls are not intuitive, but the kinks are getting ironed out.			"

												So Far I'm addicted to this game so I highly recommend it. My friend had it and I did a ""trial play"" with it. You can get trapped for HOURS playing if you don't mind the clock. I love the multi dwarf control and leveling aspect. Very much so like many other crafting games such as gnomoria, terraria, minecraft, etc but still with it's own special individuality. You can be very attentive or pretty lazy if you'd like. The game allows you to lay out tasks for the dwarves to do and so long as they're fed and well rested they do their own thing. Mind the clock however; swarms come every 40 mins or so as well as creatures during the dark. Unlocking new crafting tiers seems to be a chore later on as you level though but still fun.All in all a wonderful game!			"

								EDIT: The AI is improving, but the crafting grid still bugs me til no end. Might sound a bit extreme, but it can be a dealbreaker. I do like this game and I can recommend it to any fans of the genre, there are only two things that bug me about it.1. The AI is braindead. This is mostly annouying when giving orders to your dwarfs and they do it in a nonsensical order, as far as i am aware you can't priorotize tasks either, which makes controlling the basterds a hassle sometimes.2. WHY IS THERE A 3X3 CRAFTING GRID?? It adds abosolutely nothing to the gameplay, in fact its annouying. In Minecraft it makes sense, because you can guess recipies and stuff, here you have to research them before you can use the recepies.  For the love of god get rid of it.			"

								First off I have had fun playing this. (written while still Early-Access)I don't like the built-in (very obvious) micro-transaction-system, I mean I'm playing it on a PC, so why would I be fronted with that system, I couldn't even pay if I tried?On the other hand, that is not such a big problem after the first ""grind"" of getting things started is taken care of.A few hours in you start noticing it is a game still-in-development, not a lot of game-breaking-errors but a few, some are solved by exiting and reopening your saved-game.Some are graphical (UI 30-50% gone), some are obvious scripting-issues with path-finding and prioritization that is probably not completed or even implemented. Some are objects in the game, that for some reason does not apply yet / at this stage.But it is fun, you don't finish a session in a short time (can go on for a loooong time), and with hard work they will definitely finish a very good game. Adding features and polishing things are the priorities they should maintain, imo.			"

The controls are straight forward and the way that the inventory system works, it never makes you feel like you have to consult google to find out how to build something as you do in minecraft and other such games. The game also has a way of easing you into it instead of dropping you into hell right off the bat. Nothing comes close to this game and I honestly find that when Im not playing it I look forward to the next time of playing that. Something few games can attest to.One final thing I want to say and that is the thing The Devs are doing VERY right; 1) they listen to the community 2) they patch the game quite frequently and stay on top of issues and bugs			"

								Craft The World is yet another world builder game in the huge list of games in the genre. Despite this, it does manage to add completely new things in the vein of simplicity. For example, play as an RTS overmind rather than one character, and although the player is given a similar room system to Terraria in which the player must build a room with an entrance to be able to construct beds for sleeping and tables for eating, it adds a new comfort system where the objective is to raise the comfort levels within the room. The comfort system is pretty much raised by advancing a cool crafting tree, though it's pretty large, so if you want to complete it-it will take a while.Which brings me to what's not so good about the game. I have had the room system bug out on me as it keeps getting confused as to where the rooms actually are. I've had dwarves ask where their own beds are when they're standing right next to them. So I would definitely not recommend this game until they fix it. However I love the game and enjoyed spending many hours with it.			"

								Hello steam community :)I have decided to make my first review and the game is Craft the world. So far I have been playing the game for around 25 hours and it is starting to get boring now. The game is a 2d based survival/crafting game with a daily cycle where monsters spawn during the night. The monsters get a bit tougher the longer you play, but to be hornest it isnt realy a challenge. When not fighting monsters you are collecting materials in order for you to progress through out the techtree. The techtree is very long and even though I have spent many hours playing I have not yet finnished the techtree(mostly because of restarts). When you are collecting resources under the ground you will sometimes find secret caves, one of these caves will hold a damaged portal. To finnish a map you will have to repair the portal by obtaining different artifacts from monsters in other caves. Which you will need  some late game equipment for.All in all it is a good game but mostly because of the prise, I think i got it for 3-4 euro. There seems to be missing a storyline or something that keeps you playing. There is a lot of waiting in the game and sometimes it feels like you are just building stuff you dont need, in order to complete the techtree. I belive this game is still in alpha stage so I guess there will be some fixes in the future.I recommend this game based on the time played vs the money spent on the game. I hope someone can use my review :D "

								A very good game, mix of terraria, dwarf fortress and some good old spelunking and make a ton of crap.  Music is very soothing kinda like sims music very hypnotic but not overly annoying, sounds are well done, for early access very good core game, needs some polish on AI and path finding but what game doesnt need path tweaking.  Very highly recommendedp.s. dont pi$$ away your wood and stone follow the guide book for building things, as trees grow slow.			"

								TL;DR: I know what you're thinking, but this game is really fun and way less cheesy than you're assuming.I haven't spent an enormous amount of time with this title yet. I was put off by the hokey facebook-smart-phone feel of the art, and the game is obviously being created with touch screens in mind. I've heard people complain about the developer creating lots of spammy fluff games, and my googling has proven the complaints to be true. Somewhere, I saw a commenter defend the devs by offering that as a dev, you're often forced into undesirable positions because, hey, you have to pay the rent somehow. I can definitely relate, though I know next to nothing about that poster or the developers, so I can't say how true that statement is.I can, however, tell you that this game is very, very fun! I bought the game assuming it would be a slightly hardcore strategy-sim. I loaded it up, saw the goofy art style, and muttered a ""god damn it."" to myself. I hit play anyway, and 45 minutes later I realize I'm engaged and having a lot of fun!This is a casual strategy/sim game, but offers plenty of depth and flexibility regardless of the ""casualness."" Very accessible for strategy virgins, and enough challenge and creativity for hardcore strategy gamers.			"

								Craft the World is an almost finished and well polished Early Access game, sounds like not right, right !Visually; graphic design and color palette is to my taste, cute, warm colors and roundy.Sound effects & Music; not too bad but there is still room to developGAMEPLAY; well this is the tricky part.  You should invest sometime to understand how you manage your dwarves as your control over them is mostly not direct (you can control an individual dwarf directly but its not the essence of Craft the World). Understanding management of your dwarves is essential as the pace of the game feels like a bit sluggish at the beginning. After starting to collect vast amount of resources quickly, it becomes easier to devise your subterrenian stronghold (or sky reaching) and it's surroundings. That is where the fun begins for me!Game has crashed a couple of times so far but other than this, not seen any major bugs or issues.My only serious complaint would be pricing; as I am not sure if this is a £12.00'er  game. I would happily pay an 8 or a 9er. Apart from pricing issue, keeping in mind that this is still  a (finished !) Early Access game, I am overall happy with Craft the World!			"

								I can't believe this is an early beta.  Yes, there are a few glitches-- big tip: leave your dwarves multiple exits in case of a pathfinding oops, which is indicated by an icon overlay-- but the amount of polish in this is really surprising.  First of all, the graphics are gorgeous.  There are no-- absolutely no-- graphics options to twiddle.  It starts up in HD (or, presumably, whatever you support) with a beautiful soundtrack and excellent artwork.  The tutorial doesn't ""talk"" you through much of anything, the interface succeeds by following the ""seven plus or minus two rule"", where there are few enough things on the screen at once that you can almost always figure it out.  Crafting has a brilliant layout where you drop the ingredients in the rough shape of the object and the icon appears to double-check; you can look up a recipe, but if you remember what you want (which is easy, for frequently needed items), it's really.  I'm a Terraria nut and wasn't sure how I'd like a cross between Lemmings and Terraria, but honestly, your little guys really are smart enough to be pretty useful.  It's a lot of fun, and definitely worth the money if you like these kind of games.  At the very least, it'll last you until Starbound comes out!			"

								I like the game and it's looking to be really nice but their 'Easy' level is NOT easy at all.  Dwarfs are too slow with gathering food/materials and they won't sleep on the bed despite having roof on their head, walls and doors.  The totem doesn't work either.  It's hard to gather materials and keep your dwarfs happy, full and alive.  But despite the misgiving, I can't wait to see the full, finished game.			"

								For an alpha game this is amazing. Great fun. It is a slow paced game so that means you can take your time and just relax as you go on, however the level constantly gets harder over time. I may have only put 5 hours in, but i have enjoyed 90% of it. the 10% came from learning how to eat and sleep (long story). To sleep, you must build a proper hous (totem, beds, roof, walls, backwalls and a door/wooden Hatch) then they will sleep. To eat, all you need to do is make a table, make the food then place the food on the table. To do that you just add the food to your quick bar and then place them on the table as if you you where adding a wall/backwall.			"

												So Far I'm addicted to this game so I highly recommend it. My friend had it and I did a ""trial play"" with it. You can get trapped for HOURS playing if you don't mind the clock. I love the multi dwarf control and leveling aspect. Very much so like many other crafting games such as gnomoria, terraria, minecraft, etc but still with it's own special individuality. You can be very attentive or pretty lazy if you'd like. The game allows you to lay out tasks for the dwarves to do and so long as they're fed and well rested they do their own thing. Mind the clock however; swarms come every 40 mins or so as well as creatures during the dark. Unlocking new crafting tiers seems to be a chore later on as you level though but still fun.All in all a wonderful game!			"

												the AI needs alot of work, you can be tellign your dwarfs what to do and thell ust stand round talking meanwhile one of your dwarfs actually listening to your commends is being bum rushed by 20 zombies and only after hes running back to base screaming cause he almost died they come to fight. not only that they can also kill them selfs by clibiming up walls then falling down on 10% health killing him for no god reason. you can have marks for them to mine stone but they struggle to find a way even tho they are looking at a ladder that clearley allows them to get to where they need to be.apart from these struggles it is a really good game and has potential you can controll the drawfs yourself if it gets too frustrasting and then theyll get the hang of it after 20 or so tries.  overall is it worht £4 yes is it worth £14 no. so untill they fix the AI i doubt the game will get much sales but i can see the game becoming enjoyable for most people that like 2D automation games.

												I've seen a few reviews with just an hour or two of time spent in the game and honestly if that was all the time I had put in, I would probably give the same review.  However, 9 hours in I am finding myself unable to stop playing.  If you enjoy crafting in any other game you will love this.  The game doesn't hand you everything you need to know at the beginning.  I had to google some basic stuff, but it ends up being super fun.  I think the progression tree could be revamped (seriously, no walls until the 3rd tier?) but it's a deceptively in-depth good time.  Picked it up during the winter sale for $5 and would definitely recommend playing even at full price.			"

If you like god like games and Terraria than I am sure that you will get enjoyment that justifies the cost.  A few things I would like to see:1. I would to see a roadmap for the game2. Less annoying repetitive crafting actions3. The ability to give dwarfs a hierarchy of job priorities (mine than harvest, only cook . . etc)4. More Traps5. The ability to call my dwarfs to a location (example: when I bust open a wall to a bunch of bad guys I would like my army to be there.6. Better AI for fights (archers are a bit dumb on first engagement)A few bugs that I have seen1. When I order a dwarf to rest he will drop what he is carrying and if he is on a ladder he will fall to the bottom2. Dwarfs not taking ordersI look forward to this game growing as it lives up to its potential. "

Early Access Review
								This is a positive review because I do like this game a lot, but that said, it has some problems. It's sort of like a Dwarf Fortress Lite game, which makes me long for DF and realize how intelligently DF (despite its UI issues) is designed.This review will be updated regularly.Pros:- Nice gameplay graphics.- Most game elements are fairly intuitive. (Though some of the buildings could use a bit more in-game instruction, like the elevator, but that's obviously not a priority in Early Access.)- The spells are a great way to engage the player, and are very useful, though mana recharge takes a while.- Controls are generally intuitive and work well.- Controlling an individual dwarf is generally very effective, though controlling the individual's movement relative the landscape can sometimes be tricky, and it's hard to execute some of the maneuvers dwarves do on their own.Cons:- Crappy UI graphics. The UI could be improved upon design-wise, and made to supply more information (like how long until nightfall, etc.)- UPDATE 5/29: They've updated the UI. It looks much better now, and has more functionality. Will update further when I have a chance to really sit down and play for a few hours to explore the new UI. :)- The drag and drop crafting system is extremely annoying. Make me do it once to start, sure, but offer an autofill option?- Needs recycling or selling items, I have a bunch of goblin crap I don't need.- Dwarves can't handle their own food supplies. When you get a lot of dwarves, they go through that food pretty fast, and you have to manually tell them to cook it, and also manually click a bunch to put it out on the table! Really makes me wish it had a system like DF where you just tell the dwarves what they can eat and cook with, and they'll automatically go get their own food. Maybe what CtW needs is a larder object where food is automatically stored, and dwarves can get it from the larder and bring it to tables themselves?- Enemy raids happen too often. Late in the game, you often have to go very far afield to gather resources, and while elevators and rails are helpful, it's still a lot of travel time. So here I am, working at the edge of the map, and suddenly I have to abandon everything I'm doing and send everyone back to base because a raid is happening. Probably ten minutes out of every hour is spent dealing with stupid raids, and the defensive towers you can build aren't effective enough. Basically your tower has to be so close to the ground to hit an enemy that they can reach it and take it out easily. Towers also aren't very powerful, meaning nearly every assault (even some minor, regular nighttime ones) requires your attention to dispatch dwarves away from whatever more productive thing they could be doing. I am presently trying to figure out a way to just prevent raiders from accessing my base, period, but so far it's been difficult coming up with a way that works. I really want to be able to focus on getting what I need to complete the level rather than dealing with giant assaults every 45 minutes.- The skill tree has some merits, but it's super annoying and frustrating to have to waste precious resources crafting a bunch of items you do not need in your fort. Maybe some form of a research to unlock technology system would be better. An invention workshop that consumes raw materials to develop blueprints/new technology?- The skill tree doesn't have the greatest progression. Some techs you would think are fairly basic, like farming and weaving, are mid-to-late game technologies. Some of the progression (you need alchemy to advance farming?) just seems to be set up to make the game more tedious.- On a related note, some form of animal husbandry, where you can just put sheep or chickens in a pen or some sort of have then generate wool and eggs would be great. Wool is incredibly important, and can be very time-consuming to obtain when you have to wait for sheep to spawn and send dwarves to the edge of the map to kill them.- Dwarves' pathing and job handling is often ridiculously poor. A dwarf carries a torch to the very edge of the map, where you need some light added. It runs into a monster. It drops the torch to fight the monster. It picks the torch back up. Does it resume placing the torch? No, it has to walk all the way back to the main base, because while the dwarf was fighting, the base dispatched a different dwarf to install the torch, and that dwarf has only just started its walk.- Hit a bug where acquiring 999 earth caused all my queued actions on the map to disappear. This happened twice, I ended up crazily just trying to use up earth so it wouldn't hit 999 (wasting a bunch of time by basically having dwarves run around installing earth back walls everywhere) and the bug seems to have gone away, though queued actions are sometimes dropping out, and this may still be to blame. Not certain.- Spawn rates of flora/mushrooms/crystals and stuff are really high, to the point where trying to mine out a block under a tree took forever because before a dwarf could arrive to mine the block after the tree was cut down, a new tree would grow. Sometimes five or six attempts required. Same issue with crystal and mushroom growth while trying to build a railroad underground.- There seems to be a max height for tree growth, so my attempts to create a dome of trees to protect my base were unsuccessful.- It's taking a really long to clear out what seems to be the first ""level"" of the game. 30+ hours.

								If you like these kind of dwarf-director games with building and exploring and tech trees, give it a shot. Compared to some of them that I've tried, the pathfinding and AI for the dwarves wasn't total garbage. There were a few times when dwarves were prioritizing resource collecting instead of killing the dragon inside my shelter, but for the most part the tools you are given to direct and navigate them are adequate for these very seldom broken paths. Something that potential players might want to know is how long the game is. It takes a long time to beat a level. I would say somewhere in the 15 hour range for your first play. And the game is pretty addicting so be careful starting it up if you have stuff to do because it takes a long time to finish projects in this game.I would say it was pretty good overall. There wasn't much of a reward for beating the first level. I wish I'd been able to bring my dwarves with me to the next one or something. However it is fun to play though and the tech tree is interesting enough to keep my attention. I liked strategizing for the enemy waves and trying to make my fortress impenetrable with traps and fortifications. I would actually like there to be a bit more variety in the tech tree, as well as maybe the dwarves to be faster. Once you get to about level 10 the game slows down a lot progression-wise. It would be nice if the levels after 10 weren't as much of a grind.			"

								this game is a nice take on a sandbox game driven by a tech tree. I like the fact that resources are limited so you need to think about how you develop things or build less of one thing so you can build more of another. Also the game has an actual objective per level also which is a nice change from the do whatever you want for as long as you want gameplay.			"

												I don't know why but I love this game.  It's cheezy, good graphic quality for an indie.  I have been playing the same map for days because I don't want to build the portal I wanna just build I have a multi layered house with traps and other fun things have 100% comfort (this took awhile to achieve) just wish there were better defense structures don't like stopping what I'm doing to fight off the hordes of enemies.

It does take a while to get to the end of the crafting tree, but is worth the effort.Just witsh the maps were bigger and more stuff to do.			"

												I started playing this game when there were still a lot of bugs and I had a great time then. I picked it up and played it a few months ago and it was an even smoother experience. This style of game is not for everyone, but I found it a relaxing, and in no way boring game. My only complaint is that there are only 3 worlds. I can;t wait for more to be released. I should add that each world is quite a time commitment, so don;t take ""only 3 worlds"" to mean its a game you're going to finish quickly. "

												8/10I love this game. Great looking game with a beautiful artstyle and plenty of depth. The different worlds behave differently, have different animals and natural disasters.Some things you need to know and take into consideration, before making a buy:- The game is still being developed - a month ago, we got a new world, that's awesome!- Since I've bought it, I've experienced the game gets better by each update. Learn from my mistakes- You CAN autobuild recipes, but you have to drag'n'drop the first time you craft. Then just choose recipe and hit the green anvil 2 times, to build the recipe. Learned this after 50+ hours of game time and a very sore hand.- You CAN speed up time. Especially useful in the beginning and between raids. Click the ""moon-wheel"" in the top right corner.Things I don't care for- Sound/music, it's just ""meh"" and I ususally turn it of and listen to radio/audiobooks instead. I don't like the dwarf voices at all.- Drag'n'drop equipment to dwarfs get's old quick. Especially when you have 12 dwarfs ind your castle.- Why do we have to build everything to unlock the recipe-tree? I don't need any pottery or flowerpots right now!			"

												So Far I'm addicted to this game so I highly recommend it. My friend had it and I did a ""trial play"" with it. You can get trapped for HOURS playing if you don't mind the clock. I love the multi dwarf control and leveling aspect. Very much so like many other crafting games such as gnomoria, terraria, minecraft, etc but still with it's own special individuality. You can be very attentive or pretty lazy if you'd like. The game allows you to lay out tasks for the dwarves to do and so long as they're fed and well rested they do their own thing. Mind the clock however; swarms come every 40 mins or so as well as creatures during the dark. Unlocking new crafting tiers seems to be a chore later on as you level though but still fun.All in all a wonderful game!			"

								Regardless of what you might read on the Steam forum, this game is like Dwarf Fortress and Terraria, with the hintiest hint of TD to keep you on your toes and drive the game a bit. This game is NOT ""roguelike."" That term gets thrown around far too liberally. The only similarity between Craft the World and Rogue is that there are bad guys that try to kill you.All that being said, I'm enjoying this game immensely. It feels a lot like Terraria, but it plays more like Dwarf Fortress. Essentially, this is the game that I wanted Terraria to be. Instead of having direct control over one person, you have indirect control over a bunch of Dwarfs.The crafting is very user-friendly (unlike Minecraft, for example); you don't have to remember anything, and the interface is very intuitive.

								Great little game. Hundreds of hours of fun all packed into a tiny little 100MBs somehow. The mana system is really cool imo. You regen mana in real time, so if you prefer building at a fast pace you can do so. But only  for an hour or 2 before you'll run out. It's hard to explain correctly, but its a cool featureA couple Cons:-Stats dont really explain what they do-You can't make workers with particular skills do particular jobs(unless im missing it) so you can have a Miner 40 off chopping down trees, while you have a logger digging out caves.. its frustrating. -Crafting can be annoying since you have to click and drag everything (double clicking on something in the crafting box will do cool things though)			"

								I found this game to be a large time sink. It took me some time to get some of the basic elements at the start of the game (that you start with a totem you can place instead of having to build one from scratch, for example). The end goal of the first level is also difficult to suss out, and I ended up spending a significant amount of time advancing all the tech trees to their maximum when it wasn't strictly necessary to succeed.Those issues aside, the game is a lot of fun. Whether you treat your dwarves as disposable labourers, or care about them like a family, you'll find things to love about the game. Harvesting resources, building your fortress, and basically showing off your mastery over your environment make this game great fun. The nightly monster raids provide an extra element of danger and amusement, another challenge to overcome.Probably a good idea to check out a gameplay video first, to make sure it's up your alley, but I for one had a lot of fun with the game.

								This game still has some bugs, but as an early release that is to be expected.  It is a pretty solid game; I have had some glitches but no crashes. The world is well done and game play is fairly intuitive.  The graphics are a step above most of the competition.The dwarves can be somewhat humorous with their gusto to attack even against overwhelming odds. The AI for the dwarves has improved through the updates but still can be frustrating at time as a dwarf will go through the portal and just stand on the other side as it closes when there is no reason for them to be there.I have yet to make it to the second world but would still recommend this game.

												I recommend Craft the World to anyone who enjoys popular sandbox and crafting games such as Terraria, Minecraft and Dwarf Fortress. CTW combines elements of these games into one whole game and the creators definitely did that right. There's a lot to CTW. Crafting, construction, tower defense, mining and so on. The idea of having dwarves that carry out tasks; along with the 2D side-scrolling, retro style is brilliant.Overall, I give the game a solid 9/10.Edit: Okay. The AI could do with some fxing. I have two dwarfs, one with a stone axe and one with a stone pickaxe. There are blocks of stone and a tree to mine. Why does the dwarf with a stone axe sometimes mine stone? Why do the dwarves not sometimes mine what is best suited for their tool?			"

												I picked this one up over the weekend just prior to getting out of early access, and ohmygod, its glorious. Never heard of this game before, but its a little gem.Gameplay is pretty much what you see in the video. Its Terraria meets Dwarf Fortress.Its a sidescroller/platformer. You do not directly control your dwarves. Instead you create tasks for them. Mine this chunk of ore, cut down that tree, build a stone wall over here. Your dwarves will seek out and complete these tasks.There's also a bit of Dungeon Keeper-esque upkeep for your dwarves, albeit simplified. They need food to survive and a bed to sleep in. They don't actually eat very often, but when they do, they'll eat an entire table of food. The will retreat to to their beds if injured. If down to 1/3rd health they'll run away from things and try to recover in bed. These are all of the needs your dwarves have.Its a very simple game but it is a highly enjoyable game. Construct a little dwarven fortress as if it were Terraria. Dig deep and greedily. Fend off invasions of zombies or goblin thieves.Maps are randomly generated. You have 3 biomes (forest, desert, snow) and 3 world sizes. You can also adjust a few other options, such as how often you get weather events or the game's dificulty.The crafting system is quite complex. Higher tier items are going to require several steps to construct, as you must first build all primary and intermediary items. Unfortunately the crafting system is also one of the downsides of the game. Crafting must all be done manually and there's no auto-fill button that I'm aware of. I'd prefer to be able to set build orders (construct up to X number of item Y) and let my dwarves automatically fill the quotas. Crafting involves a lot of micromanagement. This is more of a quality of life concern rather than a problem with the gameplay. This is also my sole concern with the game. This is the only negative point I have with the game.Gameplay isn't deep, but it sure is satisfying. This game could very well be a mobile game, but don't let that put you off. If you enjoyed Terraria or Dwarf Fortress I highly recommend it.			"

												Do you hate all of the following things:- Eating food that cannot be prepared in a microwave- Having meaningful relationships- Being gainfully employed- A clean living space- Going out and doing things- Responsible adultingThen this is the game for you!It may not seem addictive at first, but that is simply a cunning ruse.  I purchased this on a whim during my lunch break.  I fired it up, thinking I would taken about 30min to get it figured out.  That figuring-out process was somewhat frustrating, if truth be told.  The in-game tutorial is both helpful and a bit obtuse, leaving out the tips and tricks that can really make the game flow.  I imagine you're supposed to discover them for yourself, but not knowing some of them can make the gameplay appear more repetitive and aggravating than it needs to be.Thankfully, helpful guides and tutorial videos abound (really... use them!).  After that, I remember nothing beyond Craft The World for a period of approximately 10 hours.  By the same time on the next day (after calling in sick to work), I had amassed 20+ hours of play time.  My husband was not impressed, so I bought him a copy.  Problem solved - haven't seen him in days.Update (12/31/15): After completing the four starting realms and getting all but two of the Achievements, I can still say that I thoroughly enjoy this game.  Looks like the developers have recently added some new content (co-op and pvp, mainly).  I look forward to trying these out!			"

												This game is amazing, from the graphics to the music to the premise.  I really do love this game ever since I bought it in early access. I would recommend buying this game.I was hoping that the problems with the AI were going to be fixed but unfortunately it never happened.  Although new content was added, many of the problems I had with the game were never solved.-	After you get over 6 dwarves and created several routes the dwarves just stand around confused, maybe they are just union workers.-	The dwarves will still jump off of high platforms without a route to get back into base, basically suicide.-	The dwarves do not seem to be individuals when it comes to feeding. For instance I put 3 berries on the table, 1 berry gets eaten; now the dwarves will say they are sick of eating berries.-	The dwarves will sometimes help fight and other times not. They will drop what they are doing to fight a target across the map while others nearby will do nothing.-	The dwarves will stay engaged in combat when they have less then one heart which will likely lead to there death. *Players can now create a building to store dwarf’s spirits and create potions to resurrect them makign this issue less bothersome. -	Portal spell hurts the immersion of the game but the railways are expensive to build and not quick enough to be worth it.-	Sandbox mode requires you to find items rather then use the tech tree which causes excessive clicking and just causes players to have to keep the wiki open. *Multiplayer allows the player to craft anything. I havn't checked but maybe this was applied to sandbox mode.-	Creatures fall from the sky, makes sense in the latest world because they use parachutes but seems much less intuitive on the other worlds.-	Portals will open on top of your base if you expand to far or try to have multiple bases.-	Dragon eggs still seemingly have no purpose after two years of them being in the game. *Dragon eggs are now used in dwarf resurrection. There is allot to do in the game but these issues make it feel incomplete still and lower the experience for me.  This game has not yet met it’s potential and I hope it does.  8/10___________________________________________________________________________________They added in a multiplayer alpha which is a really cool start to multiplayer. You play on a singleplayer world in where you can cast a spell to look for pvp or coop multiplayer game. When you find someone you bring 5 of your dwarves who retain their skills but not their equipment. Allowing you to bring back spoils. If they die in the matrix however they die for real. They added in a revival building that holds your dwarves souls for you on death allowing you to make potions to bring them back to life. Great addition to the game helping permadeath mode, multiplayer mode, and giving use to dragon eggs.			"

												This game is amazing, from the graphics to the music to the premise.  I really do love this game ever since I bought it in early access. I would recommend buying this game.I was hoping that the problems with the AI were going to be fixed but unfortunately it never happened.  Although new content was added, many of the problems I had with the game were never solved.-	After you get over 6 dwarves and created several routes the dwarves just stand around confused, maybe they are just union workers.-	The dwarves will still jump off of high platforms without a route to get back into base, basically suicide.-	The dwarves do not seem to be individuals when it comes to feeding. For instance I put 3 berries on the table, 1 berry gets eaten; now the dwarves will say they are sick of eating berries.-	The dwarves will sometimes help fight and other times not. They will drop what they are doing to fight a target across the map while others nearby will do nothing.-	The dwarves will stay engaged in combat when they have less then one heart which will likely lead to there death. *Players can now create a building to store dwarf’s spirits and create potions to resurrect them makign this issue less bothersome. -	Portal spell hurts the immersion of the game but the railways are expensive to build and not quick enough to be worth it.-	Sandbox mode requires you to find items rather then use the tech tree which causes excessive clicking and just causes players to have to keep the wiki open. *Multiplayer allows the player to craft anything. I havn't checked but maybe this was applied to sandbox mode.-	Creatures fall from the sky, makes sense in the latest world because they use parachutes but seems much less intuitive on the other worlds.-	Portals will open on top of your base if you expand to far or try to have multiple bases.-	Dragon eggs still seemingly have no purpose after two years of them being in the game. *Dragon eggs are now used in dwarf resurrection. There is allot to do in the game but these issues make it feel incomplete still and lower the experience for me.  This game has not yet met it’s potential and I hope it does.  8/10___________________________________________________________________________________They added in a multiplayer alpha which is a really cool start to multiplayer. You play on a singleplayer world in where you can cast a spell to look for pvp or coop multiplayer game. When you find someone you bring 5 of your dwarves who retain their skills but not their equipment. Allowing you to bring back spoils. If they die in the matrix however they die for real. They added in a revival building that holds your dwarves souls for you on death allowing you to make potions to bring them back to life. Great addition to the game helping permadeath mode, multiplayer mode, and giving use to dragon eggs.			"

												Do you hate all of the following things:- Eating food that cannot be prepared in a microwave- Having meaningful relationships- Being gainfully employed- A clean living space- Going out and doing things- Responsible adultingThen this is the game for you!It may not seem addictive at first, but that is simply a cunning ruse.  I purchased this on a whim during my lunch break.  I fired it up, thinking I would taken about 30min to get it figured out.  That figuring-out process was somewhat frustrating, if truth be told.  The in-game tutorial is both helpful and a bit obtuse, leaving out the tips and tricks that can really make the game flow.  I imagine you're supposed to discover them for yourself, but not knowing some of them can make the gameplay appear more repetitive and aggravating than it needs to be.Thankfully, helpful guides and tutorial videos abound (really... use them!).  After that, I remember nothing beyond Craft The World for a period of approximately 10 hours.  By the same time on the next day (after calling in sick to work), I had amassed 20+ hours of play time.  My husband was not impressed, so I bought him a copy.  Problem solved - haven't seen him in days.Update (12/31/15): After completing the four starting realms and getting all but two of the Achievements, I can still say that I thoroughly enjoy this game.  Looks like the developers have recently added some new content (co-op and pvp, mainly).  I look forward to trying these out!			"

												I like the dungeon keeper/creatures 2 analogy, really reminiscent of both these games, but with the buggy charm of minecraft because the AI are stupid as♥♥♥♥♥♥and the game randomly shuts down sometimes (but always autosaves well). The 'levels' are ridiculously long and as far as I can tell have the same core objectives (craft something, then craft something else so you can build something new...) Although have great replay value because the way you play relies on the way you build your 'shelter' for your dwarfs.I hope the developers are still working on it because it could be an incredible game, I'm putting so many hours into it as it is			"

												I picked this one up over the weekend just prior to getting out of early access, and ohmygod, its glorious. Never heard of this game before, but its a little gem.Gameplay is pretty much what you see in the video. Its Terraria meets Dwarf Fortress.Its a sidescroller/platformer. You do not directly control your dwarves. Instead you create tasks for them. Mine this chunk of ore, cut down that tree, build a stone wall over here. Your dwarves will seek out and complete these tasks.There's also a bit of Dungeon Keeper-esque upkeep for your dwarves, albeit simplified. They need food to survive and a bed to sleep in. They don't actually eat very often, but when they do, they'll eat an entire table of food. The will retreat to to their beds if injured. If down to 1/3rd health they'll run away from things and try to recover in bed. These are all of the needs your dwarves have.Its a very simple game but it is a highly enjoyable game. Construct a little dwarven fortress as if it were Terraria. Dig deep and greedily. Fend off invasions of zombies or goblin thieves.Maps are randomly generated. You have 3 biomes (forest, desert, snow) and 3 world sizes. You can also adjust a few other options, such as how often you get weather events or the game's dificulty.The crafting system is quite complex. Higher tier items are going to require several steps to construct, as you must first build all primary and intermediary items. Unfortunately the crafting system is also one of the downsides of the game. Crafting must all be done manually and there's no auto-fill button that I'm aware of. I'd prefer to be able to set build orders (construct up to X number of item Y) and let my dwarves automatically fill the quotas. Crafting involves a lot of micromanagement. This is more of a quality of life concern rather than a problem with the gameplay. This is also my sole concern with the game. This is the only negative point I have with the game.Gameplay isn't deep, but it sure is satisfying. This game could very well be a mobile game, but don't let that put you off. If you enjoyed Terraria or Dwarf Fortress I highly recommend it.			"

												Enjoying this game so far.  I'm almost done with world 3 and the gameplay is simple yet addictive.  The only problem I have is that the dwarves AI isn't great.  Sometimes dwarves will stand right next to what I've clicked on while another one runs halfway across the world to take care of that thing or a dwarf with smithing will go gather wheat instead of make that new mithril pick-axe I've requested.

												I didn't know what to expect of this game. I have always been intrigued by the idea of the legendary dwarf fortress but could never get over the archaic visual look of it (I do love tons of old video games but I find it hard to go back to the 80/90s and be enamored in the same way at that time). The reviews indicated Craft the World was a good mix of the dwarf fortress feel with nice visual aesthetics appended with aspects of dungeon keeper (an old favorite) and minecraft. Overall I’ve had a blast with the game. It is a ton of fun exploring and seeing what lies beneath the next few blocks of mineable ground -- new enemies, new treasures, new hidden rooms, etc. The tech tree is relatively easy to understand and progresses naturally. Sometimes it gets a bit bogged down in forcing you to craft meaningless items to advance a particular branch but I’d still give it a 4/5 overall. The graphics and sound are exactly what I’d expect—charming. The game is challenging but not too difficult if you plan well. If you have any interest in watching a civilization playout ala sim-games/civilization/etc this game is perfect for you. I had flashbacks of SimAnt only with way more control over the fate of my creatures(dwarves). Everything considered, I’d give this game an 8.5/10 and definitely recommend you at least try it (especially considering it can be had for fairly cheap).			"

												Honestly, this game is pretty good. It takes some time to figure out, but once you do you will get your moneys worth.I was really impressed with how the AI works. Though it's not flawless, I was impressed, it does take some planning to keep it from breaking/digging into it your stuff.I really wish item progression was not so ""the next stuff is just overall better, so give it to as many dwarves as you can"". It would have been nice you have the option of mage armor for example, that could perhaps raise mage damage but not so great at defense. Perhaps the heaver stuff would slow your dwarves down in combat? Maybe giving you the option of giving the lighter stuff to archers?Overall, it's still a good game. I hope it's supported for many years. It's certainly a game that some DLC would be nice for. "

												Craft the World - why did I even buy it? Obviously the cartoony graphics were a huge factor.I don't even play these sort of games.Installed. I load up and start a new game on ""small"" world on easy difficulty. Easy-peasy, lemon-squeeze. Build, mine, kill a few monsters and onto next level right? How hard can this be?40 hours later I am facing a mental battle of wills against the game developers. Like Gandalf said in Lord of Rings, ""You shall not pass!"". This game isn't passing me by. It's not the boss of me.It's more like a strategic game or even a new type of gaming genre called the ENDURANCE GENRE.I started with a single dwarf who can cut down a few trees and play with dirt. He can mine stone and also kill the odd sheep for wool. EVERY resource he produces must be taken back to the central stockpile before it can be used in my megalomania. This is where the problems begin. Soon enough I level up and gain more and more dwarves to play with. I work through the skill tree and move from being able to produce beds made from leaves to the fully emperor size luxurious beds. I move from making simple wood weapons to Iron Axes. I move from being able to craft a mud pile to stone walls.As all this is happening the game goes through a night and day cycle where during the night zombie/ghost/skeleton mobs attack.How do you build a home? I don't know. How do you stop your retard dwarves from travelling half way, ALL THE WAY across the world to gather a single stupid bit of wood, I don't know.How to stop rats from attacking your home? I don't know. (This one is probably the most asked question in Discussions).How do you complete the game? I don't know.Can you sell items? I don't know.How do I make the portal? What bloody portal?Why don't more trees grow on top of my house? I DON'T KNOW.40 hours in I am still on the first ""easy"" level. On my 6th attempt. Each time trying to find perfection. The perfect home. The perfect set of skills for my dwarves. The prefect wave of destruction that consumes the world of all its natural resources ensuring no piece of stone, bit of Earth, bit of coal is not consumed in my inevitable march towards the exit. To the developers, I say resistance is futile. I will beat you.Miles and miles deep into the Earth I come across some sort of giant skeleton creature that wields a huge sword which also erupts waves of fire at my puny dwarves. It can also summon undead. It's dead. I find a portal spell.Many, many, many things wrong with the game. Primary is the Dwarven IQ levels which may cause you to smash your fist into the screen. ""Run you fools"" as Gandalf said. These fools don't run. They often engage in combat at the wrong time and more often end up ignoring your blatant commands. The developers must have realised this as well as a short while into the game you are given the HORN spell that basically forces the dwarves to move their♥♥♥♥♥right now. GO THERE RIGHT NOW. ALL OF YOU. MOVE.It gives me a little pleasure watching my dwarf idiots trying to follow my simple instructions. I give them meat and salad and sometimes they have the cheek to complain about being forced to eat the same food over and over again. I watch them sleep. I direct them to the bowels of hell to find some iron ore.I am not addicted to the game and I am certain my 6th attempt will bring me huge success. Apparently the next world is quite similar. You basically start all over again.So, I am not addicted. JUST. NEED. TO. COMPLETE. THIS. FIRST. LEVEL. TO. PERFECTION. "

Early Access Review
								First, a narrative! Skip to the dashed lines to get to the meat of my review.Sixteen hours in to the first level, my dwarven city was thriving, albeit a bit disorganized. Our ranks had swelled to twelve dwarves strong, and we were finally putting out silver to work in the newest armor and equipment available to us. The crimson red portals held little risk for us now. While we lost the occasional good dwarf to waves of unyielding, merciless foes, we always pushed them back in the end.It was while we were constructing our first mine cart track that we came across the secret, forbidden chamber, holding a guardian of unimaginable power. My poor dwarves fought bravely, but they could not stand to the unthinkable power of the ancient foe. Thinking quickly, I cast a magic gate spell, allowing the half of my forces who had survived to escape back to the core of my city. Only seven of the dwarves from that fateful encounter survived... but even while their hammers struck anvils to replace the equipment of their brothers, the homelands were sending reinforcements to bolster our ranks. I knew even then, when our enemy falls at our feet, we will not celebrate in the ruins of our allies. We will mourn, and look grimly ahead at the challenges to come.--I feel after 20 hours of gameplay, I am well qualified to recommend a game to friends and family. I qualify this because, as of writing this review, I STILL HAVEN'T BEATEN THE FIRST GOD DAMN LEVEL. This game has a level of depth that you wouldn't believe. It's like you took the core concepts at the heart of dwarf fortress, but added in playability and accessibility. New players are going to feel right at home almost immediately, and veteran dwarf managers and city builders alike are going to feel very comfortable with this game's mechanics and handling. This title combines the strategy and decision making of Dungeon Keeper with fun, engaging gameplay mechanics, building, and crafting.The best part of this game, as suggested above, is the natural narrative that is emergent to this game. You cannot help but become attached to your most effective dwarves, and if not mourn their ignominous deaths, at least feel vengeful against their murderers.I was stunned that this game falls under Early Access. Craft the World feels more complete than many games that have a much higher budget. If this is the UNFINISHED version, I cannot wait to see the end result.THE GOOD: EVERYTHING. Seriously, this game is fun, the pacing is pretty spot on for the most part, there is a perfect amount of tension and stress to make you feel like you're working for every step. Crafting, building, and decorating all feel really engaging and exciting. THE BAD: Okay so the pacing isn't *perfect*. Iron can be hard to find going in to early mid game, and seriously (I mean this big time) NEVER STOP MINING COAL. NEVER. You will ALWAYS need it, and you will NEVER have enough of it. This is mitigated by the magical gate spell that allows your dwarves to go from the heart of your base to the edges of the map instantly. This really strains your mana, though. The game picks back up again when you get railroads, and your dwarves start drag racing across the entire map.THE UGLY: I... you know, I think everything was in ""BAD"". I find very little flaw with this game, except perhaps that over the last 48 hours, I sank 20 in to this game. This is some serious fun.EDIT: There is one ugly thing. NEVER assume direct control over your dwarves. It's just a bad plan. Always. The controls are a little clunky, and they're just hard to manuever. Besides, games like this aren't really designed to be controlling one unit. Just sit back and let the dwarves do their thing, while passing down orders on your computer chair-throne.			"

								For a minecraft addict who is just not hardcore enough to get over the learning curve of Dwarf Fortress, Craft the World just seems to hit all the addiction points.  Building the first shelter and surviving the first major waves is surprisingly challenging, but it's great fun delving into the crafting game.  The dwarves sometimes do have spotty AI, and it can be hard and a bit frustrating trying to keep them alive near water or big enemies.  However, the player can directly control a dwarf and play it Terriria-style.  Looking for treasures underground or battle enemies in that mode is a lot more reliable and fun.The game is not without faults, but the charm makes it hard to put down once you start.  Definitely worth picking up.			"

												Bargain!  Like gnomoria? give this a whirl. Purchased it, very cheap, 25 hours later I completed the first map (of 3).  I had stayed up till 4am trying to fix something you need to fix before finishing the first level (spoiler protection). No better recommendation. I pulled an all nighter.Some thoughts:Good AI on the dwarfs, 90% did what I expected when I expected it. UI could do with some work.Grindy tech tree.Drags a little near the end of the first map, need virtually EVERY resource available to complete the map.Some resources are finite so dont go crazy making more than you need.Using the healing pots in combat is a pain ( open equip window, scroll thro all dwarfs to see injuries, rclick health pot, use, repeat up to 3 times per dwarf. Repeat every 10-15 seconds depending on armor equipped).Satisfying gaining, building and then using tech. (elevators, mine trucks, lightning towers)Not satisfying realising the tech is pretty obselete with the spells you have... (teleport, fireballs etc)I managed to snag it 50% off, but it would have been a bargain regardless.Happy to recommend.			"

								This is probably one of the best early access games I have had the pleasure of playing. I have sunk a good lot of my time into it due to how flexible the game is and how innovate the creators have been with it. I highly recommend it!			"

												I think I have played enough of this game to give a good expination on what the game is about what its cons and pros are. so forth. Let me start with the Cons*No multiplayer *Constant Problems (needs, Waves of enimies, Such)*Bad AI (Their ai will tell them to go into a hole. and go back and forth for about an hour then get out saying im hungry)*Difficult to control Dwarfs. (Tell them to go somehwere? they'll go. but in the hardest way possible.)*No fast Foward button (Or i don't see it but while the game is going. the button to make the game go faster is non existant.)Pros * Fun game to get into. *Fun backstory * good time killer (Playing for alittle bit) *Nice Mechanics (Build your own bit) * artistic style is nice So my recomindation towards this game. Is a middle. If they changed some of the things that was listed then maybe the game would be a 100% Thumbs up. But for the mean time. it is a little tedious to play with. If they added their multiplayer then that would be more interesting. while the game is fun in its own way. There are ways that the developers could make it so much better. Personally what they could do for a start. is work on the dwarfs AI. The AI is a little bit a pain to work with. but when they go they will go. While the game is fun. My recomindation towards this game is going to be a Thumbs up, and a Thumbs Down. If the developers could fix the problems. then yes this game would and can be a really good game. but for nowMy rating of this game is a Thumbs up.			"

Early Access Review
								Amazing mix between terraria and a strategy game. Unique, addictive and fun.Dig, fight, defend, attack by controlling a small band of dwarves. Gear them, earn skills (in ES spirit (doing same thing over n over)) feed them, build them a shelter and defend it!Graphics are pretty much like Stamworld Dig for those who played it. Interesting.The only downside (which is justified by the early access factor) is the poorly built rarity hierarchy. Meaning that, some items supposed to be rare are more common than meant to be common items...  "

												If you turned Terraria into a simulation/strategy game and added some elements of Starbound, you'd get Craft the World.Pros-LOTS of gameplay potential if you're fond of the game mechanics offered (there are 4 stages and I've spend almost 30 hours just on the first one.)-Randomized worlds mean that your experiences playing will be varied-Dwarves can each be given their own weapons and items-Crafting level-up system is interesting and unique-Tons of items to craft and tons of ways to use them-A well created base is fairly self-sufficient, you can give your dwarves a bunch of tasks to do, leave for an hour, then come back to find things (usually) going smoothly (as long as you are on an easy level and they have enough food)Cons-Dwarf AI is TERRIBLE (caps for emphasis), there are times when they path in the most rediculous ways that waste a lot of time and lead to them taking a lot of extra damage (from falling off ledges, drowning, moving through hazards, ect...)-Gameplay can get repetative, and it's really annoying to have to start your fort over when you get to a new level-Leveling up takes forever as you progress which leads to a lot of repetative gameplay.  The big drive for leveling up is getting that extra dwarf at each level to add to your army, but it never feels like you have enough dwarves.  I wish the game gave you more of them to work with as a whole, I feel like the huge buildings I create could/should house a whole legion of dwarves but I'm instead restricted to the 13 I have at level 13-Fighting often feels anti-climactic, you'll either easily mow down most enemies or get slaughtered by the larger ones (at least until you advance your craft far enough to make better stuff or have more dwarves from leveling up)  There isn't much strategy behind the combat other than making sure you have enough dwarves in an area to swarm the undead during invasions-Crafting is tedious, the game requires you to put ingredients(click and drag) into slots even though all craftable item recipes are learned from advancing your crafting skill tree.  It only adds a few seconds to gameplay, but having to do it each time you learn a new recipe adds up. (Especially since the game pauses whenever you go into the crafting menu.)-Moving to a new world causes you to lose all of your research progress.  This is a huge frustration when the portals keep spawning harder and harder monsters and you're struggling to catch up.OverallThe game offers a lot of gameplay and replayability, especially in the beginning.  And although it may start to feel like a grind later on, you'll still get many solid hours of fun gameplay out of this title.  For the price, it's worth checking out. (And to support the devs in hope they take this system and refine it.)  If you would like more information about this game, I've created some videos showing gameplay...

			Craft the World part one of my video playthrough. This part covers basic crafting and tips for building.		

*Update - So I've gotten to the point where I don't really want to play this game anymore due to the repetative nature.  I'm going to keep the reccomendation just because I easily got my money's worth out of the game, but you may be disappointed by the repetative nature of the late game.  The developer really should have added more unique content to the later levels.			"

												What to say about this one? Well, to start off it is one I recommend whole-heartedly. I enjoy playing CTW a lot. It seems to have the potential to be boring, dig stuff up, find the secret rooms, kill the boss, move on to next level. But it is not boring at all.So, the story is that you have a dwarf who doesn't even have an axe. Yep, a dwarf without an axe. Mad I say; everyone knows dwarves are born kicking and screaming, beard and all, with axe in hand. Salt and pepper, coffee and cream, mac and cheese, dwarf and axe. Still you have the potential to sort this out pretty soon. Dig up some stone with your little stone knife, cut down a couple of trees and you get to build an axe. Or a pick axe. Or both. But by now, you probably have another dwarf, sans axe of course, and have to kit him out too.But of course, a stone axe just won't cut it will it? (Sorry, pun intended) You want to move up to iron, steel, silver and eventually to mithril. For all your dwarves. This takes time and patience but it is worth it.The campaign starts you off in a nice little forest world. Beat this then you move on to an ice world without anything you had before you moved over. But of course you don't move all your team across, just one and you start all over again, this time on a harder world. But you are not done when you finish this world. Desert world is next. Now, the latest update has arrived and, lo, a new world has been added. Underground! With a whole new set of creatures and bad guys to take on and some kind of underground God thing who likes you to leave stuff for it on an altar and if it likes the stuff it will give you useful stuff. I haven't beaten this world yet, only just started it so i can't tell you what happens but all in all a nice addition.So, get digging / chopping / fishing / smithing and all the other things you need to do to beat this game. I enjoy it and hopefully you will too!			"

												Just finished the first world, so I feel a review is now fair to write.  Love this game!  You take charge of a growing squad of dwarves, and give them tasks as needed, in order to make the world a nice place for a clan of dwarves to settle.  But enemies will also come for your kingdom, so take the time to prepare.  You can either just give orders and sit back, or you can get your own hands dirty by taking control of any individual dwarf for certain tasks.The game has a lot of replay value.  The first campaign, at a fairly normal pace but trying to explore most of the world, took about 25 to 30 hours.  Graphics are simple and cutesy, but still quite pretty and functional for what the game is trying to do.  The crafting tree is robust, with a lot of functional and cosmetic items.  Though, even cosmetic items are functional in a way, given how the dwarves' resting mechanic works.The only real drawback to this game comes when you gather quite the party of dwarves (over 10).  Then, the dwarven AI individually tends to compete, and they start to derp in frustrating ways.  You'll see 2 or 3 dwarves competing for a single task and getting waylaid on the other side of portals if you don't micromanage certain tasks.  Too, sometimes dwarves will fail their tasks for no apparent reason, or plain not recognize their task.  Fortunately, you can (usually) clear this problem by taking control of a dwarf and/or immediately releasing him. All in all, the game is fully worth the $20 it was at regular price.  If you catch it on a Steam sale, you'll do even better.  For lovers of simpler real-time strategy, with mining/crafting elements, building, and some battling!			"

												These block/crafting type games tend to look really good but lack substance or look really bad because the devs spend all their time on substance and gamplay NOT THIS ONE. It looks good plays well and is very enjoyable the devs also continue tinkering and improving it.Whilst I consider this ""lite"" gaming it will challenge you at times and loves to keep the pressure on with waves of enemies coming through a portal every 40 odd minutes. It also likes to mess with my OCD side by using giant worms or dust storms to muck up my dwarf camp (the further you get into the level the less impact these events have.....if you plan right lol)I have read some other reviews and I agree the dwarfs having pathing issues........lol they are really stupid at times.....but if you really need something done you just take control of a dwarf and do it yourself. Personally I dont bother I just prioritise  the tasks I assign .....like defence first then bury them in chores. You will still have to go looking for one that gets himself stuck or built in every now and then but I just laugh and say dumb dwarfs.The biggest tip I can give those about to play is don't get to attached to your dwarfs if you let a few die along the way for the greater good of the base you will progress faster plus they are replaced a few minutes later.

												A charming game, but don't let that exterior cartoon-like smiling faces fool you. Underneath the inviting facade lies a game that will challenge your patients, drive you crazy (in a good way), as well as offer you many many hours of enjoyable game time. At first glance I thought ""Great, another Tablet game that's on the PC"". I could not have been more wrong.  A BIT on the casual side but not so much as to become a clickfest game and involved enough to keep you playing WAY WAY past when you want to. If you are looking for a nice game to kick back and play AND get your monies worth, you just can't go wrong with Craft The World. I only wish there were even more worlds to play. (see below) UPDATE: New world now available and I am VERY proud to say it is not DLC. A HUGE thank you to the developers for releasing this content as an update instead of a DLC.			"

												I really enjoy this game. I bought in during EA on a whim and have been pleasantly surprised by it. Especially the longevity it has in game play. It can be slow at times, and some of the newest features (rats, spiders) can get annoying, but these are minor gripes for an overall outstanding colony builder.You start with 1 dwarf, and grow your colony by crafting, fighting nighttime skeleton and zombie attackers, and then a massive wave of enemies every 45 minutes or so. In the first (easiest) world, you get to about 12 dwarves by the time you find and fix the portal out. Then you go to a new world where resources are harder to find, and the fighting waves of monsters are harder. This is where the game become much more challenging, which keeps it interesting.The dev recently added DLC which brought female dwarves into the game, and a few other changes, but the gameplay itself remains a colony builder at it's core. I do wish they would eliminate the damn rats that show up when your ""home"" is not yet ""comfortable"" as it just becomes an annoyance in the early part of each world, but like I said, it's a minor thing.

												Sort of a mashup between DF (or its clones like Towns, Gnomoria, Rimworld etc) and sidescrolling explorers like Terraria or it's many clones. You start with one dwarf on a random map and progress through multiple technologies all the while collecting resources, delving deeper, fighting off waves of monsters and building an appealing looking fort. Blocks are big so it isn't nearly as spammy as most block games.I've easily forgotten myself and stayed up hours later than I planned just because I wanted to finish up one more ore cluster, finish rearming my dwarves (there are about 6 stages or armor and weapons), or build one mre piece of eyecandy. Hghly recommended.			"

												Controls are a little meh, takes a bit of getting use to figure them out. At first I was anoyed with them but there are a lot of Hotkeys that make up for the lack of displayed controls.Art / Graphics look amazing.The way to unlock new items is cool, its a bit of a grind on some parts but for the most part you are going to be making the items anyways. What gets me the most is that you loss EVERYTHING when progressing through the ""campaign"". There is no reason to play the campaign at all since you can play a custom map and get the same experience without having to unlock the different levels. I understand that each map is a different world but does that mean I have to reinvent the door because I went to a snow biome? The levels have very little difference between them. With maybe 1 or 2 mobs having a Skin Change. The goal is still the same (Find and Open the Portal) with the same resources available(minus the stone world).Overal I really enjoyed my first couple worlds a lot, there was a bit of a learning curve that wasn't to hard to over come but the game got old pretty fast after my first complete world. I wouldn't recommend buying this at the full $20 but if it goes on sale some time it might worth your time.			"

												You start with a stockpile on the surface and one dwarf at your disposal, which you can order around by marking terrain, items or enemies or even selecting them and giving them direct orders (like ""go sleep""). Any and everything you gather is stored in the stockpile, and needs to be defended by your dwarves. Especially at night, when undeads walk the lands. In set intervals a portal will open and release a horde of enemies walking towards your stockpile, much larger than the few undeads during normal nights. As you gather ressources you can build a house around the stockpile with several floors, offensive towers and many, many items to fill it up. Several crafting stations produce different types of items, from food over equipment to more complex devices. Over time you will get more dwarves under control, which do all the work for you: mining, chopping trees, hunting animals, farming, killing monsters and generally keeping your base intact. They will also need to eat and sleep from time to time. Mind you: food has to be placed on a table for the dwarves to access it and sleeping should be manually ordered before entering a cave in the deep or the timed monster invasions. Just to make sure everyone is at maximum health. If one of your dwarves dies he is gone forever. A new dwarf joins you after a few minutes however. The items can be recovered, but his skills are lost.The goal of the game is to progress through the technology tree until you can create a portal which leads you to the next world. Building it will require finding caves in the deep and disposing of its bosses, as well as gathering ressources and finding the original, destroyed portal.The number of items to create is nigh unlimited and serves a huge amount of purposes. Even decoration items increase the comfort of your base and thus let the dwarves regenerate faster while sleeping. The dwarves themselves can pick up to three skill lines at once (warrior, miner, swimmer, logger, ..) which can be improved through skill books. You (the player) learn several spells ranging from a simple (but very useful) town portal to more advanced ones like the fireball spell. You do have limited mana, however, which regenerates at a very slow rate.Finishing the first (easy, small) world took me over 17 hours, but I took my time with it. This should give an estimate of the other worlds, which are all larger and have a more complex topographic.At any rate, if you enjoy more strategical, relaxed sandbox games this is strongly recommended.

												The Good:Time-sink heavy game that feels like a mobile port but manages to dance the line between Terraria, Minecraft, and Dwarf Fortress.  If you like time sink games, this will probably be enjoyable for you.  Tell your dwarves what to do, build a little house, progress through the tech tree, etc.  Not bad.The Bad:It still feels like a mobile game, huge cartoony buttons and facebook and twitter share buttons all over the place.The Ugly:They advertise multiplayer in the title card, but multiplayer is a complete crapshow.  The game itself is a sandbox progressive building and survival game.  The multiplayer game is a drop in random dungeon.  It's also gated by the main game, you can't just join a Multiplayer game, you have to start a regular game and progress until you have 5 dwarves, then create an advanced portal, then cast the Multiplayer Game spell.  On one hand, this is a decent idea because the game isn't the most intuitive, but on the other hand, I'd really just like to play a sandbox game with my friend please.In short, it's not a bad game, the multiplayer is poorly designed though (in my opinion), and I hope the dev eventually adds a proper multiplayer sandbox mode.

												I bought this game years ago, played it on and off, and I actually enjoyed it. I came back to it recently, hoping to make some similarly good memories.Bluntly, I was disappointed.While the crafting is easier than it was, and the dwarves seem slightly smarter, those are the only praises I can sing. The enemies seem stronger AND more numerous than before, and the ore in-world actually seems more sparse, leading me to believe there's been a ramp to push the DLC; one gives you mini-biomes you can get ore and coin from, the other adds female dwarves and pets that can fight for/with you. The end-game bosses (Scroll Keepers) have also been jacked up SIGNIFICANTLY, forcing you, the player, to equip all of your dwarves with end-game gear you'll need to farm coins to buy, or purchase the DLC to visit biomes to make. I'm not against people making money -- I'm an artist, I draw commissions for a living. I've dabbled in game design.What I AM against is people forcing DLC to make a game playable without farming -- it's not quite pay to win, but it's not far off. If Steam had a way to roll back before the updates that were DLC-balanced, I'd definitely recommend this game; but in it's current state, unless you're willing to buy the DLC, and have friends to play with, it's a grinding simulator atop a buggy game.

												For 19 euros you get a lot of hours of content.The game's a bit slow, punishing at times and perhaps repetitive. If you never liked DF's end game, onyl the struggle to it, this game is perfect. There's no end-game economy, just a slow climb to reach the next level.The game is mostly you sending dwarves to harvest resouce X or attack enemy Y. That's all you can do with them, though you can directly control one at a time (this is VERY inefficient). To aid their escapades, you can craft items (or queue them, if they require skilled dwarvish labour) and equip them or place traps and defences. Or use spells, like portals, to speed up their activities.Mining, as with all dwarvish games, is a big part. As you accumulate minerals, food and furniture, you are sometimes assaulted in a heavy siege, or find a loot-riddled dungeon. Ultimately, you wish to gather the plans for a portal and get out of there; it's never safe for long as sieges become stronger and fiercer. Certainly, it's a simple game. It's not DF compelxcity, but if you just want a simple, slow game that goes perfect with a nice podcast or video, this is great for those! For 19 euros, you get a pretty solid game, with plenty of length and exploring to do.			"

												This is basically Dwarf Fortess in two dimensions, with graphics but less complexity for it. That isn't to talk down about the game, I just spent all night playing it. This game is super fun. If you like Dwarf Fortress, you are going to like it.I haven't died yet so no idea if you have to redo all your progression if so. I got down to three dwarves but hid in my fort until things got a bit better. This game is more forgiving than Dwarf Fortress. I would call it graphical dwarf fortress light.As such, I think it could use some sort of Dwarf Therapist addition equivalent. But it's an exceptionally fun game and well worth the cost, though I am a bit irked they made me pay just to get female dwarves, dammit!			"

												Great concept. Fine implementation mostly - with one exception. The movement mechanics for Dwarfs could be alot better - too many cases where Dwarfs lose situation just because of jumping in fights, choosing dumb paths, hanging decision-making, etc. This part is really low-quality implemented. Micro-management should deal with gameplay, - not with workaround glitches of poor mechanics.			"

												While I do like the look of the game, there are things that need work.    Telling your dwarves to kill something, sends them ALL to attack. Leaving your stockpile open to attack by goblins, which I didn't know until it happened. The thing that bugs me most, is the lack of any explanation to do anything.  There is no tutorial to do that. Your given the option of starting a game, but are attacked every night by a number of enemies, while trying to figure out how to build a decent structure, or how to build things that your dwarves will need, like beds, and food. Others have other complaints about the game. But the lack of any helpful information is the biggest problem for me.			"

												Mobile equipment: The dwarves have become more self-sufficient and now use temporary ladders without waiting for the player’s help if they can’t reach a certain spot. They also have access to parachutes that allow them to jump from high places without getting hurt.This should have been part of the base game, I like this game but as of the DLC release they are just trying to be greedy and lock basic things that should have been part of the game behind a pay wall due to how crappy the pathing AI is. I bought and played this game since it was first available and while it has improved the developers are now just going down the milk money path rather than implementing the needed items into the base game to deal with issues they won't fix.

												I played this game on a friend's computer earlier in the year and whilst it was ultimately very enjoyable it was also deeply frustrating due to the awful AI. So almost a year later when I found the game on sale I thought it must be worth it now - it must have improved.However it seems like the only real change is the addition of multiplayer which just seems like a way of making the dodgy dwarf AI even more frustrating to deal with. There is nothing more annoying than watching a dwarf repeatedly attempt to climb up a massive wall and repeatedly fall until they gradually kill themselves all for the sake of recovering a leaf that had fallen to the bottom of a long forgotten pit on the other side of the map.In the early stages of the game this problem is hampered by wood shortages so you cannot build ladders to prevent it or food tables, beds and a shelter to even heal them back up after. In the late game this problem results in spending significant amounts of time shoring up the map to stop the little morons killing themselves doing pointless things. Both are annoying.If it was my first playthrough I'd have tolerated it I guess but having already done all of this before and having already gone through all the tedious late game grinding each stage involves I found myself just wanting to give up and refund it after twenty minutes. So not a lot of replay value then...			"

								An addictive little gem in the genre. I was somewhat expecting another wannabe Minecraft, but it's so much more than that. The achievements give you more fun to attain other than the missions/goals called ""tasks"" and the campaign mode offers multiple levels (at this point, three) to explore and work through, with different world sizes and types. (I *HATE* snow. With a passion. In a good way.) If you want a sandbox building/crafting game that feels like anything other than Mindcrack (yes, I went there), then check out this game. :D			"

												6.5/10; only buy on sale.Craft the World tries to be a more polished mix of Dungeon Keeper, Terraria, and Dwarf Fortress.  Sounds like an amazing idea, but the reputation and success of those games makes for extremely large shoes to fill.  Now, while CtW is a decently fun game, it's just not deep enough to appeal to fans of the games which it is based upon.  It has the 2d construction and mining that Terraria has, but none of the different worlds are nearly as ""epic"" as the world made in Terraria.  Terrarra had a significant ""Metroidvania"" aspect in its crafting and looting that expanded the player's exploration options once they've found the right materials.  CtW tries to do this in the form of a techtree, but it just feels grindy and arbitrary compared to Terraria's more subtle systems.  The different biomes from Terraria instead exist as separate maps in CtW, making the scope of each world much smaller despite the larger number of builders.   For example, one of the funnest aspects of Terraria was that digging could get you to run into old sunken ships, mushroom worlds, and demonic fortresses.  In CtW, you get more dirt, some insects, and maybe a vampire.  The game's pace is much slower as well, which makes it feel like a slog through a shallow pit compared to Terraria.Few games can match the complexity and deepness of Dwarf Fortress, but CtW doesn't even begin to graze the surface.  Dwarves in CtW are born with innate specializations and can train and equip for more, but they can't ever be assigned specific tasks.  There is a ""trader,"" but he's more like a regular RPG vendor and there is no diplomacy.  The challenge from DF is also unlikely to be found.  The game, with its combined slow pacing and simplicity, just doesn't have the same ""losing is fun!"" appeal that Dwarf Fortress does, and you have to really mess up badly to even begin to replicate experiences from that game.So why the recommendation?  Well, I cannot pretend that any game worse than DF or Terraria is a bad game.  I had some fun playing CtW, thanks to the graphics and polish.  Making my dwarves upgrade to defend against increasingly threatening invasions was fun.  I'm just not sure who to recommend it to; fans of Dwarf Fortress will find it way too simplistic, and fans of Terraria would want a more diverse world to explore.  Maybe to people who've played neither and are interested in this sort of game, but why?  DF is free and Terraria is 1/5 the price.Bottom line: Craft the World is a decently fun game but does not nearly match the epicness and complexity of the games it is based on.  Buy it on sale and don't expect to be blown away.			"

												One of the better games in my Steam library, I've recently started this one again from scratch.  Fun game of crafting/exploring/defending, really nice UI and graphics.  At higher levels, the periodic 'Monster' waves can be pretty overwhelming, but it adds an edge to the game that would be missing without the stress of trying to prepare for the next onslaught.  I've seen some comments about the dumb AI of the dwarves - they're not geniuses, but it's pretty trivial to get them properly marshalled with a little experience.  It's a crafting/exploration game first and foremost - some people will find that tedious, but I enjoyed working through the crafting tree.  The rewards at the higher levels of the tree are pretty substantial.  "

												Wonderful game if your only intentions are to play it alone. If you bought it thinking that co-op would a good time, please do not purchase this game. This isn't multiplayer in the sense that you can start the game from the beginning alongside your friend (in this case, my wife). You have to progress alone until you reach level 5, which then allows you to invite someone to play together. You are then warped to a biome (not the one you played on originally), where you play co-op, or pvp, with the person you invited (or that joined randomally, if that works. Didn't try it myself). In my opinion, having to go through any of the game solo to be able to play co-op is a very odd and misleading co-op functionality. It defats the purpose of what co-op is meant to be in a video game. I don't want to be forced to play alone for however it takes to be able to invite a friend, just to be thrown into a new world for the brief multiplayer fun, then thrown back to own world. With all of that said, if this was listed as a single player game, I would have no issues with purchasing it. Great game, lots of fun, just not true multiplayer.			"

												BUYER BEWARE: If you are purchasing this game for a RTS-style multiplayer experience, you will be disappointed. The multiplayer does not work like normal games (someone hosts, invite, join, voila!), but rather you have to craft a specific portal, which takes a bit of time to get to. Once you craft the portal, you can then invite your friend to something that looks like an instance. It is basically just a dungeon where you defeat a boss with your friend and then go back to your own world. I will be asking for a refund for this game on Steam for this reason. Hopefully I can deter anyone else who thought this was a legitimate multiplayer. If you are looking for singleplayer, have at it. The game is very fun, just not what I was expecting as far as multiplayer!			"

												I bought this game for playing crafting things and the sense of freedom. But I was so disappointed and didn't feel the freedom as I espected. The dwarves are so stupid and the settings of this game is so unfriendly.The settings of the workers AI are terrible. To build a long ladder, I have to watch the little foolish dwarf go and get just one piece of ladder from the base which is so far away and come back to install it ........AND repeat it again and again.Of course I can directly control one of them, but when I intend to build a big house or a huge one, I finally find it very inefficient. That would be a disaster...........Besides, the mechanism is very unfriendly, especially the tech tree which is made so complicated. When I want to make an iron pickaxe, I find that I need a furnace. Then I intend to make the furnace, but I find that I need water. Then I intend to get the water, but I find that I need a barrel. Then barrel, But timber. Then timber, But workbench. Then workbench, but table. WTF!!!Finally I made the workbench, but why it is working so slowly?! Oh! I forgot that you can not make an iron pickaxe when you find iron mine, cause you need to make enough things to unlock the corresponding part of the tech tree. what a rubbish setting. Compare with this, minecraft is much better. After you got a workbench, when you found stones, you can make stone pickaxe; when you found iron mines, you can make iron pickaxe after smelting the iron ores in the furnace which is so easily made; when you found diamonds, you can directly make a diamond pickaxe on the workbench without any other redandunt, boring and unfriendly processes.Oh!! What SHOULD NOT be neglected is that    this game is d*mn buggy!  The bugs just made me want to throw the developers out of the window of a ten-storey building.After finishing this review, I even want to install minecraft right now.......:(So I don't recommend this game.

												Craft the world is a fun game to play you start off with one dwarf and a knife and must build up from there. now to progress from a vietcong like hole in the dirt to a castle you need to advance on the tech tree, to do that you will need to make things belonging to that technology EXE. making basic stone works will advance you to advanced stone work sadly guns are only avablible in the last biome for some stupid reason. the ""story"" is some random a** dwarf saying the evil forces found us again thats it thats pretty much the only expostion you get.that said progressing is satisfying when you go from cowereing from goblins or skeletons to full on slaughtering them, the main threat to you is the monster horde, every Fourty mins or so a portal will open and a huge monster assault will happen i'm talkin' anything from basic zombies to huge or armoured skeletons weird eye monsters they will decimate you at the start crude clubs and wood armour don't really help when a gaint skeleton comes with a massive flail and starts S*** whipping every one... imagine that. though the biome your in also has specific enemies like the forrest world has goblins that look suspiciosly like native americans come to raid you are weird little furry eskimo tribes in the artic know one huge complaint is when dwarves have low health they will flee BUT sometimes they will stop mid flee and make a last stand you then yell at your screen YOU AREN""T A F****** SPARTAN FLEE DUMB*** but thats not the only problem after a while with all the mining building and what not your dwarves will be overwhelmed like one time i had a mine with a split one way went to S*** tons of oron the other a little coal and dirt you can't prioritize ores jobs or anything like that so i spent about 4 hours waiting for the iron to be mined because They went for the coal and dirt that section later gave me mithril but the point is you're dwarves get overwhelmed and might do the less contributing jobs first my last two points are A you need to build a totem to make a shelter so dwarves can sleep you can't just make single houses which if your under 50 percent comfort you constanly get rats  and B the sisters in arms DLC should be FREELC anything it adds would literaly fit right in to any tech tree but then you wouldn't pay 5 dollars for female dwarves and a few pets would you 8/10 would be 9/10 if not for the stupid DLC rip-off			"

The AI is ATROCIOUS.  To the point where crafting even the most simple structures becomes a frustrating time sink of placing ladders, then removing ladders, then one of your dwarves gets attacked so EVERY SINGLE DWARF drops what they're doing to help, then they procede to pick up all the items they dropped and, instead of completing their original task, returning said items to base before having someone else entirely go now pick up the items, then oops one of your dwarves gets attacked...Over it.  Do not recommend.			"

								I absolutely cannot wait for this game to be complete; it's wonderful! A great game for those who love sandbox games such as Minecraft, Terraria, and others, yet would like a break from worrying about falling and breaking your neck, and directly engaging the monsters of the dark -- instead, let your dwarves do it for you! It focuses more on the crafting, exploration, and building aspects, while leaving the work to your dwarves (though, you can take direct control of them as well). I really have no complaints about this game whatsoever, and it is already very polished. While I have no complaints, there are a few features and polish I would like. For starters, a bit of polish could be used for the crafting interface; crafting the same items over and over can be a bit tedious when you have to put the ingredients in the specific slots each time (you can build multiples of the items, but it would be nice once a recipe is discoverd to be able to simply craft it instead of having to plop them all in their locations again. The only other thing I would like, is the ability to control the creation of the world itself a bit more. As it is now, you can select from Forest, Desert, and Snow settings, but it would be nice to have finer control over the creation of the map by increasing or decreasing the different ores found, etc. But this are minor quibbles -- I love this game!

												A game with very unintuitive control and questionable mechanics. At first glance, the concept of controlling multiple characters to explore and get resources may seem fun. However, the poor AI, terrifying controls, and UI catered to iOS tablets will slap you across the face and let you know that this game is yet another subpar product trying to ride off terraria/minecraft's success.

It happily kept me up until 5am and swallowed my Sunday entirely - this game is addictive!Pros:++ Fun and addictive+ Solid balance between micro and macro+ AdorableCons:--- No way to alter game speed. This can make the game feel stagnant and slow at times.- Full screen only, which crashes local video players so you can't watch a video while playing. - No sense of purpose/long term goals, yet there is a second world to unlock so there is indeed a goal.Verdict:If this *looks* like your kind of game, it probably *is* your kind of game, and is worth $15.

												The game was a lot of fun at first, but it has a very grinding feel to it. Also the way the dwarfs move and do things is ridiculous, and incredibly tedious, the dwarfs will run around when you want them to go inside, they will not build blocks in the order you clicked them. Another annoying thing is the game is not very clear on how certain items work, i think it could of benefited with a tutorial at the begining. There is room for improvement.			"

												Craft the World is worth buying if you're looking for a 2D sandbox game that feels like terraria and all the others, but you command a group of dwarves instead of your own character. Three campaign levels lasting 15 hours each, and tons of replayability with randomly generated worlds and settings you can change with custom games. The dwarves may not be the smartest and will probably make you want to yell at them at times, but it is still a nice game.A quick look into the gameplay of Craft the World:

												There are a few things that makes me not recommend this.  The tutorial-system is bad at explaining certain things. For instance, trying to figure out where it is allowed to place a totem for the first time is a pain. It is in no way obvious that dirt/rock walls count as a part of a room (this is not the case in most other games). I had an easier time in both Gnomoria and Dwarf Fortrress. Lack of fast shafting options and progressive mining. You can't order your dwarfs to dig down and also set up a ladder on the way. Having this feature would've been really practical as it would speed up management. It would also be nice to have the opportunity to mine out from the ground layer by layer vertically to avoid having to set up platforms to make it faster. The ""Sisters in Arms""-DLC is sort of a slap in the face. It would be nice to have a game where women can exist without having to pay extra. I get that the devs need some way of supporting themselves, but it would be nice if their additional funding didn't involve them literally selling access to digital women in a game (that also have different stats than their male counterparts!). The crafting system is pretty lame. There's no production line that has to be managed, only potentially creating of tools. To craft things, you open up a Minecraft-like crafting window, drop things in and them you'll be able to skip that process for subsequent crafts by auto-inserting items. This also means that crafts are instant the moment you have the resources in the stockpile. Dwarves falling off platforms for no apparent reason. How food works in this game still eludes me. Do dwarves need to go to the stockpile to eat?Guess I'll go back to Dwarf Fortress or something.			"

												Rant alert:This is one of my favorite games I have bought recently. Hopefully, my 90+ hours of play time will show that! I really enjoy commanding dwarves to carve out through the depths of the underground. After I first bought the game, my first reactions were ""This looks so very nice!"", ""Wait... There are only  three  worlds?"" and ""Holy crap this tech tree!"" After my first 5+ hours I started to understand the games mechanics. Really easy to download and play, plus there is a tutorial, that is skippable when you start a new world. Now the problems I have with the game. Right around the middle of the tech tree, I find myself having to grind along. Most of that is because of a need for wool. The developers remedied this by adding traps and farms to maintain sheep. Unfortunately, both the farm fences and the trap require rope, which is made with wool, to make. Also, the AI for the dwarves still needs a little work. Often they will not pick up the resources I need and instead gather around tables for chats. That being said, the AI is not bad by any means. Recently there was an update that did help fix this. I have had a problems with occasional minor lag spikes and my saves corrupting if my computer bluescreens, which is not the developers fault. The fault lies with GeForce producing terrible cards ( and Nvidia producing updated♥♥♥♥♥♥drivers for older cards. Definitely worth $20. I would buy it again at that price, and an even better value if bought cheaper. Pros:-The games art style-Large tech tree-Large maps-Personally control one dwarf at a time-Wide spectrum of enemiesCons:-Grind, grind, grind-minor lag spikesBottom line:I would definitely buy this again and I would completely recommend this game for any of my friends.

												Nah. It's a mobile UI so you spend a huge portion of your time either fighting the interface or waiting on things to happen.Like your dwarves will craft something then toss that♥♥♥♥♥♥on the ground. If you're lucky, a few minutes later, a different dwarf will pick it up and then because they still have room in their backpack for more items, carry it to the OTHER SIDE OF THE EARTH to grab a single log before coming back and finally adding it to your stockpile. So you wonder ""Where's all the swords I crafted. Better make some more"" then you check later and suddenly you have 500 of them. Arrghh.The tech tree takes forever to climb and the game makes you build multiple of an item for the sole purpose of consuming a bunch of that resource. You can't skip ahead in the tech tree. And all the branches are tied together. So this means, you may have no interested in home decoration, but if you want to make silver swords, you have to build like 50 water fountains, a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of barrels and vanity mirrors and thatched roof panels (way more than you need) to level up your home decorating skill. WHY? Does the mobile version let you purchase resources as shortcuts or something? Why would you design it like this.I should add that the game isn't actually that bad. If you're a big fan of the genre, this game has nice art and an increasing difficulty curve. It's relaxing and you can make attractive bases. But in general, I'd say there's better entries into this genre. This one has too many frustrating UI aspects involving crafting, which is the key mechanic in a crafting game.			"

This game is a great combination of many genres : survival, tower defense, builder.... it takes the best in all of them and become a must try. Maybe less suprizing than some other of the genre, but a great game nonetheless. A least 20 hours before you get the discover (most) of the content of what the game has to offer.			"

												What an awesome Game!      I was concerned that Craft the World would be a clone of Minecraft or Terraria.   It's not!     This has quite a bit of replayability, surprisingly!   The campaigne goal of Craft the world is to master the map.   The map does have a completion (you can choose not to complete yet to keep building/mining/exploring) where you can go to the next harder map and try to survive the elements again!    Multiplayer.    The multiplayer is fun.   However...   It's not your traditional coop.  (Mixed Emotions included in this statement)   Instead of working together on your map,   coop involves teleporting to 1 of 4 Biome minimaps with a boss and a much shorter completion time.    You start on opposite sides of the map and work towards a comon goal.   There is also a PVP mode incase you want exploit your friends or a random person....   After the short Coop/Pvp map,  your back to your single player map with a reward from your coop/pvp experience.   It's a great help to the single player experience but not as easy to network with friends.   Did I mention you have to play each single player map a while just to unlock Multiplayer?   Is the game worth it?    Very much so!  Buy it already.   Think of this as a 1 player game with some cool Multiplayer ""features"" that reward your 1 player mode.   Sure you can select a friend from steam friendlist or play a random person so it is infact a Multiplayer game.    Maybe in the future there will be Coop options avaiable?   Either way,  Craft the world is a very solid purchase.			"

Craft the World gives you a team of Dwarves, a couple of tools to get started, and unlimited potential. Build a huge castle or dig down as far as you can...  Or do both, all while unlocking increasingly advanced tecnology and defending yourself from huge yetis or devious goblins. Highly reccommended.			"

								Playing this game makes me feel like I should be poking my screen with my hands. This game was clearly intended to be made for mobile platforms. The line about a mix between DK, Terraria, and Dwarf Fortress hooked me in. Wish there was a 10 minute post-installation refund window.To be fair, it is early access and my complaints are mainly UI/Control/Mechanic based so maybe that will change but I doubt it.Edit: After spending more time with it, I've changed my opinion to ""recommends"". The game UI is still largely inefficient but the game seems to have a decent amount of depth to it. I'd recommend waiting on this game until it becomes more fleshed out, unless there's a sale on it that you just can't pass up.			"

												Really engrossing sandbox game! I can't remember anything I have enjoyed as much in years.At first I was put off by the cartoonish graphics but they are actually better than most of the competition in the same genre.The crafting system is extensive and, I believe, even more extensive than you get to see.Completing the first stage in campaign mode took me 40 hours, though I played it completionistly and could possibly have knocked as much as ten hours off of that.The second stage is markedly more difficult but you do get new recipes that you did not get in stage one.If you like crafting games like Wish, Wurm Online, Minecraft etc, then my bet is you will be loving this as much as I am.Rating?10/10 so far!

Craft the World is a world building sim and a mix of Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper and Minecraft. Craft the World is also considerably long, and is undeniably fun.The game is immediately recognizable to anybody who has ever played a crafting game. It starts you off as a single dwarf who must chop, dig, and collect in order to build and fortify a shelter. Things start off very slow with your dwarf because he can only carry a small amount of materials before returning to the base. Thankfully, you quickly gain new dwarves to help out, which speeds things up considerably.Probably the biggest gameplay difference between Craft the World and other games in this genre is that when controlling your dwarves you are not directly responsible for moving them around manually. To direct them, you simply need to select enemies or materials that need to be dealt with. They will use the appropriate tool which they have equipped, which makes for a more casual experience on the surface.Some mechanics are poorly explained mainly what qualifies as a shelter and what doesn’t. The mission objective in early stages of the game is also poorly explain and players can seem lost at times.THE GOOD- Charming art- Progression system- Sandbox modeTHE BAD- Lack of depth- Poor toturialDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												It has potential but still feels unfinished. Normally that wouldn't warrant a bad review but the fact that they are releasing DLC's that should be base game content (i.e. multiplayer and female sprites) is kinda ridiculous.The reasons that the game feels unfinished are that the AI for resource collection makes no sense. Your dwarves will wander to the far end of the map pick up one thing instead of the whole pile then wander halfway across the map to grab the next thing.There's also isues in that the game feels like a massive grind, the the tree is a great feature but needs fine tuning so it feels more intuitive and less of a grind. You end up crafting a bunch of window that you're never going to use just so you can get to the next level. Again, this would be forgivable stuff if they were still working on it not releasing overpriced cosmetic DLC's.It's frutrating because this game feels like it has potential but it still feels like it's early access. You can get Terraria etc. for a fraction of the price and there are so many studios that still release content and updates for free after you've purchased that this just feels like a rip off.			"

												If you like games that involve crafting, dwarves, RPG, and monster slaying with a tower defence twiest then this game is for you. A large progressive tech tree plus lots of content such as lots of decor, spells, weapons, environment that makes the game very interesting and cool to play. Some management aspects of the game, dwarves do all the leg work and all you do is tell them what to craft, attack, and build. co-op is iffy but do not buy this game for that sole reason. This game is best played solo enjoying the ambience and transforming the environment to your needs and fighting hoards of monsters and completing objectives and building portals.This is a real gem and worthwhile game to sink some time in, I recommend you give it a shot.

												While I have enjoyed the game I would not recomend it due to the following reasons  Specialising your Dwarves by giving them skills and Skill enhancing items is pointless since Dwarves will try to do everything regardless of whether there is a Dwarf with a higher skill in that subject so you will end up with your logger doing the mining and your smither doing the logging  The tech Tree is all over the place and getting certain types of tech takes too long since some Techs get completed quickly and others(especially deccorative tech) forces you to craft an ungodly ammount of junk that you might not be planning to use  The Dwaves AI frequently Breaks causing them to stand around doing nothing(even underwater causing them to die of drowning) or just walk back and forth on the spot  giving your Dwarves too many different types of things will cause your progress to slow dramatically as the Dwarf mining might suddenly decide to trade places with the Dwarf cutting down trees  The timer for when waves of enemies attack just makes it too easy to prepare for them and it is always the same ammount of time between waves, plus it just causes you to stop doing anything every once in a while  the multiplayer might as well not exist all it is, is you send a single dwarf to a dungeon type thing and control him directly with other players dwarves  It is painfully obvious the game was designed as a smartphone game and also released on PC, its possible to play the entire game useing only your mouse movement and left click "

												Quick Summary: This game is mildly entertaining for a single level, but doesn't stack up against similiar mining/building games like Terraria, not even worth the $5 sale price I paid for it.Cons:-It seems like it was designed as a free smartphone app with in-app purchases, by which I mean the UI to get things out of your inventory is LITERALLY the worst of any game I have ever played. It makes basic tasks like putting out food for your dwarves (instead of laterns and ladders) a total chore. -There are game breaking bugs (like it not recognizing you set up a house, which is totally required for your dwarves to surivive)-There is almost no guidance, for a game that is trying to be simple I had to google search basic mechanics for the game more times than for any other I've played recently (like setting up house, farming, how to overcome glitches, how to get to the next level, etc)-As other reviewers note, the dwaves don't have amazing logic dictating their actions, so will frequently go about things in the least efficient, or most dangeous way.-Levels past the first one don't offer new technology, just slightly more difficulty and a little variation in the monsters. So if getting new technology for your dwaves is what kept you going, good luck with replayability.-Much of the technology is cool but totally useless. You can ALMOST use minecarts and tracks and elevators to save you time, but because of how quickly the dwaves mine through the dirt, this doesn't seem pratical to spend resources on.			"

												Pros: good atmosphere, a variety of enemies and crafting.Cons: the AI is simply intolerable disgusting, your dwarves will always be blunt, stuck somewhere, die like idiots. During the battle with the most powerful monster in the game, a couple of gnomes just ignored him and started to cut the vines next to it (do it automatically), when you get tired with AI, you will encounter the second problem: what, in fact, to do? And there is nothing. No plot, all you have to do - just move up the scientific tree, then build a portal to a new world and all over again, with the passage of one of the world took me 16 hours, on the second I just got bored.It pains me to play it.

												There are many things I could say about this game but I will simply say thisI just had  a game where, for no reason I can comprehend, one dwarf jumped off a stone bridge and decided to drown in a deep lake. Then every other dwarf did the exact same thing, presumably trying to retrieve his stuff, they all drowned.I am happy playing a game where my instructions can aid the NPCs and improve their stratagy, I am not interested in baby sitting a bus load of congential ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

												Buying a game that you have neither seen nor heard of is a lot like gambling. Sometimes it pays off and you get hours of fun out of it, sometimes you are dealt a bad hand. This time was the latter for me. As much as I want to like this game, it suffers from a tremendously bad UI that is clunky and not very intuitive. I had to keep replaying the tutorial because I simply couldn't wrap my head around the UI. I feel like it has a steeper learning curve than the game itself. Browsing the forums, I see others have had the same complaint and have requested everything from minor changes to a complete overhaul of the UI, and the developer's response has basically been “deal with it”. So the only hope would be for a UI mod developed by a third party. Maybe if/when that happens, I will revisit this game, but for now, it has been uninstalled and moved into my “Bad Games” category.

												This game has drag and drop, slow as balls, figgity as hell controls.  As another reviewer said, this screams MOBILE GAME.  But it's on PC.  If you like terraria, go play that, forget this exists until the developer decides to put real time and effort into making it an actual PC game.   The one thing i can say i liked was the graphics, they are nicely done.  The building system is just downright BAD, and needs a major over-haul.  Get rid of the minecraft crafting grid, it contributes NOTHING to the user experience to force people to drag and drop the items when i can't make more advanced items without the recipe anyway.			"

								Holy cow this game is addicting. I usually try to stay away from Early Access games but I picked this up when it was on sale and I don't regret it. Once I start, it's hard to stop. Lots of progression and things to do. You command dwarves to cut down trees, dig for minerals, fight monsters, hunt animals, defend off regular waves of enemies, cook food for your army, build armor and weapons, and more.Not everyone's type of game, if you're expecting something like Terraria or Starbound then you're not gonna get it here. This is a different experience for people who like managing multiple individual units and completing a lot of tasks.			"

												Its kind of RTS survival: Resourcing, crafting, building, etc. Food consumption is a good little aspect so is keeping the Dwarves alive. The permanent death setting adds a bit more care & is recommended. Invading monster armies add interest & look good for a side scrolling game. Its 2D but by no means depreciated as its still visually impressive. Higher Dwarf population gets chalenging cus they do have a tendancy to wonder willy nilly after scattered resources & go somewhere least expected. They do like to waffle on which gets annoying when one just 'walks to talk' in the way of your doing something. Better control & selection of them is deffo required - maybe a command bar on the selected unit cus direct control of a Dwarf as its problems. Game crashes are common at the time of this review. However, its got great potential & is quite entertaining & can be addictive.			"

												This game is a fun little game until you take into account that every few weeks it will randomly lose your saved progress forcing you to restart at the beginning of level one. This has happened to me multiple times now and I therefore cannot recommend this game to anyone. Perhaps I will adjust that view point if they return my saved game to me or at least unlock sandbox mode that allows you to choose a level to play at instead of forcing you to clear all preceding levels over and over again since they cannot keep saved data. There is also no way to do a manual save or to reload from backed up data. Overall that makes the game frustrating to the point of being unplayable. Fix that and it would easily be one of my top ten games.			"

												Craft the World is a very fun and addicting simulation game. You start off the game with one dwarf, a storage location and a shop to buy things. There is also technology tree where you have to complete a number of items crafted to reach the next tier. You use your dwarf to locate the items required, which could be a plant, an animal or a mineral. When you start crafting you will gain experience points to reach the next level. At each new level you gain one new dwarf to help with your city. The game does have a day and night rotation. During the night zombies, skeletons and other foul beasts will show up in an attempt to destroy your creation. When you slay them you will get some experience points and they will drop some loot. There will also be goblins that try to move in randomly during the day. The interface is very easy to use. You can drag the items you crafted into a tool bar, click it again to select it and then place them on the map. The crafting is done by dragging items into one of nine boxes. Depending on what item you place in which box you'll create an item. This might seem cumbersome at first, but the first time you make a mistake and discover an item you don't have the instructions for, you'll be happy it was made that way. I played the game at an easy setting to get use to it and have some fun. There are ways to make it more challenging. I set it so that when a dwarf dies he later respawns, but you can set it so that it is a permanent death. If you are into simulaiton games where you get to build homes, this is the game for you.			"

												This Gnomoria/Terraria hybrid is trying to be good, but has too many problems that can't be overlooked. The positive about this game is the art style. The devs put a lot of time into the graphics.However, despite the good graphics, this game has many issues:1: AI pathfinding is very bad ( both enemy and dwarf ) - I managed to find ways to slow down all the enemies in the raids to the point my dwarfs only have to fight 10% of them ...2: Dwarven logic is bad. I've watched my little guys do a lot of stupid things, such as drowning themselves to pick up a weapon at the bottom of a lake ( can't stop it ), climbing a mountain instead of using the tunnel shortcut, walking right into a clump of enemies, standing in one spot despite having a job right in front of them, hauling one item at a time even though they have capacity for three, ignoring portals and instead walking all the way across the map.3: In sandbox mode, craftable items are given randomly - many necessary things will not drop for a long time. In my case on the last play, I couldn't cook anything because I did not have the recipe for nails, I couldn't make steel items because I did not have the recipe for ingots, and my dwarves almost starved to death thanks to not having the recipe for a table.4: The crafting system is awkward. You first find the item you want to make, than click-drag items from inventory onto your pattern. This actually takes a while to make some things AND if you accidentally click on something without dragging it, the pattern is lost meaning you have to start again. Why couldn't these devs just copy Terraria's crafting system, which is a LOT easier and faster.5: The dwarves won't eat unless YOU put food on a table. This may seem like a minor gripe at first, but this mechanic gets annoying FAST!6: Unable to remap keys. For many folks such as myself, this means we can not zoom since we do NOT have a mouse wheel !!!7: Dwarves are very slow. The devs should have a 4X and 8X game speed option.8: It's very common to have goblin raids at the start of the game that can easily wipe your dwarves out!9: Raids keep getting tougher sandbox mode, despite most armor and weapons being impossible to craft due to the random nature of the recipe drops !10: Flooding is an issue. In a map that has a lot of hills, water collects in the valleys, flooding some areas out over time. A goblin village that spawned at the start of the game ended up three blocks under water ! ( that map ended up about 50% underwater before I dug drainage ditches to the oceans )11: This game becomes very repetitive very fast !			"

												This game is not ready for release.Current issues: * Co-op mode is not available from the start. The game puts you into a lengthy tutorial mode and you won't play with your friends for hours, if ever, before you're done.* UI tries to be user-friendly, with the ghost of dwarf fortress looming overhead. It's trying, it really is. And it fails, and fails hard. I could not figure out how to make a totem for over an hour before I realized that I cannot make one in the tutorial, it just gives you one. The UI for crafting is similar to minecraft misleading you to believe you have to guess the right combination to unlock it. You can't.* Path finding is path failing. A lot. You'll be scratching your head why your guys won't place a bed or a torch or a ladder, or anything, even on flat terrain. It will fail with no explanation, over and over.* To make a valid shelter you need to hit the wiki. You won't figure it out on your own. Without a valid shelter, your dwarves won't sleep in beds you make for them. By the time you get frustrated enough to hit the wiki you may realize that you've ♥♥♥♥ed up so hard you can never make a valid shelter and have to start over the whole thing.I can go on, but I stopped here and so should you.In closing, I applaud the developer for trying to make a user-friendly dwarf fortress, but there is a lot more work to be done here before this can be considered a user-friendly game.

												The briefest way I could describe this game is ""simpler Terraria RTS."" The perspective is very similar, what you're doing (gathering resources, crafting, digging deeper, expanding out, making little buildings) is basically the same, etc. However, you have dwarven minions. If you click on a tree, one goes and chops it down. Click on some dirt? He digs, then the dwarves bring the items back to your base. Although their storage capacity can be increased as you go along, sheep are required for this and other desirable items, but they seemed exceptionally rare. It takes a while for the dwarves to get back, but luckily you can open a portal that lasts about 4 minutes to ferry them back and forth for a while, which is nice.You have a technology upgrade screen that shows you how much XP you need from building things in each category to unlock the ability to build things from the next category. At night...you guessed it, enemies spawn and attack. Goblins do show in the daytime, as well, though. Another Minecraft throwback is the need to place crafting supplies on a workshop grid in the shape of what you want to build. The game will let you auto-spawn the items needed from your supplies if you've crafted the item at least once before. I can't say there was any enjoyment or call for that to be required in the first place, though. Unfortunately, much of the time is just spent watching dwarves walk around and hit inanimate objects or the occasional enemy. I built a workbench but couldn't seem to be able to place it anywhere, so my crafting was slowed down by that. An enemy attack wave counter was ticking down at the top of the screen, and it was down to about 20 minutes or so by the time I quit the game. I just found Terrarria far more engaging, as each piece of equipment you get in that gave feels like a treasure, whereas giving EACH dwarf a pickaxe, cutting axe, hat, and club and having to craft many of those just felt like a chore. When I finally did close the game, I just wasn't entertained, and had no initiative to stick around for 20 more minutes to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by skeletons since I lacked a house despite trying to make one.There -is- a note section in the game, and thinking back, maybe it tells you how you can place the work bench. I don't know. There just wasn't anything to make me want to keep playing, though I did like the sound effects, some of the UI, and the character dialog portraits. If very mellow games are your thing, this might be right up your alley, but it was a bit dull for me, leading to feelings of apathy, so I cannot recommend it.			"

Some levels force you to only go so far due to lack of resources. By learning to be more efficeient you can progress faster and a little further. After you get a large enough place micro managing starts to take up time in between waves but it never really gets too grindy and leaves you with a good sense of accomplishment.			"

												In a voxel-esque survival game where you need to build a shelter to endure the night when creatures run rampant... The most basic walls are not constructable until you reach roughly level 4 on the tech tree... YEAH! You read that correct. You start the game on level one and it tells you to build a shelter to survive... But your dwarves are to stupid to put up some wooden slabs as walls until tech level 4. I found an undead lich-knight (That shouldnt be in the inrtaductory tutorial level in the ♥♥♥♥ing first place!) which slaughtered half my stupid dwarves  (because even though they can climb walls they decided to just fall into the lich chamber and take extra damage and stun themselves) before my idiot dwarf squad could even cunstruct so much as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wooden shack.I came here expecting something like the cult classsic Diggles. Was severly dissapointed before even finishing the ♥♥♥♥ing tutorial.			"

												First hoursGraphics style, sounds and overall feeling is very nice. Early game certainly was *very* enjoyable. Although few bugs here and there were a bit worrying, overall the game is very polished. After few hours I thought that I had seen the game and started thinking that the travel distances etc. would start breaking up the experience, but I'm still happily playing :) (Even at that point I felt that I got my moneys worth.)I don't particulary like the way the game forces player to advance through the tech tree and I still don't (after hefty amount of hours) understand how certain things (like the confort level) affects anything. I was also a bit dissappointed when I realized how little meaning there is to expand your structures from caves up from ground level.In the end this is very well rounded up game and I would certainly recommend it!+20 hours laterPlayed through the first world... Game wraps up itself nicely! There are (just) enough objectives beyond the basic resource management and fortress building to keep you interested, although I needed to push myself a tiny bit from the early game to keep playing, it was worth it. Now I'm eager to try more difficult setups.			"

												While the game is pretty and interesting... it fails on some pretty important points.The tech tree is annoying... however, it is the ONLY reason to play the game. There is no story or over-arching goal here. Terraria had a goal and a little bit of a story. This does not.Next, pathing is abyssmal. Dwarves falling all over the place. Combat (dwarves fighting) is also very questionable. Again, however, there is ABSOLUTELY NO POINT.Enjoyable for a few hours of mindless fun. Then delete and install a better rendition.			"

												It's fun until you get to the second world more or less. By that point the game seems to fall apart.- The monster portal and monster spawn locations are rather erratic, to the point they can spawn somewhere that completely negates your defences, like your roof. The monster portal itself just presents an annoyance that rushes the game.- The absolute worst and most annoying aspect of the game would have to be building and crafting things. It's annoying enough having to drag ingredients to the slots like Minecraft, even more so when starting a new world when you've already done it. Beyond that, it's kind of unbalanced and repetitive because of the linear tech trees required to unlock more stuff to build. In a game like Minecraft or Terraria you can craft anything from the very start of the game as long as you have the resources and facilities to build it.Say you actually have to go down the tech tree if you want to get basic wooden blocks to build with. So when you build your first section of the base early in the game, make sure you do it perfect. Even worse that wooden towers is reasonably far down the tree to a point that by the time you reach it, it can be nearly worthless.			"

												*This is a casual game with no loss condition. The only theoretical threat comes from night-time hordes of monsters, but that's a farce. Assuming they successfully breach your defenses, they just stand there in the main hall, waiting for morning to come (at which time they burn to ashes like vampires), while all your critically injured dwarves sleep and heal somewhere else.*The crafting system for Craft The World is a textbook example of a developer ripping a system off from another game without actually understanding its point. In Minecraft, you get a 9 square grid where you can place ingredients because you are meant to actually guess and experiment with recipes. In Craft the World, the recipes are *given to you* as you advance down a tech tree, but the game still expects you to laboriously drag ingredient by ingredient to the grid every time you want to craft something. Why can't I just select the item and quantity I want and be done about it???*Most techs range from mildly useful to entirely cosmetical, but you are still required to craft several items from each to unlock the next, which results in a lumbering grind.*There are no female dwarves and population does not increase the way... one would expect. Instead, new dwarves magically teleport in when you reach tech tree milestones. There's no demographical simulation at all; this ain't no Dwarf Fortress.*You have to manually reposition all traps after every night-time invasion attempt by the undead horde. But as I said, you might not even bother, as nothing of consequence actually happens if they get through.*The sound effects are exaggerated, repetitive and get on your nerves. From non-stop loud snoring to the cheesiest battlecries, your ears don't get 10 seconds of respite.			"

The game should have been fixed quite some time ago, And if the dwarfs run around 'tying to pick up an object on the other side oft he map' one more time! and don't get me started on how they cannot even work out how to do basic tasks such as digging.

All you are doing is fiilling out research trees to get to build the final piece to end a level. Then you just do it again. All the fun of mincraft with none of the actual fun bits.Seriously all you are doing is getting materials to make more materials to unlock more materials. Very lame and not at all like Dungeon Keeper as many have suggested!			"

												Whilst its a good well thought out game and insanely fun game to start off with. After 6 hours the game turns into a bit of a grind. The game has a tech tree where you unlock better items, which is great untill you have to make 40 pots of dye and master paintings to produce better armour. There is also a version where as time goes on you unlock recipes, however I rage quit after all my unarmoured dwarfs died dispite having the knowledge to make silver armour but not the ability as they didn't know how to make the bucket required for the forge.

												The game is fun, if you are ok with the micro-management, and i liked the exploration and crafting aspect. I got a blackout on the computer during the middle of the first level, and my saved game completely erased. The previous days too. I had to begin again from the start.After a few days the game crashed at the end of the second level, and the saved game completely erased again, and the second level appear as locked, so i cant even restart the game from the second level, i have to start again from scratch. No.  I played for a few days, it was fun, but i am not goin to spend any more time with a game which randomly delete all of my progress.			"

												I would give this game 6 out of 10 points.It is nice if you want a peaceful crafting game.The singleplayer is good. There are different worlds to explore with different animals and hardships. The goal to complete the Portal on the other hand is rather boring. You have to max out the techtree every level if you are not going to play multiplayer games.The multiplayer without friends owning the game is nonsense. You need luck to get a player who is not going to cancel halfway in the game. If there would be a bonus for the remaining player it would not matter. Instead you try to achieve the goal of the multiplayer game, in the worst case sacrifice a dwarf and waste your time without getting an item. "

												This looks nice n' fun for a couple hours.then you realise how broken the game actually is.the more Area you reveal the more stupid A.I (that controles the dwarves) becomes,I've lost 9 dwarves couze they couldn't find the way out of piramid.Other 3 just stand there didn't wanted to die nor go back to home.also i couldnt controle them for one bit, they where just standing there talking with each other.This is an example of how A.I can be.After this event i pulled the red dress, sat in box and started crying while i was pretending i was a tomato.I dare you that 90% of dwarves' death will be happening due bugs or A.I retardation.I hope that convinses you to not buy this game. P.S. I hope the devs of this S.H.I.T HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLE (insert turret girl meme) game die of cancer in a slow and panful death.Overall game rating: (insert pepe the frog meme here)			"

Early Access Review
								Enjoyable crafting and exploration game in the vein of Terraria mixed with Dwarf Fortress that's well worth the low price tag to try out.It's a 2D-view game with destructable environment, crafting, and exploration like Terraria with greater emphasis on building and resource gathering. You control a clan of dwarves that grows as you increase in level, and they carry out your commands to attack, build, and gather. Each dwarf can be given up to three skills out of 12 or so allowing them to specialize in various crafting, gathering, or combat styles, giving it a bit of an RPG feel. The ""grind,"" or activity that will take most of your time, is gathering materials from mining to climb the tech tree and better equip your dwarves. A simple technology tree unlocks different building styles, furniture, weapons and armor, and the ability to utilize more advanced resources. It's a style of game that we've seen before, but it works well and has a simple enjoyment to it. There are waves of monsters every 50 minutes that attack your base with increasing force, so you've got to focus not just on gathering resources, but improving your defenses and equipping your dwarves.Aside from some incomplete UI elements like tooltips and the occasional non-reproducable bug, the game plays smooth and everything works very well. There is a campaign mode where you can ""beat"" a world by killing a number of mini-bosses to build a portal. The later worlds are both larger and less hospitable than the first one, making for a fun challenge and learning curve.Definitely recommend the game if it's within your budget and you like games such as Terraria or Starbound. It's very easy to get into and hard to stop playing.			"

												I bought this game when it was still in its early stages of development, almost a year ago. The game was fun back then, but it clearly needed a lot more work put into it, so I left it for a while and decided to come back to it once it had been updated a bit.Almost a year on, I decided to give the game another blast and see what had changed. The answer to that was, not a lot!It's a very slow paced game where you need to craft various items from basic house furnishings, to weapons and equipment. The recipes need more and more materials to create them, so you need to venture deep into the earth and explore the wild around you to find them. The problem is, this slow pace is almost halted to a crawl as the AI of the dwarves is absurd!The dwarves often stand there ""path finding"" when they are stood in the middle of an open area, with nothing around them which could be considered an obstacle. Often even a simple jump takes 20 seconds of calculations to work out how to do it.I revealed an area with some pretty tough monsters in it. A guardian whom can summon skeletons and is only vulnerable to mithril (which will take you some time to research due to the afore mentioned problems). After realising he was too tough, I cancelled my command to attack him and wanted my dwarves to go back to what they were doing. The problem was, once I had cancelled the command, this did NOTHING to stop my dwarves repeatedly running and trying to attack the Guardian. Even using the ""call to fortress"" feature was useless as that would cause them to stay in one place and do nothing, then once I cancelled this order, they would run straight back to the Guardian to try and kill him!In the end my dwarf I had skilled up to be my main warrior was killed due to his own (and the games) stupidity. After this, I decided that the time and effort I put into getting to where I did had been wasted.I would not reccommend this game unless the developers revamped the entire AI system and made the game actually playable. Until then, it's not worth £14! I would pay maybe £3 for this game, but would much rather see it offered as a flash game on some website for free!			"

												Very fun for the first world, but you start completely over on the second world with no previous progression held over. Second world could still be fun as you can make a much better base and manage dwarves better with the knowledge you're cementing from the first world. However once you've done that you have no reason to play beyond the second world. Could be much better if the worlds offer vastly different or you retained some levels or recipes from your previous world. Comparisons to Dwarf Fortress don't feel quite right as the Dwarves don't really have personalities or stats, and their power is determined by their gear pretty much and the skill books you give them. Still, I'd recommend it since it's cheap and I was seriously engaged for about a week.			"

Early Access Review
								I was looking for simple crafting games to keep me entertained, and so I decided to check out Craft the World.  I didn't expect much;  A simple 2D scrolling mining game, maybe some tower-defense style challenge, but otherwise a fairly straight forward game that was early in production.  I assumed it was a game that was probably very basic and still quite sketchy.  What I received was a surprisingly well polished game, and for that I am thankful.  So often Early Access games are mere scaffolding with a thin layer of activity -- Just enough content for testing and a lot of blind alleys to stumble into.  But with CtW, you are getting a near-complete game.  On top of that: The art is pleasing, the sound effects are appropriate, and it has catchy music.Almost everything works.  There are some aspects of the game play which do not function (such as comfort-level inducing items), but none of the lacking features cause much hinderance.Of all the ""2d semi-autonomous dwarves running around in procedural random worlds and building stuff"" games, CtW is my favorite.  It's soothing to play; Challenging but not in a nail-biting click-fest manner.  Just what I wanted right now, something to curl up in bed with and play on the laptop.Kudos for Dekovir for EAing such a polished product.			"

								I have to say, this is one of my favorite games and one that everybody in my family loves and plays.  The dwarves sometimes do stupid things like attack big bosses with little to no health (then die..) or just not escape through the portal I put RIGHT NEXT TO THEM but is just so many reasons to love it.  Overall, I have VERY little to complain about.  Even as a putz around game to play while doing other things it is great.  Set them to task and go get some stuff done.  Crafting menu is HUGE and VERY easy to use.  Can beef up your dwarves with armor and skills.  This is certainly a game that will last the test of time.			"

												Fun simple little game to relax with. Not sure it's worth the pricetag, but definately worth it at half price. The negative reviews complain about dwarves getting stuck for no reason, etc., but I've found that organising your expeditions into the earth into simple layers allows the dwarves to get around easily and without issues. The crafting is kinda tedious, but it is fairly simple, and it's easy to craft multiple copies of required items. The attacks the monsters make aren't particularly difficult to deal with, but having every dwarf with a combat skill from a book makes it a breeze, but mildly expesive to achieve. Don't expect a complex, in-depth game, and you'll be pleasantly surprised. 8/10			"

												The Good and Bad of Craft the World: Good: -Nice smooth combo-nation of building, mining, crafting, fighting and other things.-Massive crafting tree. -Graphics-May not be PS4 or Xbox1 quality, or Wii U HD, but still charming. -Good use of spells -Multiple worlds. -Music is fantastic Bad: -Dwarf AI is horrible-Dwarfs will try to pick items up when monsters are near the items, and will still go to pick up items that used to be there.-Inconsistences with the crafting tree and other worlds-On the ice world, the game wanted me to research fishing, even though there were no fish in that world. -No easy and quick way to get mana back in the early game-(expect leveling up); mana potions come in late midgame. -Frustrating moments when you need better armor or wepons, but are forced to work on useless things. Notes: -One world takes a long time; spent 25 hours in all to complete the first world.			"

												I love this game. I LOVE THIS GAME.It has simulation aspects (you commamd your dwarven horde), creative aspects (build your base! decorate your house!), and RPG aspects (stats! weapons! gear!)Working through your technology tree and uncovering new recipes is the most fun thing for me. There's no real story goal outside of ""survive"" and ""make it to the portal"" so the tech tree helps define what you should be doing next. It's also very satisfying to gear up your dwarves and start a raid on a goblin camp. Every so often, they trigger a massive monster horde to test your defenses. I play on the harder difficulties now because it really forces you to be tactical.Not to mention it has all the fun of Minecraft, too.			"

												A good game. I received a gift code from my friend and played it for a bit. Found it quite interesting, albeit it is a bit alike to Minecraft and Terraria (or some sort of games). The beginning is fun and it is getting a bit tedious as the game progresses. Time warp is a good addition to the game as it eliminates *some* of the wait. It is a good game if you can spend more time on it.// Keep it up craft the world!			"

												This is a pretty solid game, with three different worlds, and a strong resource management mechanic. Managing a group of characters is a good break from the crowd of other 2D crafting sims, which helps to make it stand out, with the option of directly controlling those characters for a time if you need to. Each world type has a different underlying mechanic, which again keeps the gameplay fresher. There are different challenges to gathering and maintaining resources.The amount of items you can make is pretty good, with a tech tree in the campaign that can be turned off for custom play. Magic spells and a mana pool add another resource to manage, with a few fun and a few more useful spells and potions. I neglected these in my first games, and my experience was the poorer for it. Mana is useful!Games run pretty long, and my main critique is the pathfinding AI. As you spread out and make tunnels branching off to gather resources, the dwarfs do have a tendency to make illogical decisions such as walking all the way to a task and then simply returning to the home base. This can be fixed by putting down a portal next to the task and bypassing the long walk, but it tends to hog mana, thereby limiting what else you can use it for. As a shortcut it works fine, but it's a shame that sometimes you are forced to rely on it. That said,  have enjoyed the game even taking that into account.			"

												Great game with a fun concept. Similar to games like Terraria but with less direct control but it adds a whole new dynamic by managing a group rather than a single person. You can still take control of a single character or let them run. Occasionally frustrating when they won't follow commands due to fatigue that's vaguely indicated so often you have no idea why they aren't working. But it's something that's quickly overlooked as a flaw. Would be nice if they could speed up a bit, once they get deep underground it takes a very long time to transport supplies and building additional supply points takes a while so once you hit a certain point it gets really mundane for a while until you jump up to the next tech. Otherwise a great game. I would give it a 8/10			"

												Ever sat down at your computer and had the overwhelming urge to micromanage nomadic dwarves into a powerful, sophisticated Gimly-esque beings? I think we can safely assume EVERYONE has had this yearning at least once in their adult life. Like rain to a desert, nay, like a backscratcher to a rashy bottom finally a game to sait our buring desire.Seriously though. This dwarven ant-farm is the perfect screen saver to have running while you study, work or do house chores. Just come back to build, reselect resources to gather and defend your keep against the various undead that swarm periodically. Each dwarf is complete with his own name and randomly selected skill. It is hard not to get attached to these bearded tomagochis.I have and will continue to recommend this game to anyone that looks NEAR my direction.			"

Early Access Review
								I've been playing this game for only a few hours, and in real life, first impressions last forever.Let's start with the Pros of this game from a new players point of view.Pro'sI liked the graphics alot, you can tell they put alot of work into it, as well as the music, the animations and the over all theme of the game it's not just slapped together.I like the idea of building a community of people versus only having myself in a game such as terraria single player feels lonely. while you might be playing alone in this game, having multiple npc's really makes the game feel alive.Crafting tree progression is really nice, it ensures that you fallow a linear path through the game to get the most of what the dev team wanted you to get out of it. Instead of just being able to build the best thing once you find the resources like minecraft. You actually have to progress through building weaker items before you get the good products.Stock Pile pretty unique never seen another game use that style of game play where your npc must go back and drop off items.Some Cons and there are only a few so far.  Wasd scrolls the screen and right clicking doesn't it really throws you off in the beginning but after an hour you will stop using it.Npc's actions seem a little clunky, looks like some bad AI at times, NOT all the time but only a minority of the time. Quest progression is in your face when you login and its very overwhelming. It says to build a shelter but doesn't give you any details. It took me 71 minutes to realize that I could over lap stone wall with stone to make an actual solid stone wall.			"

												This game has me quite torn. It has so much potential to be a really awesome game but just a few things hold it back, I think.I really like the base mechanics of the game. You don't control your people individually, but rather tell them what to do and they'll get to it eventually. This can lead to annoyance as things can become high priority to you and your people continue to do the other 'housekeeping' tasks you've set. I could be wrong, but as far as I know, there's no way to increase priority of tasks. That's definitely a problem.The other thing is that even on the 'fastest' setting, the game gets boring waiting for your dwarves to complete their tasks (even if they immediately jump on them), especially early on when you only have 1-2 dwarves and basic equipment. I know it's kind of supposed to feel like that early on, but this is too much. I'm just staring at the screen waiting far too often.Also, there is a time box constantly counting down. Every 30 or so minutes (15 I think on the fastest setting), a large group of mobs attack your people. They aren't generally too difficult to defeat, but it does absolutely require your attention. I like the feature, but not ALL the time. This is a crafting game, primarily, and the demographic that likes crafting and building usually doesn't like constant distractions. We want to build our giant god damn usless-but-purty constructions and landscapes.Lastly, the non-sandbox modes are brutal. Even if you have the materials to craft something, you can't craft it until you reach enough experience in the prerequisit tech tree research. I find myself crafting 14 'dyes' or 8 diving helmets or whatnot just to get enough experience in that tech to be able to craft further. It's infuriating at times. The crafting isn't all that streamlined either. Everytime you craft something new you must drag each ingredient from your inventory to its proper place. That would be forgivable IF you weren't required to craft nearly 100% of what's possible to craft to get to the end of the tech tree. One or the other. Absolutely not both. Like I said, this game has so much potential, and as it is, it was still fairly fun for me for at least the first time through. However, now when I play I just end up frustrated every time. It's like the designers are too concerned with 'what makes sense?' and not enough with 'what is fun?'. Streamline menus, find a new crafting/tech system, speed the game up, realtime 'increase priority of task', and don't have the mob attack timer on constantly. Maybe a mob attacks only when you steal a rune or something underground so you can choose the time.It's mostly a solid game, and I'm sure some people will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. Make note of the date of this writing - perhaps they will update it and fix some issues. I want so badly to like it but sadly it isn't there yet.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing, and it just gets better with every patch.  Sure, there are a lot of things they could do with it, that they've even set the groundwork for, and I'm sure it'll get there, but what we have now is just loads of fun.My biggest complaint is that there is a limit to how long you can really play; eventually you run out of resources, as you've mined them all from the map.  The maps aren't very big, there's absolutely no reason to explore or expand, and once you get all of your guys decked out in mithril gear, what really is there left to do?All that aside, I still highly recommend this game for anyone interested in this type.  The graphics are wonderful, the dwarves are cute, and it plays smooth as butter.			"

												Not going to play this game until they improve inventory and crafting interface. Currently it has an irretating unnecesary mechanic that makes you fill in slots with resources to craft an item first time is tideous, and completely useless. They need Terraria-style crafting not the freaking Minecraft-style crafting system. Also the interface could be much more informative.Can't say much about the rest of the game since I was not willing to put up with said bad interface design which completely breaks the flow for me!

												This game has me quite torn. It has so much potential to be a really awesome game but just a few things hold it back, I think.I really like the base mechanics of the game. You don't control your people individually, but rather tell them what to do and they'll get to it eventually. This can lead to annoyance as things can become high priority to you and your people continue to do the other 'housekeeping' tasks you've set. I could be wrong, but as far as I know, there's no way to increase priority of tasks. That's definitely a problem.The other thing is that even on the 'fastest' setting, the game gets boring waiting for your dwarves to complete their tasks (even if they immediately jump on them), especially early on when you only have 1-2 dwarves and basic equipment. I know it's kind of supposed to feel like that early on, but this is too much. I'm just staring at the screen waiting far too often.Also, there is a time box constantly counting down. Every 30 or so minutes (15 I think on the fastest setting), a large group of mobs attack your people. They aren't generally too difficult to defeat, but it does absolutely require your attention. I like the feature, but not ALL the time. This is a crafting game, primarily, and the demographic that likes crafting and building usually doesn't like constant distractions. We want to build our giant god damn usless-but-purty constructions and landscapes.Lastly, the non-sandbox modes are brutal. Even if you have the materials to craft something, you can't craft it until you reach enough experience in the prerequisit tech tree research. I find myself crafting 14 'dyes' or 8 diving helmets or whatnot just to get enough experience in that tech to be able to craft further. It's infuriating at times. The crafting isn't all that streamlined either. Everytime you craft something new you must drag each ingredient from your inventory to its proper place. That would be forgivable IF you weren't required to craft nearly 100% of what's possible to craft to get to the end of the tech tree. One or the other. Absolutely not both. Like I said, this game has so much potential, and as it is, it was still fairly fun for me for at least the first time through. However, now when I play I just end up frustrated every time. It's like the designers are too concerned with 'what makes sense?' and not enough with 'what is fun?'. Streamline menus, find a new crafting/tech system, speed the game up, realtime 'increase priority of task', and don't have the mob attack timer on constantly. Maybe a mob attacks only when you steal a rune or something underground so you can choose the time.It's mostly a solid game, and I'm sure some people will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. Make note of the date of this writing - perhaps they will update it and fix some issues. I want so badly to like it but sadly it isn't there yet.			"

												when I first launched it I liked it, but I kept re-making levels because it took me some time to find the difficultly I liked. I started from the bottom and worked my way to Hard difficultly, going through a total of 3 difficulties I think. This is a problem because you have to re-make the whole save file to change difficulties. This is more of a problem because it takes some hours until you realize that the difficulty is too easy and the game has become essentially minecraft in creative mode. If I was able to change difficulty within a save without making a new one then I'd probably recommend this game, as I wouldn't now be bored and would be further in the game progression. If this game had multiplayer I'd also probably recommend it, as it would have more re-playability			"

								I have to say, this is one of my favorite games and one that everybody in my family loves and plays.  The dwarves sometimes do stupid things like attack big bosses with little to no health (then die..) or just not escape through the portal I put RIGHT NEXT TO THEM but is just so many reasons to love it.  Overall, I have VERY little to complain about.  Even as a putz around game to play while doing other things it is great.  Set them to task and go get some stuff done.  Crafting menu is HUGE and VERY easy to use.  Can beef up your dwarves with armor and skills.  This is certainly a game that will last the test of time.			"

								Craft The World is ownly bound to get better.  There are so many more features in this game than they let me know of!  The game seems to intelligently progress in difficulty and is constantly keeping me on my toes, but not ruining the experience.  This game is like Lemmings and Terraria put together.  I like Dwarf Fortress, but we can't compare apples to oranges, folks.The fun is in the unique management that you have to endure.  There is no number crunching of taxes or balancing of peasant population to that of the warriors...  The management is in the making sure your work gets done before nightfall, keep your dwarves fed, provide a safe work environment (yes, they can slip, trip, drown, and fall to their deaths), provide shelter, and then get to your exploring.To top it off, the game is visually enjoyable.  It is asthetically color balanced and the animations are reminicent of Monty Python's cartoon shorts.I love it!			"

												I reccomend this game but only in some circumstances.It's a fine game, its well made, the art is nice, graphics are vibrant and the gameplay and crafting systems are pretty in depth. The crafting system is especially well made and is probably the highlight. I've seen some people say its hard to control the Dwarfs and it is and isn't at the same time. Early game its easy to get your dwarfs moving in one direction. Late game once you get vast chasms of mines and tunnels you'll be tearing your hair out when goblins suddenly spawn next to your house while all your dwarfs but 2 or 3 are away in the tunnels. There are some useful presets you can give to your dwarfs to perform certain jobs, the lite RPG elements are neat and give serious benefits to highly leveld dwarfs for their jobs but it becomes damn near impossible to keep track of everything and keep all your dwarfs on the same page after your population hits 20 or 30. The crafting is neat. You start you gathering resources and clearing tunnels and land. You develop a nice plot to place a house on and keep your dwarfs slept and fed and then you go from there progressively upgrading and improving your tools, armor, weapons and workbenches. The crafting system has a fairly deep system but it still didn't seem deep enough to keep me interested late game. After so long it became more of a stalemate and i couldn't keep up nor could i dig far enough and build enough ladders to get to the best ores. At this point i lost interest since i was more or less in a slogging grind and was making little to no progress. To some that may be part of the fun, and it is for me usually, but the crafting system wasn't deep enough to keep me grinding. Since crafting is one of the main, if not the main, selling points of this game that can be a hit or miss depending on who you are or what you like. I'd recommend it to people who can get this game on the cheap and enjoy cartoony games with lots of charm and a neat little twist on the craft/survive genre. Its got a bit of Minecraft, Terraria and a bit of RTS-RPG like Warcraft 3. It has good charm from your dwarfs and some of the enemies you battle. It has vibrant colors with clean, well made graphics that fit the atmosphere and gameplay perfectly. And finally the sound design and quality are pretty top notch for an indie game or Mobile port (not sure if this is a mobile port but it seems like one). Pros -Vibrant Colors and Graphics. Very clean and pretty.-Nice sounds and music. Helps keep the charm of the game up during play.-Charm. This game has a good amount of charm, atleast to me.-RPG elements. It has several layers and types of RPG elements-Crafting system. Its fairly easy to understand, a bit convoluted but has decent depth.-RTS elements with individual characters having their own equipment slots.-Many different jobs and noticable changes to productivity from job skills leveling up.Cons-Turns into a grind late game.-Crafting system wasn't deep enough to keep me interested late game or long term.-Some enemies seem very annoying, the goblins especially.-The game is good in many different facets but doesn't really excell at any one in specific.-Somewhat convoluted design to mages and some crafting recipes.-A slight learning curve, especially for those new to the genre.-Some of the items and furniture seem useless and arbitrary.Thats about it. Its good little game. I feel it was worth the price. I think i payed $7.50 or $10 for it and i got a nice, enjoyable 10 hours out of it. I'll probably come back a few months down the line to give it another play through because the game does have a lot of charm to me despite its flaws. Its a, for the most part, technically solid game that was better than i'd expected. I think it deserves a buy if you're into Terraria/Starcraft, Minecraft and other games of that ilk. I wouldn't reccomend it on its RPG-RTS elements alone but they blend together well with the survival/craft elements to make a rather enjoyable and worthwhile game, even if its worth wasn't that long for this one guy.

								This is a VERY light Dwarf Fortress-like with some Minecraft elements. It's the kind of game where you can queue a bunch of orders and then walk away for a while, come back and see most of it's done and nothing particularly bad has happened. It takes a while to work through the tech tree, which can be a little bit annoying. The game does drag things out unnecessarily but it's definitely a nice casual experience. If you want a game that requires less constant attention than a Minecraft or a DF but has those sorts of elements (resource gathering, crafting, building, dwarves, etc.) then this is the one to get. It's quite complete and playable.			"

												This game leaves a bitter-sweet singe in the retinas.  It's colorful, cartoony, and inviting with a dash of mood via the lighting system.  I was drawn into the game, wanting to play more, build bigger, and it seems like the AI or UI or something always breaks down as the game progresses.  Dwarves stop doing work or areas clearly accessible are marked as inaccessible, unless you manually guide the dwarf to the spot and click on it yourself--the dwarf happily goes to work as if nothing was amiss.  With 7 dwarves in service, I had no desire to manually walk a dwarf all over trying to accomplish tasks that were handled by command earlier in the game.""Craft the World"" is a fun, engaging game with plenty to do and incentive to keep playing more, but the wonky AI or whatever causes the workflow to disintegrate deflates the entire experience.  Just when things heat up, it gets harder to manage for some reason.  I'd recommend being cautious about this game.  It could just be my experience or flawed perception, but the AI automation / pathfinding and such seemed eccentric, at best.			"

												I very highly recommend this game. I won't go into great detail as others already have but I must say that I find the game challenging and entertaining. After the first world I feel like the challenge really ramps up. As others have stated before, Even midway through the first world will become increasingly more difficult as you struggle for resources. A HUGE help is I discovered you can put items in the crafting window to break them down for some components back and I feel not pointing this out in an extremely obvious fashion is a major oversight. Breaking down old equipment is very helpful but I do hope the developers make it so ALL crafted items can be broken down for base components. Also if the developers can add more content for the other worlds that would be a large incentive to play them as the first world can be difficult enough and the rest just get harder. With no new unlockables for the later stages it feels like I should just keep replaying the first level. PLEASE ADD MORE CONTENT!!!! Maybe add rare equipment like boots of speed, backpack of holding, flaming sword of doom, etc?			"

Not sure how it could be done, but would be nice to play with friends-Could use more levels and variety of maps.  The levels are randomly generated though which helps with replayability.-Finite number of resources.  Could use more ways to replenish resources like iron, etc.  There are ways to do this, but would be nice to know you could try to survive forever on one map. "

												Really enjoyed the crafting and building system, however the pacing of the game feels very off. Having to completely max out every tier in the crafting process in order to advance between worlds becomes very grindy. This is a 10+ hour process with little variety between worlds save a few themed block recipes, e.g. ice tables on the snow world. I believe the game would be better to have the crafting tree maxed out over the course of several worlds, using new ores, etc. The game is still fun and worth the price.			"

												Whimsical. Initially it was interesting (figuring out the system, telling the dwarves where to defend / explore / dig). Overall, however, the game doesn't scale well. It is fun at first, but after getting a sense for how to play, there aren't many choices or challenges.  Limited materials make construction of many of the objects incredibly difficult.  Dwarf AI is pretty stupid -- they don't get in mine carts, dropping objects down deep shafts, prioritizing distance objects, poorly engaging creatures, making long trips just to deliver one torch, etc. It could be managed...it just isn't fun to manage.  Crafting system is slow -- the constant moving of objects to craft something new gets old. (And yes, this is using the ""quick craft"" system.)  It is hard to manage once the tunnel system gets large. Mine carts just don't work well enough to make a smoothly flowing system -- even if you have enough iron to make that much track. Some of the above can be fixed by using the 2x game speed...but there still aren't that many choices to be made.			"

												The game looks really good and it is quite fun for the first hour or so.The problem comes when you realize you have to research the whole frigging technology tree, through tons of utterly useless technologies making the first level of the game beatable in 12+ EXTREMELY boring hours.And after you get through the first level, you hope the next one will be exciting and that you have all upgraded already, getting your hopes up for some storyline and improvements. But no... You get to do the exactly same thing in a world of ice...I honestly wouldn't suggest buying this game.			"

It's by no means like age of empires or mythology at all but it has that deep content and addiction level. LOL  I thought I might even be done with it by the time I finished the first campaign.. which was quite a bit of time... which is nice.

Different terrain made certain items that you needed ultra rare or relying un underground spawns, etc. and with a more difficult set of mobs and behaviors it made surviving a huge challenge.			"

								This is a VERY light Dwarf Fortress-like with some Minecraft elements. It's the kind of game where you can queue a bunch of orders and then walk away for a while, come back and see most of it's done and nothing particularly bad has happened. It takes a while to work through the tech tree, which can be a little bit annoying. The game does drag things out unnecessarily but it's definitely a nice casual experience. If you want a game that requires less constant attention than a Minecraft or a DF but has those sorts of elements (resource gathering, crafting, building, dwarves, etc.) then this is the one to get. It's quite complete and playable.			"

												Addictive? Yes. Entertaining? Absolutely. Pain staking mineral grind? You betcha! This is the type of game that you dig into for the long haul. My only gripe is the callouts the dwarves make, for instance, ""We're under attack!"" and ""En Garde!"" Obviously we are under attack, also, no need to tell me you are attacking when you're about to attack. ""What are you preparing? You're always preparing, just go!""			"

								This is a VERY light Dwarf Fortress-like with some Minecraft elements. It's the kind of game where you can queue a bunch of orders and then walk away for a while, come back and see most of it's done and nothing particularly bad has happened. It takes a while to work through the tech tree, which can be a little bit annoying. The game does drag things out unnecessarily but it's definitely a nice casual experience. If you want a game that requires less constant attention than a Minecraft or a DF but has those sorts of elements (resource gathering, crafting, building, dwarves, etc.) then this is the one to get. It's quite complete and playable.			"

												It's a build your world game like Terraria. It has better graphics and more explaination if you're are new to this type of game. I'm only recommending this game if you get it for under $5, at $19 it is not worth it.			"

The one and only thing I wish they would change is that you can't move your first stockpile. If I could place it where I wanted it would make the game a lot more fun. I keep restarting the level trying to get a better set up because I'm stuck with the stockpile. Please change that! I want to move my first stockpile!			"

Early Access Review
								Are you a fan of Dwarf Fortress? Is that why you are here?  Then turn around and head back the way you came.  I have never before missed DF's ability to streamline jobs like I do now.Do you feel like screwing around in a world where you cannot possibly lose or die? (if your Dwarves die they just respawn in a few minutes).  Would you like to be forced into crafting Wooden Bookshelves and Cabinets with Glass in order to unlock your next tier armor (even though you can tech straight to helmets)?Are you more interested in creating a beautiful mansion than the slaughter of your enemies?Then this game is for you!

												This game has a lot of promise, early game is tons of fun, amazing mechanics.... but... and this is a big but...The late game is absolute, complete garbage. You have to spend hours (like 3-6?) winding your way through level after level of ""research"" crafting pointless decorative♥♥♥♥♥♥(gargoyles?, furniture?) to get to the end game useful items (like top armor, weapons and base defenses). I never even made it through the grind it was so painful. And I've even read that depending on the world you spawn in, you can run our of minable resources crafting this useless trash before you get to the end of the crafting research tree.Nothing is more infuriating than a late game, game-ruining bug!

												In a game where you order dwarfs to complete task this game requires too much mico management.  Crafting esp has me frustrated by the dumb interface, dragging components onto a grid over and over and over and over in not much fun but instead very tedious.  Also as this game was really made for smart phones/tablet and so the controls are awful, no right click, no dragging, no tool tips, just bad.  There might be some hidden shortcuts(pressing i at least brings up the crafting screen) but because there is no keybinding menu you'll have to do a google to find them all.It's a shame too because it this is a really colourful game, and it's alot easy to build large structures than in other games(although the dwarfs still don't auto place scaffolding.)  So this could be a fun game for you if you can get past the interface and the micro crafting, but it's not very fun for me.			"

TL;DR: though this game has promise, and a few nice things about it, because of clunky tech trees, no military conrols, an uncompelling storyline, and no challenge to speak of, I'm recommending playing Terraria and Dwarf Fortress over Craft the World.I've logged 44 hours into this game so far, and am about midway through the second world. I've been playing the campaign mode, and haven't tried the sandbox, which means the below feedback is mostly about the campaign mode. From what I've seen, sandbox mode would probably improve the mechanics.ProsAs some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the game has some strong points. To me, these aren't so amazing that they outweigh the cons, but I'll acknowledge them: The graphics are cute, colorful, and cartoony. Tons of fun. The controls are pretty smooth. Keyboard controls are nice, and interacting with the world is pretty intuitive. Music is well done, if a bit repetative.  Crafting recipes are clever - after seeing a few receipes, you start to be able to predict the next level of the tech tree. I'll get back to this in a minute.ConsBecause it's such a mix of game genres - rogue sandbox strategy dungeon defense fortress builder - it's trying to be all things to all these genres and struggling to get close to any.The rogue element would be more interesting if it were easier to fail - one of the reasons Dwarf Fortress is so amazingly fun is that once you learn the horrible UI, you can and will lose the game. The question is: HOW will you lose. Maybe a dwarf will be having a terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad day, and then his kitten will fall off a cliff and die, and suddenly his Bad Day will turn into a Tantrum Spiral and the next thing you know you have a single completely insane 3-year-old dwarf sitting on the floor of the Great Hall amidst the rotting corpses of her family, and the goblins are coming. Craft the World doesn't have any feeling that you're living on the edge, or that you should care about your dwarves' welfare or wants. A dwarf died? So what!? Another one will appear in 4 minutes. Outfit that one with some gear, he's just about as good. Exploring felt too easy - what's the point of railroads that use all my iron and (buggy) elevators to speed transportation when I can just open a portal to where ever I want to go, and I can light the way with light spells that essentially let me explore the entire world without any help from dwarves at all?The sandbox element would be more fun if it felt easier to access - particularly in the first world where the small map means that resources are scarce, I completely strip-mined my entire world of iron and barely had enough to scrape together the resources to finish the tech tree and get those last few portal peices. I had to spend it on 'fancy chandeliers' to level up my tech tree skills. This (admittedly) would work better if I were playing in sandbox mode.Crafting & Tech TreeThe crafting window is frustrating. The UI is clunky - recipes require arranging ingredients in a specific pattern in the grid - and no easy way of doing that except with the mouse, drag and drop, drag and drop the next thing. I desperately want there to be an 'auto-fill' button, especially after you've made a recipe once - no need to drag and drop ingredients every time. The tech tree itself is frustrating - even if you know or can guess the recipe for a 'later' element in the tech tree, you MUST complete the levels below to have access to the upper-tier recipes. There's no strategy to 'leveling up' the tech tree and you can't choose what you're interested in building towards. As you get higher and higher in the tree, the relationships between the teirs makes less and less sense. For example, you have to complete the 'luxury decorating' level in order to have access to the 'master armor' level.Personally, I'm more interested in the strategy aspect of games, and having to build 15 'decorative mirrors' in order to get the best armor makes zero sense to me. The Tech Tree should have 'tracks' - related things that build up - and cross-track requirements (like creating steel from the resources track is required to make steel armor, but not required to see the steel armor recipe).Also, beer is one of the mid/late-game craftable items. Dwarves without beer for most of the game? That is no fun at all.(No) MilitaryNothing pains me more than watching my expert cook throw himself at a Beholder and die a horrible death. There's no clear way to control some Dwarves over others or assign specific dwarves to a military squad. There are essentially 3 settings for fighting:  fight a chicken or sheep: a dwarf may eventually attack it, but the chicken/sheep is too fast and the dwarf gets tired of running after it and gives up fight a boar: attract one or two dwarves to the battle and can be somewhat successful fight a skeleton, zombie, beholder, or some other hostile creature: ALL your dwarves come running at top speed just for the chance at a stab at itThere are no controls in the game to tell a specific group of dwarves to attack while another group stays home, or for one group to attack one creature while another group attack a different creature. You just have to give the order to attack and hope that at least a few dwarves show up.There could be more of an element of tower defense, except your defenses are going to be attacked and maybe destroyed with every enemy wave. There's very little in the way of maze-building, mostly you're just building traps and spikes to slow down attackers - hopefully you have enough guns built up out of reach that they can fend off a wave. Keeping defenses strong for the next wave means conserving resources that you would otherwise spend on leveling up the tech tree. I'd say that this could be a fun element of gameplay - balancing resources so that you can fend off the waves while still progressing in the game - except it's yet another gameplay element that feels extremely arbitrary. If I build bear traps, why do they disappear rather than needing to be reset? Why do cages trap zombies and not skeletons? Game speedYou can either pause the game, or play the game, and you can't interact with dwarves when the game is paused. There is no 'slow' or 'fast' game speed to help in crisis moments or speed up boring things.BugsWhen I started this game (about a week and a half ago), it was technically still in 'alpha', so I'll grant that there will probably be some bugs. I found a few of them.There's an annoying bug where dwarves with nothing to do will stand around underground next to a portal instead of returning to the house, which means they can get stranded in enclosed caves if you're not careful. My dwarves kept on falling down the elevator shaft. Ironically, the 'send feedback' button on the main screen of the game would open one of the game folders in Windows Explorer.""Story"" and BossesThere's no storyline to speak of, and though there are bosses, there isn't really a reason to fight them except to get to the next level (and once you do that, you have to start over with the tech tree, a single dwarf, and no fortress). The bosses are all the same (beholders and ""scroll keepers"") and there's no strategy to beating them besides equipping all your dwarves as best you can and then crossing your fingers.ConclusionIf you want more interesting game progression, crafting depth, or sandbox elements, play Terraria. If you like micromanaging a rogue dungeon, play Dwarf Fortress - or 'easy mode' DF, Gnomoria. I'm probably going to finish the campaign mode, because I'm a glutton for punishment and a completionist.			"

												After playing the starter campaign for several hours, I'm pretty frustrated.Crafting is painful: if you want to create something you first have to manually create all the components.I'm used to Factorio style crafting, where you choose the recipe you want and it automatically makes the components.Combat is painful: I can't seem to issue orders to individual dwarves!When a battle happens, I want to collect everyone into a group, but instead they sort of charge haphazardly into combat as they trickle in to the area.  So far I've won, but only because I'm playing on 'easy' difficulty.Equipment is painful too.  I can make a fancy smithing apron and put it on a dwarf, but how do I know if that dwarf will assign himself to smithing duties?  If I put a smithing apron on a dwarf and that dwarf starts walking halfway across the map to mine a dirt block, I've wasted my time.Keeping everyone healthy is difficult!  Left to their own devices, they don't seem to rest.  Five minutes before a battle, I have to manually click on everyone and tell them to go take a nap so they'll be ready.Building my fortress is kind of fun, but it would be more fun if the comfort rules worked better.  My fortress is an expanse of wide hallways full of chairs, because chairs give +2 comfort and there doesn't seem to be a cap.There's a huge sprawling tech tree ahead of me, and I can kind of envision how the rest of the game will work -- sending dwarves down to mine resources so I can build tech levels, bringing them back up to fight off skeletons.  I wonder if there's a way to build an unassailable fortress, either deep underground or up in the sky, so the skeletons can't get to it?  But I'm not having enough fun to keep playing.			"

But if you haven't played those, or if you prefer a more linear, more repetitive, more lacking storyline, with one-click controls, and lots of waiting, give it a go.  You'll love it.

												While the concept of this game is cool, the execution is terrible.  For a fortress management game, Craft the World is severely lacking in tools that enable the player to manage their little dwarf colony.Basically the way dwarves are managed is that you assign tasks by clicking on objects/tiles to harvest or creatures to kill, assigning things to be crafted, and for objects to be placed.  Along with these tasks, there is also the generic task of picking up objects that are dropped when resources are harvested.  The dwarves themselves decided which of the above tasks they will do, and in what order.  From what I've seen, unless one of their skills correlates to one of the jobs (more on that later), they will simply do whatever task is quickest to complete.  The only exception to this is when selecting an enemy to attack.  In this pretty much all dwarves will drop what they are doing to attack the enemy.There is no way for the player to prioritize tasks or to restrict dwarves to only do certain tasks.  This means that trying to multitask is pretty much impossible as dwarves focus on tasks closest to the stockpile because they are the quickest to complete, ignoring tasks further away even if the further ones are more important.  As a result things take forever to complete.  This is made even worse when you take the pathfinding into account, expecially when it comes to gathering resources.  When a dwarf is gathering resources it tries to fill its inventory before dropping things off at the stockpile.  This means that if its inventory space is 3, and it is holding 2 objects while next to the stockpile and there is group resource across the map, the dwarf will walk all the way over to the distant pile, pick up one object, then walk all the way back to the stockpile to drop the objects off when clearly it'd be more efficient to drop off what it has, then go pickup 3 objects from the distant pile.The only real management tools the player has is a portal and the mostly worthless skills mechanic.  The portal spell opens a temporary shortcut between a tile on the map and a the stockpile.  These portals are taken into account when calculating the speed at which a task can be completed, artficially giving distant tasks a higher 'priority' in the dwarves todo list.  However, in order to keep the piority of distant tasks high the player must constantly open up new portals near distant tasks as the tasks closest to the old portal gets completed, as the further a task is from a portal, the lower its priority is.Along with the portals, each can also have up to 3 skills that can influence which types of jobs it takes.  For example, a dwarf with the mining skill will try to mine blocks before it tries to cut down trees, even if the trees are a quicker task to complete.  Unfortunately this mechanic is almost completely worthless as each dwarf only starts with one skill, and what that skill they start with is competely worthless.  This means that you'll most likely start with a bunch of dwarves that are skilled in worthless stuff like swimming and milling, when you really need things like mining, logging, carpentry and smithing at the start of the game.  Furthermore, the only way to get new skills for a dwarf is by applying skill books to a dwarf.  These books are rare drops that you get sometimes after harvesting a resource.  Unfortunately what skills these books teach are also completely random, meaning that you might go an hour before a book drops with a skill that you need.Overall the gameplay is excrutatingly slow and tedious.  As far as I can tell the ""Campaign"" of the game is just a sequence of randomly generating maps where in each one you have to build a portal in order to reach the next map.  The portal pieces are hidden in secret rooms underground that you have to find.  As levels progress the maps slowly get bigger and the difficulty gets higher.  There are no special scenarios or win conditions for any of the maps as far as I can tell, making the Campaign feel extremely boring and repetitive after the first level.In short, do not buy this game.

												I supported this game from day one and enjoyed it UNTIL the multiplayer came. I do not mind the multiplayer but now its ALL about the multiplayer. All patches now is just for multiplayer, all new content is just for multiplayer, all multiplayer stuff is just for multiplayer and you cannot even go to any of those places if your in single player.So if your looking for this game for multiplayer, go ahead, but if your looking for it for single player, then you can forget it because the single players are forgotten, everything is just for the multiplayer and nothing anymore for the single players.Also AI still broken (you want something collected, well dwarf standing next to it will just stand there while dwarf on other side of map will come to collect it, i mean really!!!), there is still lots of other bugs in the game, so instead of them fixing this first they decided to bring in multiplayer and concentrate only on multiplayer.Its funny how us single players brought in the money but now we are forgotten.I do not recommend this game for single player because we get nothing now.Edit (2016-11-23) : I like what they did for Haloween but i wish they can get back to new content for the single player.Edit (2017-03-22) : Again a new DLC just for the Multiplayer and no new content for the single players. My review still stands because they have forgotten the single players.			"

								The amount of depth here is mindblowing. This really is like a 2D, playable Dwarf Fortress, but with some tower defense elements. I was afraid it would be like Terraria, and be very twitchy and over the top, but it's not. I'd recommend this game to anyone who really, really, really wanted to get into Dwarf Fortress but just couldn't because of the terrible UI and steep learning curve. I've put 20 hours into this game without even realizing it, and I'm only on the first world. Really well done.			"

												The most annoying part of this game for me, is if a strong monster walks into your camp when you have only a few dwarves at the start. They will get stomped on. And you won't be able to progress any further because they will just constantly run away as the monster is partrolling your stockpile. I have just restarted a map 4 times because this happened 3 times in a row when starting the second level of the game.			"

												I don't know who the f**k figured out the shelter system but it's damn ridicilious. Once I figured out how to build up a shelter for the dwarves, it got to a point where I couldn't get my dwarves in since dwarves can't get through doors but the shelter comes incomplete once I open the hatch. So now I have a shelter which I can't use.Also the ♥♥♥♥ing AI is horrible. 50% of the time your dwarves just stand around finding a path which haven't changed. Once you order them to attack the skellies, 1 or 2 might act and the rest just keeps gazing the scenery while their friends get slaughtered. And the game looks♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ So does dwarf fortress but atleast it has a solid gameplay. Uninstall this and I hope there would be a way to get my money back. This game isn't worth a penny.			"

												At this time, the polished artwork temporarily hides the flaws of this game. While not game-breaking, the flaws make you realize you are playing an unfinished shell of a game that is simply wasting your time attempting to compensate for those flaws.  Pros++ Polished Artwork and original style+ Little to no bugs or game-breaking errorsCons-- Bad AI for Dwarves and Monsters-- Very Small Worlds -- No Campaign or Plot- Very limited bestiary- Constant and predictable monster waves- Boring/slow crafting system- No autofill for recipes - Lots of pointless click and drag- Limited in-game resources prohibit creativityEx. The player controlled spells like the Portal Spell are merely tricks that lets you bypass the slow gameplay and clunky AI of your minions.			"

												i've played quite a few hours of this game while in early access and as such, it is good. but i honestly thought it was still in early, as the interface is still clunky and the AI is buggy. sometimes the dwarfs just stop and tries to figure out what to do next. even if there are plenty of unfinished task close by. the tech tree seems off, with decorative stuff being mandatory to get usefull things. you will end up with enough decorative items to get 100% on several housings before getting to the end of the tech tree.the graphics are nice and the audio compliments the speed of the game. it is a slow pace most of the time, you just mark out what to mine/build/attack and it will be done.as the game is now, i would not recommend it, it needs to be polished more, but if it gets the crafting UI sorted, the tech tree re-designed and the AI improved, this is one of those games where you just relax after a frustrating day, looking at your minions do your bidding.

												This game brings together the best parts of Diggles, Dungeon Keeper and Minecraft. There are a lot of items available to craft and different types of materials that can be used to build shelter. You can build traps and automated turrets, equip your dwarves with different weapons and teach them different skills using books. The goal of the game is to kill 5 guardians and rebuild the portal to the next world. There are 3 different worlds available (normal, ice, desert) with different creatures, weathers, resources and a few specific items available only in this world.After 30 hours of gameplay on a larger size map the game becomes a bit boring. Dwarves move slowly, mana regenerates slowly (so you cannot be using portal spell too often), maximum speed of the game is x2 (I play on max speed 95% of time). There are a few minor bugs, but they don't prevent from enjoying the game - sometimes item cannot be removed from a quick access bar or dwarves behave as if their IQ dropped to one digit number. Quick access bar at the beginning seems quite small but you get used to it (and there is another one available by pressing ctrl). There is no loading a save game - game autosaves, so when you exit you come back to what you built, hence it is not possible to undo mistakes (other than to copy save files to another directory and then bring them back).I don't remember a game released in the past few years which would be so cheap and which I would play so long - this game is definitely worth this £14.00.I am looking forward to see some other means of transport like horses, increased maximum game speed to x5 or x10 and normal game save/load system.

												Love the game alot, its fairly casual and laid back (With its own intense moments) But there are some things that I would see changed.First off, I really love the DLC.  The woman-folk are awesome and sound cute.  Much better then the males sounds which sound somewhat...dorky.As for things I would change? The crafting system is the very first thing that comes into mind.  I understand the crafting table recipe thing but it just sorta feels really clunky.  You could have it so individual recipe's can just be made right away without having to put things together first (I think you can do that once you crafted at least once) but being able to do so right away would be better.  For instance, just have a 'materials needed' screen toggle, so that if a person wants to try to blindly make something by putting things in a recipee window, they still can.Next thing, and I would DEARLY love to see this, is a auto-equip feature.  Having your drawfs automatically equip the best armor that is avaliable instead of having to go through each dwarfs inventory would be great.  There could be further toggle abilities to include weapons, and for what type.  For instance, a toggle that lets your dwarf pick up their best fighting based items if they have skill in that type of weapon, so a Mage will automatically pick up mage stuff.   This could include tools as well.  To further complicate the coding, you could even have them auto-equip crafting tools whenever a particular dwarf goes to make something for you, since the ones chosen to craft seem to be fairly random.I would also love to see the ability to place down wall tiles in a large group, with more than one dwarf going for it if you shift-selected or something.All in all, these things do not break or even really hinder the game.  It only slows stuff down a tiny bit, and for some, micromanagement is a big plus, so its not even a negative for those people!I also look forward to the pets.  Hope there is some kind of tutorial for how to get them.			"

												I bought this game a good bit ago before they added multiplayer or any of the other 'new' things they've released. And even after they added these updates it just made the game better. Heres what a typical player would do: Start, skip the tutorial, get the basic tools for your little buds, and go to town mining, chopping trees, fighting enemies, etc etc. I just don't understand how people can complain about such a fantastic game.. There is nothing wrong with the combat, its entirely straight forward and simple, you click and tell your slaves to attack and they attack, most of the time wrecking the ♥♥♥♥ out of anything that attacks them. I started off and got myself 5 dwarves before the first medusa cyclops eye monster came and they all had basic clubs in their hands when they ran to fight it, know what happened? THEY ♥♥♥♥ED IT UP!!!And on to the mining and chopping, its tedious, not gonna lie about that. Your slaves will run around and act all derpy and take 2 hours to go and place a ♥♥♥♥ing torch or put down a ladder, but thats just because they prioritize certain things like fighting or mining something before they prioritize placing a torch or ladder. There is NOTHING wrong with their system of prioritization, its pretty damn good! Over all i'd give this game a very nice 8/10.Why? because its a fun♥♥♥♥♥game and i like to kill zombies with a bunch of slaves! XD			"

												Love the game alot, its fairly casual and laid back (With its own intense moments) But there are some things that I would see changed.First off, I really love the DLC.  The woman-folk are awesome and sound cute.  Much better then the males sounds which sound somewhat...dorky.As for things I would change? The crafting system is the very first thing that comes into mind.  I understand the crafting table recipe thing but it just sorta feels really clunky.  You could have it so individual recipe's can just be made right away without having to put things together first (I think you can do that once you crafted at least once) but being able to do so right away would be better.  For instance, just have a 'materials needed' screen toggle, so that if a person wants to try to blindly make something by putting things in a recipee window, they still can.Next thing, and I would DEARLY love to see this, is a auto-equip feature.  Having your drawfs automatically equip the best armor that is avaliable instead of having to go through each dwarfs inventory would be great.  There could be further toggle abilities to include weapons, and for what type.  For instance, a toggle that lets your dwarf pick up their best fighting based items if they have skill in that type of weapon, so a Mage will automatically pick up mage stuff.   This could include tools as well.  To further complicate the coding, you could even have them auto-equip crafting tools whenever a particular dwarf goes to make something for you, since the ones chosen to craft seem to be fairly random.I would also love to see the ability to place down wall tiles in a large group, with more than one dwarf going for it if you shift-selected or something.All in all, these things do not break or even really hinder the game.  It only slows stuff down a tiny bit, and for some, micromanagement is a big plus, so its not even a negative for those people!I also look forward to the pets.  Hope there is some kind of tutorial for how to get them.			"

												I bought this game a good bit ago before they added multiplayer or any of the other 'new' things they've released. And even after they added these updates it just made the game better. Heres what a typical player would do: Start, skip the tutorial, get the basic tools for your little buds, and go to town mining, chopping trees, fighting enemies, etc etc. I just don't understand how people can complain about such a fantastic game.. There is nothing wrong with the combat, its entirely straight forward and simple, you click and tell your slaves to attack and they attack, most of the time wrecking the ♥♥♥♥ out of anything that attacks them. I started off and got myself 5 dwarves before the first medusa cyclops eye monster came and they all had basic clubs in their hands when they ran to fight it, know what happened? THEY ♥♥♥♥ED IT UP!!!And on to the mining and chopping, its tedious, not gonna lie about that. Your slaves will run around and act all derpy and take 2 hours to go and place a ♥♥♥♥ing torch or put down a ladder, but thats just because they prioritize certain things like fighting or mining something before they prioritize placing a torch or ladder. There is NOTHING wrong with their system of prioritization, its pretty damn good! Over all i'd give this game a very nice 8/10.Why? because its a fun♥♥♥♥♥game and i like to kill zombies with a bunch of slaves! XD			"

Early Access Review
								This is an Easrly Access game, but as soon as you press the ""play"" button, it will be almost forgoten. Craft the World is about you controlling/commanding your little dwarf tribe, building/expanding your shelter, collecting resources that will help you keep dwarves fed and fresh, always ""begging"" you for some more work. That sounds simple enought, but there is some more depth to the game. Monsters, like zombies and skeletons, roam around mostly at night, goblins may camp nearby and propably will raid you and even more horrifiying creatures dwell deep under the ground. On top of that, every 50 or so minutes a wave of monsters will appear on the map at night. You will have to survive till the morning. The waves will get stronger as you level up. Oh, did i say that you lvl up? Well, sure you do. You gain experience constructing new buildings or armor, mining, chopping down trees, killing enemies etc. For every level you gain, you get one more dwarf under your commands. You can micromanage every dwarf (i m currently level 10, with 10 dwarves), in a pretty simple and easy way, applying to them new armor sets, weapons, mining and logging tools and stuffs with special properties that increase their ability in certain things. Every dwarf can have 3 specializations, from crafting or mining faster, to dealing more damage to enemies. There are many more things concerning the depth of the game, but i ll leave it up to you. Of course, there are some issues with the UI and some minor bugs, but having in mind that this is an Early Acces game, it is well done till this point. Currently i m on a campaign mode, playing the first map and have spend 20 hours on just that. I nealry have completed all the skills tree and there are many more things to do. Reading negative reviews from players with only 2 hours on this game, is a great great facepalm.			"

												Game with lots of insanelly annoying bugs. Also game have cheating mode already in the game. One freaking dwarf under controll of a player can move way faster than normal, build everything without walking to supply spot where AI controlled dwarfs must go every time to get needed items!!!!This is stuplidly silly casual or should I say reta*d mode for pathetic players that need cheating implemented in game to be able to beat it! Stupidly dumb made game!AI cannot use its advantages like distance. In many cases when they can attack from high ground like 2 blocks down they instead in some percentage will go down even if they have long range weapon like staff or bow :)Creator of this game have no logic at all. Iteams in shop are way cheaper than buying needed resources and creating them on your own! Resources needed are priced such way that it would be higher price to make iteams on your own.New features like unocuppied dwarfs that make stuff in shelter they make it for free. All is needed is that in tech tree such object is unlocked for example better beds. They will make them FOR FREE! Same with food no resources are needed if dwarf make it on his own LOLRat nest in base spawns insane ammount or rats! ACCIDENTALLY attacking one can trigger rat armageddon and simply wipe out all dwarfs!!!!! What retard would make such thing!If they would spawn 1 per 5 minutes tnen ok but NO after nest spawn they pop out in about 5-7 and then spawning very fast!There is simple way to beat them. Build earth where they stand and they are killed like snails. Also build anything in the base and dont leave any free spot that will make nest spawn impossible. But when player rebuilds his base and have poor shelter rating then nest will pop out with 5-7 rats and then just accidentally attack one of those !@#@$# and you are done. VERY BADLY DONE FEATURE!!!! For those mistakes creator is just blind or to dumb to see.Game with this bugs can outrage player. Also retardness of dwarves can make player go mad!AI is pathetic!! They can fall into huge holes just like they would not see that hole in bright light. In many cases when player use button for returning to shelter they stand and get beating from enemies! Player need to turn it of and on to make them move. Or commanding them to go to sleep is also bugged I need to spam go to sleep button so dumb dwarf with almost no HM is forced by me to go to sleep othervise if I am not spamming that button or shortcut ""r"" then if they are attacked by enemy they engage. So stupid! They stand in spot and get beating while nor teacting to beating or repeatedly command to go to sleep! That game can make player mad with those idiotic bugs and idiotic game features.Author with every patch adds new bugs to replace old fixed ones. For example in newest patch with new animations and dwarfs graphics (totally unnecessary!) dwarfs turbo chat with each other and can slide on their feet while chatting :D			"

												A Great fun game of Terraria / Dungeon Keeper / Lemmings. Spent about 14 hours to beat the first of four ""Level"" and had a lot of fun. Thinking I would roll into the second level with increased difficulty and a modest stash from my first world I was left in shock to find out that absolutely nothing carried over. Not feeling on spending another few days trying to do the exact thing over again I tried the ""New"" multiplayer (6 month old at time of writing) with a friend and, again, we had a lot of fun. It was confusing that somehow I had my units and supply from my singleplayer but my partner had a fully unlocked tech tree, eventually the same problem as single player that when we had to call it a night we lost everything and couldn't return to the game we spent 5+ hours in together. TLDR; 3.5 / 5Buy it on sale +Great fun for a single playthrough, 8-12 hours-Minor Bugs-No replayability or proper multiplayer co-op			"

												I am a fan of succinct and to the point reviews. I will do my best to adhere to my own rules with this review.Pros: - Technology tree is awesome- Graphics are extremely well done (specifically the environment/textures/objects). Though I found the character sprites a bit on the cartoonish side (including the enemies - just a minor personal gripe).- Enough going on to keep you busy for several hours.- I loved the idea of an Altar/Shrine!Cons:- Crafting interface is unforgivable. You must drag and drop each instance of the resource required. WHAT? Whose idea was that?- Not enough to work towards (while my own time with this game was brief - I was able to get a good sense of this aspect by watching several in-depth YouTube reviews)- No risk/reward mechanism. You won't really die if a ginormous Zombie smacks you around and falls on you! I prefer challenge and some sense of realism!- The world needs to be much much bigger. Think Terraria sized worlds.- You can't truly take control over the characters. Sorry, I like full control Yes, I am a control freak when it comes to these kind of games.Overall I feel this game needs a lot of improvement to get it to where it needs to be.In the meantime I will get my fix by playing Terraria!

												I am quite motivated in giving this game a bad review.I hope i can help other people to be mislead like i was by the 90 % positive reviews.This game is boring and clunky.I think this kind of casual game could be nice to play : no pressure, just a pleasant relaxing game.But this one fails at this because the gameplay is not pleasant enough. you need to be crafting stuff all the time to advance and you can't take time to watch your dwarves and remain efficient at the same time.I don't think i'll open the game again. Even at low price, it is not worth my time/			"

												This game was fun for the frist 30 minutes, after that it just...blah, It was quite annoying to be honest, trying to stop the dwarfs from drowing every 5 minutes. The reason I got this was because I thought (from the trailer) that you could build an awesome 2D dwarf castle, insteadd I got very bland gameplay and weird game mechanics, monsters that attacked and killed a dwarf every night, losing its skillset entirely. I was just annoying.Maybe its just because I'm not into this type of thing, I just thought it would have offered abit more varriaty.I don't recommend it.~Gloomyguygaming			"

												Really bad game, but you'd be forgiven for thinking that it might be anything decent. The game does have pretty good presentation and art, but the actual gameplay is probably not what you're expecting.Personally I was thinking that this might be like dwarf fortress, but it has nothing to do with management. It's more like a 2D horde survival game where you don't control the characters directly, and you exploit the surrounding countryside for stuff to craft into tools or weapons or even blocks.Every night a horde of undead will try to assault your holdings. It does sound fun maybe, but there's just too many  restrictions put into place. You can't place traps and since you can't control your dwarfs directly you pretty much end up staring at them mucking about trying to exploit or fight for you.The game is very slow paced which might be neither good or bad depending on what type of player you are, but you're probably going to feel that there's just not a lot of interesting things for you to do in the game. It's simply a boring, boring game. If you're a migrating DF player like me - then I definitely don't recommend this game. If you however are looking for a very slow paced 2D shooteresque game with light management elements in it - then this might be for you. Regardless I don't give this my personal recommendation.			"

												I really gave this a shot. I restarted more than twice, just trying to get through the tutorial level. And... nevermind that the requirements for a *basic* shelter are really hard to satisfy, I wasn't having any fun. Everything takes forever, and not in a ""I am living in a simulation"" satisfying way.I had dwarves coming out my rear before I could build a shelter - the basic walls of which are apparently advanced technical knowledge; in this universe, iron forging is less complicated than shoving some logs together - and the shelter stopped working if I tried to add new levels or dig underneath or... well, anything that games like Terraria solved literally years ago. I keep seeing people saying they had fun with this, and I'm genuinely at a loss. The tutorial doesn't work right. You can't build basic shelters until after you've discovered the Bessemer process. Just... why?			"

								Looking at the trailer, which played at ""light speed"" mode, made a good impression on me that the game looks fun.Here is my little tales after picking up the game, played it for an hour.And the first bad thing I notice is the said game speed itself.I don't mind much the dwarfs working so slooowwwwly. But the pacing of their movements leave a bad taste in my mouth. Imagine buying iron ores from the shop, which was 2 screens away, which I didnt expect the bought items to drop on the floor like that. Now I'd have to wait.... for certain worker to decide that ""OH THERE ARE SOMETHING I COULD PICK UP THERE"", then wait for a few more minutes for them to walk, again, slowly. to the shop. pickup items. ""OH, the bag is full, I should go back""...... Then after arriving at the base, it'd have been night, which I'd have to lock the house for the safe of the party.The night was passed by, slowly, something like  5 or more minutes of unable to do anything.... because it was night time, with peril monsters and ghost wondering around. I really wished I could dig down the house to do something below... but it was not possible due to the prohibition during the night. Ah, well, zzzzzzzzzz............the new dawn has come, with the light of the sun, the darkness was gone. The dwarfs went out on their journey. I hoped for them to go and take the ore I had bought yesterday.... but NO. They like the woods and stones dropped nearby, so they all went in another direction, slowly, to get something I dont really need at the time, without a way for me to say ""HEY YOU RED, GO THERE!""And thus I closed the game... hoping the bad cloud in my mind would dissappear when I went back for the game, one more time, some time.Maybe.Hopefully.At the current state, I'd not recommeneded the game to anyonem looking for some Terraia HD. I shall see again after some more updates from devs.....			"

												Craft The World looks very nice, but unfortunately, it wasn't what I was looking for. It possesses the same problem which caused me to abandon attempts to play Terraria: there is simply too little complexity in game's world, so in the end procedural stories do not quite happen.Quite simply, CtW isn't ""simplified Dwarf Fortress"", but rather ""Terraria with Somewhat Indirect Control"". While you (usually) do not take direct control of any single dwarf (although there is such an option, and it's often helpful), your dwarves show very little signs of thinking for themselves. They have no mental model like those of DF, and they certainly seem far more simple than, say, heroes in old Majesty game. Watching them is plainly boring, because they rarely do things for themselves, but only hurry to complete tasks you set for them, idling or sleeping when there is nothing to do.Also, this is a game about DWARVES where said dwarves do not quite care for BEER and only brew it for a very slight food value at high level of technology. WTF?!I guess CtW isn't a BAD game per se. Maybe it suits someone who likes management games, or something else which I don't like. I would refrain from marking my review as positive or negative if I could. Just don't expect it, like I did, to see an independently living world in it.On a positive side, I must remark that this game is REALLY beautiful, and sound of birdsong is very nice too :)			"

YouTube™ Video: Craft The World 5 Minute Review 

			Views: 646		

			Buy it now on Steam! Or don't...		

Tl;dr; Not a bad game, but somewhat slow en tedious on the crafting level. Darf AI isn't too great either with them getting stuck or just left clueless often. Multiplayer is a true grief-fest, but what did you want? Fun to play if you can live with its flaws.----------------So it's all about crafting a world for you dwarves. They have opened a portal which only had the power to transport 1 brave pioneer into your playfield and depend on your guidance to prosper and thrive. That is, if you can hold off the forces of evil that come out every night and every 45 minutes (the Devil sure is punctual).To do so you need to gather resources by clicking on them. After that your eager dwarves will mine or hack away and carry the stuff back to the stockpile where it can be used to craft new items/base decorations/fortifications/food/...Sadly not all dwarves are born with an Einstein level intellect so you will be wondering why 1 of them (let's call him Toby) is always doing the exact opposite of what you want. Be prepared to bail Toby out a lot with portals, scaffolding and ladders.Building the actual shelter is pretty basic and not too refreshing. The only real notable thing is the aura of the ""Totem"". The more comfort you give the dwarves, the larges their base will become. Which in turn gives you more space for more dwarves.You get new darves by leveling up through crafting, completing tasks and combat. It somehow makes it feel too much like a mobile game by doing this, but then again every other comparable game does it... Leveling is pretty fast in the beginning but slows down incredibly after lvl 10, however the monster waves don't.So you day to day management will be:-  gather resources- craft what you need for new technologies- give dwarves new items- expand baseSounds like a lot of fun? Well it is in the beginning... but after a while you need to craft 100 fancy chairs just to be able to pass on to Steel armour. It makes no sense to me, uses up a lot of resources and especially slows things down dramatically. The first ""easy"" world will take quite a while to complete, even with cheats...And then there's multiplayer... for the love of God or Buddha or whoever you wish to believe in, do it with friends or alone. Chances are random players will screw you over beyond belief sending you right back to your tedious crafting without any reward whatsoever.So all in all I want to really like the game for its ideas and just because I love the genre, but I'm stuck just barely liking it because some things can be too frustrating. If you can get it on a decent sale then don't doubt, otherwise there are better alternatives.			"

												The AI is dumb and you don't give me control of them individually. I'm trying to play on Nightmare and Permadeath mode but my dwarves are just so stupid it makes the game incredibly frustrating. I won't recommend this game until you remedy this by allowing me to micromanage my dwarves and not see them waste time/be stupid/ do whatever. I just had two dwarves have the idea to charge a Beholder at level 2 because... yeah, that's a wonderful idea guys.The game is simply unplayable like that. It's ok if you play on Easy and just want to build.			"

												not a good game. designed to be addictive, not fun. the technology tree is full of arbitrary interdependencies; you have to build x traps and y pieces of furniture to get to the next tier, there's no chance to specialize. so you can't really choose to play it as a building game or a mining game or a tower defense game. it's just a grind with a clunky mobile interface and a lot of unsatisfying tedious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I knew this by hour two but kept playing anyway. stay away.			"

												Unfortunately this game is too slow to be interesting. It also has a lot of mobile tendencies that do not translate to the PC. My main gripe is that you need to drag recipe ingredients over the first time to craft. It's needlessly slow and once your ingredients list gets a lot larger it's harder to find them.I say skip it entirely as this is probably not the game you're looking for. It has a lot of good ideas that just fall flat.

								The game is actually pretty good but it is shamed by its clunky interface. You have to single drag every ingridient into the crafting system, every time. Its such a paint in the♥♥♥♥♥ Also to place items you need to drag and drop to your small hotbar.This game have UI designed for a smartphone or tablet. Drag drop crafting very very quickly loose its novelty, and after that its just a chore.			"

After 10 hours into each map, I can tell you a full squad of dwarf climbing down walls into a deep pit... just to fall to their own death to fight one lonely spider, when there is a ladder to climb down... it gets old after a while. And that moment where all my dwarves were stuck using an elevator going up and down without going to their destination ( Ive read there is a patch for elevator, might be fixed ). Also that moment where a monster wave wiped my dwarves clean after 15 hours of play in the map... because of a patch to make the waves harder! Woo.Its an addictive innovative game. Slow, frustrating often, but fun. Just wait when it will be complete for better experience~!			"

								This game is a LOT of fun. I've found myself unable to put it down once I start. One thing you have to keep in mind while playing it is that it is an early release game and so there are a few things that are a little quirky here or there. With that in mind, I'd like to make a few suggestions (if anyone in the development team is reading these):1. When you are able to control the dwarves, give some options to put them into gather mode and then allow the user to click an area that you want them to gather. I've found that often times if you have multiple areas being worked on, the dwarves will not gather what has been chopped down/killed/etc. And if you control a dwarf and bring him to the area it is hit or miss as to whether he will gather the materials there. That's a bit aggrivating when you are low on iron and there is a bunch of it on the ground that they have mined.2. Add a warp feature where you can speed up time. As others have said, on large maps it takes a long time to watch your dwarves go from one area to another. If you could speed up the clock by 2x, 3x, 4x, and finally 5x multipliers that should solve the issue.3. Give the option to craft a new supply hub/portal. This way the dwarves could bring it to multiple locations and remove some of the time it takes to get from one to the other. Another idea might be instead of creating multiple supply hubs, to give a permanent teleportation base that ports you back to the main hub (much like the spell) that could be crafted and multiple dwarves could simply walk through it.These are just a few things that I've noticed so far (fairly new to the game) but overall I am really LOVING this game. I would recommend it to anyone that likes these types of games. Check it out!			"

								idk how it will turn out, but currently its definently not worth the money, its lack of total advancement and massive bugginess definently outwiegh the generally good idea, a good free game, definently not a good 15 dollar one. EDIT: @soviet, its linear gameplay in general makes it not really very indie so once its beaten it actually has very small replay chance, the game has a very slow advancement to begin with so its easy to get bored while playing, the lack of complex combat or mining doesnt help. I dont think you understand how buggy this game actually is, half the time your dwarfs totally fail to do the job set out/get stuck in a wall. on the off chance that it doesnt bug out and you actually harvest the item you will 30% of the time fail to pick it up,  the problem isnt so much that the GAME  is just terrible as the fact that you must pay $15 for a game that is totally unfinished, i dont mind beta testing but this game should not be pay-to-play			"

								I want to like this game.  Hell, I want to love it.  I love building games, I love dwarves, but I hate this game.  The AI for the dwarves is AWFUL (they like to walk in circles or just not move at all) which makes every other thing in the game terrible.  Combat, gathering, building...   that aside the ""tutorial"" is insufficient.  ""Build a shelter.""  Easy enough right?  Yeah, YouTube it and see how many people created videos because it's NOT easy enough.  Once the AI issues are resolved I'll play again and try some more and hopefully change this review.Update: 5/1/16Game is still not fun.  Dwarf AI is awful, pathing is no good.  Then once the monster portals start spawning you're screwed.  Don't waste your time.			"

												""Don't judge a game you've never played""  or ""Don't judge a game by photos""I've seen this game surface on steam and never quite saw any interest given by the pictures.  Why I never went to youtube to see what the game was about is beyond me.  Craft The World is by far the most addictive game I've come across since Plants vs Zombies (1), Field Runners and Prison Architect.  I woke up one morning, played all day and night around the clock till 6am.  That's how addictive this game is.  The whole minecraft, side scroller/builder is awesome.  I never thought something like this would be so much fun.  Albeit it needs more updates with bugs and a few new ideas; this game is amazing.  I can't say much about it.  For $10, it's a damn steal.  You must try this game without asking questions.  Remember, Cash shop is not pay to win, to gather water you need buckets in your inventory and just click on the water and choose gather or fish.  Just a couple of stuff I came across I couldn't figure out and felt stupid how much of a common sense it was.5/5			"

								Short verdict: Too slowHonestly, it's not a terrible game. It's just slow and unwieldy, and not terribly friendly to beginners.It features Minecraft-like crafting, with exploration much like Dwarfs!. However, it's a side-scrolling oriented interface, so the initial dwarf settlement on the surface must try not to delve too greedily or too deep - at least not too soon.			"

								Played the games for some hours and had fun playing it. Despite that I would not recommend this game (at this development stage) as the game has a steep learning curve compared to other games. In a regular game nowadays you will get the time to learn step by step what you need, how to get it, etc. In this game it is all trial and error. As the game is still being developed I hope that the developers will choose to make some changes to make it more ""builder"" friendly.The game revolves around getting building materials and getting increasing access to more advanced buildings. Before the first night falls, you will at least need a basic shelter to not get your dwarves killed right away. The way the game incrementially intoduces you to new buildings and craftable objects is good as you will not get overwhelmed by the possibilities (which are huge). With every object built you unlock the next object.Besides the building the game lets you also encounter enemies. As these enemies already come at the first night, there is no opportunity to relax and take your time to build a fort or solid defense. As you play the game more often you will find it easier to know how to quickly get the resources you need. One of the resources I have been lacking quite often is wood.All things considered I'm in the middle of rating it positive or negative. At the current stage it is slightly negative but I'm confident that the developers will sway my vote to positive with some slight changes to game mechanics.			"

												This game is a piece of trash, nothing works. Pathfinding is a joke and your dwarfs are more likely to commit a terrible sucide than anyhing else. You start out the game with nothing and you dont even have the recipes to build a house. But guess what you need a house in order to heal your people and keep them safe. By the time i was level 9 i still did not have the recipes to construct a house(had doors,locks, dec but no walls). Its like playing a RNG or a lottery trying to find the recipes you need. I had recipes for things that required other recipes that i did not have or the workbench to make either of them. In the end all my dwarfs were just about killed because i couldnt buy materials for a house or find the recipes to make one because they were so beaten from monsters to the point that, all they do is run away constantly, ingoring all your commands.Fk this game, save your money for a 2 year old coder trying to print a line statement for your entertainment.

												Have you ever wanted to be suckered into buying a mobile device game on your PC?  Are you tired of the subtle humor and gameplay for all ages in things like Terraria and looking for something that will give you tedium and a complete lack of control?  Craft The World is the game for you!Gone are the days where you have to do all that pesky mining yourself in a matter of seconds!  Gone are the days where your construction is in an open world and the universe is your oyster!  Imagine, for a moment, some of the greatest games in strategy platformer gaming history.  The Lemmings. The Humans.  Now imagine all of the aspects of those games that made you want to pull your hair out, and here we are!I picked this up because Steam recommended it because Terraria.   This has paid off before..Starbound, Edge of Space, etc.  This game plays nothing like those.  Instead, you have command of a dwarf or two and give them commands to build stuff and harvest resources.  What shows that this was originally a mobile game?  You wait.  And wait.  Then there's more waiting.   In 10 minutes I had done 5 things.  3 of those were in another window.  I'm not sure why this was so highly recommended, as my opinion of this game is that it is microtransaction tripe ported to PC with all of the appeal of recycled laxatives.			"

												SEX!Huzah!  Now I have your attention.As far as God-simulators go, this game is pretty awesome.  The game has a surprising amount of depth and a creative sandbox mode once you complete the 3 level campaign which adds to the fun.  The campaign consists of 3 levels: first is a small forest setting, the second is a medium sized snow setting, and the last is a large desert, each getting more difficult to pass.  Don't be fooled by the few levels though, each one has taken me upwards of 10 hours each to finish.Over the course of a game, you have to start with nothing much like other creation games such as Minecraft, and build your way up from nothing by gathering everything from dirty to iron, gold, and eventually Mithril.  Using these gathered resources, you traverse a large tech tree, each category allowing you to build more items ranging from decoration for your home to weapons and armor.The game will pique your interest quick and hold your attention for a long time.  With that said, once you beat the campaign and do a sandbox mode or two, you start to notice and exploit things like how to efficiently mine, find gold or skill books, and how to cheese the invading zombies (I will not reveal that here.)  Once this happens, you (or at least I did) will get bored quickly.  The novelty for me wore off literally halfway through a game one day, and I just quit.The Good:1-Great crafting system2-Challenging combat (not at first, but the longer you stay in game, the more enemies come out to ransack you)3-very fun spellunking system4-hours upon hours of fun per level5-quests give you both direction and rewardThe Bad:1-Once you've discovered combat and mining exploits, the game loses most of its fun and challenge2-Even the largest maps are pretty small, taking maybe only 25% more time to finish than the smallest3-Enemy waves happen only once every 50 minutes (25 minutes if you have the game speed set to 2x)4-weapon and armor improvements are WAY down the tech tree, so you have inferior gear against large waves if you dont move fastAll in all, the game is a great way to burn a lot of hours, especially for how cheap it is.  being under $20 means that as long as you enjoy it for at least 10 hours, it was well worth it, and I promise you will get a lot more than that out of it.

Hope they fix some dwarf issues, such as distance from base, for long paths dwarves will take their building material go part of the way and then turn around back to base. Would also be nice to have the option to turn off hourly monster invasions. Good to spend some time, but not a keeper. Had to stop playing due to these issues.  "

								For the $10 I spent, it was a great buy, however that doesn't explain how sad it was when I crossed the portal to the second world, only to find I was starting over and no new tech tree or anything. I played for a few minutes, saw there were new creatures, end exited out. Unfortunately, new creatures and a larger frozen world, isn't enough to keep my interest. A new tech tree, a continuation of the first part of the game, etc., yes. I didn't even use my books in the first world on the play-through that I ended up completing on, because I thought they might be more useful while building out my second world.			"

Maybe be worth 5 dollars at best.  I no longer play or care about this game or their developers.			"

								This game needs quite a few more updates before I think it is a playable game. The controls are poorly designed compaired to many other games of this genre, AI has significant issues following orders, very buggy and the general dificulty curve is very lopsided. Will this be a good game? Possibly. Is it a good game now? No. Is it worth the $14.99 pricetag at the current time? Absolutly not. Once this is out of alpha, we will see. until then, I unfortunatly have to say I would not pay a dime or this game. I wish I did not pay a single dime for this game, at least just yet. Maybe if I waited I would be satisfyed with it, but right now, it is more tedious and fustrating then fun and intuitive.			"

												ПОСОНЫ НЕ ПОКУПАЙТЕ ТАМ ЗАВИСИМОСТЬ ОТ ИГРЫ ТРИ ДНЯ НИЧЕГО НЕ ЕЛ И ПОЧТИ НЕ СПАЛ!!!Данная игра приглянулась мне довольно давно, На ператке я играл в нее часов двадцать и решил ее купить, ну достижения, часы вобщем не советую ее покупать тем людям у которых нету терпения, целеустремленности, уметь успокоиться и понять суть этой игры.Приглянувшиеся особенностикрасивая графика, которая не тормозит.  приятная музыка.сложная система крафта.огромным миры, на освоение каждого из которых нужен не один час.гномы, каждый со своими особенностями, навыками и внешностью.волны врагов, приходящих по ночам.До сих пор в игре есть некоторые неровности, например, гномы порой не могут найти нужный путь или постройки для дома не подсвечивают количество клеток, которые займут, от чего поначалу дико неудобно их размещать внутри здания, да и постройка этого самого здания не очень подробно описана в документации.Тем не менее, на все эти мелочи перестаёшь обращать внимание уже на третий час игры, сосродотачиваясь на более интересных вещах.Денис Слепенчук			"

Early Access Review
								I don't like how much resources it takes to build even a simple shelter, and after a few days of having no shelter, your dwarves are at such low health that you can't do anything thanks to them constantly running away from enemies that don't leave your shelter (And thus, your stockpile, and any beds you may have tried to place but refuse to work, thanks to the aforementioned lack of resources to build a shelter.)This game would be so much better with a pre-made shelter, so that your dwarves have somewhere to get back to every night where they don't have to run from enemies.

												I'd like to recommend this game but the AI is truly broken.  The dwaves will run around in a panic and not rest or eat.  They run into monsters and do nothing.  They stand around doing nothing when there is all kinds of goods to pick up.   Dwarves will walk into enemy camps and do nothing while the enemy beats the stuffing out of them.  I'll open a portal for them to get to safety and they just stand there instead of using the portal and going to safety.  Dwarves will seal themselves into a chamber without figuring the right order to put the blocks down to ensure they can get out.  Dwarves will fall into water and drown unless you can take manual control and get them out.    Loot will just inexplicably disappear from the map.  CRTL R - Supposed to make all dwarves rest that are under 70% health.  They are at their beds standing next to it and momentarily make a snoring sound.  But they are tired and won't lie down.  Same problem if you slect them individually and tell them to go rest so they can heal.  They'll just stand there.CRTL E - all hungry dwarves are supposed to eat.  They don'tYou can select them individually and try and get them to do one of those things when they are getting the crap kicked out of them, or if they are standing around doing nothing.  Not going to work though.Other problems not bugs but just present game features - If you click on attack every dwarf no matter where they are will ALL run to the one enemy.  There's really no way to assign individual dwarves to tasks.  They just do them based on what the AI decides.There's no way to sell or stuff you mine to the merchant for goods, except for gold coins that you randomly find.You'll find yourself constantly running out of resources, so a trade system (even an unbalanced one) would be helpfulKeyboard interaction is limited.  You will find yourself clicking, and double clicking to select a resources.  You want to select a certain dwarf - you must click on the dwarf.On a postive note:Pretty graphics.Developer seems like a nice guy.  He notes the bugs I report but no response on an update or a known issue. So, the game is pretty much unplayable in it's present state unless you just want to manually control each dwarf that has become unresponsive and walk them into a monster and let them die.  Then you'll get another one after a while.  But you will start from scratch and lose the skills the dwarf has aquired.  If you don't do thist, your unresponsive dwarf will either run around amlessly until is gets killed and you will lose the equipment you made for it (about 80% change of that), or it will just stand there and do absolutely nothing (which costs you one dwarf slot).  Hopefully the developer will fix these problems and get the game where it needs to be AI wise. "

Early Access Review
								Look, the premise of this game is great. Wonderful idea, charming music and graphics... but this has to be one of the most frustrating gaming experiences i have ever encountered. DO NOT BUY!! Sure, it is early access... but the game claims to be in phase 0.9. That frightens me.The A.I is ATROCIOUS!! 75% of the time... the dwarfs does absolutely everything else then what you want them to do, and there is no way to manually tell them what to do. There is a ""control"" dwarf command (probably implemented because the developers knew about the broken A.I), but this is just as broken as everything else... all you can do is control the dwarf to the object you want to interact with, and then release control of him and HOPEFULLY he will do what you wanted. Most of the time he will not.The gaming mechanics is ill explained. Want to build a shelter? Sure no problem, you unlock the wooden wall craft pretty early. But how do you build walls? Well, first you build it once... and it becomes a wooden backdrop. Fine.. then you have to figure out that, in order to build a wall you need to build it again on top of the backdrop. But we are not finished yet, no... because that only makes a solid wooden block. The third step is to select the wooden wall craft a third time, and click upon the finished wooden block... which transform it into a proper wall. And NONE OF THIS IS EXPLAINED IN THE GAME!!! Your only hint is ""build a shelter!"".What´s even more agonizing is that me, (and looking at the forums many others) was plagued with the (one of many) bugs... that makes it so, the GAME DOESN´T RECOGNIZE YOUR SHELTER EVEN THOUGH IT´S CORRECTLY BUILT, UNTIL YOU EXIT THE GAME AND RESTARTS IT!! So, you have to build a shelter, with horrible A.I, obstrusive unexplained building mechanics, and when you have finally guessed your way to a solution, the game doesn´t recognise it (even though, it says you completed the ""built"" a shelter mission, the shelter is non existent).What is worse is, that a proper shelter is needed in order for you dwarfs to rest. The resting mechanic is just as ill explained as everything else. So for me, the first two hours of gaming my dwarfs didn´t rest... they had zero HP and ran at the smallest enemy, making game progress horrible slow. I didn´t know why my shelter didn´t work, and oh... such a horrible experience.And there is more. The game crashed several times. Bridges flat out doesn´t work. The dwarfs randomly falls through them and starts to drown. At my final gameplay moment, my entire bridge just dissapeared. I could still ""de construct it"", but it wasn´t there.Uh... such great promise, but such an awful, awful programmed game. DO NOT BUY!!!!!And if this game is in such a state at 0.9? Heck, this feels like a unfinished ALPHA 0.2... i can´t possibly imagine they could fix so many issues for the final build.Stay away!!			"

								Whilst the game looks and sounds like a great concept, I can't in all honesty recommend it because there's a really annoying issue whereby the entire game 'pauses' for a second, every 5-10 seconds. It's so off-putting, I've not been able to play it for more than a few minutes.			"

												No female dwarves? I thought this was 2015, not 1985.Maybe this is a good game (although I found the crafting system to be unecessarily tedious, with having to manually select each individual material each time), but I'll never know because I refuse to play in a world where women are--again--erased from existence. If a patch adds female dwarf models (and not just one or two; 50% of the models should be female) I'll revisit my review, until then I'm sticking with Terraria and Gnomoria. Seriously, the devs should be ashamed of themselves for releasing a game like this with only male characters in this day and age.			"

								When you see the title of the game, ""Craft the World"" - most people will just think that this game is another attempt to perfect the well known game ""Minecraft"" - but it isn't. Craft the world is not for everyone though, if you are not a fan of sandbox survival games - you might as well stop reading this review. This game offers so many opportunities when it comes to decision, from - ""Would my house stop those pesky ghosts?"", ""What weapon should I give my Dwarfs?"" to ""If I don't destroy the goblin encampment now - what's the worst that'll happen?"". Trust me - this game is very enjoyable and i highly recommend it to those survival fans out there. Definitely worth the money! =D			"

								""Mix of Dungeon Keeper, Minecraft and Dwarf fortress"" - Ambitious tag line from the early access steam pageas with all such claims, one must remember that EA killed Bullfrog and so we will never get something close to Dungeon Keeper, only pretenders and charlatansthat said, Craft the world is actually pretty good and is a good way to kill a brainless hour or two, once past the initial undead attacks and you establish a good base with dwarfs armed with clubs after that the game doesn't really pose a challenge it's more of a creative endeavor, where your goal is to create a really cool base while progressing through the tech tree and finding the portal underground so that you can progress to the next world.

								If the price vs it being an early release deters you from what looks otherwise like a fabulous game, don't let it.  This gem of a game has drained near a hundred hours of my time and is still growing. The game is so extremely simple to learn and play, but like any ""building"" style game just keeps you going and going. And the best part is, the development team is so responsive being early-access that bugs are getting fixed, features are being added, and feedback is being listened to (in a good way, not in a let's change everything because one guy said so way). New updates seem to come out every week or two just getting the game one step closer to being finished. Other's have compared this game to older games they've loved, but I just can't even compare - this is a unique game, or at the very least the first of it's style to get it right.			"

								This game is great! And only in beta. I hope that when it is finished. Dwarfs are a bit smarter, they tend to ignore the tasks I give them when I have to many. Archers not shooting blocks while hunting. And more ""real"" quests not just craft the next thing on the skill tree.But still this game is great, everything I hoped for!			"

								Craft the world is a really fun and relaxing game. think dungeon keeper mixed with terraria with a wave based monster attack. the whole idea of the game is to explore this map, gather resources. build a shelter tech up, equip your dwarfs with better armor and weapons and finally make a portal to complete that map. so far its early access and its a ton of fun.

								When you see the title of the game, ""Craft the World"" - most people will just think that this game is another attempt to perfect the well known game ""Minecraft"" - but it isn't. Craft the world is not for everyone though, if you are not a fan of sandbox survival games - you might as well stop reading this review. This game offers so many opportunities when it comes to decision, from - ""Would my house stop those pesky ghosts?"", ""What weapon should I give my Dwarfs?"" to ""If I don't destroy the goblin encampment now - what's the worst that'll happen?"". Trust me - this game is very enjoyable and i highly recommend it to those survival fans out there. Definitely worth the money! =D			"

								One of a kind, you will get lost playing it for hours on end, tons of fun. My favorite crafting/building type game because you can control a small army of dwarves to mine, cut down trees, fight, drink beer, eat food, etc etc etc you can do a ton in it and build awesome housing as well to fight and fight off the undead army at night as well as the goblins that are around the map. Very fun game, I highly recommend it, it was also probably the most polished early access title I've ever played and it's only going to get better and better with more content!			"

								Having played ""Craft the World"" for a mindboggling amount of time for a pre-release game, I feel like I have to add my two cents. Digging, exploring, building, defending and managing are all your responsibility in this (as has been pointed out) Terraria-like indie game. Don't let familiarity with similiar titles sour you to this one. It has its own unique flavor, delightful animations and, most importantly, is utterly addicitive. Patches comes fast and furious so I feel confident this is one title that won't be left to languish. Crucially, I can say that, even were the title to grind to a halt today, I got my monies worth and then some. Even better, I look forward to the finished product and the anticipated improvements to come.			"

								Obvious alpha, but still a very fun game to play. There were a few times when my guys would continually go for picking up fallen items, even though there were like 20 enemy in the way, and constantly were forced to run  away, eventually being killed. Other than that, when mining, ocassionally letting go of the back wall, or jumping off cliffs and being hurt repeatedly, especially when replacing walls while riding an elevator(later thing in game you can build or buy). All in all though, great game, especially for being called alpha, I look forward to seeing it as a full release.			"

								While there remains a few pathing bugs, small features that lack intuitive design--such as a larger warning for design flaws with the dwarven abode and where to fix those flaws--I still find this one enjoyable. The battle features are lacking, with the advancing waves leaving much to be desired. If only there was a premise or reason for the waves constantly attacking and a gradual increase in difficulty that were visually represented, this would complete the experience for me. With that being said however, this is a gamer's vacation away from other games, without waxing enthusiastic on the crafting genre. There have been a few games that cut into this genre that do a very poor job with design, yet this is not one of them. The technical advancement tree is well thought out and makes sense in terms of rhythmic play. The way lighting and terrain plays into the game leaves you patching up every possible angle of defense and lighting every corridor possible to stave off the encroaching threat. I believe this will do well if the developers improve the AI of the dwarves (and enemies) to include line of sight issues with ranged weapons and add diversity to the threats themselves.			"

								Incredible game.  Absolutely incredible.I enjoy this game immensely, and I'm picky when it comes to crafting sandbox games when it comes to holding my attention.  The learning curve is easy, the crafting system is intuitive, the graphics appealing and enjoyable to view for hours on end, and the depth of gameplay is deep.On the surface, it may look like Terraria or Starbound with different graphics.  I can attest to the fact that this is far from the truth.  Craft The World takes the best of multiple games and puts them all into one incredibly fun package, all while adding something new to the genre.  The developers have done a phenomenal job getting this game into great shape, and even though it's still early in development, I had absolutely no issues playing an entire 25 hour campaign mission straight through.  The occasional restart will fix any major game breaking bugs that pop up, and that's about as easy as it comes when you're talking about an early release.While I've got high hopes for some unannounced features, this is and will be a solid game moving into the future.  I'm extra excited for the concept of multiplayer, so fingers crossed we'll see it in the future.			"

								Craft the World is ""Game of Dwarves"" with a lack of depth perception.  Heres a quick overview 6 hrs into the game.Recommend for sandbox / management gamers who have a decent tolerance of bugs and need something new.The Good -Art: Very pleasing art style, rather original style overallIntro Screen: When starting up the game the background pans around to your last save with dwarves actively moving around.  Not at all a big game changer but a nice creative touch.The Bad - A.I: Dwarves are dedicated to picking up all bits of garbage no matter how many goblins are in the wayPacing - Not sure if there’s a fast forward button, but I need to find it if there is.The Rest -Tech - Both Verity and pacing seem decent but it feels a bit grueling at times.  You don't research but simply gather mats, craft and place the object before progressing.  This means placing a mishmash of fluff around your house as you progress. "

								Still in alpha but an amazing game.  Like most people have stated it is a combination of terraria, minecraft, and resource management.  I haven't noticed many bugs, a few crashes here and there but it saves automatically so you don't lose anything.  The one downside is there is not a lot of guidance and it will take some time to get used to.  The campaign (at least the first level) consists of challenges trying to unlock more items to create, except for some its very confusing on how to create them (where to get materials) or finish the challenge.  Either way, it is a great game and if you think you will like it, get it.  Help them out and report what needs fixing.  This game has a lot of potential.			"

When you consider this is literally just the beginning, you know you're onto a complete winner. Take control of a small 'community' of dwarves, and craft, mine and fight your way to kitting them out with the best armour and putting them in the best home. I thought it would be another Minecraft clone, but this goes much deeper than that. As the game description mentions, it has a Dungeon-Keeper-esque feel, mixed with the crafting of Minecraft and the side scrolling of Terraria.Basically, just buy this game and support these awesome developers.

But I have to be careful when playing cause it can eat up timelike crazy and I tend to get lost in it.I like the dwarves, they are neat although some of those names... ugh. Wish I could change them. I do not like the monster portals, especially when they pop up on top of my base. There should be a no portal zonearound the base.It's very time oriented, you have lots of things to do and build, learn and craft. Plus you have a bunch ofdwarves to manage too. They are like toddlers so you have to keep an eye on them or they will get into trouble.All in all I found the game to be an enjoyable one. "

												When I first played this game (probably about a year back), I found myself getting bored fairly quickly. Booted up the game again today, and I can definitely say, they have added a lot of new content. There are still bugs to be worked out (and pathfinding could always be improved), but I am thoroughly enjoying this game. Possibly wait for a special if you are tentative.Edit: Maybe worth mentioning. I've played about 8 hrs today, and still on level one. It's a fun game to try and discover everything.			"

												I've put in over 30 hours.  I'm not even crafting mithril weapons and armor yet.  Instead, I'm growing wheat to make beer.  The dwarves love beer and consume lots of it.Oh yeah, there is the monster portal that opens every 45 minutes.  Every time I survive, I tell myself I should go to bed.  Next thing I know, there is 7 minutes left until the next portal opens and I've upgraded armor or weapons and think I should try it out...just one more time.The dwarf AI is not great - however, that's part of the charm.  You have to save these guys.  Build signs to deter them or craft doors (and lock them).  I've enjoyed my time in it.  It's fun.  If you like Terraria and/or crafting games, give it a chance.Update:  I'm now over 175 hours into the game.  It's an obsession.  The tech tree is huge - I've built everything and am on the last part of the campaign.  I've learned to hate the ghosts and gargoyles.  They are annoying.  I more than got my money out of this game.  However, I've learned it's not for everyone.  The game can be tedious at times.  You will also get frustrated with the AI - it can make some really poor choices.  You will also hate the damn ghost - I'd like to just turn them off.  I don't see the point.Wish list if there is ever a ""part 2"":-Upgradable tower defenses.  Yes, we have the archer tower and tesla-thing.  I would like more.-What about adding golems?  I wouldn't mind having some that could haul materials, patrol, and perhaps even do some mining.  Once you start crafting silver armor - the game shifts and requires you to mine lots of metals.  I have been giving orders that take 30 minutes or so - I do something else while they are mining.  This is tedious and gets boring.			"

												WOW! I mean seriously! WOW!ImpressionThis game is just simply amazing! I bought it while it was on sale, however, I would gladly have payed full price. The game is currently in early access phase. Sometimes, with early access there is definitely some bugs or some issues with the game. This is true at this point. But the issues are minor enough that I really don’t mind a lot. I’m sure they will iron them out and if they don’t, the game is still amazing and I would still pay full price. What is it?	This game has some definite parallels to popular games such as Terraria. That isn’t a bad thing either. The success of Terraria is undeniable. I have played many hours of that game myself. This is NOT a terraria clone however. This has similar features and gameplay models but it is far from the same. In this game you are more of a dwarf god in that you tell them to chop a tree down and they go to work. You don’t have one character to traverse the world with, you control multiple characters to tell what to do and watch the magic. Still want that control of being a character? Don’t worry, they got you covered. You can individually control the dwarfs as well. There are also a lot of great twists on old enemies as well as some spectacular new ones. Did I mention there is also experience and reward as such? This is great since nothings is worse then the same old dwarf with the same old abilities. You can also outfit your cool warriors with armor, weapons, tools, fishing poles, and so much more. The goal is to survive and thrive into a great dwarf community. I have over 5 hours of play time as of now and that’s what I know so far. I’m absolutely amazed at how good this game is.Buy or Fly?	The ultimate question you’re probably asking yourself is, “Should I buy this damn game or not?” Well, if you like boring straightforward cookie cutter games with absolutely predictable gameplay, then don’t buy this game. If you like fun, new and creative ways to play a mix of genres, then this is a MUST BUY! I would absolutely recommend this game. This game is on iPhone and iPad?! Buy or Fly?	Silly question. YES! I bought it on both Steam and my iPhone/iPad already! It’s the same game on both but a slightly different experience. Either one is worth buying but I say buy both! "

												This game is pretty awesome.  Nothing too fancy, but just enough to enjoy and kill time.  This game is a mix of Terraria and Minecraft.  Game itself has a pretty easy learning curve.  The digging, crafting, and fighting is fairly easy, that my 9 year old does it better than me.  Graphics is okay for the type of game it is.  A very enjoyable game.  If you enjoy and appreciate Terraria and Minecraft type game, then you'll enjoy Craft the World.			"

								Incredible game.  Absolutely incredible.I enjoy this game immensely, and I'm picky when it comes to crafting sandbox games when it comes to holding my attention.  The learning curve is easy, the crafting system is intuitive, the graphics appealing and enjoyable to view for hours on end, and the depth of gameplay is deep.On the surface, it may look like Terraria or Starbound with different graphics.  I can attest to the fact that this is far from the truth.  Craft The World takes the best of multiple games and puts them all into one incredibly fun package, all while adding something new to the genre.  The developers have done a phenomenal job getting this game into great shape, and even though it's still early in development, I had absolutely no issues playing an entire 25 hour campaign mission straight through.  The occasional restart will fix any major game breaking bugs that pop up, and that's about as easy as it comes when you're talking about an early release.While I've got high hopes for some unannounced features, this is and will be a solid game moving into the future.  I'm extra excited for the concept of multiplayer, so fingers crossed we'll see it in the future.			"

								Craft the World is ""Game of Dwarves"" with a lack of depth perception.  Heres a quick overview 6 hrs into the game.Recommend for sandbox / management gamers who have a decent tolerance of bugs and need something new.The Good -Art: Very pleasing art style, rather original style overallIntro Screen: When starting up the game the background pans around to your last save with dwarves actively moving around.  Not at all a big game changer but a nice creative touch.The Bad - A.I: Dwarves are dedicated to picking up all bits of garbage no matter how many goblins are in the wayPacing - Not sure if there’s a fast forward button, but I need to find it if there is.The Rest -Tech - Both Verity and pacing seem decent but it feels a bit grueling at times.  You don't research but simply gather mats, craft and place the object before progressing.  This means placing a mishmash of fluff around your house as you progress. "

								Still in alpha but an amazing game.  Like most people have stated it is a combination of terraria, minecraft, and resource management.  I haven't noticed many bugs, a few crashes here and there but it saves automatically so you don't lose anything.  The one downside is there is not a lot of guidance and it will take some time to get used to.  The campaign (at least the first level) consists of challenges trying to unlock more items to create, except for some its very confusing on how to create them (where to get materials) or finish the challenge.  Either way, it is a great game and if you think you will like it, get it.  Help them out and report what needs fixing.  This game has a lot of potential.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is surprisingly deep (pun semi-intended) and addictive to a fault. The biggest problem with the game is that the tutorial system is nonexistent and one or two aspects of the game are non-intuitive (builiding a shelter) but once you get over the frustration this is an amazingly fun game. I think there's still room to add more depth to the quest system (i.e. the quests basically just ask you to build every item in the tech tree which is something you'd do anyway and not really a separate mission) and the bestiary doesn't seem to work (it's stuck on one page and indicates stats for monsters that seem to become inaccurate over time) but so far this game has a lot going for it.That's the biggest problem I have with this game at its current state, there's no explanation for how the various components actually work and there's a lot of guesswork involved in figuring out how to best use each piece. It would be nice if there was a little explanation, or video of how they all work to clarify things. For example, the cart system isn't totally clear, or how to get mages to use spell potions (they vanish when you try and equip them) or why you can ""construct"" spells, but gain nothing from it.The in-game analogy is that this game is really deep, but the developers have dug themselves in without building ladders to let people climb down. Players have to fall a lot before they understand what's going on well enough to find the best ways to get in and out.In addition it would be nice if there was a way of directly commanding the dwarves in combat other than taking direct control and forcing an individual dwarf's actions. It would be nice if you could select specific dwarves and tell them where to go together to attack a specific target. There is a rally spell but it only forces them to stand in one spot and doesn't allow much beyond that. For combat it would be good to be able to  move in unison and attack together, the current set up doesn't allow for this and makes fighting large numbers of enemies a tricky circumstance. Being able to assign dwarves to guard specific spots would be good also.A quick note for people who may be confused with how to build a shelter:The game world has two layers, foreground and background including for construction. In order to build a proper wall you must build both the background layer and the foreground layer (i.e. build one space twice if it's empty). In order to build a shelter you must fill the shelter with background walls, the perimiter with background and foreground walls, and have doors/hatches (doors are for lateral, hatches are for vertical) at every intended opening, and you must have a totem somewhere within that space.A second note on construction:I realized this after many, many hours of play (after finishing the first world, in fact) but you can construct dirt/stone/sand directly back into the world and even use it as a building material for your structure. This is incredibly useful knowledge and yet the game doesn't teach you this anywhere, you sort of just have to stumble into it, but bear this in mind as dirt is a lot easier to get ahold  of than the other building materials you have to spend ages collecting resources for in order to create. Plus it's a cheap way to fill in inconvenient dig sites, or construct yourself a real dwarf burrow inside the earth.Overall a great game, and mostly inutitive, but seriously needs further development of the quest system and better explanation of how the game works (tutorials, an in game help system, a wiki, anything is better than the short blurbs in there at the moment.).

								I didn't expected this game to be so fun and deep.Now I'm playing it over Starbound. Micro manage your guys when you want it or just click here and there from time to time to relax. There are a few fight tactics to try, and some customisation (skills and gears) for every dwarf of your tribe.There are a few pathfinding/AI issues, but as you can take control of any character from your group, there's always a workaround to issues. Some gameplay parts are also a bit hard to get at first (shelters, elevators, trains) but once you have failed once or googled it, you get the point.The main feature I'd love to see in future patches is an express mode (like time goes x2 or x4 until you get attacked, so the mining/sleeping process is faster).

								This game is a mixture between Terraria, Gnomoria and Stronghold.Build your own fortress, dig for treasures, gather resources, fight off waves of monsters, do research, equip your dwarves.What I enjoyed most is the fact that this game has it's emphasis on defending vs monsters which always keeps you on your toe. Currently as it is, time always plays an important roleThe classic sandbox approach where you just build and mire is better left for Minecraft and maybe even Terraria, despite the graphics being one of the best one's for this genre so far.I recommend reading some guides first before jumping straight into the game since certain mechanics, i.e. how to build a proper shelter or how to use town portals are not necessarily intuitive yet.

								Incredible game, it is much more Dwarf Fortress and less Terraria/Dungeon Keeper. Overall the game is one of the best ""early access"" games I have ever played on Steam. I highly recommend this game, below is my break down of why I like this game.Graphics: Very well done. When you equip gear on your dwarfs, this is reflected in their in game appearance. Everything fits well and just looks awesome. There are tons of little touches like portraits and ornate beds that look stunning. I love Terraria but this game blows Terraria out of the water in this department.Sound: The music is nice, but the game shines in the ambient sound department: war cries, snoring, mumbling, etc...  Gameplay: There is a lot to this game. I mean lots and LOTS of items to craft and things to do. In 10 hours of gameplay I have completed maybe 2/3rds of the crafting quests. The game has a bit of a tough start, but once you get the hang of defense it is fairly simple to set up your fort. The difficulty increasing smoothly and I never felt that it got ""too easy"" at any point.UI: Pretty simple once you get the hang of it. You have an inventory and a hot key bar. Crafting is done in box type thng like Minecraft/TerreriaFun: Very addicting, there is always more stuff to build, places to explore, hordes to fight off.Bugs: There really aren't many. Occasionally my dwarfs forget what bed they own, but exiting the game seems to fix it. The bad stuff: My only real negative is that I know nothing about the developer, I think they are Russian and they have made an Android app game... but beyond that I really would like to know what their plans are. This game came out of no where, but it is really so well done and refined.That being said this game is a blast. Even in its current state there is a lot of fun to be had. This game has all the potential a blockbuster like Terraria			"

								I have been playing this game for awhile now, and anyone that thinks it is a Minecraft or Terraria clone is wrong on many levels.  Yes you build dwellings and fight off evil nasties, but in this game you are deeling with Drawfs.  The problem being is that at the begining they are really stupid.  Also you have to learn items in your crafting tree one at a time to complete other items.  What I mean is that I had to create several items before I could make a door for my dwelling.  So yes there are plenty of differences.  But even thou it can be fustrating, I am rating this game 8 out of 10.  It is only in Beta form right now and you can really play and enjoy it.  So if your looking for a game you can build, dig and fight, this is your game!			"

								I bought this during one of the flash sales. The moment I eyeballed it, I knew it was a game I wanted to play. I like the concepts (and played) of Minecraft, Terraria, and Dwarf Fortress have, and generally like the game that take these concepts and put it into a gamel ike this. The ability to control a team of dwarves, construct a fortress, and survive in a world is a great thing. Minecraft and Terraria, while fun in their own merits, get stale after a time. Letting your creativity flow to create cool things in those games are pretty sweet, but I need more to it than being able to create things of fancy. That's why I like Dwarf Fortress. You create a fortress for dwarves, make them happy, and create a fort that suits them (though most who play DF consider efficiency high on the list more than aesthetics). And in thae game, you have to deal with all sorts of dangers risking your entire fort. That's what I like. I like the idea of creating this ""fortress"" with all sorts of perils come at you and try to wreck your day. This game is tamer in that resepct, than Dwarf Fortress, but it shows a lot of promise. It has some issues at the moment of this writing, but it was expected for being early access. There are some noticeable bugs, and feels like there's more left to add (obviously). However, I think it's on the right track to its potential. For those who don't buy into ""early access"", I'd say keep an eye on it.			"

								A Superb Example of 2D RPG Sandbox Survival!As the developer says, If you like games such as Terraria, Dwarf Fortress, and Dungeon Keeper, then you are going to love this game. It is very well polished even in it's early access form. It has excellent graphics, sounds, and game play.Lots of collectible resources and a simple crafting system make crafting items a breeze, and the armor and weapons for your dwarves are well balanced. You truely feel you have accomplished something when you take the time to outfit your motley crew with the latest item upgrades, allowing them to take on larger hordes of enemies, but not making them invincible.As with any game of this nature, it will likely take you a couple play throughs to get the hang of things. Challenging enough to keep you playing for hours on end, while still giving you helpful queues along the way to aid you in progressing. You never feel lost trying to figure out what you should do next, but you also never feel like the game is making decisions for you. The only issue I ran into was while trying to get my dwarves' house secure enough that they would sleep. I had built the house, and placed beds, but the game didn't seem to recognize the house was secure. (A secure home is completely sealed with or without a door, and contains a Totem and a bed for each of your dwarves). A quick internet search suggested that I exit the game and restart. After doing this, the game recognized my house was secure and I never had trouble from then on. I have played Craft the World for 10 hours so far, and have not fully explored or conquered the first small world. I am sure I will log some serious time on this game. I highly recommend this game!

								Firstly i fully disagree with people comparing this game to Terraria, Starbound or even Minecraft. This game is nothing like any of those games. This game is more of a strategy based game you know you are going to be attack so do the best to set up defences while you mine and gather resources. The graphics for this game are amazing for the type of game it is. I specially like the fact that when i change the Dwarfs armour it reflects in the game that they now have different armour.Crafting in this game is amazing the fact this game is still in early access and has this much crafting is really amazing. I can’t wait to see what the developer adds to this game in the next updates (hopefully new larger maps)As for game play i have been playing this game a lot in fact 30 + hours and i still am loving this game completely so much still to do. There are a few things i would like to see fixed like when you click on a mob to kill and accidently remove your dam wall bit of a pain but other than that this game caters for all aspects of gamers from beginner to someone after a challenge If you’re undecided about this game i encourage you to give it a try, hell it’s the price of 3 maybe 4 coffees in most countries Lastly i must admit i purchased this game as a joke game to play when i was really bored, however after playing this game it is currently the game i play the most was completely surprised when i purchased it and that night and 6 hours later looked at the clock and wow 3am had passed.

								Craft The World is one of those games that you start playing and after a couple of hours you still can't quit. It's like ""just unlock one more item..."" or ""just farm one more vein of iron ore...""Although it is an early access game by now, it comes with a huge tech tree and a very detailed farming and skill system. It runs quite stable and I didn't have any problems yet. And the look... The developers made the look of the game so lovely, so funny and so coherent, which represents the whole atmosphere.If you enjoyed Dungeon Keeper or Dwarf Fortress or both you will love this game. Support the developers to make a even more awesome game!			"

								Very fun to pass the time. A little weird to get into but excellent for an early access game. I wish there was a way to speed up time since it is a single player game and things can get a bit boring while waiting for your little guys to rest up. Overall, worth the money I paid and I enjoy it. Looking forward to seeing this game grow in the future. :)			"

Early Access Review
								Incredible game, it is much more Dwarf Fortress and less Terraria/Dungeon Keeper. Overall the game is one of the best ""early access"" games I have ever played on Steam. I highly recommend this game, below is my break down of why I like this game.Graphics: Very well done. When you equip gear on your dwarfs, this is reflected in their in game appearance. Everything fits well and just looks awesome. There are tons of little touches like portraits and ornate beds that look stunning. I love Terraria but this game blows Terraria out of the water in this department.Sound: The music is nice, but the game shines in the ambient sound department: war cries, snoring, mumbling, etc...  Gameplay: There is a lot to this game. I mean lots and LOTS of items to craft and things to do. In 10 hours of gameplay I have completed maybe 2/3rds of the crafting quests. The game has a bit of a tough start, but once you get the hang of defense it is fairly simple to set up your fort. The difficulty increasing smoothly and I never felt that it got ""too easy"" at any point.UI: Pretty simple once you get the hang of it. You have an inventory and a hot key bar. Crafting is done in box type thng like Minecraft/TerreriaFun: Very addicting, there is always more stuff to build, places to explore, hordes to fight off.Bugs: There really aren't many. Occasionally my dwarfs forget what bed they own, but exiting the game seems to fix it. The bad stuff: My only real negative is that I know nothing about the developer, I think they are Russian and they have made an Android app game... but beyond that I really would like to know what their plans are. This game came out of no where, but it is really so well done and refined.That being said this game is a blast. Even in its current state there is a lot of fun to be had. This game has all the potential a blockbuster like Terraria			"

								It would be a fun game if devs didn't artifically increase the length of the game by adding XP requirement to build stuff via tech tree. Well even if there was that, it should have been implemented seperately for different item groups so I don't need to make 20 gargoyle heads to make silver armour. Basically you need to create huge amount of random items (not related in category to those you need, eg. decorative items/illumination items are required for armour and such) that you will never use to create a few items that you actually will use. Anyway, has lots of promise and is very fun until you need to create 10 lamps to make a decent sword. If devs fix this game will be much better. Until then about 5/10.			"

								I have been enjoying this game along with my younger brother and sister. A very addictive and relaxing game as well as just cute and fun. I'll put my pros and cons here to sum up some of the best and worst aspects as of now.Pros: Fun detailed 2D graphics style         Easy to understand crafting interface.         Lots of variety in creatures as well as materials.         A leveling system which grants more and more Dwarves as you go.         A sense of accomplishment as you dig further down and build higher up.         Dwarves have a class assigned to them when they spawn in.Cons: Some pathfinding issues but they are getting better.          Dwarves don't build or dig in the order you give them - As if they had a mind of their own          The music is nice but lacking in variety.          And my main problem with this game, while not a game ruiner by any means, is the translation problems. All in all I will give this game a 9/10 because the pros heavily outweigh the cons and the team working on this has obviously put a lot of love into this gem.Hope this helps someone decide whether or not to buy the game.

								As a long time Dwarf Fortress player, the only thing this game has in common with Dwarf Fortress is the word, ""Dwarf.""  That said, this game is incredibly fun.  It is Desktop Defense, but with dwarves.  There is a huge, entertaining crafting tree to help you build your defense, as timed waves come to kill your dwarf clan.  Goblins can appear at any time, to keep you on your toes.  This game is very fun.			"

								I like games like Keflings, Terraria, and Minecraft. I picked it up because it looked right up my alley. I gave it a try and suddenly it was 8 hours later... Its very much one of those ""just one more thing"" games. I really enjoy having the dwarves do my dirty work and just managing everything rather than doing it all myself like in other games. The AI seems pretty good. There are a lot of things to make, and you're left to build whatever you want with them. I liked the variety of enemies, and the occasional waves of attacks to keep you focused. There's really a lot in the game as it stands now.In starting you are kind of left to your own devices to figure things out. The tech tree is pretty clear and there is a help section in the book with the basics, but the main thing I just totally didn't get on my own until at least a couple hours in was how to build a house- ie a secure shelter. My dwarves were getting beat up and wouldn't eat or sleep. I thought you had to build the wood walls etc that you don't unlock till later, so I was frantically trying to get that far in the tree, and even then I had no idea how to actually make walls on top of the background. My friend had to eventually show me.Seeing as this game isn't even done yet, I can't wait to see what more they add!			"

Also three biomes with a nvic selection of enemies make it especially fun. Finally the resources and craftable items is amazing and will allow for literaly days of game play.

								This is a good and engaging game. It has a good overall theme and artwork. The game play is fairly straight-forward as well. Dig, Defend, and build. Rinse and Repeat and the defending gets more difficult the longer the campaign goes on. It's a great in sandbox mode for just building/crafting fun. Campaign mode can be fun and a bit challenging. It's still early access so it's hard to be to critical for a game that hasn't declared itself mostly done.This game suffers a bit of strangeness when it comes to the UI and ease of use when playing on a computer. Though they do make sense if this game ever went to a tablet like an iPad or possibly a console? A few things I do not care for but are not real deal breakers for me* The strength of monsters seems difficult to gauge. Knowing if you can kill a monster is not an easy question to answer. Just hope they don't kill your dwarves* Monster noises particularly the goblins get a bit excessive and repetitive i makes me cringe.* The game also fails to really explain the use of spells and mana usage. * I find it strange when it comes to AI with regards to priorities of tasks. I click on things and getting them to do it seems hard or impossible sometimes* There is a bit of unnecesary crafting of things i never wanted to use but crafted in order to advanced my crafting skills to make the things I really wanted to. For example crafting 20 gargoyle statues that have no effect other than vanity seems silly so i can make something else worthwhile "

Other than that, when mining, ocassionally letting go of the back wall, or jumping off cliffs and being hurt repeatedly, especially when replacing walls while riding an elevator(later thing in game you can build or buy).

When you consider this is literally just the beginning, you know you're onto a complete winner. Take control of a small 'community' of dwarves, and craft, mine and fight your way to kitting them out with the best armour and putting them in the best home. I thought it would be another Minecraft clone, but this goes much deeper than that. As the game description mentions, it has a Dungeon-Keeper-esque feel, mixed with the crafting of Minecraft and the side scrolling of Terraria.Basically, just buy this game and support these awesome developers.

There are a few fight tactics to try, and some customisation (skills and gears) for every dwarf of your tribe.There are a few pathfinding/AI issues, but as you can take control of any character from your group, there's always a workaround to issues. Some gameplay parts are also a bit hard to get at first (shelters, elevators, trains) but once you have failed once or googled it, you get the point.The main feature I'd love to see in future patches is an express mode (like time goes x2 or x4 until you get attacked, so the mining/sleeping process is faster).

								This game is a mixture between Terraria, Gnomoria and Stronghold.Build your own fortress, dig for treasures, gather resources, fight off waves of monsters, do research, equip your dwarves.What I enjoyed most is the fact that this game has it's emphasis on defending vs monsters which always keeps you on your toe. Currently as it is, time always plays an important roleThe classic sandbox approach where you just build and mire is better left for Minecraft and maybe even Terraria, despite the graphics being one of the best one's for this genre so far.I recommend reading some guides first before jumping straight into the game since certain mechanics, i.e. how to build a proper shelter or how to use town portals are not necessarily intuitive yet.

								I pretty much played this game straight through for a week and I must say, I had a good time.  I love the graphics. The style ,in a way,reminds me of the old Settlers games.My biggest ""issue"" was that I had nothing new to do after said week but since its alpha, this should be expected. The worst bugs were straightened out fast so thats always a good sign.I hope the devs will add a lot more features  and  content (other than decoration) and bring more depth into the defense.If they do then I would definitly recommend it but its already a good little game.

								Crafting is my favourite genre. As is building a dwarf fortress-like complex of buildings and tunnels. It then won't come as a surprise when I say that I like this game. But what did surprise even me, was just how much I've been in love with this game from the moment I started playing. Even through there are quite some 'early access'-related bugs that are still waiting to be fixed, and even though the AI doesn't always seem to be all that intelligent, this game has so much to offer and is so much fun to play that you'll happily overlook the few little details that don't seem to work just yet. For fans of the genre this game is an absolute must-have!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is surprisingly deep (pun semi-intended) and addictive to a fault. The biggest problem with the game is that the tutorial system is nonexistent and one or two aspects of the game are non-intuitive (builiding a shelter) but once you get over the frustration this is an amazingly fun game. I think there's still room to add more depth to the quest system (i.e. the quests basically just ask you to build every item in the tech tree which is something you'd do anyway and not really a separate mission) and the bestiary doesn't seem to work (it's stuck on one page and indicates stats for monsters that seem to become inaccurate over time) but so far this game has a lot going for it.That's the biggest problem I have with this game at its current state, there's no explanation for how the various components actually work and there's a lot of guesswork involved in figuring out how to best use each piece. It would be nice if there was a little explanation, or video of how they all work to clarify things. For example, the cart system isn't totally clear, or how to get mages to use spell potions (they vanish when you try and equip them) or why you can ""construct"" spells, but gain nothing from it.The in-game analogy is that this game is really deep, but the developers have dug themselves in without building ladders to let people climb down. Players have to fall a lot before they understand what's going on well enough to find the best ways to get in and out.In addition it would be nice if there was a way of directly commanding the dwarves in combat other than taking direct control and forcing an individual dwarf's actions. It would be nice if you could select specific dwarves and tell them where to go together to attack a specific target. There is a rally spell but it only forces them to stand in one spot and doesn't allow much beyond that. For combat it would be good to be able to  move in unison and attack together, the current set up doesn't allow for this and makes fighting large numbers of enemies a tricky circumstance. Being able to assign dwarves to guard specific spots would be good also.A quick note for people who may be confused with how to build a shelter:The game world has two layers, foreground and background including for construction. In order to build a proper wall you must build both the background layer and the foreground layer (i.e. build one space twice if it's empty). In order to build a shelter you must fill the shelter with background walls, the perimiter with background and foreground walls, and have doors/hatches (doors are for lateral, hatches are for vertical) at every intended opening, and you must have a totem somewhere within that space.A second note on construction:I realized this after many, many hours of play (after finishing the first world, in fact) but you can construct dirt/stone/sand directly back into the world and even use it as a building material for your structure. This is incredibly useful knowledge and yet the game doesn't teach you this anywhere, you sort of just have to stumble into it, but bear this in mind as dirt is a lot easier to get ahold  of than the other building materials you have to spend ages collecting resources for in order to create. Plus it's a cheap way to fill in inconvenient dig sites, or construct yourself a real dwarf burrow inside the earth.Overall a great game, and mostly inutitive, but seriously needs further development of the quest system and better explanation of how the game works (tutorials, an in game help system, a wiki, anything is better than the short blurbs in there at the moment.).

								""Mix of Dungeon Keeper, Minecraft and Dwarf fortress"" - Ambitious tag line from the early access steam pageas with all such claims, one must remember that EA killed Bullfrog and so we will never get something close to Dungeon Keeper, only pretenders and charlatansthat said, Craft the world is actually pretty good and is a good way to kill a brainless hour or two, once past the initial undead attacks and you establish a good base with dwarfs armed with clubs after that the game doesn't really pose a challenge it's more of a creative endeavor, where your goal is to create a really cool base while progressing through the tech tree and finding the portal underground so that you can progress to the next world.

								If the price vs it being an early release deters you from what looks otherwise like a fabulous game, don't let it.  This gem of a game has drained near a hundred hours of my time and is still growing. The game is so extremely simple to learn and play, but like any ""building"" style game just keeps you going and going. And the best part is, the development team is so responsive being early-access that bugs are getting fixed, features are being added, and feedback is being listened to (in a good way, not in a let's change everything because one guy said so way). New updates seem to come out every week or two just getting the game one step closer to being finished. Other's have compared this game to older games they've loved, but I just can't even compare - this is a unique game, or at the very least the first of it's style to get it right.			"

								I enjoy this game quite a bit.  I find that having the missions and tech tree make it much easier to get into than Terraria.There are a few issues with the current build:1) The difficulty settings don't seem to have any effect.  I tried replaying with higher difficulty and did not notice any change.2) The portal mechanic is pretty abusable in its current form.  Using it there is not really any need to build a transport system.Despite these issues I still recommend the game.  I've played about 50 hours so far, and feel like I have seen and done everything the current build has to offer.  I'll definitely play again when they put out a substantial update.			"

								I really like this game! I read the negative reviews first and found one person who was complaining there was not enough fighting. Please do not turn this into another defense game, there are plenty of those in the world. As the name is Craft The World enemy interaction ought to be secondary to crafting. So I bought it and found that crafting/resource collection is the primary focus. I am excited that this is on Mac as well surprising for an early release there are not that many. I started in Sandbox mode and liked that I didn't have to play through craft tree to get that version. I did struggle for a few hours on the Totem and house building, not sure if that was to add to difficulty or if there will be more guidance later on. As far as an early release goes this is quite built out. You will be learning through trial and error to figure the game out but I enjoyed the challenge. One thing I struggled with was the shop. The items pop out and they are small so I didn't see them and thought that part may not be complete yet but they do spawn in front and have to be collected like other resources. I know the shadow is intentional but the light spell dosen't go far enough would be nice to get 5 or so blocks to plan out your dig. However, you can still re-add any of the collected resources back if you want. I am surprised at the graphics, though simple they are much better than many of the crafting games. I think its just right not to much not to little. There are difficulty levels so you can select the level of challenge. I really like that you can craft something without having the pattern yet so the really critical crafts you can remember the sequence to help you at the beginning. I can't wait to see what is still to come!			"

												Think ""Dwarf Fortress/Minecraft/Terraria/SimTower"" all molded into one. Now you're digging it!At first glance I hoped this would be a good game, boy was I surprised when I found myself completly obsessed with playing Craft the World. I missed work, I didn't eat, I just played and played till I finally finished everything the game had to offer, which at the time was only one level..Now we find ourselves 1 year down the road and I decided to check in with my past adiction. I felt as though it was calling me with a whisper ""Updates"" ""Updates"" it said softly and I was none the wiser, I laucnhed the game and found not only another level but to my surprise I found 3. As if I thought that was enough the final underground level was astounding design! That is not to say the other two where not great too, but yet again I found myself completly adicted.To explain bluntly, each level is an entire game. When you start the level you are looking at an entire 15-30 hours of gameplay which for a person like me is perfect. You could lose everything in an instant and for a game that takes so long to finish, that can be a problem, but if everything goes according to plan then you finally start to feel the reward.I wouldn't not recommend this game to anyone.

												At first I was a bit frustrated . There is a nice tutorial when you first start the game, but it doesn't cover all of the basics. Dwarf AI is really poor, and it's not easy to get them to do what you want. But the graphics, animation and sound were so good that I stuck with it. After viewing a few tutorial videos linked from the Craft The World website, I finally realized I was doing lots of stuff wrong. I also realized (after starting over several times), that my dwarves can fill in spaces and totally change the underground area under my stockpile. I am still on the first campaign level because of starting over so often, but now that I have got the hang of it, I am really enjoying this game. "

Mine minerals, hatch trees, melt ice to water, build strong wall defences, shooting towers, many traps, adore house walls with paintings, mirrors, furniture, tapestries (all of that rises comfort and dwarf power), build bedrooms, kitchens, invent and upgrade armor, weaponary, doors, rails. Most things can be disassembled to return materials.  Make your dwarves learn magic, combat, cooking, mining, swimming and much more professions. Prepare many dishes to keep dwarves fed.

Which wouldn't be a problem except that in order to advance to things like better weapons you need to discover aesthetic type stuff.  Kind of annoying.  -the dwarves are exceedingly stupid will rush to their deaths-it takes eons to finish a map (some people might like this though)Overall though I had fun, but after losing the second level to dwarves doing kamakaze missions where they would charge into a pit where there's a yeti, two skeleton mace guys, and the stink ogres.. well..

												I have played this game quite a bit, from early access to what we've got now. Of course the worst part of this game is the AI. Pathfinding is atrocious and highly annoying. I ended up cheating the speed of the dwarves (nothing too crazy just enough to make pathfinding a non-issue).Where the game falls short (other than pathfinding) is the fact that each world you have to start over from scratch. You just spent 20-30 hours on a level and now you've got to start allll over again. I have never played two levels in a row because it's just no longer fun. It will take a few months before I want to start over again.The technology tree is messed up, definitely. There are things that should be in the beginning and things that should not affect technology. All deco stuff needs to have its own designated tree. I should not have to make windows so I can make better doors or better pickaxes.Enough of the rant, this game is fun. Frustrating at times, but which game isn't? It lacks constant replayability but coming back to the game every few months seems to work for me.Pros:-Addictive-Being able to control a dwarf and building quickly without needing to go back to the stockpile.-The graphics are nice.-Devs update the game.-Lots to do, no time to do it.-I can't stress enough that this game is actually fun.Cons:-AI is terrible,-Technology tree could use some tweaking. End game items are only used if you decide not to go on to the next level (absolutely no goal left, so no reason to keep playing).-Restart after level advance.-Max fast forward is 2x (at least they added a fast forward).-Animals are too scarce in the beginning and the farm isn't available till about halfway and by that time the animals respawn at a nice rate and you can move around the map with ease so farm is useless.-2 height reach is extremely annoying. 3 or 4 should be standard with a way to make this a setting. Many times you are left with no choice but to use many ladders which take a long time. Scaffolding is available but at a decent time away from game start.This game has got lots of cons but that doesn't mean that I don't enjoy it. If these issues were fixed I'd probably play this non-stop. If you think the cons are an issue get this game on sale, don't miss out.			"

												It's a funny game that makes a lot of fun. My first Review was positive. I enjoy the graphics very much, and even when the game is still in early access, it is nearly coomplete und absolute playable.So why negative rating?I don't agree with the dev's way of balancing. Especially with the structure of the tech tree. There are many techs where i think: ""Why is it there? And not there?"" for example armor. New armor comes very late, but in late game, they all come nearly at once. Why? Why do i unlock Iron Armor, to unlock Silver Armor as soon as i crafted some Iron Armor? Only to unlock Gold Armor, as soon as i crafted some Silver Armor.Crap.Same with beds. I unlock beds Tier 2, only to unlock allready Tier 3 before i even crafted enough Tier 2 beds for my dwarves. And thats really annoying. When i need stuff, i don't get it. And when i get it, i don't need it anymore because i allready unlock better one before i finish crafting.And the other thing i don't like is the late game of each level. It's dumb digging for Portal parts. And it gets even worse with every level since the map increases in size. It's okay to dig for real progress, to get new and different ores for better equipment. But it's horrible annoying if you need to dig down the whole map only to find those portal parts when you allready have everything you need. (except the portal parts, of course.)So yeah, i like the gameplay, but tech trees and late game content really needs a change.			"

												This game has a solid foundation, but has several major design flaws. Since the game already has a lot of positive reviews, I'll focus on why mine is negative.First off, it's extremely slow paced. It requires a lot of micro management, so you can't just set orders and go do something else. But it moves so slowly that you'll be sitting doing nothing for a minute or two after assigning new orders. Set some blocks to mine, trees to cut down, animals to hunt, then open portals near those places. Now wait 2 minutes while your dwarves finish those tasks. Then repeat. In order to play at an engaging speed, I actually used an external program to run the game at triple speed, which improved the game significantly.Second is the crafting ""tree"". All items, weapons, equipment, decoration, supplies, etc are bunched into groups of 4-5 items. In order to unlock a new group of items, you have to craft a certain number of items from the group (or two) that lead up to it. Crafting a lot of only one item from that group has diminishing returns, so it is best to craft 2-3 of each item in the group. The problem is, it isn't laid out in a tree. The next tier of armor might have furniture and glassware as prerequisites (as an example, I don't remember exactly). But each of THOSE requires 1-2 other groups first. So you can't rush to the items you want: you have to make EVERY ITEM IN THE GAME a few times to progress. This just compounds the first problem, slowing down the game. Even though you could easily just dig down and get mithril to make the best gear in the game, you can't actually craft those items until you've made every single other item in the game several times over. Imagine if in Minecraft, even though you can easily dig down and find diamonds in 10 minutes, you couldn't actually make diamond gear until you've spent 10 hours gathering materials and crafting every other in the game 20 times. Or if in Civilazation, there were no tech trees and you just had to research every single technology, in the same order, every game. That's what it feels like. There's no choice. It gets boring and tedious after the first time. Third is the lack of real progression from level to level in the campaign. There are four ""worlds"" in the campaign. Beat one, go to the next one. Here's the problem: each world only has a few new items to make. You play world one, get your dwarves decked out in the best gold and mithril gear, and then move on to world two... and you're back collecting sticks and leaves. World two lets you build four ""ice"" versions of other items, which are only better in that using ice doesn't waste the more valuable resources. Then you go through the whole crafting tree, taking forever to get enough resources to get up to gold and mithril again, so you can go on to world three and start all over again. World four finally adds some new weapons, which is nice, but they aren't a huge improvement on the same weapons you've been using since world one. It just doesn't feel like you're progressing. Normally in a campaign, when you move on to the next world you get access to stronger gear and the like. But in Craft the World, you work through the exact same progression over and over.My overall conclusion is that the game has potential but is poorly designed. A major overhaul could make it really good. Increasing dwarf movement speed so you don't have to micromanage portals for transportation would be amazing. Sorting the tech tree by item type would be a big help. Iron armor -> silver armor -> gold armor, instead of iron armor -> glassware -> fabric dying -> whatever -> silver armor or whatever the progression is. This would let you focus on what you want/need at the moment, instead of wasting your time making items you don't need first. When I need better armor so my dwarves can survive the next invasion, I don't want to have to make a ton of armoires first. The last major change would be changes to the scope of the campaign worlds. World one should be shorter, with iron as the only available metal, and weaker guardians that only require that iron gear to beat. Then world two is slightly larger, with silver added and guardians that require silver to beat. This way, the player actually feels a sense of progression from world to world. As is, it's just painful and quite frankly STUPID to go from mithril right back to wood, and then have to work back up to mithril. Also, don't make me unlock all the crap again in world two, three, four. It's a 100-200 hour game, with only 10-20 hours worth of content.Of course, for a lot of people it isn't just a game where you rush to beat the campaign. Like Minecraft, it's about building your vision of the perfect home. But in Minecraft, when you have a new vision you start a new world and can quickly have everything you need to start building again, but in Craft the World the tech system means that if you start a new world, it'll be at least 10 hours before you start to see your vision take shape.

												I really enjoy the premise of the game. You harvest, learn recipes, craft, build, fight off enemies, earn achievements. It's addicting and fun. My only gripe is that the dwarves sometimes act very stupidly and you have to micromanage the AI. It would also be really cool if there were things you could unlock between levels, so you could use new things after a level and it didn't feel so much like, ""new level, so I have to start all over again.""

												Craft the world is an exellent game, but a major feature is missing: for people like me who are using an AZERTY pad, moving a Dwarf can become very tricky.

												I'm going to review this game with the premise that it one of a few games that could be categorized as Dwarf Fortress like, and will refer to DF throughout the review. The game has some major flaws, but overall it's a great game and is well worth the price. I'll start with the negatives. The AI is not great. The dwarves have a strange way of prioritizing what needs done, so you can't queue up too many task at once, or it will take forever for the important ones to get finished. They also path terribly sometimes, ignoring nearby warp portals if was built after they decided to go somewhere. They will also walk into a hole another dwarf is about to fill to pick up dirt, and will just stand there deciding what to do next, rather than realize they will be trapped. Also wood is far too important for building for not being able to reliable plant it yourself. You end up using the portal spell to send your dwarves out onto the fringe of the world for a few trees all the time. The tech tree is also very poorly implemented. The order in which the dwarves research things is very strange, with seemingly easy things towards the end of the tree and hard things at the beginning. It also forces you to make countless items you'll never use, simply to advance the tree. Combat can also seem kinda clunky, as dwarves will sometimes waltz away from a monster wave simply because none of the monsters are marked for combat. The lack of a profession system is also very irritating. In DF and many DF like games, you assign your dwarves/gnomes/goblins/etc a job, and they perform that job. Such as smith, miner, logger, etc. In this game all dwarves do everything. There is a skill system (dwarves gain up to 3 skills in things such as logging, swimming, archery, etc), and I've read that a job is done by the dwarf with the highest skill in that task, who is currently not doing anything. While I'm not sure if this system even works, it is a bad idea to begin with. The game can also begin to be repetitive. At 21.6 hours I've beat the first world and have moved onto the second world. You simply begin back at square one, with one dwarf and an empty tech tree. The only difference is that the world is harder. I can easily see how other people with more hours and who have gotten to further worlds say that by world 5 the game is boring. Now to the good. The side view 2D is an interesting perspective, and fresh from many of the other top down view DF like games, or any city builders in general. The fortress defense mechanic is very fun. Although the nightly skeleton/zombie hordes do not get any more challenging, the hourly monster raids do start to get harder. This is until all your dwarves are equipped with mithril weapons/armor, at which point the game becomes fairly easy again. The tech tree, while overall being badly implemented, can do a good job at driving you forward to research new items. There are several types of metal to work with, which leads to a nice flow of upgrading your weapons. There are also several types of walls/roofs (once you finally research them), so you can make cool looking forts. Although the game does discourage making individual bedrooms (by keeping interior doors until well into the tech tree) and this does detract from making interesting looking forts. Once you also get farming (well into the tech tree, this is another negative) you can make interesting looking fortresses with attached underground farms. This is always one of my most fun parts of DF like games. The spells are nice too, and make you feel much more involved than many DF like games. Dwarves getting tired of eating certain food too often, forcing you to take advantage of the different types of food available. While I love Gnomoria, I hate knowing I can just grow wheat and my gnomes will never get tired of eating wheat bread and drinking wheat beer (in fact spamming wheat in it is to your advantage). Overall, the thrill of the first 15-30 hours is great. You want to explore just one more tunnel before you go to sleep, and the portal spell makes exploring the fringes of the world much more accessible. If you don't mind spending 20 dollars on a great 30 hours, and then (from what I've heard) an ""eh"" another 20 hours before the game is just too repetitive, then this is a great game for you. If you are a fan of a DF and are looking for something less intense and requires less time and energy, this game is also great for you (or if you are too scared to jump straight into DF but want to play a fortress builder).

												This sort of game never really appealled to me before; however, it a gem of a game that I have thoroughy enjoyed for a very long playtime. Initially there is a steep learning curve for getting started, but the charming and progressive gameplay really draws you in. The premise of the game is simple, build a home for your dwarfs and get them to delve deep into the earth to discover rare materials needed to strengthen the dwarfs home and their own gear. Each world requires you to survive and then  find the portal on to the next world. This can take 10-15 hours of playtime per level and the final world is very challenging, with enough variety to keep the tech tree engaging.  For the price, this game is a bargain, especially if I compare the played time I have on lots of other expensive games that cost far far more. Hopefully the developers will continue to add new worlds and techs to this very charming and addictive game!			"

												Craft the World is a fun Minecraft/Terraia style game, held back by an extremely long and boring technology tree and a severe lack of enemies.Unlike most crafting games, progressing from one tier of items to the next does not just require building the correct crafting table and gather enough resources, it also requires you to have advanced the tree by building tons of items at the prior level.Want to build iron swords? Oops, gotta build 5 more wooden sheilds first.Trying to bake a cake for your hungry dwarves? Well, I hope you caught a bunch of fish first, to advance up,Found a vein of platinum you want to craft? Sorry, your dwarves need to master bed & lightbulb construction before they'll even try to make a new set of armor.Combat content (enemy types) run out far too quickly as well.After surviving the nightly zombie raids, and killing the local goblin camp (with your level 1 wooden swords), there's nothing left to fight except god-tier golems in hidden chambers deep underground.  And if you want to fight them? Well, prepare to spend hours mining out every level of the  In the end, Craft the World is a very accurate title. By the end of the game, you'll have mined the entire world, and converted it into a procession of increasingly meaningless cosmetic items, on a quest to advance the technology tree far enough to get some decent combat equipment for your dwarves.

												This game is right up my alley.  It's a blend of Terraria with the autonomous command-driven functionality of dwarf fortress.  It's an interesting amalgam of the two games, though not nearly in-depth and strategic as DF, and lacking the insane quantity of content of Terraria.  If the developer maintains a level of involvement half that of the Terraria dev, this game has huge potential.  As it stands right now, early game discovery is a superb experience.  Mid-game, you focus on building yourself up and reaching higher tech levels.  I haven't made it to end-game content yet, but I hear it's lacking.Bottom line, do I recommend it?  Hellz yeah.  And $10 is an excellent price point for this game.  In hindsight I would have purchased it at full price, but I had no idea it would be this good.			"

												I recommend this game if you want 10-15 hours of fun, and then only pick up the game once every other year when you want to have exactly the same unchallenging and simple experience again, and dream of what the game could be if the mechanics were more developed and balanced.I've played it for 17 hours, which was what it took for me to do one playthrough, without any rush. Now I assume there's nothing more to do, so I won't pick it up for a long time. But that was worth €9!			"

												Bought in a flash sale at Christmas but seriously would pay the full price if asked again.  It has that slow introduction to a game that I enjoy that then ramps up to ""To Much to do and not enough time"" mode.  Others have already said what the game is like, I prefer to say what I enjoyed about it.  I found it fun, it does not take itself seriously and minutes turn into hours of gameplay enjoyment.  Downsides ? Can take a long time to get to other levels, but you always have sandbox mode to see what your missing.  Recommended.			"

												I am in love with this game, the sort of game you can leave for a week and just pick up where you left off.... And you will have to! There is no playing a single level in one sitting (unless I'm really bad at this game)...I am STILL on level 2 and have clocked 50 hours!Basically you are micro managing  a small population of dwarves - you order them to cut trees, mine ore, kill enemies etc... All while building a house with good comfort so that dwarves sleep well and gain health back faster. Every 45 minutes you get a wave of monsters which gets harder and more portals will start opening. So it's a micro managing - tower defence - creativity - mining game!!! You can also make equipement and kit out each dwarf. It is in my top five games.My only cons are that Dwarves hang around an awful lot even if you have ordered them to do things, sometimes its just faster to control one manually. I don't like how they drop all of their items to ALL go and attack a snail if you accidently click on it and I also get infuriated when a dwarf decides to take the long and treacherous route home instead of the portal! BUT seriously, those are just irks lol! LOVE this game, worth every penny. The app is pretty good too but it's a couple of updates behind.			"

												I have greatly enjoyed this game - It's been one of those great casual games to pick up and play for...well..hours on end.  The concept of mining resources, a tech development tree, and building Fortresses isn't a new one, but is well executed in this game.The development team has done a good job of fixing bugs as they come up, as well as adding new content (The recent addition of a 4th world was an unexpected surprise)One issue that does seem to come up occasionally is the prioritization of the tasks you send the dwarves to do (i.e. they will do something you just ordered before something that's been waiting a while), but it is overall a minor issue.I would certainly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys the gathering/learning/building type of game-play.

												I bought this game on a whim and walked away after about 20 minutes of play. Then after a few days I went back to it and have been hooked ever since. It's basic, repetitive and time consuming. But there is something about digging a big mine and turning what you find into useful stuff that is addictive. The concept of starting out with  set of tools that are fundmentally stoneage and developing your abilities to make items of ever increasing complexity over time is a good one. A well executed, original concept.			"

												INCREDIBLE depth for crafting fans. You can actually build and craft the world here - down to the little details and decorations.This game has the best crafting options I have ever seen in a game. The only drawback is that it's a 2D world which may not be a drawback at all depending on your preference. You may like playing in a 2D world.To me, this is the best 2D game of it's kind. It's easy to get into, fun to explore and charming in every way.Now to go dig further down, and build up some defenses!			"

												Craft The World is a nice-looking 2D dwarf-colony-gestion game. From the top you should know it gets repetitive as the campaign is limited to a few maps and the only progression is towards crafting items to unlock the next technology, and beat bosses to reach the next level. However:-It's really addictive: you'll dig down through time or your wife's labor.-Pathfinding and AI may seem dumb but it's your job to take control and direct your dwarves from time to time. You can play with minimal investment if you wish.-You design your dwarves's home/castle/dungeon/fortress while trying to optimize paths and comfort.-The map is living, with hordes of ennemies appearing and regular mob spawning. Defend yourself !-Has a smell of Terraria, with an army of automated dwarves !-You can play it with one hand on the mouse and a newborn in the other arm.I love it.			"

												It's a funny game that makes a lot of fun. My first Review was positive. I enjoy the graphics very much, and even when the game is still in early access, it is nearly coomplete und absolute playable.So why negative rating?I don't agree with the dev's way of balancing. Especially with the structure of the tech tree. There are many techs where i think: ""Why is it there? And not there?"" for example armor. New armor comes very late, but in late game, they all come nearly at once. Why? Why do i unlock Iron Armor, to unlock Silver Armor as soon as i crafted some Iron Armor? Only to unlock Gold Armor, as soon as i crafted some Silver Armor.Crap.Same with beds. I unlock beds Tier 2, only to unlock allready Tier 3 before i even crafted enough Tier 2 beds for my dwarves. And thats really annoying. When i need stuff, i don't get it. And when i get it, i don't need it anymore because i allready unlock better one before i finish crafting.And the other thing i don't like is the late game of each level. It's dumb digging for Portal parts. And it gets even worse with every level since the map increases in size. It's okay to dig for real progress, to get new and different ores for better equipment. But it's horrible annoying if you need to dig down the whole map only to find those portal parts when you allready have everything you need. (except the portal parts, of course.)So yeah, i like the gameplay, but tech trees and late game content really needs a change.			"

												Very nice little game, well made, solid.  Not many people get the AI right like this, where you issue your orders and don't have to worry about idle workers, orders deadlocking, etc.  It just works, it's fun.  Replayability is somewhat limited as you can unlock the full skill tree in your first play and following games are more or less the same gamplay is a larger/harder environment.  But if you are into that kind of games, it'll hold you for 20h at least.			"

												I tried liking this game, I really did.Pros-You can take control of any dwarf you want-There is a ""tech tree"", while not the best tech tree, it's a start.Cons-The game is buggy. Very buggy. Sometimes dwarves can do things, sometimes they can't for no reason.-The game is really never updated with much content into free play mode.-You have to invidually put item by item, even if it's the same, into a crafting menu to craft things.-Some craftables take time, some don't, it's really random in what takes time and what doesn't. A salad takes time to make 3 while you can make plenty of DOORS and LOCKS in an instant.-Monsters do loads of damage. (ones in waves anyway), and can overpower you easily as they come in groups and never seperate.-Dwarves will fall when climbing for no reason. No explanation.I put an hour or two into this game, I got 4-5 tech unlocked. I still cannot pick up a door that's right in front of my feet. Why?			"

												Play the first stage - you will see all that there is if you want to. You want the same in different colors many more times? Play the later stages. I played stage one and it was fun. But unfortunately it was all the fun there was.This game is sadly one-dimensional. All the progress in the randomly generated worlds is available from start. Only the smallest changes are there.If you want to play the same slow game over and over again and get only a very petite change with every repetition - buy yourself a miniature Zen box and variate the patterns.Or buy tetris. It is more random and has a higher replay factor - even if you only replay the same level.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is surprisingly deep (pun semi-intended) and addictive to a fault. The biggest problem with the game is that the tutorial system is nonexistent and one or two aspects of the game are non-intuitive (builiding a shelter) but once you get over the frustration this is an amazingly fun game. I think there's still room to add more depth to the quest system (i.e. the quests basically just ask you to build every item in the tech tree which is something you'd do anyway and not really a separate mission) and the bestiary doesn't seem to work (it's stuck on one page and indicates stats for monsters that seem to become inaccurate over time) but so far this game has a lot going for it.That's the biggest problem I have with this game at its current state, there's no explanation for how the various components actually work and there's a lot of guesswork involved in figuring out how to best use each piece. It would be nice if there was a little explanation, or video of how they all work to clarify things. For example, the cart system isn't totally clear, or how to get mages to use spell potions (they vanish when you try and equip them) or why you can ""construct"" spells, but gain nothing from it.The in-game analogy is that this game is really deep, but the developers have dug themselves in without building ladders to let people climb down. Players have to fall a lot before they understand what's going on well enough to find the best ways to get in and out.In addition it would be nice if there was a way of directly commanding the dwarves in combat other than taking direct control and forcing an individual dwarf's actions. It would be nice if you could select specific dwarves and tell them where to go together to attack a specific target. There is a rally spell but it only forces them to stand in one spot and doesn't allow much beyond that. For combat it would be good to be able to  move in unison and attack together, the current set up doesn't allow for this and makes fighting large numbers of enemies a tricky circumstance. Being able to assign dwarves to guard specific spots would be good also.A quick note for people who may be confused with how to build a shelter:The game world has two layers, foreground and background including for construction. In order to build a proper wall you must build both the background layer and the foreground layer (i.e. build one space twice if it's empty). In order to build a shelter you must fill the shelter with background walls, the perimiter with background and foreground walls, and have doors/hatches (doors are for lateral, hatches are for vertical) at every intended opening, and you must have a totem somewhere within that space.A second note on construction:I realized this after many, many hours of play (after finishing the first world, in fact) but you can construct dirt/stone/sand directly back into the world and even use it as a building material for your structure. This is incredibly useful knowledge and yet the game doesn't teach you this anywhere, you sort of just have to stumble into it, but bear this in mind as dirt is a lot easier to get ahold  of than the other building materials you have to spend ages collecting resources for in order to create. Plus it's a cheap way to fill in inconvenient dig sites, or construct yourself a real dwarf burrow inside the earth.Overall a great game, and mostly inutitive, but seriously needs further development of the quest system and better explanation of how the game works (tutorials, an in game help system, a wiki, anything is better than the short blurbs in there at the moment.).

								I didn't expected this game to be so fun and deep.Now I'm playing it over Starbound. Micro manage your guys when you want it or just click here and there from time to time to relax. There are a few fight tactics to try, and some customisation (skills and gears) for every dwarf of your tribe.There are a few pathfinding/AI issues, but as you can take control of any character from your group, there's always a workaround to issues. Some gameplay parts are also a bit hard to get at first (shelters, elevators, trains) but once you have failed once or googled it, you get the point.The main feature I'd love to see in future patches is an express mode (like time goes x2 or x4 until you get attacked, so the mining/sleeping process is faster).

								This game is a mixture between Terraria, Gnomoria and Stronghold.Build your own fortress, dig for treasures, gather resources, fight off waves of monsters, do research, equip your dwarves.What I enjoyed most is the fact that this game has it's emphasis on defending vs monsters which always keeps you on your toe. Currently as it is, time always plays an important roleThe classic sandbox approach where you just build and mire is better left for Minecraft and maybe even Terraria, despite the graphics being one of the best one's for this genre so far.I recommend reading some guides first before jumping straight into the game since certain mechanics, i.e. how to build a proper shelter or how to use town portals are not necessarily intuitive yet.

The game play is fun and challenging, snf the exploration is rewarding. Pro tip, you really will need truckloads of wood, harvest them all then wait for the re-growth and harest again etc.			"

								simple yet more complex than it looks. entertaining animations, amusing sounds, slightly slow in it pace, but its a lot of fun if you like a sim-ish craft tree style game that will have you drinking many a cups of coffee and wondering where the time has gone.			"

Early Access Review
								All in all, this is a very very good game considering it is still curently only in early access! I havent yet encountered any bugs to my surprise and this game certainly has a lot of potential to be expanded upon, not that there isnt already plenty there for the time being!The only VERY minor problem I have with this game is the difficulty, in that as you progress through the game, it doesn't seem to get much harder as you develop, to the point where even on a game with the difficulty set to nightmare, I am having very little trouble with monsters including the large waves that appear every so often once you reach roughly about the 2 hour mark. The other thing I feel that woild make a good improvement would be the ability to switch at somepoint from a standard game to a permant death game, and then be unable to reverse, as following my above comment, it is quite easy to have a dwarf die in the early stages of the game, but once you reach the stage where you have a base up and running with multiple dwarves, the game does become easier, and I think this may reintroduce some of the challange back into the game at a later stage.However as I said these are very minor points, and all in all a very fun game that has plenty of content and is really promising. I highly recommend this game!			"

								I pretty much played this game straight through for a week and I must say, I had a good time.  I love the graphics. The style ,in a way,reminds me of the old Settlers games.My biggest ""issue"" was that I had nothing new to do after said week but since its alpha, this should be expected. The worst bugs were straightened out fast so thats always a good sign.I hope the devs will add a lot more features  and  content (other than decoration) and bring more depth into the defense.If they do then I would definitly recommend it but its already a good little game.

								Crafting is my favourite genre. As is building a dwarf fortress-like complex of buildings and tunnels. It then won't come as a surprise when I say that I like this game. But what did surprise even me, was just how much I've been in love with this game from the moment I started playing. Even through there are quite some 'early access'-related bugs that are still waiting to be fixed, and even though the AI doesn't always seem to be all that intelligent, this game has so much to offer and is so much fun to play that you'll happily overlook the few little details that don't seem to work just yet. For fans of the genre this game is an absolute must-have!			"

Early Access Review
								Craft The World is a lot 'deeper' than I thought, pun intended. I have been playing this a lot over the last few days, and it has been very enjoyable and pulls me back. The crafting tree is huge, so I haven't made it through to the end yet. My play style is more of the build and explore type, so I have not rushed to the end yet. In fact, due to loading onto my laptop and desktop both, I've been playing two different campaigns, and enjoying both. I hope that the alternate world/terrain types open up more replayability. But I still have lots of playability left to go.The closest comparison that comes to mind is Gnomoria, though graphically, it is like comparing the original DOS XCOM to the latest 3D versions.It is an 'early access' game, so I am not certain what changes might be in store. Obviously, new content is still being added, such as the new Snow world and the Yeti boss. At this stage, I do wish that it was possible to actually 'lose', but it appears that it is impossible to be wiped out entirely. There are some bugs that get revealed in edge-case scenarios, and this may be why, on one occasion, my last dwarf did not die. He kind of bugged at zero health, and I was able to recover him and un-bug him, and the game continued as new dwarfs joined him to rebuild.It's artwork is lush and beautiful, the sound effects are very good, the enemies are tough in the beginning, though once you get better equipment, the surface enemies are 'easy'. However, there are more enemies waiting for the dwarves in the depths. I can hear their drums calling to me now.			"

								I have been playing this game for awhile now, and anyone that thinks it is a Minecraft or Terraria clone is wrong on many levels.  Yes you build dwellings and fight off evil nasties, but in this game you are deeling with Drawfs.  The problem being is that at the begining they are really stupid.  Also you have to learn items in your crafting tree one at a time to complete other items.  What I mean is that I had to create several items before I could make a door for my dwelling.  So yes there are plenty of differences.  But even thou it can be fustrating, I am rating this game 8 out of 10.  It is only in Beta form right now and you can really play and enjoy it.  So if your looking for a game you can build, dig and fight, this is your game!			"

								Having never played Terraria or Starbound, I feel this game is pretty fun and really represents what an Early Access game should be in my mind. It has a few bugs and quirks but nothing completely gamebreaking. The graphics are polished and the gameplay is entertaining with a surprising amount of depth in the tech tree.This feels like what I expected (and still haven't seen) from Towns. The devs seem responsive and active too, so I have high hopes this already fun game will become far more fun as they near closer to an initial retail release.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this during one of the flash sales. The moment I eyeballed it, I knew it was a game I wanted to play. I like the concepts (and played) of Minecraft, Terraria, and Dwarf Fortress have, and generally like the game that take these concepts and put it into a gamel ike this. The ability to control a team of dwarves, construct a fortress, and survive in a world is a great thing. Minecraft and Terraria, while fun in their own merits, get stale after a time. Letting your creativity flow to create cool things in those games are pretty sweet, but I need more to it than being able to create things of fancy. That's why I like Dwarf Fortress. You create a fortress for dwarves, make them happy, and create a fort that suits them (though most who play DF consider efficiency high on the list more than aesthetics). And in thae game, you have to deal with all sorts of dangers risking your entire fort. That's what I like. I like the idea of creating this ""fortress"" with all sorts of perils come at you and try to wreck your day. This game is tamer in that resepct, than Dwarf Fortress, but it shows a lot of promise. It has some issues at the moment of this writing, but it was expected for being early access. There are some noticeable bugs, and feels like there's more left to add (obviously). However, I think it's on the right track to its potential. For those who don't buy into ""early access"", I'd say keep an eye on it.			"

												I'm totally new to the concept of crafting games and 12 hrs in, I'm loving it. The tutorial (missing in other things I've tried and given up on) was just right to get me going on how the concept works.  I love how the night brings in monsters to combat - but not so severe as you die on night one! I can feel myself getting better and better at crafting the right tools and arming my little guys ready for the onslaught  (love the countdown to the hoard of nasties). Sometimes my little guys ddon't go the way I want and manual control is a bit tedious - but to be able to control my whole game just with a single point and click device means I can keep 3 limbs under a winter blanket and play whilst snuggled up. As a starter game this has been great and I can see how there is potential to up my skill and get more out of the game as an advancing player. Nothing negative to say about it really - can't wait to see what the future updates bring.			"

												This game is just simple fun.  It feels like terraria and lemmings had a baby.  There are definetly some areas that need improvement.  When crafting items it kinda sucks having to drag each item into its respective slot.  When equipping one of the Dwarves you can simply double click on an item and it will equip in the proper slot.  But when crafting you are stuck drag and dropping.  Another bit of annoyance comes in when your Dwarves simply don't listen to your orders.  Either you'll get stuck waiting for one of them to craft some items you've queued, or for them to attack a baddie you've marked or other such nonsense.  Another point of annoyance I have had is the idea height of a room is 3 tiles yet Dwarves can only reach 2.  The only way to get to the 3rd is to build scaffolding/ladders or to manually control one of them which gives you access to the 3rd tile.However this is a great game full of fun and enjoyment.  I highly recommend this to anyone that likes this style of game in spite of some of the shortcommings.			"

												This game is a great time killer. It's one of those Civ type cames where you say just 5 more mins(1 more turn). The author has kept updating it and that's great. They just added multiplayer and I can't wait to see how that turns out. Just hope that the coop mode will let you do the story with a friend and split control of the dwarves or maybe even have separate teams but work cooperatively. I'm not much into PVP even if I have a coop friend helping.			"

												Its fun at the first world, but I didnt find myself wanting to play the 2nd world. I also found the game to be repetitive on how to progress technology, like i dont want to spend alot of resoures on stuff i wouldnt use like 20 windows to advance a tech. Also if what you wanted to do something far away from base, you would need to wait for so long for them to do it, sure you had pportals, but the mana used for it went down faster than it went up, and sometimes even with the portals, it took forever. Lastly the music is always the same, it gets tiring to hear the same song over and over each day and night.			"

												The game is fine. It's not something I've really regretted buying. I just wish that the game had a bit more variety to it. Every level is a case of doing exactly the same thing as you did on the previous level. While the incidental difficulty of the maps becomes greater (i.e. monsters are more difficult), I found it easier to mine necessary resources at later levels. I only just had enough mithril on my first map to finish the game, and with just enough to make a single mithril helmet and sword - not enough for 12 dwarves. If it weren't for the christmas easter egg equipment, I probably wouldn't have been able to survive the portal guardians.The game is also super slow. Like Civ 3 slow. It took me about 18 hours to finish the first level. Much of the wait is held up in watching dwarves haul materials across the screen. While this *is* sped up by various spells and techs, the technology tends to be fairly expensive to produce (on level 1, I was using most of my resources to build a rail system to haul resources back to make railway carts and lines...); the portal spell is useful, but it gets to the point where your entire game experience is just managing portals to ensure the various dwarves don't take too long to get back home.Final issue: the tech tree is full of connections that map back onto each other, meaning you have to become skilled in all manner of furniture and decoration before you can advance from, say, iron to silver weapons or armour. Seems a bit absurd. While happiness seemed to be a factor in some sense, I never worked it out, so I ended up producing all sorts of spurious tapestries and chairs, and not actually using them, simply because the tech tree demanded it.

My only gripe is that the dwarves sometimes act very stupidly and you have to micromanage the AI. It would also be really cool if there were things you could unlock between levels, so you could use new things after a level and it didn't feel so much like, ""new level, so I have to start all over again.""

												This game has a solid foundation, but has several major design flaws. Since the game already has a lot of positive reviews, I'll focus on why mine is negative.First off, it's extremely slow paced. It requires a lot of micro management, so you can't just set orders and go do something else. But it moves so slowly that you'll be sitting doing nothing for a minute or two after assigning new orders. Set some blocks to mine, trees to cut down, animals to hunt, then open portals near those places. Now wait 2 minutes while your dwarves finish those tasks. Then repeat. In order to play at an engaging speed, I actually used an external program to run the game at triple speed, which improved the game significantly.Second is the crafting ""tree"". All items, weapons, equipment, decoration, supplies, etc are bunched into groups of 4-5 items. In order to unlock a new group of items, you have to craft a certain number of items from the group (or two) that lead up to it. Crafting a lot of only one item from that group has diminishing returns, so it is best to craft 2-3 of each item in the group. The problem is, it isn't laid out in a tree. The next tier of armor might have furniture and glassware as prerequisites (as an example, I don't remember exactly). But each of THOSE requires 1-2 other groups first. So you can't rush to the items you want: you have to make EVERY ITEM IN THE GAME a few times to progress. This just compounds the first problem, slowing down the game. Even though you could easily just dig down and get mithril to make the best gear in the game, you can't actually craft those items until you've made every single other item in the game several times over. Imagine if in Minecraft, even though you can easily dig down and find diamonds in 10 minutes, you couldn't actually make diamond gear until you've spent 10 hours gathering materials and crafting every other in the game 20 times. Or if in Civilazation, there were no tech trees and you just had to research every single technology, in the same order, every game. That's what it feels like. There's no choice. It gets boring and tedious after the first time. Third is the lack of real progression from level to level in the campaign. There are four ""worlds"" in the campaign. Beat one, go to the next one. Here's the problem: each world only has a few new items to make. You play world one, get your dwarves decked out in the best gold and mithril gear, and then move on to world two... and you're back collecting sticks and leaves. World two lets you build four ""ice"" versions of other items, which are only better in that using ice doesn't waste the more valuable resources. Then you go through the whole crafting tree, taking forever to get enough resources to get up to gold and mithril again, so you can go on to world three and start all over again. World four finally adds some new weapons, which is nice, but they aren't a huge improvement on the same weapons you've been using since world one. It just doesn't feel like you're progressing. Normally in a campaign, when you move on to the next world you get access to stronger gear and the like. But in Craft the World, you work through the exact same progression over and over.My overall conclusion is that the game has potential but is poorly designed. A major overhaul could make it really good. Increasing dwarf movement speed so you don't have to micromanage portals for transportation would be amazing. Sorting the tech tree by item type would be a big help. Iron armor -> silver armor -> gold armor, instead of iron armor -> glassware -> fabric dying -> whatever -> silver armor or whatever the progression is. This would let you focus on what you want/need at the moment, instead of wasting your time making items you don't need first. When I need better armor so my dwarves can survive the next invasion, I don't want to have to make a ton of armoires first. The last major change would be changes to the scope of the campaign worlds. World one should be shorter, with iron as the only available metal, and weaker guardians that only require that iron gear to beat. Then world two is slightly larger, with silver added and guardians that require silver to beat. This way, the player actually feels a sense of progression from world to world. As is, it's just painful and quite frankly STUPID to go from mithril right back to wood, and then have to work back up to mithril. Also, don't make me unlock all the crap again in world two, three, four. It's a 100-200 hour game, with only 10-20 hours worth of content.Of course, for a lot of people it isn't just a game where you rush to beat the campaign. Like Minecraft, it's about building your vision of the perfect home. But in Minecraft, when you have a new vision you start a new world and can quickly have everything you need to start building again, but in Craft the World the tech system means that if you start a new world, it'll be at least 10 hours before you start to see your vision take shape.

												I have yet to finish it as i got sidetracked by larger RPG games (and other indies) but I will updeate this very short review once i have finished all three major maps, hence the following only is a first impression sort of deal after completing just the first level;This game is what i wanted both Towns and Minecraft to be. Except 2D-ish sidescroller with dwarves fighting off waves upon waves of undead and also veeery limited supply of certain metals meaning you have to be fairly greedy/careful with your metals. For me, in particular, iron, because you have to use it in so many different things including just research to unlock higher tier equiment and building blocks as well as necessary equipment, armour and weapons meaning you have to think while playing, not just breeze through it swiftly without putting any thought or effort into it.Pros:- Very replayable,- Not necessarily difficult but somewhat chance based how challenging the beginning will be depending on how you're placed on the map both strategically and practically considering resources.- Enjoyable graphics and style of animation.- Has to be learned. I had to restart games three times just to work out how to do things. First to learn how to build a house, second to actually build a house and have my dwarves not be miserable and hungry constantly. Third to build a house well and be able to defend it from the hordes. (Fourth: to learn not to attack or release the crystal guardian without a strategic vantage point AND high damage weapons/high defense armour equipped on ALL dwarves of which there should be et least 10. And fifth to actually win the map), Granted this may be considered a bad thing, but I rather enjoy the fact tht a game takes you being able to play the game in order to win it rather than just breezing through without that slight tickle in your belly when you're uncertain whether or not you'll be able to take on those enemies but you're aware you have no choice in the matter.- Although the tutorial doesn't hand you the game when you're fully able to understand what to do you have some idea and learn the rest through the objectives and through crafting so you're never fully alone in the game and left to your own vices althrough you are never told directly what to do next. Hence: the game encourages you to experiment and learn but will hold your hand and guide you a bit should you somehow manage to get stuck. - Mechanics run smoothly. I have not encountered any problems or major bugs this far.- Crafting is nice and smooth as well with a nice increasing level of dedication and involvement to craft higher tier object.Cons:- As in most my reviews, yet again the audio just gets really annoying after a few hours of playing... this far i can't really think of any other cons. As I progress i suspect I will come across more.Summary: Great fun. In fact. All of the fun. Despite the fact that I find myself moaning and ♥♥♥♥♥ing about how much I hate each dwarf in my colony (by name), Possibly also verbally assualting them with graphic curses and promises of torment after a few hours in a map it is still one of the most enjoyable and involved games i've played in a long while.

												I like the idea of the game, and for the first 30 minutes it's fun, but for me the game was bugged, where no matter what I did I couldn't get my dwarves to eat or sleep, and although I never got far enough to see how hunger affects the dwaves, sleeping it what regens health, meaning they would die very easy after a while, especially when the big waves that hit at 45 minutes  came in, with nothing I could do about it. Basiclly I lose after the first portal wave hits. If this bug ever gets fixed, maybe I'll change my opinion, till then, don't buy it.			"

												I originaly wrote a review that reccomended this game with a dose of skepticism.  I'm now rewriting that review after having many hours in game.  This game is boring.  Very boring.  It's obviously being designed as a port to touch screen devices.  They even have a handy gold coin store in place (currently you randomly find these coins while digging or by killing certain enemies).  This game is all about finding the most efficient setup and then recreating it in a different level time after time after time.  It desperately needs some variety.  The ""tech tree"" makes almost no sense and some items are even missing from it.  The crafting interface is horrible with a 3x3 grid where you have to drag each individual component over one at a time, even if it's the same component.  Unless it happens to be in an adjacent slot, in which case you can double click the original piece and fill them in.  This game feels like it could be something much more fun but only with a lot of polish, creativity (I'm looking at you arrow/tesla towers gimmie some more options here), and dedication to a specific platform instead of using PC as a way to play test your obviously touch screen intended game.

												I love this game so far however there are several flaws that need to be fixed in order to make the game playable without having to doo a full restart all the time. Your Dwarves will forget the beds exsists normally after a zombie attack and you need to full reboot the game in order to make them rest (the only way for them to heal) or they will die. The other one can completely destroy your game. Your totem (this is what decides wether or not your guys can sleep)  will on occasion just disappear. and if you dont have enough gold your entire game is now done. Restart from scratch because without a totem all your dwarves will die. I will update as patches come out but these two alone can make it unplayable.			"

												This game has the potential to be very good, unfortunately, it suffers from some really, really terrible AI and AI interactions.  During the short time I've played thus far, I've had nearly every single dwarf fall into a small put -THROUGH- a bridge that I'd set over it to prevent them from falling.  The dwarves are clearly acting as if they've fallen off the edge of a cliff, despite the bridge being there.  Also I do find the tech tree to be completely bizarre, the game should really start you off with the basic building tech already available, having to unlock walls, doors and roofing is just silly.

												Easily the best early access game I have played, and one of only two (the other being 7 days to die) that were actually worth paying for. This game is great. It's kind of like a 2D version of Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria. Although the scope of this game isn't as large as those two, the game has what it needs to stand on its own. The graphics are crisp, the gameplay is solid, and there is a good bit of variety in the (currently 4) world types. I give this game my absolute highest recommendation, and I hope its developers make a fortune on it.			"

												I started playing craft the world just recently and have enjoyed most of the time spent on it, there are a few bugs and interface improvements to make but for the most part its a good game worth it's price.It looks very good and remind me of a few other games like dungeon keeper, minecraft and games like dwarf fortress and there is a risk that you will postpone bedtime to spend only one more hour to complete your latest mastermind design. There is more then meets the eye here and planning your shelter and redesign it as you progress is both fun and rewarding. I only played custom games so far and even if the endgame tend to drag out a bit on large maps I didn't feel like it was to bad and never lacked resources for long. (Lucky perhaps?)What could be improved is the AI that can from time to time drive you nuts when the dwarfs do one stupid thing after another, there could be improvements to be made with tooltips and make it more obvious what armor stats your dwarfs have when you equip better gear. Other thing is that the tech tree could be tuned a bit to make it a bit more interesting and some techs should be moved to a earlier spot in the tech tree to match your progress as you need to expand and go further away from the shelter (elevator, secondary storages and railtracks for example) . I would also love to see some more options for defending your shelter, like more turrets, burning oil, perhaps a drawbridge. If you are into sandbox games and enjoy perfecting your castle and exploring the landscape around it you should be quite happy with this game, it got much to offer even though there are room for improvements.

												After putting in 85 hours of this I should probably write a review...Craft The World is this little hidden gem of a game, combining the lighter sides of both Dwarf Fortress and Terraria in a well polished, enjoyable game. It's one of the few games this year where I've found myself coming back to the game time and time again to indulge in a day of play. Currently it seems to be updated pretty regularly, and the new addition of being able to start rudimentary animal husbandry was a really nice, needed touch. The aesthetic of the game is wonderful - the graphics are just really pleasing to look and the game just oozes it's own unique charm. In all my time of play I've not noticed huge bugs at all, certainly nothing game breaking. There's a really nice touch in that your games are saved on Steam's cloud, so I can load it up elsewhere and just play the same worlds I was on. There are a few cons - the comment that it doesn't have high replayability is a fair one, as once you've beaten a world you've no reason other than pure enjoyment to play the same type of world again. Once you've run out of tech tree there's not so much left to do and mythril will run out eventually. There's no real incentive to build your base beyond straightforward utility - comfort is not so hard to max out provided your walls are of a decent material and it's also far easier to build down instead of up (In fairness though, they are dwarves...). If you have some items they can't pick up, they'll spam broken pathway thoughts all day but give you no clue as to where they are. Finally, and most annoyingly, you will have to craft several of the same item over and over again to get the tech tree to progress. This leads to a bit of a block in the middle section that you'll just have to persevere through.But really, these are just gripes and most of my wants in this game would be wishlists as opposed to game changes. I'd love to see an expansion of the world types - perhaps a fire-type world or a rainforest. I'd also love to see the class roles solidified and with the ability to task those dwarves. For example; disable everyone who isn't a hunter from hunting animals; make it so that only cooks and smiths and carpenters can carry out those tasks. Maybe get some unique 'appearance sets' so everyone doesn't look like a mythril statue in end game?To summarize, if 2D building and defending is your poison, you really can't go wrong with this game. It's well polished, enjoyable, and has its own unique charm. Glad I stumbled across it.			"

												Worth every penny. (Or Cent, or whatever currency you think in...)Synopsis: An addictive game where you direct your dwarves to excavate, (For resources), chop, mine, dig, plant, build structures and craft items to complete given levels.There are some magic abilities, like portals which come in handy for speeding up travel, a fiery fireball to roast enemies, and even summon imps to carry goods, freeing up the dwarves for more intensive labor.But this is not just about magic, it i about dwarves, which are known for engineering feats of note, so you can build a railway, allowing your dwarfs to speed from one end of the map to the other, lifts, that essentially do the same, just in a vertical direction.Your dwarves are also skilled in different fighting and crafting skills, like archers, sword wielders, mages and those swinging big meat tenderisers. Crafting skills range from fishing, milling, tree felling, to even simpler forms like swimming and mountain climbing.You need to equip your dwarves with the right tools, and so you craft things like axes, pickaxes, weapons, armour and t tools like backpacks.I've had endless fun, and plenty frustration with this game. At the tim of this writing, I am hinting for the last 6 achievements.This game has elements of Terraria in it, and is a bit of a world builder, as it allows you to craft elaborate homes for the dwarves.The combat is awesome,  but at times frustrating, as they keep attacking when I am busy exploring and excavating for resources.The tech tree does not make sense sometimes, however, I think there is only one point where it becomes a real pain to complete, which is the second last tier, for crafting potions. Having crafted the potions though, helps immensely in the coming final guardian battles.The last improvements made, look great, even though I haven't tried them yet.I disagree with some of the game design elements, however, these ""problems"" i perceive, do not distract from an awesome gaming experience, with plenty of fun.I am a great supporter of management games, where you direct, and the minions follow, and this game falls squarely into that bracket.

												I have spent many hours on this game, and enjoyed it very much.This game maybe simple but there is the challenge to learn how to optimise the search for parts of the portal and how to move the dwarves around when you run out of mana. A how to build a nice dwarf home that will withstand the ever increasing attackers.  There is nothing like the satisfaction of continuing to mine knowing your base is standing strong, or the intense race to rebuild a shattered base before the next attack.The key to the game is to work out the secrets that allow you regrow your mana.My only wish is for more kingdoms and for the campaign to be made longer, I live in a place with limited internet, so play the game alot by myself.I look forward to patches to see what further challenges the developers have made in the single player campaign.

												This is one of my absolute favorite games! I've just spent 5 days straight building and defending my little dwarven cave!I love this kind of slow 'base-building' games.The sounds and music are cute and mellow.Shut off your phone and pack the freezer with easy to thaw food.It's a bit stressful at the start of each world, when you need to start from scratch, but as soon as you get your underground home going it's nice and relaxed game-play. With the ever occuring portals of monsters opening of course.But it's intresting to build up ones defenses and see where they hold and where you need to beef up.And of course - searching the underground for parts of the portal to get to the next world is exciting.

I do not like the monster portals, especially when they pop up on top of my base. There should be a no portal zonearound the base.It's very time oriented, you have lots of things to do and build, learn and craft. Plus you have a bunch ofdwarves to manage too. They are like toddlers so you have to keep an eye on them or they will get into trouble.All in all I found the game to be an enjoyable one. "

												Craft the World is a nice mix of Tower Defence, Base Building and Resource Gathering / Management and after 200 hours of play I can safely say that I have gotten great value for money with this game!You are constantly moving forward one way or another. With a vast tech tree to work through, there is always something new to craft, new weapons, new tools and new decorations are plentiful. Ever increasing waves of an enemy horde will keep you on your toes, complete with a countdown so you know how long you have left to bolster defences and get ready for the pending invasion. Also the main aim of the game is to build a portal and move on to the next new land, for this you must find and defeat the boss creatures hidden in the depth of the world, be careful when digging deep though and more than 1 surprise awaits in the far depths.You are never left bored, not only are you mining to find the Portal (and to gather resources) while waiting for the invading horde but enemies will spawn in unlit areas and the day/night cycle will bring a small horde of enemies to your door each night.There are plenty of tools, weapons and armours for your dwarves to choose from ranging from stone and wooden stuff to mythril, do you go for style over functionality? will your dwarves be melee warriors, archers or mages? finding a balance that suits you can mean the difference between success and failure when attacking strong enemies.Building a home for your dwarves is also important, keep them happy by giving them good food (and maybe a nice little something to drink ;) )and a nice place to live, there are loads of choices in this department, from various walls and floors to fish bowls and comfy chairs. So much to choose from keeps the game fresh.This is a game I always go back to and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes tower defence or resource management games. "

												This is a great game! You control a team of Dwarves to dig and build. You can directly control one at a time (limited usefulness) or queue orders your team will carry out. There are quite a few, unexplained, options you kind of just have to play and learn about. The graphics are beautiful, and the game plays very smoothly.			"

								Hands down this is one of my most favorite games.  The game is incredible.  The depth of the game for being a 2-D tactical game is pretty awesome; you really don't have any control over your dwarves.  You set orders and the dwarves do their best to fulfill them.  You research new technology by developing new items (or finding scrolls/designs throughout the world).  You build a home for your dwarves and mine valuable resources to produce better weapons, armor, tools, and decorations for your dwarves.  I always find the mountain in the game and make a ton of effort to hollow it out into a castle for my dwarves to live in.  Some people build castles.  Others build underground.  FUN!			"

												After putting in 85 hours of this I should probably write a review...Craft The World is this little hidden gem of a game, combining the lighter sides of both Dwarf Fortress and Terraria in a well polished, enjoyable game. It's one of the few games this year where I've found myself coming back to the game time and time again to indulge in a day of play. Currently it seems to be updated pretty regularly, and the new addition of being able to start rudimentary animal husbandry was a really nice, needed touch. The aesthetic of the game is wonderful - the graphics are just really pleasing to look and the game just oozes it's own unique charm. In all my time of play I've not noticed huge bugs at all, certainly nothing game breaking. There's a really nice touch in that your games are saved on Steam's cloud, so I can load it up elsewhere and just play the same worlds I was on. There are a few cons - the comment that it doesn't have high replayability is a fair one, as once you've beaten a world you've no reason other than pure enjoyment to play the same type of world again. Once you've run out of tech tree there's not so much left to do and mythril will run out eventually. There's no real incentive to build your base beyond straightforward utility - comfort is not so hard to max out provided your walls are of a decent material and it's also far easier to build down instead of up (In fairness though, they are dwarves...). If you have some items they can't pick up, they'll spam broken pathway thoughts all day but give you no clue as to where they are. Finally, and most annoyingly, you will have to craft several of the same item over and over again to get the tech tree to progress. This leads to a bit of a block in the middle section that you'll just have to persevere through.But really, these are just gripes and most of my wants in this game would be wishlists as opposed to game changes. I'd love to see an expansion of the world types - perhaps a fire-type world or a rainforest. I'd also love to see the class roles solidified and with the ability to task those dwarves. For example; disable everyone who isn't a hunter from hunting animals; make it so that only cooks and smiths and carpenters can carry out those tasks. Maybe get some unique 'appearance sets' so everyone doesn't look like a mythril statue in end game?To summarize, if 2D building and defending is your poison, you really can't go wrong with this game. It's well polished, enjoyable, and has its own unique charm. Glad I stumbled across it.			"

												After playing other attempts at turning the Dwarf Fortress formula into an easily swallowable pill like Gnomoria and Towns, I feel that this is the first that succeeds all-around. It's a game with simple interface, but still plenty of depth. Dwarves behave in a relatively intelligent manner without you having to micro-manage priorities or wondering why that one task you assigned just isn't getting done, you say it, they do it. And even if there is something you want done straight away, you can always take control of a dwarf directly and do it yourself, or set down a portal to get them closer to what you want them to do. In the campaign, unlockable tech-trees and finding pieces to the portal to the next world give you goals to shoot for, and even after that, there's always something more to improve upon when building your current world.-Notes on Difficulty:- As you play you will be beset by waves of enemies periodically to test your defenses, at first I felt a little worried, but unless you are in permadeath mode, your game won't end even if your very last dwarf dies. Worst case scenario, you lose all your dwarves and the skills they built up, but they will quickly be replaced and they can wear all your previous dwarves equipment. You can quickly repair any destroyed blocks from the previous attack and prepare better for the next one.I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys Dwarf Fortress, or is even simply interested in it but feels a little overwhelmed. I am hoping for more objects/biomes/creatures in the future!UPDATE: Occasional slowdown if you have too many tasks queued or too many objects on the map, enemy and dwarf pathing isn't perfect, but you can build around it to accommodate them.TIP: You can use F1 to F3 to alter game speed. Important!			"

												WOW! I mean seriously! WOW!ImpressionThis game is just simply amazing! I bought it while it was on sale, however, I would gladly have payed full price. The game is currently in early access phase. Sometimes, with early access there is definitely some bugs or some issues with the game. This is true at this point. But the issues are minor enough that I really don’t mind a lot. I’m sure they will iron them out and if they don’t, the game is still amazing and I would still pay full price. What is it?	This game has some definite parallels to popular games such as Terraria. That isn’t a bad thing either. The success of Terraria is undeniable. I have played many hours of that game myself. This is NOT a terraria clone however. This has similar features and gameplay models but it is far from the same. In this game you are more of a dwarf god in that you tell them to chop a tree down and they go to work. You don’t have one character to traverse the world with, you control multiple characters to tell what to do and watch the magic. Still want that control of being a character? Don’t worry, they got you covered. You can individually control the dwarfs as well. There are also a lot of great twists on old enemies as well as some spectacular new ones. Did I mention there is also experience and reward as such? This is great since nothings is worse then the same old dwarf with the same old abilities. You can also outfit your cool warriors with armor, weapons, tools, fishing poles, and so much more. The goal is to survive and thrive into a great dwarf community. I have over 5 hours of play time as of now and that’s what I know so far. I’m absolutely amazed at how good this game is.Buy or Fly?	The ultimate question you’re probably asking yourself is, “Should I buy this damn game or not?” Well, if you like boring straightforward cookie cutter games with absolutely predictable gameplay, then don’t buy this game. If you like fun, new and creative ways to play a mix of genres, then this is a MUST BUY! I would absolutely recommend this game. This game is on iPhone and iPad?! Buy or Fly?	Silly question. YES! I bought it on both Steam and my iPhone/iPad already! It’s the same game on both but a slightly different experience. Either one is worth buying but I say buy both! "

												Designed for mobile sold for PC. The game has the feel of being made solely for mobile, this is evident in the clunky controls. If you want to place 200 blocks to build a house you will have to click 200 times, there is no key that allows drag-to-build. The only way to findout the shortcut keys is to google it. While this may sound like a list of reasons to not buy the game I think it's an ok buy. With the implimentaion of multiplayer mode I think the devs are working on the game and I have high hopes for the games future playability. Pros: Fantastic animations, great game if you're bored and want to play for about an hour at a time.Cons: Horrible AI, clunky controls, annoying monster portal, mana for portal spell needs to be adjusted.

												I am in love with this game, the sort of game you can leave for a week and just pick up where you left off.... And you will have to! There is no playing a single level in one sitting (unless I'm really bad at this game)...I am STILL on level 2 and have clocked 50 hours!Basically you are micro managing  a small population of dwarves - you order them to cut trees, mine ore, kill enemies etc... All while building a house with good comfort so that dwarves sleep well and gain health back faster. Every 45 minutes you get a wave of monsters which gets harder and more portals will start opening. So it's a micro managing - tower defence - creativity - mining game!!! You can also make equipement and kit out each dwarf. It is in my top five games.My only cons are that Dwarves hang around an awful lot even if you have ordered them to do things, sometimes its just faster to control one manually. I don't like how they drop all of their items to ALL go and attack a snail if you accidently click on it and I also get infuriated when a dwarf decides to take the long and treacherous route home instead of the portal! BUT seriously, those are just irks lol! LOVE this game, worth every penny. The app is pretty good too but it's a couple of updates behind.			"

												Really unique and fun game, very polished for being an early access title. It's like someone took many of my favourite games, including terraria, minecraft, dwarf fortress, spelunky, worms/lemmings and put them all in a blender. It's not something you can just play for 20 minutes, it's got a fair bit of depth. It's also fairly hard once the enemies start increasing in number, be warned.			"

								Very good game, nicely done. Previous versions had some bugs, but developers sorted out many things so only thing I can say is ""thumbs up"". buy it, you won't regret it. I like that they have stick to the plan and made it through as not many early access games do and I have seen many developers fail, but not this one. Mostly I like graphics. Very very good job on art here.			"

								I actually like this game, not having to save the game is a good thing. And loading other games is effortless. This is a very fun time killer for single player.  I would reccommend it to anyone who has played Terraria, Starbound and MineCraft type games and even Dwarves Fortress.			"

												This is hands down one of the best games I've played in years.  Easily in the top dozen of my life with Homeworld, Civilizaiton 1/2, Warlords, C&C, FTL, Sea Battle.  It's all about finding the right balance and creating meaningful progression and this game has done it.  Not perfect of course (is anything?) but pretty damn close.Pros- Pretty deep game with the four worlds with lots of hours.- Increased options and strategies with the DLC- Really nice balance between strategic choices and RTS fun- Okay replayability with the four core maps plus creating custom games- No big bugs, very stable game and small bugs are only slightly annoying and easily overcome- Appears to be a developer who listens and cares about the community they've built - I have lots of hope for more DLC and an eventual sequelCons- multiplayer is a little awkward as its inserted into single player games- Dwarves are a little flat from an RPG perspective - three skills per dwarf.  I'd like to see personalities like grumpy dwarf, sleepy dwarf as a simple way to create a stronger conneciton with them.- Some simple techniques can eliminate most of the risk from invading monsters.  Needs a bit more balance here.- More rare/unique items dropped by big monsters would be cool, more tower options would create more defence optionsAmazing game and worth the full price (and even better on sale).   I'd recommend getting the DLC with the game as it's nice to start the game with the additional options created by the DLC.Happy gaming.			"

												This game has a solid foundation, but has several major design flaws. Since the game already has a lot of positive reviews, I'll focus on why mine is negative.First off, it's extremely slow paced. It requires a lot of micro management, so you can't just set orders and go do something else. But it moves so slowly that you'll be sitting doing nothing for a minute or two after assigning new orders. Set some blocks to mine, trees to cut down, animals to hunt, then open portals near those places. Now wait 2 minutes while your dwarves finish those tasks. Then repeat. In order to play at an engaging speed, I actually used an external program to run the game at triple speed, which improved the game significantly.Second is the crafting ""tree"". All items, weapons, equipment, decoration, supplies, etc are bunched into groups of 4-5 items. In order to unlock a new group of items, you have to craft a certain number of items from the group (or two) that lead up to it. Crafting a lot of only one item from that group has diminishing returns, so it is best to craft 2-3 of each item in the group. The problem is, it isn't laid out in a tree. The next tier of armor might have furniture and glassware as prerequisites (as an example, I don't remember exactly). But each of THOSE requires 1-2 other groups first. So you can't rush to the items you want: you have to make EVERY ITEM IN THE GAME a few times to progress. This just compounds the first problem, slowing down the game. Even though you could easily just dig down and get mithril to make the best gear in the game, you can't actually craft those items until you've made every single other item in the game several times over. Imagine if in Minecraft, even though you can easily dig down and find diamonds in 10 minutes, you couldn't actually make diamond gear until you've spent 10 hours gathering materials and crafting every other in the game 20 times. Or if in Civilazation, there were no tech trees and you just had to research every single technology, in the same order, every game. That's what it feels like. There's no choice. It gets boring and tedious after the first time. Third is the lack of real progression from level to level in the campaign. There are four ""worlds"" in the campaign. Beat one, go to the next one. Here's the problem: each world only has a few new items to make. You play world one, get your dwarves decked out in the best gold and mithril gear, and then move on to world two... and you're back collecting sticks and leaves. World two lets you build four ""ice"" versions of other items, which are only better in that using ice doesn't waste the more valuable resources. Then you go through the whole crafting tree, taking forever to get enough resources to get up to gold and mithril again, so you can go on to world three and start all over again. World four finally adds some new weapons, which is nice, but they aren't a huge improvement on the same weapons you've been using since world one. It just doesn't feel like you're progressing. Normally in a campaign, when you move on to the next world you get access to stronger gear and the like. But in Craft the World, you work through the exact same progression over and over.My overall conclusion is that the game has potential but is poorly designed. A major overhaul could make it really good. Increasing dwarf movement speed so you don't have to micromanage portals for transportation would be amazing. Sorting the tech tree by item type would be a big help. Iron armor -> silver armor -> gold armor, instead of iron armor -> glassware -> fabric dying -> whatever -> silver armor or whatever the progression is. This would let you focus on what you want/need at the moment, instead of wasting your time making items you don't need first. When I need better armor so my dwarves can survive the next invasion, I don't want to have to make a ton of armoires first. The last major change would be changes to the scope of the campaign worlds. World one should be shorter, with iron as the only available metal, and weaker guardians that only require that iron gear to beat. Then world two is slightly larger, with silver added and guardians that require silver to beat. This way, the player actually feels a sense of progression from world to world. As is, it's just painful and quite frankly STUPID to go from mithril right back to wood, and then have to work back up to mithril. Also, don't make me unlock all the crap again in world two, three, four. It's a 100-200 hour game, with only 10-20 hours worth of content.Of course, for a lot of people it isn't just a game where you rush to beat the campaign. Like Minecraft, it's about building your vision of the perfect home. But in Minecraft, when you have a new vision you start a new world and can quickly have everything you need to start building again, but in Craft the World the tech system means that if you start a new world, it'll be at least 10 hours before you start to see your vision take shape.

												pros:-Get to guide little dwarf guys to build a base-nice art-you can control the dwarves individuallyCons:-the only way to win is to craft stuff.  Which wouldn't be a problem except that in order to advance to things like better weapons you need to discover aesthetic type stuff.  Kind of annoying.  -the dwarves are exceedingly stupid will rush to their deaths-it takes eons to finish a map (some people might like this though)Overall though I had fun, but after losing the second level to dwarves doing kamakaze missions where they would charge into a pit where there's a yeti, two skeleton mace guys, and the stink ogres.. well.. I hope I can find better uses of my time.			"

												Epic game with an epic fail... I really loved CTW after watching an LP, but I found an ugly flaw after I bought it couple months ago. There's no replay factor. You need to research everything to complete the first level. And done. Nothing left to discover for the second level. I felt no interest in playing it again. If I were the developer, I would never let players pass ""steel age"" at the first map. It's like a ""less-sandboxy"" Minecraft, where you need to fight the dragon and the wither in first map, then you almost forgot there's a second map (where you do everything again, from punching wood).

It's basic, repetitive and time consuming. But there is something about digging a big mine and turning what you find into useful stuff that is addictive. The concept of starting out with  set of tools that are fundmentally stoneage and developing your abilities to make items of ever increasing complexity over time is a good one. A well executed, original concept.			"

								Actually very fun. While it may seem similar to Terraria, the game plays differently and has a different aesthetic that reminds this author much more of Dungeon Keeper crossed with Dwarf Fortress. This game is entertaining and engaging despite the field of ""Dwarf-likes"" being flooded currently. Despite some very odd design decisions and a 2d space, the game stays novel by reducing some of the complex factors of Dwarf Fortress (goblin invasions etc) to a point where they become somewhat stale after a bit. Despite that, the game stays fun by introducing some new surprises in the depths and simplifying gameplay mechanics within a 2d space.			"

												I first thought it just needs time. But I realised that it just went in the wrong direction and became a rather boring frustrating game.1. AI is horribly stupid. I did hope again and again that we get direct control over the dwarves like in an RTS. That would have made things so much better. You WILL get insane by the AI's stupidity.2. Boring. Build a fortress. Nice. And then? There isn't really anything going on. I can unlock other planets at first, yes. But why? It's anyways the same. The game has 100s of items but only one way to play it. No room for creativity AT ALL. That's most likely the biggest ♥♥♥♥-up of them all. Also places are to small, enemies to weak. It's just boring. Relaxing yes. But after a while you have seen it and want more. 3. Crafting System is stupid. You need to build senseless stuff just to advance. Annoying at best. If it's on sale for under 10€ I'd say you might give it a go as it is also nice in the beginning. But when you saw all you don't want to play any further. Also at least point 1 and 3 have been said again and again by the community. But the devs weren't able or willing to do anything about it.			"

I do not like the monster portals, especially when they pop up on top of my base. There should be a no portal zonearound the base.It's very time oriented, you have lots of things to do and build, learn and craft. Plus you have a bunch ofdwarves to manage too. They are like toddlers so you have to keep an eye on them or they will get into trouble.All in all I found the game to be an enjoyable one. "

Build your fortress up and discover new recipes to strengthen and improve your equipment... meanwhile, you need to survive. And who REALLY needs sleep, right?			"

												My previous review was negative, they added a lackluster DLC that effectivly broke the base game.  Over the course of a few days they've repaired the game so it functions.  Now I'm still not impressed with the DLCs, the fact that multi-player isn't a base feature is a real drawback, but the content in them is somewhat nice to be totally fair.Over all I do enjoy playing the game, its got the Lemmings appeal with some solid crafting fun.  Some people say the hourly attacks are too frequent - they can be frustrating but the additional conent adds enough base defence that it gets pretty easy and without that content there is certainly a hump but its doable.Tl;dr The base game is fun, the DLCs are weak but on sale often and imo worth the sale price.  They also fx bugs which is a credit to the developers.			"

												This is a great game. I have played many hours. I enjoy playing this in the background while I watch Netflix or Youtube.However, recently I need to adjust the window size due to my new TV. So I attempted to move the window edges to adjust and was unable to. So I check the screen resolutions avaliable and it is now stuck in a full screen window that I cannot adjust or change at all. I can no longer play while watching something, and as the dwarves take a while to complete all the orders I've laid out, this mean I have nothing to do while I wait.Turns out, this made the game unplayable for me.While I recomend this game. Be aware that there is alot of down time while you wait for your dwarves to do what you want.			"

												I did not like this game the first time I saw it. But having watched a couple of let's plays I got really tempted and eventually purchased this game. I have not played much, but my first impression is pleasant. Interesting gameplay, full freedom and really challenging game mechanic - the more you play (provided you play actively), the more dwarfs you will get. It will increase your power, but on the other hand, all of those dwarfs should be fed, given place to sleep, given tools and weapons. Maybe this game was inspired by Terraria and Minecraft, but it is quite different. In Minecraft, theoretically, you can beat the game even if you live in a small house. In Craft the world, you'll have to expand. 15 dwarfs need space to live afterall!I am really looking forward to developers adding even more items into the game, hopefully they'll include some steampunk-themed things. Because I've always assosiated dwarfs with steampunk.Some'll say Terraria is better. Maybe, I have not played it, I can not say. But why control one character when you can have an entire army?This is a wonderful game, and even after 1.5 hours of gameplay I am like:

												This is a great little game.  It is by far the best Early Access Game I have purchased.  The crafting element is very well done and a lot of fun,  The combat is also well done.  The devs have done a great job keeping the game moving forward.  I can't wait till the game is finished up.____________________________________________________________So the game has gone to full release since my original review and I have a few more hours playing it...Here is my take on the finished product and the first DLC.It is a still great game overall and I still highly recomend it as a fun mostly casual game.  It also is still the best Early Access Game I have.Pros:  Good graphics  Good single player gameplay  It has been out for almost 2 years and still gets updated above and beyond the DLC  The DLC was reasonalby priced for what was in it (female dwarves, decorative wall    tiles, catapults, shields, and 2 house pets)Cons:  The Dwarves AI is still not the sharpest tool in the shed, though it has improved  Multiplayer gets poor reviews that I have seen, I was unable to get it working and    multiplayer is not important to me so your milage may vary  The game occasionally still has some non-fatal bugs that are fixed by quiting out and    restarting  There is a lot of dragging in the crafting interface  IOS version available, but no android version			"

												Depends what you want from games... If you want minion mastery, sandbox, base defense, crafting, gathering, building, feeding an army, strategy, survival, tactics then this is your game. Of course it has some cons but better than %90 of games which like dwarf fortress.I hope they bring some dlc later.			"

												A fun game for casual players.  I found myself playing the game for quite some time when I first got it, and then I'll load it up and play it again for a bit before walking away and doing something else.I will say it is a fun time killer, and it worth the price you pay for the game.  If you enjoy terraria, or minecraft, you might enjoy this game.It does have it's flaws though, such as pathing issues, and dwarves doing stuff that you wanted them to do, but not in that order, making it difficult for you to get some resources as they tend to go to the closest item first.

												[edit]How sweet, they introduced rats in the latest update, and the solution to get rid of rats via paid DLC. Thanks devs, thats a real insentive to keep playing this game :(After spending a long time playing Minecraft and Terraria, I started looking for a new game with similar playing experience and that would hook me in just like those ones. Craft The World seemed to do just that, and once I started playing I found myself sucked in and spending long hours immersed, at least until I completed the first world.The game is very enjoyable to play, easy and intuitive to learn. It’s fun to command around your army of cute little dumb dwarfs. And dumb they are, sometimes amusing you with their complete goofiness and sometimes testing your patience to the limit, as they so often seem to refuse collaboration. They have a persistent tendency of being in the wrong place. Command your dwarfs to build something, and you can be sure all other idle dwarfs will run to that same spot and stand there doing nothing, just hampering the dwarf who is actually trying to do the building. Relax your attention for a moment, and the dwarves may wander off getting lost into caves or falling down to their deaths into pits full of critters.All this fun will last you through the first world though, as you will have to start from scratch once you beat the first world and start the second one. All the long hours you spent grinding through the tech tree, collecting resources, upgrading and training your dwarfs will all be lost once you make it through the portal to the next world.This is a major drawback of this game, as it gives you little reason to keep on playing after the first world. It’s frustrating to have to start over, and not being able to keep your dwarves and tech upgrades. I don’t mind arriving at a new world to build and explore, but starting everything all over from point zero with one dwarf and no tech was enough for me to put the game down for good.Another part of the game mechanics that makes little sense is the huge tech tree you have to work through in order to get access to better equipment. Many of the items you are forced to craft in order to advance are completely useless (mirrors, decorative items, columns, statues, gargoyles...). These useless items should not be mandatory.It would also be nice to be able to assign individual tasks to a dwarf or group of dwarves, as the current game only allows tasks to be assigned collectively. This task assignment is not always efficient – sometimes a dwarf standing right next to a assigned task will do nothing while another dwarf will come from far away to complete that task.I can say without any doubt that I enjoyed playing this game and that the 30 hours+ spent to finish the first world were worth the money I paid for it, but I wish there had been a way to continue the game without losing everything I conquered.Maybe the developers will correct these issues in a future update, as it has been a major source of complaint among players.

								This game caught me off guard. Didn't think I'd get so hooked so fast. It's just a really solid and fun game. I do have minor gripes (the path finding can be really odd at times and your dwarf sometimes doesn't do what you tell it to do), but there are usually workarounds. If you like Terraria/Starbound with Gnomoria/Dwarf Fortress elements, you will love this game. Highly recommended.			"

Early Access Review
								Overall a fun game with a charming art style as well as an interesting dynamic to tech progression that is both probably the game's biggest strength, as well as most glaring weakness. The tech tree is vast and full of neat things to craft and place around or give to your dwarves, but around the halfway point tech progression can slow to a crawl as you scrounge up materials for your seventh soup ladle or umpteenth stone pillar that you won't ever use while desperately trying to claw your way to better weapons and armour so that poor Hunck the blacksmith doesn't get maimed by a beholder for the third time today.This mechanic, while it can be slow-going and grindy at points, does however ensure there's never a lack of things to do while you wait for your bearded minions to finish the latest addon to your fortress or figure out the best manner in which to club a snail to death.The generally casual pace makes this game an excellent time-waster for when you've got nothing to do and a long time to do it while the regular invasions that occur every 40 minutes or so keep things interesting and keep you on your toes and devising clever methods to keep enemies out of your fort and your dwarves' heads firmly on their shoulders.If invasions and tech trees aren't your thing, the game also boasts a sandbox mode, though I personally haven't taken the time to play much with it.Updates and hot fixes are small and frequent, with constant effort being put into improving AI, visual assets, and the overall gameplay experience.Also ghosts are pretty much jerks.

Early Access Review
								This game felt very polished compared to so many other games in 'Early Access'. I am very much looking forward to whatever else they plan on implementing.  The game definitely has that Terreria feel but I very much enjoy the dynamic of controlling multiple dwarfs and being able to mold each of them in to their own specific role.  The game also gives you a similar feel of control to the 'hand of god' games such as Black & White, though when you really need to, you can take direct control of a dwarf.  One other little detail that I appreciated was the fact that the dwarfs can be clumbsy and may fall of planks or off walls and take damage.  This attention to detail made the dwarfs feel much more like a believable character than just one of many bots that will run around and do your bidding with no faulter.I could go on about the features that I enjoy about this game (and at the time of writing this I have only played it for just over 3 hours) but I would highly suggest you play it for yourself.

								All in all, this is a very very good game considering it is still curently only in early access! I havent yet encountered any bugs to my surprise and this game certainly has a lot of potential to be expanded upon, not that there isnt already plenty there for the time being!The only VERY minor problem I have with this game is the difficulty, in that as you progress through the game, it doesn't seem to get much harder as you develop, to the point where even on a game with the difficulty set to nightmare, I am having very little trouble with monsters including the large waves that appear every so often once you reach roughly about the 2 hour mark. The other thing I feel that woild make a good improvement would be the ability to switch at somepoint from a standard game to a permant death game, and then be unable to reverse, as following my above comment, it is quite easy to have a dwarf die in the early stages of the game, but once you reach the stage where you have a base up and running with multiple dwarves, the game does become easier, and I think this may reintroduce some of the challange back into the game at a later stage.However as I said these are very minor points, and all in all a very fun game that has plenty of content and is really promising. I highly recommend this game!			"

I can't compare it other games that other reviewers have mentioned, but after 8 hours of play (and several restarts) I can say that I have barely scratched the surface of the crafting system. Dig, craft, build, hunt, fish, fight and farm. This game has lots of fun things to do that should keep you entertained for hours. I haven't really experienced any of the negative things people have said about it, nor have I tried the multiplayer aspect of the game.The game is worth the $20 they are asking, but if get it on sale with the DLC for less than $10 you are getting an AMAZING deal.

												This game is seriously addictive... and it's seriously easy to ""lose time"" with it. If you like builders and ""survival"" type games, you won't be able to stop playing this one. Build your fortress up and discover new recipes to strengthen and improve your equipment... meanwhile, you need to survive. And who REALLY needs sleep, right?			"

Early Access Review
I really want to like this gameThis type of game is something I enjoy. And this game looks like it will become a great game if the developers keep developing it. However, as it stands right now, it has very limited depth. The tech tree seems out of sorts. It's difficult to survive in the beginning due to being unable to build adequate shelter before the first invasion.Invasions get harder as the game progresses. That's great. Except they only get harder in so far as there are more mobs in each invasion. At some point, you will be unable to complete an invasion before daylight. I have all of my guys with maxed out weapons and high levels of experience with them. I have multiple defenseive structures. I still can't complete an invasion. There are other points of contention: Dwarf AI is lackluster at best. Minerals become very rare. Towards the end of the game, it's nigh impossible to gather enough materials to equip you dwarves, much less build grand castles under the mountains. There is no way to automate anything. This includes things like making sure tables are stocked with food. Transit AI is terrible, and in some situations is so broken that you have to manually remove them and replace them in order to get them to work properly.Perhaps in the future, this game will become a fun game to play. Until then, play the first hour or so, and then go find something better than the tedium that is Craft the World.			"

Early Access Review
								Been playing this game nonstop since I got it. Very VERY polished and playable game especially for Steam's notorious Early Access program. This game has more content and is more stable than many indie full releases here on Steam.A mix of Terraria's 2D world with Dwarf Fortress' dwarves and industries along with a dose of Minecraft-style box crafting interface. This sounds awful, but first it's not eye-destroying because the entire game has a hand-drawn art style and not the overdone pixel-y aststyle of games like it. Resources seem to be plentiful but there is definite challenge in the waves of enemies that spawn above ground and you find underground. Defnitely a fun base building game thats easy to get a grasp on and also is easy to make awesome looking bases in. I love it so far, it has a massive tech tree to work through BUT one aspect of the otherwise great UI bugs me to no end. This game has an absolutely enormous amount of objects to put in the hotbar and all of them are only accessible through another menu that is tabbed. So it can take forever to exchange the items you need into the hotbar. Hopefully that issue is fixed before the game leaves Early Access.Otherwise, STRIKE THE EARTH (and spiders, goblins, zombies, etc)			"

Early Access Review
								My ten-hours-in review: it was rough figuring out how things worked initially.  It doesn't explain some important things (like how to build ""shelter"") but if you dig a little online, it's easy to get sorted out, and I believe that the menus will probably be improved.  That being said, once I got the game sorted out after a couple hours of fiddling, I started really enjoying myself.  It's a pretty forgiving game so far, and I've taken quite a shine to my little tribe of dwarves.  I can relax and enjoy the exploration without feeling like one of my guys will get stupid and fall in a lake of fire.  The waves of monsters from time to time have been something of a challenge, but I have yet to see what happens if you get wiped out.  Individual dwarves respawn after a delay when killed.  All in all, it's an enjoyable little time waster, and you like build and explore games, there's a lot to like here.  I heartily recommend it.			"

Basically, think Terraria meets Dwarf Fortress, and you have the game in a nutshell.  173 hours later, I still enjoy playing it.Whether it's fighting a massive wave of undead monsters that's trying to invade your base and kill all your dwarves, or hunting down resources so you can build better stuff for your dwarves, or having to hunt down the pieces for the next portal world, or trying to work out how to get water in the snow world, or even fishing, this game has a lot going for it.

												Probably one of my favorite games on Steam, as evidenced by my time played. Very addicting, the interface is simple, and it is very easy to get things going. There is plenty of room for creativity with base building, and the graphics and audio are pleasant.Multiplayer still needs some work, though the developer has tweaked it since releasing this feature, which indicates they are aware multiplayer needs improvement. On the other hand, single player is where this game shines. My other suggestion for improvement would be a slightly better tutorial. It took me a while in the beginning to figure out how to build a house properly, and there should also be a bit more guidance on how to work the campaign quests (particularly how to beat the first mission, as the others are pretty similar, albeit located in larger worlds/more diverse ecosystems).Wholeheartedly recommend!

												Considering its pricetag when its on sale, i would say that this game is absolutely worth that price considering the hours i spent on it so far.The downsides of it is the really slow and grindy unlock system, it would not be too bad if you only had to do it once, problem is that you have to start over every single time, so far i have not even reached the end of it because it managed to finish the map before it, but if i did went for the end game things i would have been bored out of my mind due to the considerably amount of extra hours needed to get there.So worth getting, but it wont be a new halo 1 so have the right amount of expectations			"

												This game has a lot to offer players of all types. There's a solid story mode, which allows players to acclimate to the game. Then there's the custom mode which allows experienced players to really turn the game into an endless sandbox. If you can imagine it, you can probably make it within this game.A recent event for Halloween changed the game slightly and added a bit of a welcomed twist.As all games do, this one will get old, but it is also one of the games that you'll come back to when you're bored with other games.

I just uninstalled again after reinstalling for halloween.. BEEP IT ALL TO HELL.. GREY HAIRS DUE TO THIS GAME... removed now and I WILL NEVER EVER LOOK BACK AT THIS GAME OR ANY BY THIS COMPANY..November 7, Was very hopefull, seems they did fix a few issues however my Rave review still stands... with only 1 change...  buy it.......  ffs the logic is still BEEPED to BEEPING hell.. they did address it but its still WELL YOU KNOW.. MUCKED...  just lost 8 dummies to a retreat order and for some unknown reason they all ran down in the caves (shelter is in sky with ladder...) and got themselves caught up in 3 leaves with a one eyed beholder type♥♥♥♥♥♥.. so give that a go... ffs... 6-8 hours down drain... gonna restart and realized .. ffs again.. only reason i gave this another go was due to Oct 31 update event patch...........   so ah... DAM IT ALL TO HELL... flippin game.... STILL NEEDS WORK..    That said it is a beepin gem.......July 1...   They completely disregard ""Knowlage""  Zombies are Einstein's compared to these gimp dwarfs. Be Warned they are That Stupid. July 1...  Chops tree 13 times then stops. ponders air, starts again, stops at 13, ponders water. repeat. rinse..  Sadly learned this is a Russian Game. That said.  I EXPECT far better !!! Get on it !June 20  last 3 days crashes alot bout 3 times in 12 hrs.  No need...May 29...   You Have to Babysit major. I did.. I turned my head irl 3 seconds... Death.... was pondering prior is my review to harsh. No it isn't its the TRUTH.  Pass untill fixed.May 25...   1200 plus hours in, yes i love it but no i cant justify you throwing your money away. Great game if not for the Major Major issues which killed it.. this game could be iconic if they fixed the logic system...I GOT TONS OF HOURS IN AND HAVE TO SAY, I LOVE IT BUT I HATE IT... DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! UNLESS ITS $2 OR $3  TOPS!! only then if you think im full of beep... then you know im not.... I Must Stress The Point.....  It Will Beepeeppp you off BAD, Seriously Major, This Is Major Anger In A Cute Little Package.... I do love this game but i can not tell you all enough stay away untill the Logic system in this is fixed. PEOPLE.... ITS BAD..... Started a new game on a harder setting,.... nothing is much harder i mean yeah mobs have more life hit harder.. but thats not hard.. what they done was made it so when dwarfs are doing a task.. they just stop and ponder about nothing more offten, this cancels their orders and they then look for a new task, while doing the new task they stop and ponder again.. repeat this process for all dwarfs with execption to 2 out of 7.. Two of them finish the task, end result lots of wasted time.. i mean really not just in game but irl... who wants to game out so you can have all your commands dismissed with 1 or 2 done here or there...   needless to say as you can see by the long list of beep i have listed below..The game is a gem if somebody actually cared bout quality and the user.... but hey just give em ur dollars.. GREAT Game,  thing is.. one Major Con is....  the dwarfs are so so so stupid... they WILL make your BLOOD BOIL!!! PROMISE!!    Hope devs learn logic and then teach it to the dwarfs.....so i kept at it... i have to give it a MAJOR thumbs down, only cause the dwarfs are so dumbed down.. no need for it what so ever.... really the archer with 1/2 a heart left runs to the boss alone and boy he wont back down ( btw no order to do this...) just a hero with a 1/2 heart, runs in gets killed no need.... and well heck lets everybody do it, so sure thing they all took the Stupid pill... for now shelved and not likely to look back.. update Requires major logic overhall.... PASS unless you want a heart attack or grey hair... honestly i felt bout 6 greys start to form after last gameplay... said beep this... not worth this level of genuine stress.........Yes its a Great Game but it still stands it WILL make your blood boil... devs plz fix....  .....  ......  make portal to save dumb hero fella... yay do this evey game day...... so it lived.. for the next 3-4 mins i had to babysit the portal and any that wanted to be heros to.. no items down there to get.. just heros ....   a very simple fix if your not going to fix the hero code is give us THE OPTION to close the angry portal... so the angry player doesn't have to babysit this thing.... clicking defend base alarm and causing everybody to stop what their doing is not good enough.. remember keep it simple .....d       Devs Note: ""Give user ability to close portal"" Result: Sales - no angry users - no bad reviews... it is a great game ppl just good grief is such an understatement. i do wonder if the devs are 12 years old. im not kidding. if so GREAT JOB, needs work... ;)May 2016 - Elevator causes dwarfs to DIE and thats crap on HARDCORE when your lv 13 and are choped to 10 when your alarm is sounded long ago only they run around mindless and stupid... great game, epic fail on major issues which if fixed this game would be in the Greats...... at this point its sad to not see such fixes yet...

There are still bugs to be worked out (and pathfinding could always be improved), but I am thoroughly enjoying this game.

												I've put in over 30 hours.  I'm not even crafting mithril weapons and armor yet.  Instead, I'm growing wheat to make beer.  The dwarves love beer and consume lots of it.Oh yeah, there is the monster portal that opens every 45 minutes.  Every time I survive, I tell myself I should go to bed.  Next thing I know, there is 7 minutes left until the next portal opens and I've upgraded armor or weapons and think I should try it out...just one more time.The dwarf AI is not great - however, that's part of the charm.  You have to save these guys.  Build signs to deter them or craft doors (and lock them).  I've enjoyed my time in it.  It's fun.  If you like Terraria and/or crafting games, give it a chance.Update:  I'm now over 175 hours into the game.  It's an obsession.  The tech tree is huge - I've built everything and am on the last part of the campaign.  I've learned to hate the ghosts and gargoyles.  They are annoying.  I more than got my money out of this game.  However, I've learned it's not for everyone.  The game can be tedious at times.  You will also get frustrated with the AI - it can make some really poor choices.  You will also hate the damn ghost - I'd like to just turn them off.  I don't see the point.Wish list if there is ever a ""part 2"":-Upgradable tower defenses.  Yes, we have the archer tower and tesla-thing.  I would like more.-What about adding golems?  I wouldn't mind having some that could haul materials, patrol, and perhaps even do some mining.  Once you start crafting silver armor - the game shifts and requires you to mine lots of metals.  I have been giving orders that take 30 minutes or so - I do something else while they are mining.  This is tedious and gets boring.			"

												This game is all in all fun. Every time I start playing it I just keep going and never stop. It's the kind of building game I like where you control a nice amount of characters and they do tasks on they own when you tell what they are. And the fact that it gets challenging is pretty nice too, as long as it doesn't get too hard.But there is this one thing about this game that bothers me a bit. The tech tree. It forces you to make stuff you probably won't even place down at all. Something they could do to make it so you don't have 10+ items in your inventory that won't be placed is to give the shop a sell function or something similar.			"

												Loe Craft the World, easy to play, the crafting and designing your base to stop the raids is great, lots of different ways you can go about getting to the next worlds.			"

												I love this game.  The way you grow on each world can be different.  I usually ignore the tasks.  I treat this as a building game and thoroughly enjoy it.  It has the ability to make me rage when the dwarves do unexpectedly stupid things.  I forgive it each time.			"

												I pirated this game since they have only one or two map to play thinking it would be one time thing.They keep adding more and more stuff in. This is a rare find company these day. ( I'm not joking btw) so I follow this game updateand try it from time to time. it was ... not there yet ( kinda lack replayability)So I bought it when I saw the plan on last update which is multiplayer patch should be okay I think.and try it a bit ....WHAT THE HELL! WHEN DID YOU GET THIS FAR !!Was my first sentence when I saw the content ... ( I really mean it )from that idiot-dwarfs-running-like-headless-chickento not-so-idoit-but-still-do-stupid-pathfinding-dwarfsand all that stuffs in game.what are you waiting ... get it guys!			"

												Excellent game. But it does make bases feel very small and packed in by the end (through my experience).			"

												A good game in general, but make shure to have time in front of you, cause it will suck it all. The paste of the game make it casual but it will also make you skip on your day's chore, be warned.			"

												Interesting concept, helpful developer.Update 2016-02-14 - Developer is still working on the game, updating it, coming up with new maps every once a while. That is good considering like 99% other developers dont even finish their game.			"

												I recomend the game as a pure singleplayer game.It is fun and challenging, and there is loads of stuff you can craft.What i don't get is why they used valueble time on a multiplayer mode that is the worst i have ever encountered, so don't buy it for the multiplayer like i did.You will need some required tec before you can go into multiplayer with someone, and then you get teleported to a new world that can't be saved, tried it once and lost connection to the game server, and we had to start over again.

												Best investment ever for me. The family played this for countless hours (mostly the ipad version). Kids totally love it. My son even brings the ipad to the toilet just to be able to take care of the dwarfs (however he destroys all the beds and tables, because lazy dwarfs spend too much time sleeping and eating instead of working:)			"

												Really nice game, totally worth its price.Nothing really new, but it does what you paid for, and it does it quite well. Although:- The art could be a little bit enhanced (Artworks for loading screen and menu for instance, look a bit cheap).- More music would be nice. You can spend hours on a single map, and just one or two music looping is rapidly annoying.- A better AI for the dwarves would be a great enhancement. I know it's not an easy thing to do, but sometimes, they do some really stupid things like drowning or running into a pack of monsters just to pick up dirt, etc.- But the only real problem i have with this game is the fact that, when you've spent hours and hours on a map (collecting everything you can, maxing you dwarves, creating everything you can) and you go on the next level, you have to start all over from scratch with nothing from the previous map you came from. Even the blueprints of the objects must be unlocked again, and this is really annoying.Still, i've spent about 60 hours on this game so far, so money well spent, and i think the devs love this game enough to make it even better so i'm looking forward the next updates.

												Craft the World was a game I found through a youtuber named Paul. The game is a way better version of Terraria and thats why I love it. The game can get pretty difficult and frusterating. But, what makes up for that is the fact that the dwarves are total and utter ding-dongs. Its hilarious. I love the crafting and building aspect of the game. I wish that the first world in the Campaine was a little bigger. Overall, its a great game and I cant wait to see what kind of things will be added in the future.			"
