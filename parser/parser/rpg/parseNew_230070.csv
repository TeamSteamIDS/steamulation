												I have to admit on first glance this game does not seem appealing due to many factors but after deciding to give the game a go I have to admit it is one of the most broad RPGs ive seen in a long time.To explain what I mean by broad, at the start of the game you chose to play one of roughly 8 classes and then build your character with combat skills and civil skills.For an example you can build a mercenary who is actually a lover not a fighter, an merchant who responds to denial with an axe to the face and many other combinations.One of my favourites is playing a grifter/con man and taking the skills impersonate, streetwise and persuasion.With that character I was roaming around town and conning people into thinking I was the messiah, a noble, a merchant lord, a soldier, an imperial envoy, some friendly stranger and pretty much anything I need to be.Your class and skills dictate how you need to play the game as you cannot be a little of everything, for example with my grifter if I ever went into combat I would die in 2 rounds since he was not well suited for combat.But if I dressed as a bandit, convinced the leader to parley, went to the lord of the area and told him about a possibility to kill 2 birds with one stone then went back to the bandit leader and convinced him to attack an enemy of the local lord getting both sides killed in the process to find the bandit leader still alive in the end begging for his money just to slit his throat makes up for the fact that my grifter couldnt actually fight.This game can be very cruel to people who are the usual goody-2-shoes, in fact the game hates that architype and out right punishes you with unwinnable fights, people backstabbing you every second until you are finally broken and ready to look after yourself and do what you have to do to survive.So if you enjoy Fallout (1 and 2) like games with tons of replayability and many ways to survive be it masquerading, lying, killing, poisoning, backstabbing, talking your way out of trouble or just plain paying other people to do your dirty work then I would highly recommend this game especially if you ever wanted to RP a social character and actually never have to fight anyone in the game.

Early Access Review
								I have to preface this review by saying that I LOVE this game, but chances are 80% of the current gaming population wont like The Age of Decadence. As such its important for anyone interested in this game to have a good idea of what they are getting themselves in for - which is a proper hardcore RPG.Combat is turn based and initially very hard. The creators have tried to recreate the real life danger of fighting and pretty much nailed it. Your fledgling character is able to take on one opponent at the start of the game, but fighting multiple people will more than likely get you killed. Luckily the game has multiple solutions to the problems you will face and combat is not the only path for your character.The game has a good solid story and there are plentiful dialog options which are linked to the social skills of your character. This of course means that you could potentially play through the game as a smooth talking character with minimal combat skill. The game doesn't hand hold you in terms of what you should put your skill points into, but common sense will get you through (eg if your playing a Thief character sneak, lock pick and disguise might be useful..).There are multiple character backgrounds which modify the story including Loremaster, Thief, Assassin, Merchant and so on. Some times the characters overlap at points in the story, so it can be interesting to see things play out from a different perspective. Even though the game is not complete (at the time of this review) the different backgrounds give replayability to the game.Finally the setting is based of post roman collapse, which is a unique setting for this type of game. Don't expect to see spells and magic flying around typical of fantasy RPGs, but there are wondrous items and locations which can be visited from a bygone era in the games lore. Overall if your sick of ""baby's first RPG"" and are hungry for a solid learning curve and dangerous combat in a unique setting I recommend The Age of Decadence.(Note; At the time of writing there are a number of crash issues that the game is experiencing, hopefully everything will be ironed out for the final release).

												I don't normally review games but since Age of Decadence is a bit of a niche title then maybe this will help out.  In short, AoD has been an awesome gaming experience for me and maybe it will be for you too.What you have to realize going in is that AoD has a learning curve -- even if you play a lot of RPGs -- because the philosophy behind it is unusual in today's market.  It's not designed for your character to be good at everything all at once.  Rather, your character is supposed to play a specific role in the style of classic RPGs.There's a basic dichotomy in play here, and it goes like this.  Your character can be a good Fighter or a good Talker -- but not both.At least not on your first few runs.  You may eventually be able to utilize both of these skillsets on a single character -- at least to some degree -- but not until you have a lot of experience with both the combat system and how choices & consequences work in the game world.  Don't try to play a hybrid character in the beginning or you will fail spectacularly.Let me repeat -- if you start out trying to play a character who can both fight and talk, you will get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you.  So pick one or the other and your initial experiences with the game will be much more pleasant.  Now that that's out of the way, let me explain why there is a great game here.  The combat system is very deep and one of the best I've seen.  Your stats and skills have a huge impact on how your character plays, which opens up dozens of possible builds.  Tactical options abound and the encounters are difficult enough that you'll need to utilize every possible advantage.  And one aspect I really appreciate is the ""feel"" of combat -- it's cruel and unforgiving, which is totally appropriate for a post-apocalyptic setting.  You'll have to think and push yourself hard if you want to survive, which to me is really satisfying.The game also offers pathways for ""talky"" characters via the use of skill checks.  With the right build you can charm, manipulate, and scheme your way through the whole game without ever picking up a sword.  It's a much lighter experience than playing a fighter and offers a refreshing take on the RPG genre.The story is good but -- like most other aspects of the game -- different than most other RPGs.  There are seven major factions in the world of AoD, and which faction you choose to align with will have a drastic role in how you perceive and experience the game's events.  You have to play characters from several different viewpoints in order to really get a complete sense of what's going on, which gives replay value beyond what most RPGs are capable of.The last major point of emphasis is the role of choices & consequences.  The world of AoD is harsh and most of its inhabitants will happily cut your throat if it suits their interests.  But if you are smart -- or just good enough at committing violence -- the choices you make can dictate the rise and fall of guildmasters, generals, nobles, and even the supernatural.  You have to work hard to get ahead, but that just makes it more rewarding when you do achieve results.There are a few negative aspects that are worth mentioning.  Technically the game feels rough and unpolished.  This is mostly due to the game engine showing its age, though, and you shouldn't encounter many bugs.  I also think the quality of the faction questlines is a bit uneven.  It's worth playing through them all but there were definitely some I enjoyed more than others.  I can forgive this easily enough because when you have this much content some things are bound to shine a bit more than others.Lastly, there really is no true ""independent"" questline, meaning you can't progress through the game very much if you're not aligned with an existing faction.  It would've been neat to have a way to build your own little empire to compete with the others, but this isn't really a knock on the game -- just a feature that might've been cool.So hopefully this review gives a good sense of what Age of Decadence is like.  The game is innovative, complex, and a lot of fun.  If you're still reading then you're obviously interested, so go ahead and take the plunge.  And remember, you're about to die and we salute you! :)			"

Early Access Review
								In brief: AoD ditches many of the genre long established staples to focus on the roleplaying, and this it does amazingly well; there really is nothing quite like it out there. The EA version is very much playable (there are less bugs than in many releases). The combat, which has been much the focus of attention due to its difficulty, is not awesome, but it gets the job done and it is optional. ***Since for some reason Steam has decided to implement a character limit to user reviews (what's up with that Gabe?), you can read my whole review here: http:// http://steamcommunity.com/app/230070/discussions/0/666827315713399977/ , but below is a very long extract:AoD is a turn based cRPG set in a post-apocalyptic low magic/low tech world. So naturally one might think that this is something like Fallout in a “fantasy” (as opposed to sci-fy) setting. But it’s not and both games suffer from this comparison. So, if it’s not Fallout in a low fantasy setting, then what is AoD? The best way to approach this is by considering that cRPGs tend to be very long games, with the first playthrough taking at least 20-30 hours. A first playthrough of AoD EA version, which according to the devs contains about 60% of the final content of the game, can take anywhere between an hour and 5 hours. However, while in the typical cRPG you see about 80% of the content in the first playthrough, in AoD you see anywhere between 5% and 15%. This has a huge impact on how you are meant to play the game, the importance of which cannot be understated. It took me a long time to realize this, despite warnings from other players and the devs on the forum. You are not meant to constantly save the game and load it when you die or when something goes wrong. If you do this, paradoxically, the game becomes much more difficult and frustrating than it is, particularly when it comes to combat. This is because you can’t compensate through luck “bad” playing character stats, as AoD gives very little margin to luck. The problem is that at first it might seem exactly the opposite, because even though the to hit chances (expressed as a %) are low, you think “if I get a bit lucky with a couple of hits, I can pull this off”. But the outcome is not decided by a few very lucky rolls: you have to be consistently better than your opponent (e.g. not like in Fallout, where you can finish or disable an opponent with a single lucky shot). But, not realizing this at first, you save before a combat and reload when you fail, which you will do again and again. I’ll return to the combat in AoD in more detail later.So how does the game play? Essentially you move your PC around in a fully 3d isometric view. Combat is never automatically triggered; it is always preceded by a dialogue window, more often than not giving you the chance to avoid it. You can talk to NPCs, examine some objects in the environment, or very occasionally pick up “loot” on the map. You don’t “hunt” for containers, checking every pixel for chests, drawers, bag, barrels, etc. You don’t worry about enemies spotting you, you can’t “turn on” sneak, there are no traps, pool of poisonous green goo to avoid, etc. The main view is, so to speak, just a convenient tool for showing how the world is and what is around you, allowing for some exploration and generally getting the character from one place to another. You can also use a map for convenient quick travel, and many times in a dialogue you have the option to appear directly in the place you want to go to. The meat of the game is in dialogues with NPCs, text adventures and combat. As to the dialogues and the text adventures, their outcome depends a lot on PC stats, to a lesser degree on prior game choices and occasionally on equipment. And they are very good! Actually, they are so good that it is very rewarding to play a PC who doesn’t get into a single combat (yes, you can definitely play through the whole game without having any combat encounters at all). They are generally very well written (minor criticism: the swearing arsenal seems limited to the f word, which makes me miss Annah and Morte from Planescape Torment), the NPCs descriptions, motivations and actions are very solid and follow an iron logic action-consequence pattern, the PC has many different options when approaching them and more often than not they allow for a lot of roleplaying and expressing how your PC is. The mechanics themselves are unremarkable, but what AoD manages to accomplish through them is brilliant. A warning though: because the outcome of both dialogues and text adventures is largely determined by skill checks (e.g. you must have a persuasion of 4 to convince an NPC) and as a player you have no way of knowing what level of skill you must have to pass it (it’s not shown in the text and you can’t possibly derive the exact number from the context), at first you might feel very frustrated that you don’t get the best outcome (or even fail, which in some cases means outright dying) because of something so silly and arbitrary. But it’s part of the game design that every PC can only get the best outcome in some cases and that you die a lot. Remember that each playthrough is relatively short; this is not Dragon Age where you invest 50 hours in building a PC. AoD is meant to be replayed many-many times, and the story and the world come together as you replay the game following different paths and failing in many of them . I can’t stress this enough: you gain insight into the story, the NPCs and the setting when your PC fails/dies, thus losing is an integral part of playing AoD.As to combat, as I mentioned earlier, there is very little luck involved. If you face an opponent against whom your stats and equipment compare unfavorably (not in absolute, but relative terms, i.e. your stats and equipment don’t allow you to have an advantage over your opponent) you will lose. Again and again and again. The room for tactics in combat is also quite limited: there is positioning (counterintuitively, this usually means getting yourself into a corner where you are attacked by the fewest number of opponents at the same time), armor, quite a few different attacks (but ultimately not that different between them) and some variations between weapons of the same class and some auxiliary thingies you can use (like nets and alchemy bombs, but not much more, at least in the current version). Breaking it down, I think it would be fair to say that the outcome of combat depends mostly on the stats and equipment, somewhat on tactics, and very marginally on luck. Personally, even though now I feel quite comfortable with combat in AoD (I better, after sinking so many hours into it) and I don’t find it too difficult or frustrating, I’m not thrilled by it. It does get the job done and it’s important to realize that without a very serious investment in AI, the most practical way of making combat hard (as is part of the game design) is to make it dependent on stats and populating the world with opponents with high stats. If tactics played a larger role, a human player would have a huge advantage over the AI controlled NPCs, which would go against the whole philosophy of the game. Fortunately, you can play AoD without ever getting into combat. To avoid it you just have to be cautious in your dialogues and text adventures, which means as a rule of thumb behaving as you would in a real life situation (e.g. if you see some thugs, don’t approach them; if they ask you for money, give it to them). The best thing that can be said about combat in AoD is that it does succeed in making combat a very dangerous business that one should avoid unless very confident about his or her martial skills.

												Very much an old school rpg. No quest markers, lots of (pretty good) dialogue, plenty of stuff to discover. Its turn based combat is pretty darn brutal when you first start playing the game, you need to specialise and learn the system. I can certainly see some people getting frustrated with it and giving up, but it's fairly satisfying once you get the hang of it.Of course, you can build an entirely non-combat character and get through the entire game without ever having to lift a weapon. There's tons of skill and dialogue and reputation based options to use, but again you need to specialise.The game really does change depending on which faction you align with, so it's good for more than one playthrough. It's certainly worth a buy if you like old turn based rpgs. "

												You hear much talk lately about the cRPG revival and I’m fairly confident that The Age of Decadence will come to be counted favorably among that swell and deservingly so. But I don’t think it's enough to just say that we have here another good revival title. Though it's look and feel will be familiar to fans of the genre, The Age of Decadence strains so impressively against the reins of what we have come to expect from a game that it may just land us at the leading edge of new territory.Sure, all of the staples are here. Nice isometric view graphics paint the adventure around you...check. Stat and skill based character creation allowing for a nice variety of playstyles...check. Compelling storyline with strong writing...check. Immersive world lore...check. A world crafted specifically for revealing it's secrets to you as it builds your character into a world saving hero and providing you with believable illusions of consequence...che……..no. No. The world reveals nothing to you for free. You are not a hero or a special snowflake. And you are not pampered by mere illusions of consequences to your choices. You are served very real consequences. And that’s a special thing.The Age of Decadence provides a wonderfully immersive world. And it respects the player enough to not bend that world’s consequences in a way that favors our character. It's a harsh place full of backstabbing, intrigue, and power plays. And the game says, hey player, act as you want and I will show you what happens to a character like yours when they do those things. If you play the role well you may find that you excel in your ventures. Play the role poorly and you'll quickly discover that you’re just another subpar assassin or merchant that gets to die in the gutter like all of the other hack jobs out there whose aspirations outweighed their qualities.The decisions are tough. Make an ally here, create an enemy there. The narrative consequences that unfold due to your actions and choices are, to my knowledge,  unparalleled in gaming. And Age of Decadence does something really fascinating. You WILL NOT see all there is to see in one play through and that is because each faction/alliance playthrough is served it's on unique view into the story that is unfolding. Honestly, I am not one to replay cRPGs but The Age of Decadence compels you to do so. There’s almost a Butterfly Effect in that as you explore these parallel story lines you get to see just how consequential your actions were when you served that other factions interests. There are many ways to play the game but however you play it, you'll want to stay true to that character concept. If you’re a smooth talking merchant that’s avoided physical conflict your whole life honing your silver tongue, then exercise all of the caution that character would when things look like they could get physical. The game isn’t going to coddle your poor decisions. Get in the head of that character and respect the world around him or her in the same ways that they would. Playing a talker, you will learn very little about how combat works. Play a physical character and you will be playing a whole new game as you plumb the depths of the rewarding combat system.  The Age of Decadence won’t be for everyone. It's unforgiving nature will be a downer for some. But if you like the idea of real choice and consequences, richly written dialogue and plot, and a gritty brutal setting...then you owe it to yourself to give it a try. And there’s a demo, so try that first!			"

												I've had this game on my radar for a while and purchased during the last Steam sale. Recommended for fans of the genre with some caveats (ergo, on sale). + Well written...really well written. + Interesting new world story-wise, complete with history. + Skill tree: you will need every skill point. + Can go minimal combat without having to sneak/stealth.+ Combat is very challenging. + Alchemy; not just a an add-on, but necessary to kill without strong combat skills/weapons/armor. + At times I needed AoD or went through withdrawal. + No grinding or fetch quests.- Graphics: weak to beging with; tiny character portraits removes immersion, makes it feel like a text adventure game.- Controls for navigation: frustrating moving around towns due to having to rotate, blocked by buildings, etc. - Crafting: I couldn't get a schematic to craft anything I couldn't easily buy (crafting skill 6)- Cannot win the game unless certain skills at certain levels. The game ended abruthly and was very unsatisfying; I didn't have enough skill points to overcome the lore/crafting failures needed to progress (lore 7, crafting 6, but even lore 8 insufficient; had I known this, I wouldn't have spent skill points on block or critical and probably not crossbow). - Music: monotonous, limited; the main town has a track about 20 seconds long that loops endlessly; nearly drove me mad.- Too chaste. AoD world is full of mature content...but sexuality/senuality curiously missing. 7/10 Would kill the Crossbow Kid again.  "

												If you're up for a challenge and like text-driven narratives this might be one of the best cRPG-experiences in a long while. While Wasteland 2, Pillars of Eternity and Divinity: Original Sin has played a big part in the resurrection of the cRPG-genre, Age of Decadence has long since carved out it's own path. Make no mistake, this is a niche game that's sure to be overlooked by many.In Age of Decadence your actions will have, often dire, consequences. Your choices DO matter and they will shape the story, characters and locations. There's a sense of satisfaction in persuading one of your enemies to ambush a third common enemy, thus securing a location for one of your allies. There's a feeling of dread when a dangerous situation is about to get out of hand and the only option left is to fight for your life. There's a sense of accomplishment when you finally realize the use for an old artefact. Such sensations are rarely present while playing modern RPG:s and it alone should be the reason to try out Age of Decadence. Granted it's not the best looking game, neither is it particularly welcoming to new players. Actually, even hardcore cRPG-players will have a hard time grasping how Age of Decadence is meant to be played. If you think even for a second that your wealthy merchant will be able to talk his way out of an ambush in the slum district just because you've maxed out your charisma and persuasion skills you'll be sorely disappointed.Play this game as you would if you were actually an assassin, mercenary, loremaster, trader or diplomat and you are a lot more likely to succeed. Of course you can still play as a tough merchant, but then you'll have to actually commit to that role. Carrying all that cash in your pocket while visiting a dangerous part of town without (or with...) escort is usually a bad idea.Now, enjoy a well-written story with enough branching storylines to make your head spin. And don't feel bad when you die in the first fight. It's an achievement after all.			"

												I had something else written here beforehand but it was more of a funny anecdote than a review so I put an actual review here instead.(so the helpfulness statistics probably isn't going to be too accurate)Age of Decadence is a great cRPG(I personally consider it the best) but it offers something very different than what is usually expected in the cRPG genre.The sort of a default experience one expects when he loads up a new RPG is to make his dream hero character and go on a great, at least, 50 hours long journey during which he achieves everything possible in the game and then he turns the game off and plays maybe once or twice more in the future. This is not the approach that one ought to enter the world of AoD with because it's a game structured mostly on interactivity and replayability. A single playthrough might not see more than a 6th of the total content the game offers. I'll try to illustrate why this is so.Every character is given a 'main quest' which basically boils down to 'find the ancient temple'(not the most interesting hook but please keep reading) but most of the game and narrative content are explored through various 'faction quests' given by organisations that the player character can join. There are altogether 7 of these 'factions': The Imperial Guards(or the army), The Merchant's Guild(think less trading and more political manipulation), The Thieves Guild and The Assassin's guild on top of those there are 3 Noble Houses which you can join and work for.These questlines are exclusive so a character which works for the Imperial Guards doesn't have access to the quests offered to for example the Assassins’ guild and so most of the game's content will be not shown to any given character by design. There is also the fact that most(okay all) of the questlines offer various ways of progressing through them depending on the skillset of your character s.Your faction allegiance also isn't rigid that you pick at the start of the game and are stuck with until the end, there is plenty of opportunities to switch sides if you feel that the current situation doesn't suit your character enough.Thus there is plenty of fun to have with every single character but the game can only be truly experienced and enjoyed if given multiple playthroughs.Another important thing to consider with this game is that it's more than possible to make a bad character.(this is mostly related to combat) AoD has a combat and character construction system that you have to master in order to defeat the game, it's not a really a hard system to master but you might throw a few potential characters into the bin straight away as you start up.Good advice for attribute and skill point distribution is to be conservative and focus on only a few(2-3) skills. Most every situation can be solved in various ways so if you plan for you character to be a talker you can safely ignore combat stats and if you plan to only fight you can safely ignore some of the more social skills like 'persuasion' and 'streetwise'.(hybrid characters are possibly and rewarding however such concepts are best tried after having played through the game at least once or twice to get a taste for it)The combat itself is a single unit turn based(squares) game with various weapon types and various attack types and two distinct defence attributes(dodge/block) each with it's own benefits and drawbacks. Combat is also affected by skills like crafting(which offer higher quality equipment) and alchemy for various poisons, performance enhancing drugs and bombs. It's based around action points. Which means that you have a given pool(decided by your attributes/armour) and various actions(including movement) cost various amounts of action points.Success in combat encounters is decided by the stats and skills your character has and your creative use of tactics with roughly 60-40 in favour of the first measure in an average combat encounter.There is also a demo avalible so you could try that out before buying the game to see if you like it.

												This is the RPG I've always wanted without knowing it. My character has toppled two major governments without conflict, but once followed a crooked merchant down a dark alley for a ""great deal"" and was mugged to death. Soldiers ask me to go clear out raider camps and I say ""no"" because it turns out taking on a group of armed enemies is dangerous. I scored major INT and SPEECH successes, convincing a military commander I knew of his plot without proof-so he immediately had me killed. I screwed over everyone in my relentless pursuit of first part of quest, so was friendless, alone, and doomed trying to finish it.If like me your favourite parts of Fallout were [SPEECH 90] and [SCIENCE 95], Age of Decadence is the game for you.(Just save a LOT. There's no shame in quick-loading back in time when you're still learning that this game Means It).  "

												A great and unique RPG. The closest thing I can think of are those CYOA gamebooks, or a western version of Way of The Samurai, with a complex turn-based combat on top.The complete opposite of Skyrim - where even a dumb orc can be Archmage of Winterhold -, Age of Decadence presents a coherent and realistic world, where you must weight your decisions carefully, based on your strengths and weakness. This is the first game that when thugs asked me for a toll to get through a street, I actually payed instead of just killing them all, because even one thug could easily kill my merchant.It's a dangerous world out there, not a pandering power-fantasy like most RPGs, and you'll have to use all your skills just to stay alive, and even more to actually succeed. Sometimes backing away from a tough fight, or walking away empty-handed will be your only escape from a gruesome death. Obviously it's not a game for everyone, but those looking for a challenging game that doesn't threat you like a baby will be more than pleased. It's hard to take other RPGs seriously after playing Age of Decadence.			"

												As far as isometric role playing games, this one is not your father's Baldur’s Gate. I actually found it very easy to slip into the role of my character. You are not a great fighter who is going to change the world with your sword. You are a complete novice in whatever role you play. While you can make your character great and able, you alone are not going to move the mountain with your shoulder and sword. Deep thought, craftiness, and planning are absolutely necessary for the end game. You will restart this game more than once when you hit that brick wall of the fight you just can’t win. Virtue means very little in this game. A grafter with a swift tongue can move just as fast as an assassin with a swift blade. The right points in conversation and skills can assist more than the best gear. Attention to detail is an absolute lifesaver.  "

												*painful sigh* Ok. I really, really wanted to like this game. I accepted all the warnings with anticipation. No kid gloves. Realistic expectations. An RPG like old school pen and paper. I toiled on making the right charcater for me, going through enough of the starting scenarios to learn enough to get really psyched about the whole thing. It's a great concept indeed. A true challenge and a game that does not require a meathead approach. Then I started clocking the hours into it. And my mounting frustration did not have anything to do with the difficulty. I began to feel like a human pachinko ball, cascading through skill checks and attribute checks that required I reload failures according to the pre-arranged paths according to the rolls. Something was definitely off here. When I went for a really persuasive loremaster, I died or failed. When I went along the game's path and waited for the right checks according to the guides online before spending points and reloaded failed attempts, I got through. It didn't take long to realize I had no desire whatsoever to play a game like this-- the only way through is if you become the devs' ♥♥♥♥♥. Rigid and at times arbitrary and cruel difficulty is not challenging and fun, it's simply masochistic. I might as well go play minesweeper and not waste so much time realizing my character is suddenly gimped. Why would the devs and everyone who plays this recommend only a few skill lines and then once you start playing have to spend precious points on each skill roll your chosen quest line requires? This makes no sense! The reason old pen and paper RPGs work is because of some flexibility on the part of the GM. Who ever sat in a D&D game and set their skill points as the rolls came up ever? This game was a noble attempt at something new, but I am done with it for now. I have ragequit other titles before, but this is just sadness.			"

												Age of Decadence is a turn-based RPG set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland that is based on a technologically advanced Roman Empire that suffered a cataclysmic event due to the influence of extra-planar beings.  It's also one of the best games I've played in close to 30 years of gaming.  This game reacts to your choices in a way very few games do.  If you help one noble house, you risk alienating another.  And this has consequences that affect the ending you get, the quests you receive and your path through the game.  All of this adds to replayability and to see the whole game you will have to playthrough multiple times.  Each playthrough should take about 10-20 hours depending on how thorough you are.This is also a game that gives you multiple options to get through a quest.  One of the early quests in the game gives you the task of investigating an archeological dig that is being conducted by a rival house.  You are given multiple options with how to resolve this quest:You can fight your way through.You can find who is supplying food to the guards at the dig and convince them to poison the food.You can convince some raiders from another quest to attack the dig, killing two birds with one stone.You can impersonate someone that the guards at the dig are waiting for and infiltrate the site.You can side with the other house and assist them with the dig.You can ignore the quest completely.Note that while all of these options are available (and I might have missed a stealth option), not all of these options are available to every character.  The game demands that you specialize and while specialization will open some solutions and quests, it will close others.  For example, the character who specializes in negotiation and diplomatic skills to convince the raiders to attack the dig, will not have the combat skills to fight their way through the guards.  That means that the combat heavy quests, like becoming a gladiator, will be closed to that character.  The combat in this game is fairly challenging.  You will only control one character in the game, although you may have NPC allies, and most of the time you are badly outnumbered.  Combat is turn-based and you action points that you spend for actions like movement and attacking.  Different attacks have different action point costs and you target specific locations for various effects, e.g. you can attack an opponent’s legs to make them easier to hit.  The penalties you impose on your enemies with these attack stack and you also have special attacks with consumable items like nets, flasks of Greek-fire and grenades.  The enemies also have these abilities and they use them fairly effectively.  This means that combat can have a snowball effect, e.g. you might be fighting an opponent who you can defeat quite easily, then they land a lucky leg hit against you, which lets them land another and soon you are defenseless and being torn apart.  While you can use this snowball effect to your advantage, because you are outnumbered it tends to be to your disadvantage more often than not.  This is really a game where one bad roll can lose you the battle, while I like this, I can understand how it would be frustrating to many players.While the game is well written and offers many paths through the game, there is a sense of diminishing quality as the game progresses.  The second town for example feels very empty compared to the first town, and the game feels a little rushed towards the end.  There are also two stories going on simultaneously, there is a civil war and the exploration of the ruins.  The stories are linked, but the skills you need to explore the ruins might not be the skills your character needs to support their faction in the civil war.  Such a character will end up missing half the game on their playthrough.The game is also not without some bugs.  While I have not encountered any game-breaking bugs, I have encountered updates to quests that cannot be completed, or characters forgetting some of the things that I have done.  However these bugs are few and far between.Synopsis: if you liked Fallout 1 and 2, Wasteland 2, or just a good story driven RPG, give this game a try.  However, this is not a game where you can do everything in one playthrough, so be prepared to playthrough it a couple of times if you want the whole story. "

												You're not playing the way you want to in this game; you are playing the way you must do to succeed. That is, you're not role-playing your character, rather you're manipulating your character's stats once you've found out through trial and error what stats your character needs to have to progress.For example. One scenario for the thief is to ambush a caravan. If you want to avoid a fight you need to convince your boss to trick the delivery into rerouting. But if you take that option, you, the lowest member of the thieves guild, has to have enough lore to personally forge the papers. So, to do your job, you need at least level 3 in sneak, theft, lock-pick, persuasion and now lore. You need high thieves skills to steal the signet ring later on but you have to dilute your skills to pick up lore, which is way out of your skill set. Advanced level thieves might also be forgers but not the guys working the street for goodness sake. What you end up doing here is repeatedly restarting this scenario with different skill arrangements to find the one that actually works. This is not an RPG, this is a trial and error, skill-search mini-game.The alternative, the combat scenario, requires you to have high enough combat skills to take on five mercenaries in full armor, with shields and military grade weapons while you're in a T-shirt attacking them with a knife. Granted you've got four friend with crossbows, but you've at least got to take on one of these guys; maybe two or three at once. Reload, reload, reload hoping for a string of lucky rolls is how this scenario is done.This is why this game is frustrating rather than, say, difficult. You either do the skill-search mini-game or the RNG combat lottery. Neither one of which is fun. Granted, the combat is skill-based, but with these sorts of combat scenarios, it is the RNG that will determine the overall outcome. Apparently, if you get really good at it, that is not true. But getting to that level, it sure is.On top of this, there are actually very few quests. There are a bunch of alternatives, but any given character type has only a few that they can reasonably do. A smooth-talker, for example, cannot do the heavy combat scenarios. Nor vice versa. And aside from the quest givers, some merchants and a few thief targets, the rest of the population are mannequins. Exploration is minimal and the game is on rails.Clearly, a lot of people think that this game is great, but be warned: to have fun in this game you have to fit that niche.Not recommended. "

												I've been following Age of Decadence since around 2008 and have been greatly looking forward to playing it. When it comes to video games, I seem to completely share the same opinions and tastes as the lead designer; I'm a bit of a fanboy of his so that only increased my hype.I've enjoyed playing it, but I do have numerous issues with the game. I completed this game soon after release and was planning to only submit this after having played it several more times and editing in additional thoughts, but I haven't had the time to do that so I'm just going to post this review as is, though I will probably end up adding additional thoughts whenever I get around to playing it more (and I expect my opinion of certain aspects such as the story to improve after spending more time with non-combat characters). The following review might contain minor spoilers.Story, Writing & QuestsI found the writing and story pretty good but if I'm honest I expected better. Some parts, especially Ganezzar, feel very rushed to me. The ending is unbelievably abrupt and anti-climactic. The choices and consequences weren't as frequent or as important as I expected from Vault 'Choices and Consequences' Dweller; it seems like the biggest choices are right before you see a story slide, which I think should be secondary to in-game effects. If I side with a faction, I want this choice to affect me; perhaps if I betrayed them, they send assassins after me or something in the next town over? Things like that. But the consequences were rarely there from what I could tell.  Half the reputation systems aren't ever checked so are literally pointless and the other half are checked infrequently.There wasn't as much to do in cities as I would've expected; if combat was as easy as it is in, say, Fallout 1/2, I think the game would go by WAY too quickly. Certainly could've done with more quests and I hope that they add some more in the next 3 months of development.Combat & Skill systemMany people claim that the combat is too difficult. It's not uncommon for people to struggle to get past the first fight and it's recommended that you restart with different builds until you find the right one. This wasn't necessary for me, and I found every fight apart from two quite manageable. Occasionally there would be a fight that I couldn't do right away, but going away for a bit and doing a few quests to get some skill points and then returning solved that. The only two fights I had severe trouble with were the Aurelian Outpost, which I'm pretty sure wasn't possible with the character build I had at the time, and an end game fight that I'm not sure is even possible for anyone to win.So overall I thought the difficulty was good. Not too difficult, not too easy. You have to reload regularly but it doesn't get to absurd levels. Even if you do have to reload a bunch of times, it never bothered me much because you're very quickly back into the action. I tend to only get frustrated in games where there's needless tedium, such as in Dark Souls where you have to constantly, needlessly, run back to the challenging part through a bunch of weak enemies, which to me seems as though they might as well give you a maths problem to do before you can get through the fog door. It doesn't add anything. That said, I was disappointed with the tactical elements. I was playing an assassin with a dagger (speaking of daggers, I got a steel dagger in Teron (I believe) and not ONCE did I ever find an opportunity to upgrade it throughout the rest of the game. Unique and high quality metal shields, hammers and swords coming out my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but not a single good dagger. Why?) and high dodge with some critical strike added to the mix. I very rarely found any reason to use anything other than Arterial Strike. As far as I can tell, the only reason to use anything else is if 1) you don't have enough AP (I had 12 AP, so for me that only occurred when I had moved the same turn), 2) the opponent is lightly armoured (so, like, <10% of enemies?) or 3) the opponent was really hard to hit. There wasn't a reason to use other aimed attacks from what I could tell, I tried them out but I'd rather do 10-15 damage than cripple their AP very slightly for a few turns. I thought Aimed: Torso might be useful so 100% of my dagger's damage wouldn't be absorbed like it is with every attack apart from Arterial Strike, but no; that too was much worse than Arterial Strike. Numerous skills, such as Traps, seem to be really underutilised.Personally, I think that you get too few civil skill points. Combat skill points are fine, no need to increase those, but as an assassin I would've liked to have been able to have felt like a more competent one who could do more than just fight. I feel like the design limited my character too much and I would've liked to have been decent at Streetwise, Lockpick, Sneak and Impersonate, all skills I'd associate with an assassin. Presumably the reasoning for not giving more is to encourage replaying with other builds, so this is somewhat understandable.Technical IssuesGraphically the game isn't a champ, but that's no surprise from a small indie team with a low budget. Some areas managed to look quite nice and had a good artistic vision, such as the monastery.I had dozens of crashes throughout my playthrough, some of which happened JUST as I beat a fight I had been reloading on for awhile, which was rather frustrating. At times the game would randomly decide to crash before I could get to the menu screen over and over, so I had to close Steam and start is as admin before it would work. The next day, that fix didn't work so I had to directly launch AoD.exe as admin. At one stage, in Ganezzar, the game stopped recognising my saves and started listing them as 'beta saves' and a lot of them got corrupted all of a sudden. That could've been the end of my playthrough right there, but luckily I save like a mad man and had a suitable backup from 20-30 minutes ago that didn't get corrupted. A few times when starting fights or going into buildings, enemies would be invisible and I had to reload to fix it.At one stage, I failed a Dexterity check despite having 10 Dexterity. There were some other really minor niggles like a few typos here and there; surprisingly the very first line spoken to you when you start as an assassin had a typo! I know how difficult it is to test these things and make the game run well on all systems, so I don't consider these issues much of a big deal.ConclusionOverall this review has sounded quite negative, but that's a problem I have where I don't know how to review anything other than by pointing out its flaws and going from there. I enjoyed AoD, I think it's easily the best RPG in years and MUCH better than recent games like Pillars of Eternity. Any fan of classic isometric turn-based CRPGs needs to play this game. I'm really glad that Iron Tower Studio is going to continue making games and I will definitely be buying any of their future games including the upcoming  AoD dungeon crawler.			"

												It's hard for me to recommend this game more; it was basically everything I wanted out of an RPG.Difficult, deadly combat?  CheckNo way to complete everything in one sitting?  CheckStory with multiple angles and endings?  CheckRealistic low-fantasy setting?  CheckI don't think I've managed to weasel a good ending out of this game yet.  My character always dies in obscurity, marginalized by his political opponents despite his heroic deeds.  As it should be.			"

												One of few games of late where you can actually mess up so badly you can't finish the game, it's refreshing really.You could say Age of decadance is a constant stat check , seeing if you have what the situation merits to succeed and it's true, it is however easy to start over again and try different aproaches, making this game pretty interesting as consept.I really looked forward for this release and as I already liked the UNFINISHED game, I am sure I won't have to even play it yet to know it's good.Now then, time to go die, again :=)Man I have waited for this one ^.^			"

												There hasn't been an RPG since 90's where your character's skills and attributes mattered so much during the game. It is a paradise for people who love to metagame, try and fail, try again and succeed and love to search for hidden content like pieces of lore, character bits, easter eggs, hard skill checks and hidden endings. It is an utter terror for people who are used to games with flat difficulty curve and being rewarded without struggling for reward. It is actually a game where Steam achievements are something you wear proudly like medals for your survival.Developers also tried hard to squeeze as much as possible from Fallout's turn-based combat and actually succeeded. For a system where you control only one character and have just a handful of action points, while also constantly facing multiple enemies at once, it has surprising level of depth to it due to unique attacks, huge arsenal of weapons (none of which are completely unplayable, although some being easier to handle), consumables (which are essential for your survival in this game) and small mechanical features (like weapon and armor Hardness, critical hits and such).While visuals of AoD are outdated, many locations are actually very atmospheric and writing and music make up for that.There are, however, some things that drag the game down and make what could have been a marvel into flawed gem.The first one is that engine is outdated and game is not systemic, not even on a level of, say, first Fallout, or Ultima's, Arcanum or Deus Ex. Most of the things are done via text quests instead of player actively trying out and combining skills and objects inside the game by mouse. Pressing [TAB] will reveal most active spots around character and then it's just a matter of having right skills or items, as your options are clearly presented to you as a list.It makes game especially easy as talker-character, as you can completely avoid combat via skill checks, while in other games it's usually challenging because you have to use things like stealth, spells or know game very well to make a ""pacifist"" run.Game tries to subvert this sometimes as there are decisions that are not obvious, like switching factions, or some dialogues actually make you pay attention as you get bonuses to skill checks if you choose right answers, but first depends on how well particular quest line is written, and latter is only used rarely, so there are no text quests turning into actual puzzles like, for example, in Space Rangers.This makes game a lot more reactive than proactive, which is why exploring ancient sites and finding hidden endings and easter eggs become more fun later after game held your hand during some of the guild quests.Developers continue to try and fight this by adding even more skill checks where it is appropriate and providing players with even more options, but without proper systems it is an uphill battle and creates a huge cluster**** of scripts and variables that are hard to perfect.Second thing that can't but make you sigh during big battles is, of course, that you can only control one character. Sure, it has been set in stone, probably from development day 1, but still... There are so many weapons and builds you can try that it would require many playthroughs to run them all, and even with a party of 3 characters, combat would become a lot more tactical and require less metagaming - as for now many battles require you to have a particularly high defensive skill or good armor to even stand a chance to survive first round or two and make use of your options.It also makes many battles a chore to replay, as in some of them your impact is small and sometimes allies can win battle for you.And third thing which is a mixed bag is, of course, the writing.It is a mix of genuinely interesting politicking and exploration, memorable characters, constant betrayals and your character trying to prove himself, encyclopedic lore dumps, cool plot twists and viperous pragmatism, Roman decorations, characters interpreting history, characters forgetting their history, characters making new history and **aliens** (hands gesture).Game writing begins resembling someting like Roman ""Thieves World"", dabbles into politics and then suddenly makes and awkward jump into ancient technomagic and makes every character rush for a search for deus ex machina, which can change everything you did, thus seemingly cancelling that what I thought to be main idea behind design of the game and also behind every good plot - cause and effect.It is particularly boring and banal to read ancient history through various journals and consoles that suddenly manifest in large numbers during endgame, instead of trying to figure it through interpretations of people who live here and now like in the beginning of the game.But my own personal gripe with story of AoD is that it doesn't do Roman setting justice it deserves. There is some ""Rome"" in Praetor story, but not enough for me. I was waiting for flavourful descriptions of deaths of ancient rulers (with their eyes replaced with sapphires and liquid metal mixed with **** poured over their heads - just like in my friend's favorite book!), political marriages, conflicts between free people and slaves (and of course me buying slaves for my own protection and leisure), but probably the most ""Roman"" story in the game happened not with me, but with a wonderful scumbag Miltiades, who did in the game things that I wanted to do myself. It is always bit sad when NPCs do cooler stuff than you, and it's not even particularly epic stuff.With all that said, I invested 100+ hours into the game. And unlike many other games where these hours are generally repeating same stuff, reading same text, meeting same characters, in AoD very often you will find yourself doing completely different things. Even combat builds change the way you play and battles you choose, and of course there is a ton of hidden and locked content in the game waiting for persistent players to find.It is a joy of a game with completely different, no-bul**** approach that doesn't work in compromises, and you either accept that and try, struggle and win, or... good ****ing riddance.

												If you rolled dice and made choices when pressured by a great DM...Remember using #2 pencils to fill out character sheets (and later the custom character sheets of your friend's crazy homebrew pnp RPG)...Have fond memories of the old SSI DnD games... hell, maybe even the brutal as hell dungeon crawler Shadows of Yserbius from the old Sierra Network...Played Baldur's Gate II more times than you're willing to publicly admit, but... yeah, after the 5th time of knowing how to go God Mode, you just do it for the story, not the combat or challenge...Listen to me. Simply pick this up. NOW.IMHO, this came out just in time to be the sleeper hit RPG of the year. Talking sleeper hit on the original X-COM level that had major publications scrambling to cover it and sing praises as not to be left behind.If you are, as other reviewers said: ""easily enraged"", become frustrated easily, prefer action-focused-mindless-clicking-rpg-lites, and/or lack the patience to revisit something like Planetfall or Zork (or one of those people that rapid clicks through talk bubbles and cutscreens because, ""you ain't got time for that"") you may want to avoid this like the plague.Mature, gritty, brilliantly written, amazing NPCs that are all unique with their own motivations you will come to love, hate and a mixture of both (no spoilers, but those from early access may remember a certain ""friend"" and all the ""favors"" for the *cough* ""big pay day."" Oy vey... that guy man, THAT GUY!)Will end with my favorite aspect of this game that makes me weep tears of wonderful joy over the butthurt it delivers: Act ouf of line, get a little too certain of yourself, try that BS you can pull off in other games [*cough cough* RPG-lites] where you act like a big dog, picking fights with everyone? LOL, yeah... good luck with that ""hero."" I was forced to taste my own tears many times by this game, and every time it was a delicious and nutritious reminder of what a real RPG is. PeriodOpen up a dictionary and look up, ""HARDCORE RPG"" and the picture you'll see henceforth is AGE OF DECADENCE!*looks down at thumb buttons* Do I recommend this game?

												Let me give you a rundown of an encounter in Age of Decadence:I sneak into a palace and fight a centurion. It takes me a few tries, but I manage to kill him. Before it lets me save, the game immediately takes control and puts you back into ""choose-your-own-adventure"" mode. Apparently I take his armor and put it on, because the game has decided that that's what my character should do, and now I am presented with two options: either I can go kill another guard blocking my path, or I can try to convince him that I am his superior. I don't really want to do either of these things, what I want to do is run away since I need to go heal, but whatever. I choose the option to critical strike...Oops! Wrong choice! Your critical strike skill isn't high enough so you instantly die! (Disregard the fact that I've put four points into critical strike.) The game proceeds to make some asinine comment about its own bad design, not recognizing the irony, and you're sent back to the main menu. For some reason I decide to fight the centurion again and try the impersonation option. Who knows why I can't SNEAK? the thing my character is good at? but whatever. Maybe if I choose impersonate, I'll at least be GIVEN A CHANCE to fight this guy. Click impersonate -> failed -> two slides later where I have no choice, ""YOU HAVE DIED""The writing in this game is fine, the music is pretty good, but this is problem is not just restricted to this particular scenario. It's everywhere. When I first played the beta, I recall getting to a point in the second city where I had no choice but to start over because I hadn't put enough points into my dexterity stat during character creation. What kind of game design is this? The developer's terrible attitude towards the community also doesn't help. All criticism is met with the reply, ""Oh, you think the game is too hard? You just want to go in and win? That's not how real life works!"" Which, barring the fact that we're playing a mediocre indie game, is so ridiculous in a game with a save and reload system. That design philosophy might very well be viable in a tabletop RPG, but it makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense here. The only thing that making me restart the entire ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game because I can't see the future in order to know what the developers have arbitrarily decided is the right stat for the right situation is making me do is WASTE MY TIME. Those requirements aren't even based on how hard a task is! They're based on how far you into the game! WHO THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA?I guess I have to touch on the fact that the game's ""super realistic ultra-hard 100% PROBABILITY BASED COMBAT"" is just a waste of time. You can do the same encounter that should be easily in your favor five times in a row and lose them all because your character forgot how to use his shield, but win a 3v1 because of a lucky crit. It's awful.This game could be extremely good and I was looking forward to its release for years. It's not. Don't buy it. (awaiting incoming developer defense, because arguing with people on forums will really help make your game better. Maybe you should fix the issues instead?) I can't believe anyone would give it a thumbs up.			"

												A year ago I wrote some thoughts about the game, and with twelve months' reflection, I am even more confident that AOD is special.Here's the conclusion:The Age of Decadence is a great game. Like the Watts Towers or the 15,000-page-long illustrated novels of Henry Darger, it is startling, superhuman, almost inhuman in its ambition and novelty. When one attempts to break it into the various categories by which games are typically reviewed (e.g., stability, audio-visual qualities, writing style, fun factor), there is room for debate as to whether it is a good game. But that is merely another way of saying that—inspired though it may have been by games like Fallout and especially Arcanum—The Age of Decadence has broken the mold. It is not fully amenable to the metrics we typically use to measure games because so many of its qualities are so unusual.It will take time to judge whether Weller has succeeded in the goal I’ve imputed to him: opening our minds to a kind of gameplay that we forgot, or forsook, or believed impossible. But no one could have shouted louder, or longer, or more passionately in that cause than he has. Weller deemed The Age of Decadence worth 11 years of his life, worth abandoning his successful career as a businessman. You should deem it worth $30 and a few hours of your time, though perhaps you will find yourself lost in its world for far longer.http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MarkY/20151125/260268/The_Fanatic_and_His_RPG.php "

Early Access Review
								Do you have a death wish? If so, you've come to the right game!I've played a fair amount of the Age of Decadence (AoD), having been one of the first beta-testers for the title (most of my playtime are with non-STEAM builds). And I've died. Oh how I've died.To make things plain, AoD is not a game you'd play when you want to go on a conventional videogame ""powertrip"". It's not a game you'd play when you want to play a hero. It's not a game you'd play when you want to play an ubermensch. In this game, your character is but one choice from death at pretty much all times.AoD is a RPG with turnbased combat. It features a very deep and quite broad RPG system. Choices & consequences is the name of the game here, playthroughs vary *wildly* from one another. With the pre-requisite that you'll get your hands dirty, this game features very different ways to go through the game. On one hand, you can choose to play something like a Mercenary, killing your way through the game. Very, very hard (choosing the combat path in this game is *the* difficult choice interestingly enough) but very doable. Or, you can play a slimy Merchant, bribing and persuading your way through the game without ever entering combat.This heavy emphasis on choice is why I adore AoD. There is a *true* sense of your character forging your way through the world. Even if you happen to fail a certain skill check and screw a situation for your employer when working for one of the guilds, chances are the game will still allow you to continue though the guild and gameworld will likely remember what you've done.The turnbased combat may feel slightly clunky at first due to how it looks and ""feels"". But here is a combat system that actually has some immense depth to it, *if* you have the patience to go through the trial-by-fire where you'll die over and over. Encounters are crafted carefully and to provide immense challenge. Not to mention that your character is just another piece of the game's board. You're not special, you're not more powerful than anyone else. You're just another dude who happens to excel at a few things (depending on your skill choices) and so is everyone else. In another game, you'd scoff at the group of thugs threatening you in the slums. In AoD? You'd best be damn well prepared if you're gonna take on *any* group of people. My main critique of the gameplay is that, since so much of the game is driven by your characters' skill choices, you can quite easily get into a situation where you're just just shy of one measly point of Persuasion to get through that particular problem, but... you may have no way to get that point. And the other options can likely lead you into death (especially if you're not prepared for combat). It feels rather ""strict"". And while I actually like that in many ways, I do hope and think there will be a balancing pass on the game before it's final release. Hopefully ""loosening up"" some of the requirements without making the game casual or easy.The game relies heavily on its writing with most of its non-combat gameplay missions taking place in very elaborate ""text-adventures"". If you don't like to read, this is not the game for you.The game's writing is very good and quite harsh. There are no goody-goody characters here, and it's rough world. Characters will lie to you and screw you over. But the good news is, you can lie to others and screw them over as well!The game's length will vary a *lot* depending on how you play. Combat is the most time-consuming tasks. Battles can take a fair amount of time. If you choose to go a route where you are diplomatic and avoid combat, the game-length will also be shorter.That said, one of the main *points* behind AoD is the replayability. If you don't want to replay the game, using different builds and seeing different solutions, then it's not a game for you.The game is currently in early access and has a few months left of development. The game is made up of 3 big city locations (with various smaller locations scattered around) and the final big city is about to be released in a rough, beta form to the public. There is still plenty of things to do and experience in the game but it is not currently ""complete"" so to speak.If you want to be challenged by a RPG, and if you like old-school design and feel, then AoD might just be worth it for you. For me, it has filled a niche that no other game has done yet (even right now with Kickstarter projects and indie-games being as prominent as they are), it is truly a special game that I've grown to love, despite the many kicks in the balls it has given me.I'd highly recommend it for people looking for a more hardcore RPG experience. But to be on the safe side, you can give the demo a try as well! "

												I've only played the release version, but am having a grand time. The simplest comparison to gameplay I can think of is Fallout 1. Turn-based combat, skill-checks in dialogue and encounters, and an in-depth weapon/targeting system. To be clear, this game has MORE depth in skill-checks and weapon/targeting than Fallout 1 did. This is not a copy of things gone by, but an improvement and expansion on some of the ideas. The character screen forces lots of choices on you, and it is refreshing to NOT be able to do everything with your PC. If this kind of gameplay sounds fun to you, then wholeheartedly recommend. Obligatory ""bugs"" warning/comment: I have not encountered any bugs at all in 10 hours of gameplay. I know, it is almost unheard of in this day and age, but true.			"

												I nominated this game as the last category, for which I named, ""The Hidden Gem"". Age of Decadence is one of the few games that enthralled me, that actullay had me playing multiple play throughs, that I sat and anagonized how to get past impossible situations, I played this game for many, many, many hours almost effortlessly. I was so glad I gave this game a shot, and I know a lot of people don't even know what it is. The developers don't get enough credit for what they made here, a game with actual player choices and real consequences? Unheard of.Pros and ConsPros:Immense story, with real tangable effects on your decisions, multiple endings.Indepth and awarding combat system.Ability to play the game entirely without getting into combat, if you are slick enough ;)Lots of items and armor to experiment with, multiple options for combat weapons, multiple ways to win conflictsNot responsible for an entire party of people (my opinion)Alternate history set in the fall of the Roman Empire (my opinion)Good musicGood soundsGreat atmopsheric settingsCons:Graphics are not the bestCan only control one person most of the game (your character) (your opinion maybe)Some bugsSome things based on random number generatorMay be frustrating you can't do everything in the game on one play through (your opinion)No clear instructions (you may like that)I advise everyone to vote this game in somewhere as a reward, or feel free to copy me an nominating this as the last reward, named The Hidden Gem.

								The greatest testament to the power of genuine choice and consequence in an RPG since Planescape: Torment and Mask of the Betrayer. Highly intelligent, well written plot and dialogue, unapologetically unforgiving gameplay which rewards planning and skillfull execution and isn't afraid to kill you for your mistakes, and a virtually unparalleled degree of replayability make this an outstanding game.

												This is Fallout in a Post-Apocalyptic world IN ROME!!!!11! (Or is it???) TL;DR, I recommend you buy it. The game is a throwback to the 90s Fallout, before it made the leap to FPS. Meaning it's a classless system with stats and skillpoints in an isometric playing field, with factions and enemies looking for more power with you thrown into all this, at a pivotal moment in history. I'm gonna break down the review to COMBAT, SKILLS and STORY. COMBAT: Rich tactical options with tough difficulty. The tactical options are almost as diverse as the ones found in the Temple of Elemental Evil. Should I fire my crossbow bolt now, or do I bait them so I can unleash a timely whirlwind? Should I heal myself now or save it for another encounter later? The choices, and consequences, are yours. SKILLS: Skills matter. You can't be an overpowered master of all here, you have to choose a path and stick with it. While there are numerous encounters in the game, these do not give enough skill points for you to be a god of everything. I learned this the hard way, early on I played a jack of trades guy, who got into some quests, but got locked out during certain points due to lack of skills. Pick a profession and skills and focus on that as you make your way in this post-apocalyptic Rome. As an aside, alchemy did save my life more often than not, so I would recommend that. STORY: You have to pay attention to the walls of text. This is a throwback to the 80s and 90s RPGs, where there's not much voice acting, but a lot of exposition and character development done through the text. There's a complex plot involving ""gods"" and ""demons"" in the game, so you'll have to pay attention to all of it. DISCLOSURE: I have not finished the game myself, but I have encountered a ""DEMON"" and I'll leave it at that. There's something big going on, and I intend to get to the bottom of it. Bottomline: If you want to see more RPGs from Iron Tower, you have to buy this game. I have enjoyed every hour I put into it. But, if you're still not convinced, play the demo for yourself to see if this game's up your alley.			"

								Early access review:I picked up Age of Decadence on a whim. Knowing virtually nothing of the game other than the basic premise, I couldn't have been more pleased with my purchase. It's rare that a game in 2015 completely enraptures you as wholly as AoD did to me. Even more impressive is that the game is still unfinished (although most of the content is available at this time). The game is hard. There's no avoiding this fact, and it may turn off a good portion of players. Other reviews are not kidding when they say that you are not a hero; the game is incredibly unforgiving, and one wrong dialogue choice can leave you facing five thugs in a back alley. Unlike most games (or maybe just the games I've experienced), Age of Decadence lies to you. A lot. I tend to roleplay as a virtuous defender of the weak in most games - but instead of my generosity being rewarded, it is my naivety that is punished. Attempt to defend a man harrassed by a gang in an alley? Dead. Pay a guide to lead you through dangerous territory? Dead. Share a conversation with a traveler alone by his fire? Poisoned, and dead shortly after. ""Survival of the fittest"" is the law of AoD, and it makes sure to remind you of this fact at every opportunity. This is a breath of fresh air if you're tired of RPGs following the same formula. There is incredible replay value here, and you will certainly create multiple characters to experience the different viewpoints the storyline has to offer. One man cannot do everything, and there are even areas of the game restricted unless you explicitly design your character to be able to reach them.You are forced to min/max in a sense, and your first playthrough will likely be scrapped once you discover what the game requires of you. A jack-of-all-trades character will not succeed in this world.All in all, this game isn't for everyone. But Age of Decadence exists in a unique class, and the amount of work the developers put into the project is quite obvious. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a change of pace and a unique experience in the modern day where most games cater to the average class of player.			"

								Recently bought this game and got really into it. It's definitely not a game for everyone.+ Character customization. Choosing gender, skin color and the like.+ Origin, you can choose your character's background story ex. Thief, Drifter, Merchant.+ Reputation system, which determines how certain people treat you. + Skill and attribute allocation.+ Tactical combat, which challenges you to adapt.+ Tons of insanely great dialogue.+ Rare, Roman Post Apocalyptic setting. ( I wish more RPG's had Roman settings/backgrounds).+ So many paths to choose, that branch out. Making replayability an enjoyable must.+ Easy save system. Quicksave and quickload makes the game easier, since every choice has an impact on the story.+ Crafting system, which can be used anywhere+ Supports high resolutions.+ Have to use your brain, since you can't fight or talk your way out of every encounter.+/- So many creative ways to die, I mean one wrong choice in dialogue and you end up getting ambushed by 4 thugs, lose hp points permanently or just end up dead out of nowhere.- Some glitches, bugs and unfinished quests but that's to be expected.Overall it's a really great game done with a lot of love. I would recommend it to anyone who loves RPG's and to those casuals who want to challenge themselves.			"

Early Access Review
								There is a lot to love about Age of Decadence. The storyline, characters, and writing are great with extremely memorable events that bring you into a harsh world of betrayal and power. No black and white moral choices here to fill up a gauge, just your own sense of pragmatism and honor to contend with. The combat can be extremely difficult, but if you plan ahead, fight tactically, and occassionally sacrifice your allies you will end up on top. This is one of the few game where I can't hoard consumables until the final fight, items like primitive bombs or alchemical vials can change the course of combat.The graphical quality is indie but the art style is great and each location is handcrafted and unique. There is no filler in this game, every quest has interesting angles or options, most of which you will not discover on your first playthrough. Did I mention that there are 8 starting character classes each with its own storyline? Compound that with the amount of choice and consequence in the game and you will be replaying this for a long time. Anyone who is a fan of the old Black Isle RPGs or more recent fare like Underrail is going to love this game. Get it, and trust no one.			"

												There's many disappointing things about this game. It's been in development for a long time, and most of those development hours clearly went into raw amounts of content (this is being generous, there really isn't much content) and lots of mediocre writing rather than improving the general experience. I wouldn't be surprised if a fair bit also went into begging for positive reviews and downvotes on any negative reviews - there is no way this game warrants an 88% positive rating otherwise.Pros:-Semi-interesting setting, acceptable writing, lots of reading if you feel like it - but there are much, much better works you could be reading instead.-You get to play an isometric RPG as a single character rather than a party, which is uncommon.Cons:-Advertised as ""hardcore,"" but really, the game is extremely simple at its core. Tedium is NOT difficulty. Dying a lot doesn't make the game ""hard,"" either. Yes, you'll die a lot in Age of Decadence, but it's not like, say, Dark Souls, where you can outplay your death. You just reload and click the other option in AOD; nothing about this game requires much thought and it certainly doesn't test your skill, ever, at any point. Allow me to elaborate:For a non combat character, you essentially just click choices in a dialogue. For you, that's the game - it's like a tedious visual novel. You also have to keep old saves and save your skillpoints, because you need to level up the correct skills to pass dialogue checks, otherwise you can't progress. You will get lots of game overs as a non-combat character just because you invested your points into the wrong skill, whereas a combat character always has the (realistic) option to muscle their way through any situation the game might present. It's a bit disingenious that the creators say that combat is the hardest way to win the game; you'll probably reload LESS as a properly built combat character than you would a non-combat character. -Combat is extremely simple, and is mostly RNG based. You mostly spend your Action Points in the most damaging way possible, then move as far as you can to force your opponents to spend additional AP travelling to you on their turn, so they get less attacks. You'll beat the game just fine taking the violent option in basically every situation, as long as you keep your equipment and attributes updated appropriately, and you won't break a sweat doing it. It's heavily random, though, so you might have to reload some fights until your attacks actually connect. But all in all, both combat AND dialogue in this game are really, really simple.-All combat is set pieces. There's no random encounters, roaming enemies, or anything like that. Every battle is a pre-made set piece that comes behind a loading screen.-NO EXPLORATION. You get to places by clicking on the map. That's it. There's no roaming the plains and discovering things yourself, nothing like that. How shallow. In the few situations where you might find something interesting, instead of exploring itself, you're usually going to be clicking through a couple of dialogue screens that explain what your surroundings are like, etc.. Hey, how about you SHOW IT TO US instead?? Too much effort?-Each location hub is heavily lacking in content. You should finish Teron in about 30-45 minutes once you know your way around, Maaadoran is the same. You'll run around thinking ""surely, there's something more to do here?"" mousing over every NPC you see hoping they are interactable, only to find that no, there isn't. Those npcs are just scenery.-Every second bit of dialogue will be full of swearing. Not that this offends me, but really, writer: there are other, less obnoxious ways to emphasize that your setting is ""gritty."" The overuse of profanity is just hamfisted and lazy.-Game looks like crap. I'm no graphics nut, and I'm well aware of what the devs are going for, but that's just an excuse. Visuals are an afterthought in this game, and it's not good enough that the package as a whole can make me ignore that. Compare the look and feel of AOD to other new isometric games like Project Eternity. There's no comparison.If you're an oldschool RPG fan, I advise you to stay away unless you've played every other oldschool RPG and you're just desperate for another. This game isn't for you, I'm not sure who it's for, really. The only ways to really enjoy are:1-Treat it like a choose your own adventure game where you have to reload your last save every 2 minutes, and save every 30 seconds, or2-Just make a completely OP combat character and put up with the extremely random, simple, tedious and boring combat so that you can experience the story.But the story, even on its own, isn't anything special - so why would you suffer through a bad game just to read it?This game should have been a mostly ignored e-book on Amazon. The only reason it's getting any attention at all is because it shoved itself into a genre it doesn't deserve to be a part of. I hesitate to call it a game, let alone a ""hardcore old-school RPG.""

												Alright, this game is good.Now to break down the Good of this game to mine Subjective Opinion.-Good Points-*A classical RPG with large tatical elements in how you position your lone character. It is very viable to move your character around, especially to figuring out attack ranges and AP costs. If done right, you can dance around the enemies.*Mutliple Arching Story paths that can drastically change the end game. Not kidding, most of the paths can and will alter and jump you from plot point to plot point.*Character is set in stone - true changing of the stats, character has a base set of stats made at character creation - FYI, it is insanely to impossibly hard to winning a game with a character having 4 across the board.*Option Settings are quite literally diverse.!Conclusion of Good Points - This game is meant for those engrossed in exploring and learning a world and it's mechanics. Combat has multiple paths and even wily merchant type characters can do a good job.-Bad Points-*Difficulty is this games name. Death is sudden and brutal and for casual perps this will end their run and make them refund the game. Why is this bad? Because the casual's are yanking their money away from the company and steam. Removing support for a wellmade game.*Clunky poisoning system. It is hard to poison whole sets of throwing or missile weapons. I do not know if this is intended or not, but it makes it hard to poison 20 throwing knives.*Armor Penalty, there is no amazing fancy set of awesome looking armor that only benefits. One must choose between armors that look awesome but weigh you down or being a dodge fanatic.!Conclusion of Bad Points: I had a stupid hard time to give bad points and honestly believe the ones I put up are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Anyhow, Casual RPGers will either love or hate the game. TLDR: Game is gud. Spend your money after taking a look at videos and other reviews. Do not buy solely after this review.			"

												After 2 and half playtroughs, i am confident to offer an honest, but subjective opinion on this game. if i have to pick the best thing about this game it's the role playing opportunity, choices and flexibilty the game offer. it is one of that rpg where you can talk your way out of elmost every situation, or you can murder and leave trail of death and destruction in your wake. depending on your class, each playtrough so far offer very much different experience as you unravel the story trough different point of views.Then there's the combat, it is intuitive, really difficult but fair. take your time to read the tutorial, consult guides or ask on forums. with good build and equipment, you can be a god in this game. the system itself is quite simple, you move your character each turn, and you click on character you want to attack. reminiscent to old fallout game, or recent wasteland 2 and the new shadowrun series, your movement is determined by how much AP you have, and various kind of attacks that consume various number of AP. the strategy lies on positioning and choose the right attack you want to use. for example fast attack is effective light armored, dodge based enemies, it does less damage, but use less AP and more accurate. while heavy attacks consume more AP, less accurate but pack a punch which is effective agaisnt slow, heavy armored enemies. as the game explained, you can't heal mid-battle, but there's still arrays of poison and potions you can use to buff up your stats during battle. don't underestimate them because they will easily turn the tide of battle. the setting and story itself is really well written, and quite original. if i have to explain it in the most simplest, non spoilerish way, it would be a game of thrones / asoiaf in apocalytic setting, mixed with sci-fi and fantasy. the dialogue are definitely well written filled with believeable characters and multiple factions to join. one of the best thing about this game is discovering the lore and many old-world secrets in the dying wasteland.Each playtrough is relatively short, my first one as a talking merchant took 12 hours, adn the second as loremaster took 9 hours, but the strength of the game is in its replayabity. there's so many different characters to roleplay, class to pick, build to try, factions to join, whether you want to stay loyal, or become a backstabbing power hungry madman. each starting classes has its unique, exclusive quests, so is each guilds or houses you join. however i admit there's quite a flaw in the game, for example, the quest journal isn't so intuitive, as you can only see your current objective, but not summary of the whole quests (especiall long quest chains). i encountered some bugs too but nothing really major, and most of it was fixed just by reloading (SAVE OFTEN!).

			Episode 91: Act your Age Reviewed and edited by 16-Bit Today we look at The Age of Decadence on PC, do keep in mind this was a review code sent to us.		

Giant scorpions never truly never go out of style… But sadly isometric turn based RPGs for the most part have, but it seems this game dares to says otherwise…In The Age of Decadence you begin by creating your character, naming them, and setting up his or her attributes and skills, and what profession they start out as...  Then you die. A lot.The Age of Decadence is an unforgiving experience that won’t hold your hand through any of it, set in a post-apocalyptic ancient world after the fall of a great empire, you don’t play some sort of hero set on saving the world and conquering an army of evil doers, no you’re basically just trying to make something of yourself or to simply survive in general.In a world where combat is almost the last approach you should take to any given situation unless you wanna punish yourself constantly, as it’s very unforgiving. Even you have a good set of armor and you're decent with a weapon, chances are if you’re out numbered in this game, you'll still end up dead.But is it any good? Let's find out.The GoodProbably my favorite thing about this game is easily the story and lore of it, but probably the best thing out of the story for me personally, was specifically the politics of this world and the factions surrounding it.As I said earlier, you're not playing some sort of hero out to save the world, you're more or less just trying to make something out of yourself, and a lot of that will tie into the factions and politics of this world and whom you end up siding with.Each city is governed by it's own “House” each house is lead by someone out to either restore the old empire or simply just still exist or find out the questions of the gods of this world, then you've also the guilds such as the assassins, thieves, and the imperial army and such, so the game will throw plenty of different routes your way.And don't expect to be able to do quests for all of them at once, a lot of them are skill bound to certain things or based on your reputation with those houses, but at the same time it won't stop you from trying, so you can try and join the thieves guild as a terrible thief with no sneaking or stealing abilities, but chances are you'll reach a point where it's literally impossible to complete a quest or continue the game because of your skill set.If you wanna experience everything Age of Decadence has to throw at you, you'll be in for a number of different playthroughs, the game is heavily based around replayability, choosing different routes and skill sets to experience numerous different routes in the campaign.My next favorite thing about this game, also somewhat ties into the story a bit is the lack of a black and white morality system, you won't have your typical SAVE THE PUPPY or EAT THE PUPPY style of morality choices, honestly the game will punish you at times for even trying to be a decent person, if you plan on playing some like sort of mythic hero, most of the time you'll simply be taken advantage of for it.As for the combat, as I've said it's really more or less one of the options you wanna avoid unless you're playing a character with the right skill set for it and even then it's still very punishing at times.The game will throw plenty of moments your way where combat is seemingly impossible, but there are still ways to cheese your way through it, especially with alchemy, it will quickly become your best friend and I highly recommend learning it if you decide to play a very combat specific character.As for the soundtrack side of things, the music is your typical kind of moody med-evil dramatic music, it's whatever and nothing too memorable.But now let's discuss what we'd all rather forget... The BadNow to get the obvious out of the way, for a game released in 2015 this obviously doesn't look spectacular, it's definitely at this point a fairly dated looking game, from what I understand however it began it's development in the early 2000s so I guess that makes sense, but it obviously doesn't excuse the fact. Everything from the textures, the character models, the limited character customization and the animations, and over all even the art style I personally didn't find all that interesting, it's your standard med-evil / ancient empire sort of affair when it comes to the cities and some of the ruins you'll find, the only stand out thing to me were some of the temples you'll discover.But honestly, graphics to me aren't exactly a major selling point for me on video games, so all this I still very minor stuff in my opinion.But hey! Now you can play a new isometric turn based RPG and it'll even look familiar too... Right?As for the technical aspects, my biggest issue is the stability of the game, I'm not sure if it was my capture software or what, but I had a ton of crashing issues with the game personally, but during my 35 to 40 or so hours I spent with it, other then the constant crashing the game remained bug free for me personally, so that's always a plus, just make sure to quick save a ton if you plan on playing this.The only other issue I personally had with Age of Decadence is an issue I've had with almost every other major turn based isometric RPG is simply the combat at times can really drag out a long time when it comes to large scale combat with numerous people on screen,You basically move forward and then the next two minutes is everyone else getting into position and moving forward, and then some, but thankfully it's pretty rare to get into a large combat scenario Age of Decadence, but when you do, it takes like 20 to 30 minutes to win a fight some times, but once again this is very minor stuff.However, probably still my biggest issue with the combat system itself, is the lack of an escape or flee option during combat, unlike let's say Fallout for example and you have a random encounter while traveling, you can simply escape combat or leave a combat scenario in most cases by more or less walking away to the edge of the area or leaving whatever area or settlement your in. However in The Age of Decadence, you basically can't leave or escape combat, so you ether die trying or hopefully win, but at times the game will throw you into a combat situation out of no where, that is almost impossible to win early on in the game and you'll have no choice but to reload an older save.But with all that out of the way, it's time I give...The OpinionAt the end of the day, Age of Decadence is a game that knows the audience it's aiming and intended for, however because of this I feel this game is definitely not for everyone.If you aren't a fan of isometric turn based RPGs this game won't exactly change your opinion on them and graphically it's not exactly stellar,. but none the less I still had a ton of fun once I got deeper into the game.Admittedly the barrier of entry for Age of Decadence is a big thick wall of death screens and walls of text, but if you can get past all this and actually enjoy what you're reading, Age of Decadence is still a fantastic game and I still highly recommend it if any of this interests you.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												This game is for people who like great writing, atmosphere and good turn-based combat. It rewards your smart decisions and punishes questionable ones with a quick death, but always provides you with a fair chance to avoid these if you're observant enough and play to the strenghts of your character. Certainly very different from most RPGs these days but very rewarding and fun if you don't mind using the imaginative powers of your mind through reading.			"

												Excellent game. Very rich, deep, immersive world. Despite the graphical limitations (not a complaint, btw, I love them the way they are), the world feels very alive and encompassing. The excellent writing, both narrative and dialogue, fuel this feature and set this game apart from so many on the market today. The learning curve is fairly steep and most of the negative reviews I have read stem from that fact. This isn't a Bethesda sandbox. Your character cannot and will never be able to 'do everything' at once. Initially, you will only do a very few things very well. As you learn the game and the story, you'll be able to expand a bit on subsequent playthroughs and be more multi-faceted.  There is an incredible story here, with dozens of smaller, elegantly-interconnected side stories woven throughout. Perhaps the most satsifying aspect of the experience is discovering different angles to each story depending on which faction you ally with.  It is really fascinating to worry your mind at a plot 'hole' when playing an Imperial soldier only to have it fully explained much later on during  your 40 Thieves playthrough.  Very smoothly put together narrative running behind the scenes here.If there's one complaint, I suppose it would be the 'linear' nature of the game. Personally, I don't mind it, as I understand its necessity in order to tell a cohesive, meaningful story. But some people probably will mind it, so I mention it here. There are MANY different paths through the game and it will require several playthroughs to see them all. But once you've chosen your 'path' for a particular playthrough, that path generally runs on the rails until it completes.  Which isn't to say that you can't change paths partway through, if you're good enough to survive betraying your masters. ;) Each path also has significant choices you can make which will dramatically affect the life of your character and, in rare cases, the fate of the faction you serve or the world as a whole.  So while there is some linearity in order to maintain the story, you do have a reasonable measure of liberty within that structure. A truly great game here. A masterwork, in my estimation. I've had more fun with this title than I have with most in the past few seasons.  I hope that those of you who follow my recommendation and take a chance on it find the experience as rich and rewarding as I have.			"

												This is basially Fallout 2 (6 SPECIAL stats with points in individual skills and turn based combat) set in Post Apoclyptic Ancient Rome in Hardcore Mode. The graphics are a little dated, but tributes to Fallout 2 and games set in Ancient Rome are very rare these days and certainly worth checking out if you are into either Fallout 2/Ancient Rome.			"

												An excellent game with massive replayability.  So many different ways to do things.  I've always been a big fan of turn based strategy RPGs and if you are too then you'll like this one.  What I find most appealing is that if a particular fight is too difficult, there are about a million different ways to make it easier.  I play an Assassin with some Alchemy skill so before a difficult fight I make sure I have many different bombs, fire vials, poisons, etc.  In most games I find these things useless however in this one I couldn't fight without it.  Many games have crafting and alchemy options that are pretty much just additions without any real use except for making healing potions however this one actually puts these things to good use.  The one negative I've been having is the numerous crashes.  I've played for 4.5 hours since release and had about 6 crashes.  I keep sending the crash logs to Iron Tower Studio so hopefully it'll be addressed in future patches.			"

												TLTR,The game fills a somewhat narrow cRPG niche, but if you fit into it I reccomend the game warmly.Pros,The fiction is charming and dialogue very good. Lots of stat-bound dialogue, where skills and stats unlock new options with their own outcomes. Combat is hard but quite intelligently implemented. Lots of options for different manouvers that varies greatly over different weapons and fighting styles. further enhanced by crafting and alchemy. Game genuinely designed to afford you multiple playthroughs with a unique experience each time.Cons,The game is quite unintuitive, and chances are very high that you'll be frustrated until you either go through alot of trial and error or until you read up on how to play it.You begin the game unnaturally weak, as if you spent most of your life in a coma or suffered recent brain-trauma. Game-mechanics-wise it's ok, but it can break your immersion if you notice and contribute to the previous point about the game being unintuitive.The devs get easily annoyed and tend to get somewhat hostile here on the forum. Hopefully it's just release-fatigue, but I recommend a high tolerance for snide remarks if you're gonna hang out alot.			"

												This game is hard, especially the combat is punishing. It is easier to play the charismatic talker than the big brute. You will die, die die die die. If you go for the brutes way and on that way you end up out numbered aswell. There is no permanent companions here. The game might have a pretty ugly engine but it got its own charm and  the setting itself is interesting, deep lore and all. I truely recommend the game to fans of old RPGs, turnbased RPGs or people who want to play something more deep than Skyrim when it comes to story and RPG mechanics. Plenty of things to do, plenty of things to play and who do not want to play in a Roman Empire inspired Empire who fallen in a  war and it is now a post-apoc fantasy setting with many hidden secrets and ruins from before the collapse of the imperials. Many left overs fighting in the rubble for control.Try it, Buy it!			"

Early Access Review
								One of the most interesting and fleshed out settings I've ever played in. I've been waiting for this game for about 7 years, and so far I'm not at all dissapointed with what I've recieved. This isn't a full review, as I'm only about 9 hours into it at the moment, but I just wanted to urge anyone who is unsure to give this game an honest shot. Once you begin to get used to the mechanics (don't be afraid to start your game over/reload in tough situations) and start to get comfortable in the setting, you're sure to be hooked.			"

												Deep RPG where you can go completely non combat and be a merchant or loremaster, alchemist, whatever you want basically.  Combat is brutal, as in difficult and you're given plenty of chances to die.  People will scam you and betray you and you get a sense of real danger in this Romanesque apocalyptic setting.  There are lots of conversation options and branching paths, its an easy game to immerse yourself in and has high replayability with all the classes and different ways to approach the game. It is not an easy game and you are not the typical RPG hero...which makes you feel more vulnerable and like the world is more real, like you have to rely on your wits to survive and every choice you make actually matters.  You pretty much have to enjoy reading and storytelling to enjoy this game properly.  There is alot of text and depth to it, which is a good thing because its done well.			"

												This is a very text heavy isometric RPG - conversation skillchecks, situations resolved with choices, lots of reading. Combat is turn based, and definitely very difficult. The lore/atmosphere is top notch. Post-apocalyptic Roman Empire? That's a new one.The different classes don't just have varied skills and play styles. They go through completely different quests and plot-lines. Not since The Witcher 2 has a game had this ambitiously pursued multiple story arcs.All the above being said, this game is not for everyone. You'll have to like reading -- a lot. You have to be comfortable with difficulty. This is definitely not an action game. Not even when compared with more recent cRPGs, like Wasteland2 or Divinity: Original Sin. But if you're happy with those caveats, you'll find an impressively deep RPG, with a ton of replay value.			"

But it has a nice art style, you can really feel like a fancy Roman soldier!- You will die, you will have to restart because you get stuck with your character.- Combat ist very hard but definatly fun.- LOTS of text, the game has no voice overs, so everything is presented as text.

												I bought the game long ago,before it was released on Steam,I tried a bit the tutorial to understand combat mechanics and now i've played it twice,once with a speaking loremaster avoiding all combat,once with a mercenary that went through combat as much as possible armed with a 2 handed axe and defending with dodge.I've been lucky with my builds since they were effective.On difficulty:playing with that loremaster the game was trivial, basically a cyoa game.But a damn fine one! Still i didn't get all i could with that character.I almost never play games just for story or writing, but that has been a blast! 20 hours going calm.With the mercenary the beginning was like a chess match...Choose carefully wich battle pick first, try to survive.Then the character Is stronger and there are some easy battles(but i wouldn't call that fillers, all makes sense),some harder, some tough.Also i had loads of money! Played for 23 hours redoing a part for grim reaper achievement.With a pure combat character decently built,using aimed hits to take advantage and all the rest, the game is not that hard.Definetly not a cakewalk and sometimes i prayed to rng but neither THAT hard.Just use all options.For example with the 2 strongest  single opponents i had to remove armour to maximize dodge, on the contrary armour  was often vital even with dodge on other fights.Getting in almost all possible fights and survive makes you feel a badass!I have had really much fun with that, though of course you won’t see much lore.I tried also a shield + axe character till to get terminator achievement that i missed with the mercenary.And, boys, that was strong.Ironically the toughest battle was tougher than the 2 hander pc,but other nasty battles were much easier.Maybe playing an hybrid is another matter but i advice to avoid it for a first play.It’s important to understand that the game expects to be taken seriously and if you play a weak guy you can’t go around messing with everyone.Also i tried many characters to end first chapter. It’s short but...It’s a damn fine masterpiece.You see the story from different points of view, and all with choices and consequences. But not just that… You have choices and consequences for each branch… Probably I had still to see something that fine on that  regard. You see characters with some pcs that with other you only heard of or side against instead of supporting them. And there can be treachery.For example (remember, I am speaking just for the 1 st chapter here):Thief can use various skills like stealth and lockpick to achieve goals, i killed just 2 guys with critical strike but aside that I’ve never fought. Assassin seems a tough walkthrough, you use some thief abilities but some combat is required… And you aren’t a big bad guy.Trader is scheming and rising trading is fun… You barter with people and can manipulate them.Praetor is cool, you start inside Antidas castle… I’ve avoided all combat but that character can smash some heads too.Grifter is more about flavour and nearly a guildless speak-only thief.Drifter starts as completely neutral and can be anything.Those are more like presets, It changes a bit starting reputation with various factions, starting equipment, the first quest and the suggested stats.Said that, with my 2 full playthrough, I’ve had the impression that the rest of the game, while keeping all choices, consequences and branching storyline, isn’t up to the first city. For example the second city with loremaster isn't been so much interesting; to compensate that, in said city there's a location that is one of the coolest stuff;  furthermore, later in the game, you see some really cool location and can do some awesome stuff.On freedom:this is not a free roaming game. Actually is very far from that. You have limited resources (no respawn and the like), small maps, a short but replayable game. If a game like Oblivion is like a field with something thrown on it, AoD Is like a net. But a clever thing is that sometimes the absence of freedom is integrated on gameplay: since you can’t be all at once sometimes your real options are limited, but because that just makes sense and somewhat you are forced to behave as you character shoud do. Still, much is possible, even if not viable. Probably it’s possible to get stuck and a good thing is to keep some older save games (but that is a good practice for all games). In some regards It’s linear because you start in the first city, and, as far as I know, you end on the same place (though there are many different outcomes).On “playing the game”:the biggest surprise is how light that game is to play.I consider that a “noble” game but acts also as a nice diversion. It’s suited for short sessions yet I had hard time to shut it down (and that didn’t happened to me for loooong time).It turned out to be a good game for when I don’t know what to play.I know it’s considered hard, hardcore and so on, but to me seemed that it just required to be understood and to be played with common sense…Also it’s a game that doesn’t waste your time. For example when you finish a dialogue and have to proceed to another character, sometimes you have the option to go automatically in his place.There’s a lot of fast travel even if the cities are small.You can’t enter in many houses or it’s just told that there’s nothing interesting and you can’t explore it. And that is a bit extreme.This can make feel the game a bit meager sometimes but on contrast every hour spent feels like a quality one and I’m perfectly happy with that.Just keep that in mind if you want a big game to explore,this is not.Pros:Extremely cool settingamazing lore and writing (susprisingly fluent)excellent quests that surprises youengaging, rewarding and well thought combat (even with controlling just one character) where all options are of usenice variety of weaponrycrafting is useful for combat and out of combateasier to play than what you thinkchoice mattersthere are no filler quests and even easy combats don’t feel like being a fillerloads of skillchecks, often combinedall skills are useful(maybe one isn’t of big use,i forgive that)truly replayable with significative difference on various runsnice music (few tracks but good)It’s never ridiculous and it’s coherentI've not encountered significant bugsInterface is okFeels genuinely originalCons:Outdated graphics (but icons and portraits are wonderful)Feels indie It’s shortLocations are small metagaming is a life saver(store skill points and use when needed)Someone could not like cyoa method to solve all problems and skillchecksexploration at bare minimumno puzzles (not necessarily a con, also uncover all misteries of  the game world is not a small thing and some choices are deceiving)On some places it feels meager2nd and 3rd city aren't as interesting or refined as the first one, though to be sure i should play 2 other runs at least (but there are ""bigger things"" on the gameworld at that point)For me, most cons are just small gripes and most pros are first class executed.My impression is that if it had been bigger and more refined it would have been the masterpiece of modern rpgs. As it is, it is really noteworthy and worth to be played more than once. I’ve no doubts that all this waiting has been worth it and i've really enjoyed the game so much and i'm not done with it.There’s a good chance that you won’t like it because it’s limited in some regards  and rather particular, but devs are clear on game page.And there's a demo (and it's a damn fine one), so it's a good idea to try it before purchasing the game.

												I feel bad shooting down this game as it was given to me as a gift but I've got to speak the truth.The good:*The world building is great. The setting is grim in the best kinds of ways and fantastical enough to keep things interesting.*Character building is fun. There's enough options that sound important that there's no easy picks. *The graphics and UI are functional. Not great - functional.The bad:*The difficulty is significant but not in a way that's good or fun. The combat difficulty is fine. Struggling because you chose combat when you shouldn't have is fine and fair. What's not fun or fair is being punished because the game world doesn't explain itself well enough. At one point my character was warned that their action would cause them to be banished from the current town. I figured that was fine (I was more or less done with things in that town). The game didn't mention that being banished would include being shunted into the next act (barring me from completing content /outside/ town). In another scene my character was forced into a situation where he had to bribe a guard or kill him. The scene as portrayed with the character models is a quiet abandoned alley. Believing we were alone and not willing to be bullied I killed the guard. Later I'm told that there were witnesses and that I'm wanted by the law. Would I have chosen differently if I'd known this was a populated street? Maybe. We'll never know, the game didn't present me with enough information.*That's it. I can look past poor graphics/sound. I can forgive overly complex or dated mechanics. I have a hard time accepting bad design and artificial difficulty via intentional lack of information. I give Dark Souls a hard pass for the same reason. For example: You walk around a corner and die instantly to a skeleton that knocks you off the cliff. That's not difficulty. What's the lesson? That you should move around every blind corner with dodge roll? No. That's difficulty through memorization and that's dumb.			"

Early Access Review
								I, a person who usually plays games that do not tax my potatoputer, am very happy about this game. Not only does it have a beautifully dystopian world, but it is also very challenging! It is at the perfect point at which you are frustrated enough to play again after failing hard instead of rage quitting. I would comment on more, but as it stands, it is a perfect A in all categories BUT ONE—Saving/loading. I love this game so much, but I am a bloody forgetful fellow when I get immersed in a world, so I forget to save... or, like when I had just killed Cassius' guards after betraying the C-guild, I had to immeditely go from fighting them to fighting a tower! There was no save points in between, so I just fought the same two guards for quite some time and am now contemplating just reseting the whole save!ALL I WANT (for channukah):+SAVING-Autosave-Able to save during text screens (unless there is already a way and I am just an idiot)+MORE-of this wonderful game!

												Does Age of Decadence utilize bleeding edge graphics?  No.  Does Age of Decadence feature a dense and branching storyline that is replayable, a skill system that further encourages replays and experiementation, NPCs with realistic and logical motivations, and and a dialogue system that is perhaps the most detailed and rewarding to be created in recent memory?  Yes to all of these and that is why Age of Decadence is truly a pack leader when it comes to cRPGs.  The width and breadth of this game is made all the more impressive when you look at how small the creative team is that developed it.  Granted, AoD has been in development for an age but I promise you that the wait was well worth it.  If you're looking for a truly classic style RPG whose possibilities make for an experience that could keep one busy for a very long time then look no further.			"

												If you can look past the graphics and the insane difficulty, its honestly an underrated gem that I was very surprised by. No one I know owns this game except me. If you're a fan of the old school Fallout 1/2 series, this is definately a good successor to that kind of gameplay. Very few games nowadays have a lot of rich story, a conversational text dialog system,  and plenty of branching paths to choose from to shape your character. This is one of the few that keeps the classic roleplaying genre alive. The only downside to this game is that the difficulty is just insane. It will take a lot of effort, research, and trial and error just to make some decent progress after countlessly dying and starting over to try new character builds. This, however, is also part of its charm because there really isn't any handholding at all. This is truly one of the real hardcore games that I haven't really seen in quite some time. Dark Souls is definately a lot easier than this.			"

Early Access Review
								Waaaaay back when this first released Early Access, I wrote a review in which I thumbed down the title for the time.  Even had a bit of a chat with the Dev then.  But as I said in that review.. I expected more to come, and the whole to flesh out.  Well just popped back in for a bit, to see how the progression had come along. Totally new world. It was entertaining, and kept me thinking beyond hack and slash.  I chose a Grifter this go round. Overall, its a fun ""Fallout"" sort of title, but only in the layout and interactions.. its an interesting take on the world. Thumbs up.EDIT: Time to add some actual info.The graphics are nice for isometric. think Fallout improved.The inventory / combat / movement is well done. Easy to use.Character Creation and advancement is a real treat. As you really need to think about who / what you are. They really got it right in the fact that you cannot be a Dragonslayer Knight Templar / Loremaster / Thief  all at once. You have to really think it thru'. Balance? Or be good at what I am. Later you can and do acquire more knowledge and skills all around, but focus on one type is the key to long term success. The world is developed, the quest easy to sort your way in, and choices totally matter. Much replayability.			"

Posted: September 15, 2015
												Age of Decadence is one of the longest RPG in the making by a small and dedicated team (Iron Tower Studio). I remember reading about him about 9-10 years ago and since them I've waited for it to release. The game is set in a post apocalyptic roman empire like world and features turn based combat and lots of C&C.When starting the game you receive a warning that this game isn't some fantasy dragon killer simulator. When I first played the demo this year I died on the first quest, because I was stupid and tried to fight someone instead of running away. In this game, with a badly made build you can die easily. The thing that you have to remember though is that this is an Role Playing Game so that if you choose skills/stats related to the selected class (background) the game will be just fine to play. Sure, if you try to be greedy you will get killed if you are not prepared. This means that a change to the way you play this kind of games is required. Like a said above, a bad build is easily made if you don't think about the way a class is played. A merchant maybe should't get into fights and instead should try to talk his way out of problems or solve quests. Sure, you can try to spread into many skills but this may mean you will be unprepared for some future situations, so specialization I think is key. I would say this game is similar to Neo Scavanger on this part. In both games you have to think  about what you are going to do. Eating uncleaned water or trying to fight a soldier without having some weapon training could be deadly in both games.Now that the role playing part is described, I think I should write a bit about story. If you read any of the other reviews, you will know this game is full of C&C (Choice & Consequence). Many of the actions you will take will influence the events that you will received in the future and how you will be treated. Kill a guild trader and you may find that an assassin will be sent after you. Believe the words of a shady looking person and you will find yourself dead in a ditch. The C&C part is probably the reason this game took so long to make, since every background should be viable and also different from the others. What this means is that huge ammounts of text are in this game and it's a lot of (great) reading to be made. I don't think there is any game with so much C&C. The only game that has a smaller amount of C&C is maybe the Witcher series, but not even them don't have as many outcomes and ways to deal with situations. Now that I think a bit, maybe Fallout 2 is a bit similar to it. Both are post apocalyptic games, with turn based combat and many skills that unlock different ways to solve the problems. Similar to Fallout New Vegas there is also a reputation system which opens or closes the way you gain access to some quests.Like I said in the beginning, the combat is turn based, with different type of attacks available for each weapon. Each weapon class also has different uses and special attacks (eg. you can impale with the spear). If you played Fallout 1 or Fallout 2 is should be very similar. You use action points to move, to make attacks, use items (like poison), etc. Related to fight is also a crafting & alchemy mechanic which can be used to turn the balance on your favor in the harder fights. I think that the fights are well made, with enemies trying different tactics to kill you. What is important also to fighting is avoiding damage, which can be made in two ways: dodge or armor (you can't max both since armor decreases dodge chance). This is a great game and I recommend it to any serious RPG fan. If you only played this kind of games recently, and didn't try older RPGs, this kind of game may seem harder to play but it really is not. It's a game that doesn't treat you like some brain-dead jellyfish. From my part, this should be the game of the year.TL; DRGame is great, lots of C&C with classes that play different and turn based combat. GOTY material, now go and buy a copy!			"

												Very interesting concept for ""gameplay"" for and RPG, perhaps i have become too lazy and ""want it all"" even though i grew up on the old style games in the 80's and 90's that were very unforgiving..This game is ""short"" depending on what pathway you choose via your skills and who you side with or what 'class' you start as, you can go pure combat or a near ""pure"" talker, but you really can't go both. There is a LOT of replay here because you can miss huge sections of the game by your choices or simply being locked out because you couldn't do this fight, or couldn't talk your way past a certain person. Also it is easy to miss quests/items/interactions (no big glowing light on ! over the head :) you have to hunt for them and pay attention)Honestly after 40hours i feel the game was worth every penny, and i restarted about 5-6 times before finally settling on a dagger/dodge/crit/crafting (with some lore to try and see a bit more of the game)...I would suggest it highly to others, but i do kind of wish the one thing the game did to 'hold your hand' was HIGHLY suggest you stick to about 4 skills MAYBE 5 and build your stats around those skills 100% AND realize it is better to go 8-10 in a stat instead of trying to balance yourself across ALL the stats, also depending on the path you took to get to the end, it can be a kind of ""wait.. WHAT? that was?? WHAT!?!?! ughhhhh"" kind ending, i felt like on my 1st completion, it came out of no where, and i had no idea what i was doing or why i shuld choose X,Y,Z for the ending, but perhaps that is simply because of the choices i made with the assassins guild..The one thing i think they could of perhaps done differently was the prestat classes you pick (which determine the first few minute sof the game) might of been nice if those had started in different towns, but would of been 'difficult' i suspect to balance out all the interactions then..also the background story on this game is GREAT, TONS of lore and info you can dig around and find, quite a good version of ""earth"" they have come up with...

												1998 Baldur's Gate came out and it was likely the first RPG i ever played in my life at the time; since then i always felt the lack of market share for such videogames, where people prefers to experience something easy in order just to relax a few hours without much effort; well Age of Decadence seems to remark at most the glorious days of RPG gaming.Personally I ended it four times and couldn't stop repeat it, everytime is a whole new view of the events scripted majestically; like a saga book where in every slice you get something different and a totally clashing understanding of the events.Game is hard, graphic is like Neverwinter Nights 1 and most of the game content is text based, so you have to read a lot if you want to get a catch on the plot; it forces you to reality by every bit of it, making you understand that when lives are at stakes sometimes the better effort is the safer one.You won't be able to get much more of an ordinary person out of your character, indeed you could push some traits to the extreme but that would leave others to lack; or you could try out something balanced and yet more compromising but in the end as i've said, you won't get the chance to play superman either way and you will be able to count on your own resolve and character build in order to get out of troubles, wich is something i love.It's pure oldschool RPG gaming, so you better not miss it if you're from such school as I.Enjoy			"

												The story and writing is excellent, with tons of branching quests and different options for resolving them. The setting is really interesting and I love how you can play as a non-combat character to get through the game.The graphics aren't very good, but this game isn't about the graphics. After the first half hour or so you stop noticing anyway and just get immersed in the gameplay and story.One of the best RPGs I've played in a long time.			"

												Really unique game. We are not the chosen one, NPCs are not stupid and basically the game world doesn't revolve around our characters. Really non-linear, not in the open-world exploration sense, but in the story progression which IMO is much more important if you value things like choice and consequence.			"

												Short version: must have if you like RPGs; must try the demo otherwise.Long version:1. Lots of story content.You know how in most modern RPGs the story is on rails? Sometimes those rails pass through scenic (Alpha Protocol) or even breathtaking (Mass Effect) story environments, and you don't really mind. Sometimes a few short rail tracks are scattered across the wasteland, and as long as wondering the wasteland is satisfying (Elder Scrolls) you don't really mind.Yet Age of Decadence isn't about rails at all. The story is a freaking web; you get to choose your own path through it, jumping back and forth between multiple story lines at will, with consequences for the environment ranging from none at all to scorched earth.2. Satisfying combat (and not only combat).Quite a few turn-based games managed to bore me rather quickly due to repetitive and dull combat. Despite bowing to the effort put into Divinity: Original Sin, for instance, I just can't take another round of ""buff-summon-summon-slash-slash-slash-heal-slash-slash-slash-heal..."" for at least 3 turns each time a lowly wolf crosses my path - you can't quickly steamroll through non-challenging encounters because of the turn-based combat system, and those non-challenging encounters are everywhere.Age of Decadence never managed to bore with combat. Combat system offers a lot of tools and options, most encounters are unique (no hordes after hordes of generic thugs every 5 meters), plus combat is usually just one of the ways to solve a problem.Not in the mood for a fight with those thieves? Tell them how many you've killed and they'll kindly see themselves out of your way.Having second thoughts about a brawl with gate guards? Well, if you know a thing or two about sneaking and have a dagger, some instant kills may be coming your way. Or bribe them. Or convince them you're an awkward scientist. Or a highborn. Or a travelling vendor. Or show them a peculiar signet ring. Or throw something at them. Or... Well, guess you're getting it by now.That said, you can finish the game without having to fight once - or slaughter armies.3. Power armor.To sum up: a brilliant RPG title definitely worthy of your time - and your support.			"

It's a really unique game, that's for sure.Although I don't agree with all design decisions that VD (the creator) made and the direction that the game took because of this, I must recognize that, from the narrative point of view, is a unique and special game. It's a game that forces you to deal with your character as a living being, not an omnipotent figure - an avatar capable of solving all the world's problems. If you try to play it like a conventional game, you will always die, and fast.NPCs lie to you - all the time.They try to sell you useless junk. They try to use you to destroy their enemies, putting you in horrible situations. Trying to be ""fair and honest"" doesn't guarantee that others will be, you will often be treated like garbage, or as an innocent fool. It's a crude path in a harsh world; completely different from current games. And any choices you made in your adventure completely change the plot of the game and its ending. It's a short game (you can complete it in less than 20 hours), but each playthrough will be completely different from the previous one.The good:  An  extremely balanced turn-based combat system that requires you to deeply understand how it works.  A unique post-apocalyptic setting inspired by the Roman Empire.  NPCs to behave like human beings and not as generic characters, in a cunning and cruel world.  Choices & consequences - every decision made in the game has a huge impact on the narrative.  Huge replayability, as in, ridiculously massive.The bad:  An extremely hostile game to beginners.  You're kind of forced to engage in one of the two paths in the game: your character will either be a fighter or a talker. A ""jack of all trades but master of none"", in this game, is basically suicide.  The ""CYOA style"" of the game sometimes makes you feel trapped, the skills don't interact organically with the game, they only ""work"" in scripted events.TL;DR: Even if it isn't perfect, it's a breath of fresh air. Highly recommended - but play the demo before you buy it, because it's not a game for everyone.			"

												A reasonably good game, worth a purchase at the asking price if you are looking for a typical RPG, but can do without the magic / special abilities that most other games come with.The good: The combat system is pretty decent, although not flashy. The crafting system is nice, but you'll need to sacrifice a lot of very scarce character points to have it. Finally the story and setting are less cliche than most RPGs which is a big plus.The bad: The makers of this game have put a lot of effort in making the game unique / replayable with different character classes. This is a miscalculation in my view because it meant that the main story is rather short. And after playing through that same story 2 times you will be done with the game, leaving all those unexplored alternate side-stories unseen.Verdict: A carefull recommendation, it won't be for everyone.

												Age of Decadence is a classic style CRPG from a bygone era. It is intoxicated with skill checks and prose; built for maximum replayability with a modest play time of around 8-12 hours so multiple playthroughs are not only possible, but encouraged. This is not your Elder Scrolls: factions are more grounded and conflicting with one another, as in working for one usually means shutting out all the others. The world setting is post-apocalyptic Fall-of-Rome inspired by way of some magical and mysterious war that you can unravel to certain degrees given your ability (Hint: you will need LORE for this). It is both surprising and captivating in ways most modern RPGs are not.			"

												Playing the tutorial I was thinking ""oh gawd what have I bought""... The graphics, art design and stilted animations make it look like a kind of B grade title from the early 2000's.  The look and feel of AoD wouldn't compare favorably to a game like Gladius from 2003 for instance (though admittedly comparing it with work from a big studio like Lucasarts title isn't very fair).  But, this was a fine game.It had wider sub-plot branches than I've come to expect from an RPG and tightly balanced combat.  There's nothing terribly original about the story but it feels carefully crafted.  There is a lot of writing but hardly any bloat, so it seems like it has had plenty of careful editing. It's fairly easy to recommend.  Beware of elevators, though... You'll spend half the game hearing about Doomed Archaelogical Expeditions that discovered elevators... then never returned!  *gasp*			"

												Good game, very hard combat until you get used to it. Then it becomes fairly standard.Not a patch on fallout 2 unfortunatly, but its probably the closest to it i have played in a while.Replayability is a bonus but i feel like regardless of what class i went i missed out on a huge portion of the games content. This forced me to play other classes and roles to experience the other parts of the game.If this game had a much wider base of towns/areas to visit and quest in i think it would vastly improve the game. A large amount of the quests have pre-requisites and skill checks which can make them impossible to do with certain builds.All in all for me it was a fun experience, just too short. "

Early Access Review
								I'll start by saying this:This is easily one of the best RPGs I've ever played. I don't think there's another game out there that captured my interest so quick. But that doesn't tell you much. Let me elaborate.Age of Decadence is brutal. It's painful. It will kick you while you're down and do it again, and again, and again. Every situation you'll encounter in this game is either going to leave you in a life or death struggle or trying to piece together things you couldn't hope to understand, and that's a good thing. This is not like modern RPGs(i.e. the more recent incarnations of the Falllout Series, Elder Scrolls, Divinity, Underrail, etc) nor is it entirely like those of old(Fallout 1 & 2, Baldur's Gate, etc.). I am reminded of all, I see influences while playing it, but Decadence sticks out on its own. Again, I think it has to do with difficulty. Decadence hands nothing to you: you pick your character background, assign some basic Stats, and then pick a few skills to upgrade. Character creation leaves you tied to what you make--A strongman swordsman with wind blowing through his ears will still be dumber than a bag of rocks by the end of the game, a persuasive talker who has no combat prowess will consistently get shredded within moments of entering combat. What you make is what you get. To put it another way, Decadence does not put you in the shoes of the hero. You can die in the first fight very, very easily( I have, multiple times), and I'm sure you will as well. You are very much an everyman, someone thrown into a world that can and will exist with or without you. The only time you're ever going to be anyone of status('Hero', 'Chosen One', 'Scourge of Humanity', 'Demi-god', etc.) is by putting enough people down at your feet through hard-scrabble fights and barely coming through alive. You have to live a legendary life before you can become a legend yourself.Thereagain, that's assuming you choose to fight at all. This isn't necessarily a combat oriented game--you can talk your way out of things, trick, cheat and steal your way to success--Decadence encourages you, in a way, to avoid messy solutions. In fact, it'll often get you farther in terms of understanding the game world, story, the politics of the world Iron Tower has created and the people and creatures living in it. It'll also leave you cursing yourself as misallocated skill points cost you the opportunity to read that dillapidated scroll in an ancient library, or pull off negotiations with a feuding noble, or figure out a way to talk your way through a horde of angry tribals who want to throw you into a pit with an abomination from ages beyond. It's not any easier, certainly, the life of a silver-tongued devil compared to a battle-scarred warrior.Sounds rather difficult, right? For people who have some kind of enjoyment of punishment and pain?This game will teach you to enjoy failure. Half the fun will be trying again, in dealing with the failure. There are moments, certainly, where things get to be a little ridiculous(I wasn't very happy when I had to trash my first character partway through) but once you get into the game, things move quick. Trying again isn't so bad after you know what to do, how to maximize your effectiveness in the playstyle you shoot for. And sometimes, you'll just have to reload and try again, and hope the rolls are kinder to you, that your hits land this time and that four-armed monstrosity you're fighting stops landing criticals every hit for the past twenty loads in a row. Furthermore, it's very, very hard to make a decent jack-of-all-trades character, let alone an expert in everything. Honestly, it's hard to go purely for combat, or social skills, and so on.  It takes some maneuvering to get your skills where you need them when you need them. More often than not, you'll be reloading or restarting entirely, trying to find out the best order to do things, the best way to spend your points, the best options to choose in each situation so you don't hit a brick wall later on, finding out you literally cannot progress past a certain point because of errors in character building.Going off the jack of all trades, to fully experience the game, you(probably) will have to make multiple characters. At the moment, I've got a mercenary/warrior character with some light social skills and a character who is built entirely around understanding the ancient history of the gameworld(there is actually a skill for this in game, called ""lore"", and it's rather useful) as well as persuasion and the like. I'm probably going to have to make another one, and one more, and so on to really get the full picture. You will too, and probably will want to. Each character has a very different story, a very different interaction with the world: you'll need quite a few to get a good picture of it all.Speaking of the world, the ""bigger picture"": This game has some serious writing behind it. It, quite simply, turns your expectation from a possibly predicatable RPG storyline to feeling like your reading a novel that's just setting the stage for an entire series. There's a huge meta-plot going on beyond the actions of your character--the story becomes as much about the world your exploring and its history as it does about your character's journey through it and it left me craving more. In fact, I made that lore-based character I mentioned earlier solely for the the purpose of digging deeper into the realm presented. Like the inhabitants of the world of Age of Decadence, I wanted to find out more about the fantastic world they lived in, what happened to it, and how exactly it got to where it is now.At the time of writing this review, the game is still in early access, and we're waiting on a big update to wrap up the exisiting questlines, locations and so on. So, be aware you might not be able finish the game right yet if you buy this in early 2015. However, there is so much content you won't get bored while waiting. Best of all, you can(probably) use your previous saves in future updates--barring any serious scripting errors that might arise in the future with updates and so on, older saves seem to be pretty compatible with new versions of the game.All in all, I am very happy with my purchase(I've owned this game four or five days and already have 30-40 hours in it) and I can't recommend it more. Well worth the price. If you have any doubts, try the demo first. It's there and is a good representation of the gameplay. Also, try reading the forums and asking around if you're not sure--the community is very friendly, as are the developers.TL;DR version:Do you like difficult, challenging  RPGs with great writing that encourage that force you to learn from your failed attempts and turns it into something enjoyable?Then buy it.Oh, one last thing: Save like a madman! You're going to die soon. "

												I wanted this review to be about deep combat system, witty writing, great setting, challenging difficulty and plenty of choices and consequences.Then I decided against it. Do not get me wrong, these are all there, and others will surely cover them in detail.I will mention 2 other points instead:- couple of years ago, fans of isometric RPGs with turn-based (or RTwP) combat, focused on writing and quest desing, had a tough time. Infinity engine games were no longer made, Fallout got turned into FPS, Black isle and Troika were no more.  Now, we enjoy a renaissance with games like Divinity:OS, Wasteland 2, Pillars of Eternity or new Torment. But it was AoD that was, at least for me, the first herald of incline. Even though it was overtaken by quicker development of other titles, devs from Iron Tower were first or among the first who believed that such games will still have audience. I hope we will prove them right.- how many of us would quit a steady job to follow an uncertain dream? We all hope we would; in the dev team this already happened, when some of them felt work on AoD can no longer be done part-time.Recommendation: Buy. Unless it is on sale, then wait till sale is over and buy for full price to better support devs in further game development.			"

												One day, I found out about this game (at the time it was only a demo). I tried it.I looked at the character creation screen, and...OMG THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT SKILLS ! AWESOME !I built an Assassin, of course.I got my♥♥♥♥♥kicked in another dimension in the 1st fight.I took some time to accept that my first build sucked monkey-balls.I built a second one, and then...I was hit by the depth of the combat system. There is none alike.I still died, but somehow less miserably.And now...well I can kill pretty much everyone with a character weaker than a paralytic Chiwawa. You want a game that offers a real challenge ? Where you earn your greatness ? This is your game.If, on the other hand you are more into killing hordes of Elder Dragons with your Ogre/Mage/Thief LVL 99 in a single click, I think there is another extension of Wow coming soon.For me, AoD is an INSTANT CLASSIC.

												This is a wonderful indy role playing game which defies genre conventions. I am a pen&paper player at heart and if you like role playing (as in enacting a character and not in leveling your stealthy warrior-mage) I cannot encourage you enough to give this game a shot. A few things that stand out for me:- The game doesn't have grind. If it comes to a fight the fight is justified and brutal.- The game is not too long, but it has lockouts. This means one playthrough will take around 8h, but you will not understand everything. Which is reasonable as a realistic character will never be fit to do everything. However the game encourages multiple playthroughs and this will not mean a few different choices, but it will mean visiting completely different locations meeting completely different people.- The story and lore are actually very good. At first it doesn't stand out too much. But I did three playthroughs now (Merchant / Loremaster / Assassin) and I apprechiate all the details that have been put into very much. - The combat system is quite balanced. The game has random number generation but in a lot of fights when I was dying raising a combat stat by one point usually made a big difference.A few negative points are to be mentioned as well. Most of them are expected when you purchase a game from a small indy studio which has a focus on story:- The graphics are not the best. - There is no voice acting.- A very small amount of things/people are actually animated. - The music is good, but gets repetitive.

												This unique isometric RPG opens with a quote from Glen Cook’s The Black Company, and fans of Cook’s dark military fantasy novels will feel right at home in this gritty and grimy setting. The Age of Decadence drops you into a crumbling empire teetering on the brink of chaos, with several major guilds and noble houses vying for power while the general populace struggles to survive amidst gangs of thugs, mercenaries, and religious fanatics. It’s a harsh and brutal world with very little magic outside basic alchemy and very few monsters, though your fellow humans fill the latter role quite admirably.Unlike most RPGs, The Age of Decadence emphasizes story and character interaction over combat as the player gets caught up in various schemes and power struggles. In many events throughout the game, the player is confronted with meaningful choices which alter the direction of the story in meaningful ways, opening new possibilities while closing off others. There are multiple paths through the story and the player can choose between allying with the Commercium (merchants guild), the Imperial Guards, the Boatmen of Styx (assassins guild), and several other factions. Each path provides a different perspective on the overarching story while the player’s decisions and actions help shift the balance of power between the various factions. This lends the game excellent replay value as each playthrough with a different character type creates a distinctly different experience.Skills are split between Combat Skills (e.g., Swords, Bows, Dodge, Block, etc.) and General Skills (e.g., Sneak, Streetwise, Crafting, Lore, etc.). Building different skills unlocks different options throughout the game, allowing the story to progress in different directions. Of course there are never quite enough skill points to go around, so you’ll need to make some choices in terms of what to focus on, and those choices will impact which options or paths are available as you work through the story.While combat isn’t the primary focus of the game, the turn-based combat system makes for some challenging conflicts. There’s a good variety of weapon types with poison, potions, and other items like nets and bolas supplementing your character’s abilities. Fans of traditional RPGs should be advised that The Age of Decadence takes a slightly more realistic approach to combat; you’re not likely to become an unstoppable killing machine but focusing on combat skills will allow your character to progress quite a bit. Or you can focus more on non-combat skills, leveraging skill-based alternative options which allow you to progress through the game with minimal combat.The game’s fairly heavy on text, drawing inspiration from Cook’s noir-flavored narratives to build a broken and decaying society filled with shady characters. The world design follows suit with lots of yellows and browns, crumbling ruins and scrabbly flora. All together, it builds a cohesive world with a very distinctive feel.Bear in mind that it isn’t an open world RPG, each area is broken up into zones and the paths to navigate those zones are somewhat limited, so you don’t get the kind of free range exploration found in open world RPGs. It also isn’t a terribly long game, though what’s there is plenty substantial enough to be satisfying, and the variations when playing through it with different characters lends it a lot more life.Despite those limitations in scope, The Age of Decadence accomplishes what it sets out to do extremely well, delivering a unique and challenging RPG experience in a dangerous world echoing the spirit and tone of Glen Cook’s landmark military fantasy series. Just as Cook challenged and subverted the fantasy genre’s conventions in the 80s and 90s, The Age of Decadence flips around many of the conventions common to modern RPGs, offering meaningful choices and branching story paths while focusing on street-level characters with limited abilities rather than gods and kings.Highly recommended for fans of isometric RPGs who'd like a change of pace emphasizing story and meaningful choices over endless combat.

Adapt or dieAge of Decadence supports full specialization. You can't be two things, two personalities, in one. You are either a talkative merchant, clever but soft loremaster or a relentless warrior, but you must choose one path and follow it. Get on with the fact that you can't be the best in everything and sometimes even in your own specialization. The game itself forces you to improve only in few skills, but bringing them to mastery is the only way how to beat this game or you will get stuck unable to continue playing. This is true RPG, hard and brutal. Pros✪ Immersive lore, very sofisticated. If you happen to be loremaster yearning for knowledge you will find things you thought were impossible, even in this game. ✪ Fights are very hard, sometimes just impossibly hard. Nevermind that they are also very well elaboration and mainly more realistic.✪ Decitions - the game largely depends on them. You will see consequences for your actions.Cons ✪ You gotta adapt, and on that scale that if you choose your skills poorly you got stuck in the game, not being able to do anything but reloading or even starting a new game. It happens often here trust me. You will know that when you find yourself running around and trying every possibility just to move somewhere from this dead spot. ✪ Even though the game seems to have a lot of possibilities, but the ending itself had been a bit of a disappointment for me, mainly because almost every path ends in the same place.7/10It's a great game for one playthrough. If (like me) you want to beat the game more than once, you might be a little disappointed because you shall see the game patern (mainly skill requierements) and how the game needs you to mold your character not the way you want, but the way you get through.One final warning  If you are not a fan of reading, this is not for you, there are thousands of pages in the game.

Early Access Review
								***Decadent Times***There are many worlds in one world. Some of them are known to the common men portraying themselves as harsh truths of the circumstances or a hopeful future...some of them are only known to people who seek things behind the illusionary curtain before our eyes. Age of Decadence makes you visit all these worlds at your leisure and with your style. Let us cut the fancy words and stab our knife deep into the meat of this game. What makes Age of Decadence, unique?Age of Decadence is set on a post-apocalyptic world devastated by a war between the Empire and Qantari. The war, its consequences and the remnants (ruins, devices etc) from those times creates the mystical side of the lore but on the other hand the numerous factions vying for the power adds to the mundane part of the lore. As your character progresses, depending on your actions, background and character prowess you will find yourself uncovering things let it be political schemes, marvellous devices or simply glory of combat in the battlefield. Thus having a tasty background, Age of Decadence gives us a solid sign that it is a candidate to become a classic.First of all, forget being a hero (though it is still possible) all the time since the game will allow you to back down from several dangerous situations...but once the die is cast...you'll have to live with its consequences. Depending on your character build (combat, non-combat, hybrid) you can find different kinds of solutions to a certain quest or mission. And mind you those different solutions may lead to different consequences. Your generosity towards a person may pay well later in the game or you might find yourself in difficult situations because some thugs marked you as a target due to your generosity. It is definitely a decadent world where you should READ and ASSESS the situation properly. If you do not notice the warning signs, understand the personality of the characters you are dealing with...you might find yourself in difficulty or pushing daisies.The most striking part though...the cumulative effect the game presents you. From the start, you are subject to a different perspective on an assassination vignette where your background will affect it quite much. It will also make other NPCs of the starting town react differently. Such as, you might be the Assassin who is hired to kill the trader but perhaps you were the Mercenary whose duty was to protect the trader. Perhaps as a Mercenary you let the Assassin depart or avenged your employer and it may impress the Assassin's Guild (it is named as Boatmen of Styx and like every faction it has a neat backstory). Or you were merely a Drifter and heard some noises before stumbling upon the corpses of an assassin, a mercenary and a trader. I wouldn't want to spoil all vignettes here...regardless you will see from the start the game will offer you more depth into the matters.Another striking point is the importance of factional relations. Don't expect to pay some sum to a shady man and magically all bad feelings are gone. Minor slights and such can be mended with some acts of goodwill...but if you screw some relations severely, you'll have to live with that and like every organization, Age of Decadence factions have enemies and allies in times of change. And even your personal allegiance can change at crucial times let it be for your personal gain, a change of ideals or merely you wish for some thrill. Choices and living up to their consequences...is the essence of this game. Combat system is Action Point based where people should be familiar from Fallout series...This is one part I don't wish to go into detail because the game itself has a nice training mode where a starter player can try different types of weapons in order to get a hold of mechanics. As I said, don't be a hero and try this training :DAs one last positive, the demo of the game has the entire first chapter of the game with all its vignettes. You will not regret trying it out and will keep wanting more of it. I know I did and still do. I shall update the review for the future versions.			"

												Update for the full version of the game:I post a lot of dumb reviews on Steam, but in all honesty this is one of (And possibly #1) my favorite CRPGs of all time, up there with Fallout 1 and Bloodlines. The original review below is just me being an idiot, but the truth is this. I've done 4 complete playthroughs now and each time I've found new areas, quests I've missed, alternate solutions, and pieced together more of how everything fits in to the story. The game has far and away the most reactivity based on your choices in an RPG I've ever seen, and though you can't do everything with every character the game is short enough that starting a new character and playing through from a completely different perspective isn't a daunting time commitment. To top it all off it has a great setting (Rome-like civilization in a post apocalyptic sci-fi/fantasy world) to boot. Absolutely fantastic.Original review:You will know true decadence as you recline on a sofa of the finest writing as a nubile young choice hand-picks consequences and places them in your mouth and you watch nearly naked turn based combat fight for your enjoyment. You clap your hands to advance the festivities and are then treated to a unique setting singing for you and a roasted in-depth character skill system is brought in.Mid way through the event you feel sick and rush to the bathroom, only to void your bowels as your character dies over and over again. But it's alright, here's a swan for you to wipe yourself off on.Highly recommended.			"

												9 Feb Update: I have completed the game a week back. Played through three profiles, as loremaster, assassin and mercenary. As much as there're a bunch of readers who may not agree with my review, I stand by the original points made. You don't level up in this game, your stats cannot be easily improved (only through specific quests and items, which can be difficult to obtain) and as other reviewers have mentioned, the flow of the game seems like a patchwork of events and details. I still recommend AoD, but it's not as good as it could have been. Am hoping AoD 2 (if there is one) will address some of the points that have been raised.=============I’ve been a long-time RPG player, so when I found this title, I had to try it out. Note that I haven’t completed the game yet, but I do have enough hours and firm impressions to post an informed review. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros:• This game has a LOT of replayability. I know that RPGs seem to boast that a lot, but AOD really delivers. I’ll give you one example: a number of options and interactions with NPCs are only available to certain classes. If you’re an assassin and try talking to a representative of the merchant guild, it’s not going to happen. So this really “forces” the player to try out different classes and roles. As such, there are dialogues and options that do not appear unless you can trigger them as a member of a different class. This keeps things interesting, even though the main story arc remains the same. True replayability is difficult to achieve, but I think AOD does this quite well.•The dialog and story are detailed and well-crafted. You will often be presented with options reminiscent of old D & D days, or pen and paper gaming. •You can craft (weapons and armor), and perform alchemy to create potions, bombs, etc. •The graphical details and renderings are true to the era.Cons:•You can play AOD on only ONE difficulty setting, and let me tell you, it can be difficult. You will die. A LOT. •Combat can be frustrating. You will almost always find yourself outnumbered, and you won’t have any controlled-NPCs join you in your quest, so you’re almost always fighting alone. There are battles where you have AI-controlled NPCs on your team, but they can be pretty hopeless since you can’t control them at all.•There is a huge shortage of alchemical items to create potions, bombs etc. Merchants don’t get restocked for a long time and ingredients in the wild are hard to come by. This gets a little ridiculous when you’re fighting alone almost all the time and when these items can level the playing field.•You cannot improve your base stats. For e.g. if you generate a character with 40hp, he/she will ALWAYS have 40hp. Not sure if I like this system.•You cannot drink healing potions in battle. The tutorial says it’s unrealistic to do this while fighting, but you do have quick access belt pouches that let you switch out certain items for 0 action points, so why not heal during battle? This feature makes battles unnecessarily difficult.•While you cannot save in the turn-based combat system, the game auto-saves at critical points, so if you get killed, you can reload and try a different strategy.•Not everything is clickable in the game world. Not all doors work. Only certain items can be interacted with. This is why games like Fallout and Jagged Alliance are superior – you can interact with almost every door, and most items. •There are also some weird bugs in the game. Some quests don’t register the response you give, yet allow you to complete it. Then when you return to the quest giver (e.g. 2nd quest in Hector sub-plot) for the reward, they ignore you. Camera scrolling is also not consistent. Sometimes it gets “stuck,” and you have to move the camera forward/backward before it can side-scroll again, which is pretty annoying.•The quest tracking system can be improved. There are no notes on who/where a certain NPC is, if you happen to lose track of your open quests (there can be quite a few). You also cannot make notes in your journal or annotate your map.AOD is a fun game that happens to be marred by some lack of attention to the details above. It has pretty good replayability, but falls short of being one of the great ones. I’d recommend buying it only with a decent discount (50% or more).6.5/10.0			"

												TL;DR: Play the demo first and support the devs if you like it. This game is for big boys only, if you think you can be a master of all trades, a überbrute who beats 10 armored dudes in a fight and at same time be a übernerd to unlock all of the forgotten lore & ancient technology, well... no Skyrim for you, you'll probably die a lot without acomplishing any of the two.Age of Decadence favors specialization and I truly recommend focusing in building either a talkative\persuasive character or a muderous psychopath in your first playthrough, while the former seems boring it turns out that turning lords against each other and ♥♥♥♥ing up everything without (directly) killing anyone is pretty fun. However, as some reviews point it out, it's not for everyone, if you play the first missions and like it then you'll probably play this again under a diferent build, and again with different choices, and again trying to become or kill a god... otherwise stay away or refund, there's a demo so why not try it?

												My poor♥♥♥♥♥is raw. pls gief cream...Age of Decadence is the type of game that will look rather low key in terms of graphics, yet delivers on hard gameplay and rich story.It's bloody rewarding though, you'll feel real accomplishment when you win a tough fight or progress through a rather tricky part of the story. The story itself is highly enjoyable. Doesn't give to much away, letting you slowly soak up the rather rich (and depressing) lore of how the world has gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥ (Makes the fall of the Western Roman Empire seem like a ride in the park)Plus I love history, so the fact the dev's have used the fall of ancient rome as their basis makes me moist.BUT OH GOD MY ASSASSIN CANNOT DODGE NOW HE IS DEAD.

												A very innovative game that actually lives up to the idea of the replayable RPG. Where alot of RPGs claim to have a dangerous world, this game lives up to it. If you make the wrong decision to fight a dozen guards at once, prepare to die, mercilessly. This makes the thrill of victory in combat just as much about your meta-decisions to get to that point to the martial prowess of your character.That being said, you can also play this game almost entirely by being a talker, no problem. Or a loremaster (my favorite playthrough) or a Merchant, an Assassin, etc.. I'm looking foreward to the next game this company puts out and I hope it's in the same spirit as age of decadence.			"

Early Access Review
*The number of hours on my Steam profile does not represent actual hours spent on the game, which were many many more.*There are no elves in Age of Decadence.Most RPGs require a small (vanishingly small) commitment from the player, and offer a small reward in return. This RPG requires a massive commitment from the player. It requires reading, thinking, patience. You may have to refer to the forums (not the Steam forums but the actual developer’s forums[www.irontowerstudio.com], out there in the wild!) If you choose the way of combat, you may be forced into the fields of strategy and math. No one is going to hold your hand. In fact, you had best keep it under your cloak or it may be chopped off.The commitment is huge, yet somehow the payoff is bigger still. You will instigate cruel betrayals and double-crosses among competing, bloodthirsty factions. Study lore that doesn’t remind you of Baldur’s Gate or Dragon Age or George Martin or Tolkien. Engage in utterly unforgiving combat where success isn’t dropped like a bonbon into your hand. You are about to enter a world without filler, a land where every victory is earned.No other game has the setting, challenges, or wealth of handcrafted content this one does. I don’t mean that in combination these things make Age of Decadence unique. In each of these facets, the game is unique.constime consumingplayers weaned on RPG-lite games from Neverwinter Nights to Wasteland 2 may experience severe frustrationthough much of the writing is optional, quite a lot is not. you will have to readbecause of the complexity of overlapping storylines and hundreds of different possible scenarios, occasional minor story-related bugs are still being squashedprosan original setting inspired by real world ancient civilizationschallenging, logical, and deeply satisfying turn-based combatinsane replayability, both through a broad variety of starting professions and the staggering number of different paths one may takethe writing, the stories, the characterswait, I almost forgot the simple but elegant crafting and alchemy systems!so much more			"

												This game is killer difficult, even after 50 hours of gameplay. BUT... its really good. There's nothing like the thrill of success when challenges and obstacles are so difficult. You will likely be lost for an hour or so while you figure out the mechanics, but after that its pretty smooth sailing and the depth is incredible. Do buy.			"

												This  game is truly excellent. If you enjoy classic RPG's like Planescape Torment, Fallout, and Arcanum, you will absolutely love this game. It offers nearly unparalleled replayability, an excellent turn based combat system, and high levels of reactivity. I cannot reccomend it enough, and it has a demo (rare in this day and age).			"

												This game is one of the best RPG experiences I've had in years. It has its downs, such as the simplistic graphics(which they make up for in phenomenal portrait art), yet, that is a minor setback (as far as I'm concerned, you can get great graphics and terrible story everywhere in mainstream gaming). The sheer variety of ways to approach quests, interactions, and gameplay is impressive alone, not to mention the intruiging world and well written lore. You want combat? You've got it. You want to never touch a blade,yet topple kings? Done. As much as I love a good five paragraph long review, I will restrain myself and leave it at this: this is a great game with challanging choices and realistic consequences. Be prepared for 7-8 playthroughs and multiple death screens. Worth your time any day of the week even at full price.			"

												This game drew me in after discovering it when I pre-ordered Dead State. At first the setting drew me in, but what makes me come back for more every time is the big differences there are from play through to play through. While it certainly does not contain the amount of text and story line of a game like Planescape Torment, the story is quite compelling. I love that you are not able to find all information in one go, meaning you get to experience the events of the game from different vantage points while slowly but surely learning more about the history of the setting. I fully recommend this game to RPG lovers that don't mind challenging battles and mysterious settings.			"

												I love that in AOD you have to behave sensibly. Like if you barge into a noble's house and push your luck too far, you'll face dire consequences. Warnings are followed through, and ill-conceived plans have disastrous results. In most contemporary RPGs, if you try to manipulate an NPC and fail, you can fight your way out regardless of build. Invariably, you end up a God-like soldier, with the charisma of a movie star, who can sneak into any encampment, and take whatever you please without facing any real consequences. As a plucky Thief, the first-time I confronted a bandit camp I attempted a bogus strategy of, ""I'll let them know what I know and reap some reward from this unique dialogue option."" The leader of the encampment laughed at me, and in about 3 seconds I was deservedly staring at a game over screen for not using common sense. What the hell would a group of viscous rebels care about killing a loner who attempted to blackmail them?You actually have to play a role in this game. You can take risks but only calculated ones. It's one of the most cruel game worlds I've ever experienced.			"

Early Access Review
								Probably the best summary of this game is these four words: Was it worth it?That's the huge, huge thing that will determine your enjoyment of this game. When you die probably close to 20-30 times in a single encounter, several times when the last enemy left- and, sometimes, a single extremely powerful enemy- is basically hobbling on their patellas because everything below that has been turned into a thick, chunky mash, was it worth it when you finally win, 2 HP left but knowing that you'll wind up in the same situation again later?Was it worth it, basically knowing that most of your choices in this game, no spoiler, involve ♥♥♥♥ing someone somewhere over in the worst and most permanent ways imaginable? Was it worth it? To be honest, I can't speak for many other people, but to me, I think it was.The game might be unfair, yes, brutally so. But eventually you get into the mindset of ""losing is actually kinda fun"", you start trying out new things to see what works instead of getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because you had to restart again. This is the kind of game where you're honestly expected to do that, and it's designed so that there's enough variety in how things work, and when, that even as restrictive as it sometimes feels I wind up WANTING to try out new things to see what works.It's the kind of game that, sure, literally everyone in it I've seen so far is about as sympathetic as a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cockroach with swastikas engraved on it's brains, including the player character, but the lore and writing are good enough that, by God, I'm actually keen on playing it to the end- once it's finished, of course- just because I'm interested to see what's gonna happen.This is ultimately where ""Is it worth it"" really comes into play. It's a brutal, often frustrating game. If you ♥♥♥♥ up, you're going to die, whether it's in combat or in how you allocated points for story encounters, and the game seems about as non-chalant about it as a US president swatting a fly on TV. This is not Dark Souls, tired as that comparison is, because even that game seemed to wanna give you a chance at times. But if a game where♥♥♥♥♥♥ EVENTUALLY, comes together, where you EVENTUALLY get it and EVENTUALLY you make it through sounds appealing, I'd say give it a shot. At least the demo, since, you know, there's a demo. For once with a game.♥♥♥♥, that's enough reason for me to wanna give it a recommendation.			"

												I confess I had totaly ignored this game after I first bought it favoring other flashier games. But came back to try it looking for a decent RPG and got absolutely hooked. This is a FTL-level stealth charmer that you don't think much about until you have spent several hours on it obsessing about how casual game encounters could be done better giving different responses or wearing different gear or building your character a little differently or after changing a few aliegences. This is a really nice, surprisingly immersive charmer of an RPG. Highly recommended.I don't always write game reviews, but when I do its for exceptional game concepts.Stay Decadent, my friends!			"

												I love the idea of this game, and the writing is superb, but sadly for me I just found it too restrictive.  To have any success in combat you need to play a character who is an idiot, and hybrid play seems to pay off extremely poorly.  So you are a weakling smooth talker, an assasin, or a big brute.  When I treid to play with even somewhat hybrid roles (say 6-6-6-6-9-7) the playthroughs just really don't go well without a lot of save loading.In many ways I kind fo felt this was more of a puzzle game than an RPG.  It is hard to do well without knowing which quests are coming and when to take what upgrades.ANyway a good game that some people I am sure love, but as much as I treid to like it I just couldn't get out from under the feeling I was puzzling out my playthroughs rather than role playing them.

												This game could have been great. Its got all the cornerstones for a good rpg:+A well developed world+Interesting npcs+good leveling system+craftingBut unfortunately its missing some key elements. Or, more accurately, it has these elements in a very flawed state. There is no role playing in this RPG, its all roll playing. Nothing matters apart from where you put your stat points. The game has all the breath of an ocean and the depth of a puddle. You'll find yourself restarting again and again because you statted out your character incorrectly. You'll find yourself skipping through the same dialogue scenes over and over, wodering why you're wasting your time on this. And then you'll beat that part you were stuck on, only to realize that there is another part after it that required you to raise one particular skill in order to get a desirable outcome. If it could use your skills as modifiers for an rng, then this would all be fine. But since you're stuck with blindely guessing where to dump your exp, you'll always end up feeling cheated by the arbitrary nature of this game. I wish it was better. I would have loved this game. But as it stands, its not worth the money, even on a steam sale.			"

												Sold a ""useless necklace bead"" which I received at the very start of the game to a blacksmith. Turns out it was an ancient artifact that unlocks hidden mysteries in a magical library. Looked at my 16 hours played since the beginning and went to cry in a corner.10/10 Would regret my foolish choices again.Full Review:A Post Apocalyptic Roman RPGIf imitation is the best form of flattery, Age of Decadence (AoD) pays the most compliments to one of CRPG genre's most well known title, Fallout 2.The difference between them is while Fallout 2 revolutionised modern CRPGs with it's open world freedom, of choice, progression and approach, it relates the story from one man's perspective. AoD is more restrictive with a linear progression, and favours a more specialised approach although the hybrid talky sneaky fighter is possible albeit penalised heavily with it's difficult combat, while revealing to players the big picture, a grand story involving characters created by the player from different factions, each with their own agenda for power and dominion over 3 of the remaining strongholds of civilisation.The narrative in AoD stands out with it's discoverable lore and handling of key plot events. Such plot events can play out without the player (to forward the story in a scripted direction) should they move on without resolving them, but the standout is the interweave of such events across plays, ie. the player encounters their counterparts furthering their faction's goals when playing as a different faction, making for much replayability.Player choices tend to have ripple effects, it's often not the immediate outcome but the later consequences that players will come to regret. This is a game that you save often, and keep saves rather than overwrite them.The combat system is similar to Fallout and Fallout 2, and is punishing early in the game at low skill levels and with poor gear. Many players will find it difficult although in truth, it is no more punishing than the Fallout games, except players can't save game during fights, which means one cannot save and reload and have the best outcome on an each turn basis.Side quests are well placed to provide role playing elements, reward unique equipment, and give skill points, which one needs plenty to further main quests and pads play value to each location. There is however an extended side quest with muliple parts with it's own end game, that can be completed before or after a faction's ending, the former terminates the game before completing the faction's ending, or even be integrated with a faction's end game.Conclusion:Age of Decadence comes highly recommended personally, as a CRPG game with excellent writing and deeply thought out faction plots with choices that feels personal from the character's perspective and frustrating pain in the bum combat that's satisfying to conquer on the first or 2nd playthrough (before it becomes simply frustrating, which by then can be overcome by knowing how to get better gear earlier and better allocation of skill points).

Posted: October 21, 2015
												I've been playing this game a lot after buying it, not because its so much fun, but because I kept trying different characters to see if I could progress to the end. This game is supposed to be difficult in comparison to other top down rpg games. What I find that makes it difficult is the game is designed too restrictively. My longest progression was as an asssasin, but I reached a point where I am unable to finish any more quests because I did not spend my character points gained from exp as I'm 'supposed' to. At least as far as I can guess. I've tried other characters with diffrerent roles and I become too annoyed that i'm not spending points as per, i'm assuming, the developers expect you to. There is almost no leeway to create a variation on a character. My assassin, to continue to progress, should not have any points spent in anything except fighting stats, sneaking, alchemy, and crafting. To finish the game as an assassin you can't do it as a charismatic killer or someone who is able to do stealth kills. Want to be a lore master who can also fight at least decently? Not happening. In the end I'm finding not spending points specifically right my characters were too limited for me to enjoy completing quests.As for the dialogue its poor, generic. The cursing seems thrown in instead of natural.The combat system is done well enough, but unless I focused purely on combat stats the fights required me to reload over and over and trying new things over and over. My characters began to feel like they could not handle themselves in a regular fight. Fighting is dangerous, you can easily be killed in reality, sure. But if its causing me in game to get annoyed or frustrated instead of keen to see what I'm able to do the game ends up not being worth my time.Wait for this to be on sale.			"

												If Fallout 2 was in a Fantasy Setting this would be the game. It is hard and unforgiving for those not taking time to use everything at their disposal. The only thing I wish more of would be magic in it, it would then be more accurate to call it a mixture between Fallout 1 or 2 and Baldurs Gate. But the magic is lacking and in fantasy games I tend to want it, even if it is based on our own world where there are no demons, gods and the like to mess things up for us. (not that humans need help in destroying our world thats for sure) over all I would say 4 stars. Good and hard but not full jackpot.			"

												This is a fantastic RPG and probably one of my top favorites. The story is deep, diverse, and set in a refreshingly unique setting. If you enjoy Fallout 1 and 2 this is definitely worth a shot. Very excited to see the party based DLC. Replayabiltiy is MASSIVE in this game! I also suggest a few things:1) Play the demo first - if you like the game you can continue from your demo saves. Also make multiple characters/builds in the demo.2) Get in the habit of making MANY quick saves + manual saves.3) Don't spend skill points right as you get them, spend only what you need for the type of character you are making to pass skillchecks/combat as they appear during the game. 4) Start the game making a pure fighter then play a game as a pure talker before trying to make a hybrid. Once you get a sense of the skill checks a Praetor hybrid playthrough was VERY satisfying.5) For combat oriented characters I suggest 1H hammer + block or 1H spear + block (specifically Kadmos' Skewer) with high percpetion for aimed attacks. Swords seemed rather weak for some reason. I would suggest staying away from dodge and to only put points in block as dodge seems fairly gimped relative to block.			"

												Never written a review on here but I felt it necessary as most of the glowing reviews on here are very misleading. The game is not difficult in the sense most people would think. It requires very little thought to find the optimal solution with the information you have, and then it is simply rolling the dice a few times to beat the combat. The ""difficultly"" is the game punishes you for things you have no way of knowing will happen until they happen, but they happen the same way every time, so you reroll with the new information.The game thusly becomes basic pattern recognition and trial & error. The patterns are very simple, the options are few. It is almost like a long series of multiple choice questions. If you put in the wrong answer, try the other one until you can proceed. You keep this up until you either beat the final boss or run into a wall. You will likely run into many unbeatable walls, and reroll many times, before you even see the final boss.For me, the final straw was getting to the last boss only to be utterly destroyed by him. It took around 7 reloads to land one hit, and another 20+ reloads to give up, as he never went below the first ""slightly wounded"" state. The most I ever got was 2 rounds of combat.If the above sounds like a good time to you, then definitely buy it, but to me this game is incredibly niche and I can't in good faith recommend it to anyone.

Early Access Review
								Well, this is the Fallout i've been waiting for. Just finally got the ending i wanted, 70+hrs in game in several playthroughs not mentioning earlier tries. Pros: Story (choices really matter, very nice postnuclear, alot of artefacts and locations with ancient technology), Combat,  Replayability (REALLY fun to play the game once again as a different faction and/or different stats). Hard to play balanced character (much easier to focus on either social or combat stats/skillls), but hybrid IS possible, and reallly cool. Thief playthrough imho really shines, loremaster and praetor also have their charm. I've still to try assassin and imperial guard questlines, will start right after the review :)Cons: sometimes encountering bugs/crashes as this is not yet the final release.All in all, destined to be instant classic, really hoping for more contect to come.

												"" And like a detective in a noir yarn, you can’t help but become part of the central mystery, effecting an outcome you might not have intended."" After playing through as a Praetor my first run, this quote nails the ending I received.  Yes combat is difficult, however after a few failed attempts at playing my role, the praetor managed to survive through to quite an interesting ending and a mere body count of 2 to his name.There were several things beyond the ability of my character , yet at each stage of the game he was able to find a way to go on, even if not quite in a way I expected. I can see high replay value here as there are many other paths you can choose and each character type seems to start off in a very different situation.  If you like pnp RPG adventures , dialogue and actions that have repercussions, then get this game.			"

												Nearely every element of this game (story, combat, char building) is extremely enjoyable and highly replayable. The flow of the game might be a bit odd for some, with the character building being somewhat trial and error throughout the game, but as with any (good) CRPG you can get a lot out of it if you put the time and effort in.

Age Of Decadence - First Impression Review 
A Video of The Age of Decadence
By: rolldig

			Age Of Decadence - First Impression Review The Age of Decadence is a post-apocalyptic fantasy RPG with an ancient Roman inspired setting.		


The frequent usage of skill checks makes the noncombat gameplay more interesting and viable than in most CRPGs, but there are some situations where you simply hit up against a wall and need to save and reload until you discover what the optimal or allowable route is.Combat in Age of Decadence is quite challenging, and this may turn some people away from the game, since even though the player doesn't always resort to combat as a resolution, a lot of the NPCs do. I found the combat to be quite fun, and a step up from other single character turn based combat games, because of the different weapon types and attack type you could use. Yet it was not as good as most party based games because of the lack of variety in the tactics you can use during battles in Age of Decadence.The Age of Decadence is very hard, and much like classic crpgs, I had to start over after realizing my character build wouldn't cut it. Luckily this was a fun and painless experience because characters with different skills and attributes really do seem to play differently in Age of Decadence. Plus, the game is designed so that a lot of tedious things like walking to and fro can be skipped entirely through liberal use of fast travel, which I appreciated immensely when I played it.			"

Early Access Review
								It tries hard, but doesn't achieve what it aims for.I'd guess that dev team is small and so is the budget but whatever the reasons, after playing this game a few times in Early Access, then just recently when I heard it was almost finished (20 out of 21 zones done), I click the ""quit"" button just one last time with mixed feelings.Where so many games focus on the form but totally lack any kind of depth, I feel AoD does pretty well on the story, the context, the structural ideas, gameplay and perks. But it feels empty, it has lots of incoherent dead ends, story loop bugs and just basically things that don't make sense.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed playing it, however the first 20 minuntes of the game got me expecting a game that would have been so much more than it really is.Plus the more than extreme dependence (from my point of view) on starting stats for character creation made it a little frustrating for me. There are things that work, and things that don't, and more of the later than the former, and if you didn't build you character in one of the ""working"" builds, you more or less won't get anywhere or at least won't have any fun getting there while you fail one quest after another. Or die, and die, and die.I don't mind dying, I don't mind tough games (I love Dark Souls II) but I don't like it when it feels unfair.Again, I did like the game, at least initially, and I do like the old school feel this game has, I even loved the fighting system (though I'm pretty sure it's bugges with 97% chance to hit missing 3 times in a row, or enemies hitting me more when I lowered their accuracy than when I didn't), I do like the story too and the concept, but it's not polished, it doesn't live up to expectations.So I'm not recommending this review because had I known what I know now, I wouldn't have bought it. That doesn't mean many other players will love it though, so it's more a case of what makes you have fun, and what doesn't.			"

								Phenomenal, inspiring and on sale! One of the very few games that has kept me coming back for more even  before all of its content has been released. The developers are thorough and extremely helpful. The game, on the other hand, can be unforgivenly brutal in its insistance on realism and forcing players to think, plot, scheme and plan in advance. Superb writing and interwoven plotlines for different characters will have you replaying this game for hundreds of hours for the pure joy of discovering all of the storyline possibiities and content that it has to offer. 10 out of 10 hands down.

Early Access Review
BackgroundThe game takes place in a post-apocalyptic Roman world. You are just one man who lives or arrived in the small town of Teron. The game starts you out as one of eight different backgrounds. These can be: Preator: A member of the nobility. What more can be said ? Loremaster: A learned master in the pre-apocalyptic matters, and there's a lot more to learn Assassin: The guild of assassins is a reputable guild in this world and you can be part of them Mercenary: As a mercenary, you normally take whatever people throw at you Thief: The Thieves' guild has managed to carve out a little empire for themselves. Merchant: As a merchant, you may alter the course of history Grifter: Grifters tend to con people out of money. Drifter: You just came to Teron with the clothes on your back. No one knows you, and no one cares.Character creationYou start out by creating your character in the game. You do this by allocating attribute and skill points and no matter what your chosen background is, you may distribute these points however you want.Note that being a Jack of All Trades and a Master of None is very difficult to play in this game. Focus on a few skills and this will help you out. Since there are almost 20 skills to choose from, you will notice that it might not be good to just put one point into each of them.GameplayThe game plays out on what I would call an isometric view of yourself. (Techy people say it's better to say bird's eye-view)You control your character using the mouse and most actions are mouse based. The game is text-heavy and will require to read a lot. Luckily, the text and story are well-written and very interestingly, all of the stories interweave into one.So playing as one background will feel very different than playing as another. This is the main selling point of this game.No single playthrough will be the same due to so many different ways of completing quests.Combat is turn-based and requires a lot of planning and investment, so do not think your highly intelligent and charismatic loremaster with zero combat skills will be able to win any fight in this game.Combat includes such things as aimed attacks, nets, bolas, fire bombs and more. These should all be used if you want to win fights in this game.ConclusionFor me the major selling point of this game is all of the interweaving story arcs. I have played the game as both a Merchant and a Mercenary and the game played out completely differently based on my actions.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes turn-based combat systems and good stories and who is not afraid of challenges. I would not recommend this game to people who dislike turn-based combat systems, reading or are too much into graphics to enjoy older-looking games.Pros: Amazing writing Lots of interweaving stories and arcs Challenging combat: with old style aimed attacks a la Fallout Lots of different skills and attributes affecting almost all questlines Interesting guilds and backgrounds to choose fromCons: Old-looking graphics Some feelings of being gated sometimes due to missing just one skill point (not enough to not continue the game, but enough to feel a bit annoyed :D) "

												Age of Decadence is a difficult game to review and describe. It's fun, interesting, thought provoking and challenging, however the things that make it this way run counter to what nowadays are expected RPG conventions. Thus it's a game that has both potential to amaze and frustrate depening on who's playing and what they're expecting out of it.For instance you wouldn't expect an average RPG to be willing to throw challenging fights at you practically everytime you enter combat. That careful distribution of skill points isn't a tacked on system but your main means of survival and that you get to make choices that matter with consequences that can throw you into difficult battles your character might not be built for.This is what AoD is in a nutshell, its an RPG from an earlier era, for players who don't want to play another chosen one master of all combat styles and savior of the weak, but instead its a game focusing on integrating the player character into the game world. The game is fairly text-heavy with most of what happens outside combat explained through the dialogue window. In that sense it feels like an attempt to bring the experience of a tabletop roleplaying game onto a computer screen.For it's good sides speaks the great writing, variety of skills, challenging and thought out combat system, unique setting and lots and lots of choices along the story.As for negatives, the skill system comes across as bit arbitrary with the dialogue skill checks, some skills might seem redundant (like a bunch of dialogue only skills for persuading people that have no use outside conversation), combat can be frustrating and takes time to figure out and commit to, and it's possible to get stuck in the game through poor decisions on how to spend your skill points. Also game can be fairly short for just one run, with most of the game being there to discover on subsequent playthroughs when you gear up to meet a skill check that stumped you last time to try a different path.But don't get me wrong, AoD isn't a bad game. It's just not a game for everyone. It's highly replayable and I'm surprised by the sheer ammount of thought put into the way your choices along the story can change it along the way, there's seven factions to join but even within one faction's questline you get choices to take sides in internal disputes, options to switch sides in conflict. Can't win a fight your quest giver gave you and don't have the skills to pass the dialogue check? Maybe there's a way to cut a deal with the other party and get yourself a cozy position in their ranks instead.It's that kind of game and honestly, you don't see this level of freedom of choice often. If you think you're not one to be easily frustrated by the game's difficulty, I'd recommend you give this one a go.			"

												Fantastic game!  The way you build and play your character actually matters A LOT.  I played through the entire game using intelligence and charm to get me to the end.  Only had one fight the entire game and I beat it with an item my character was able to craft just for the fight.  I also built a character who was an honorable soldier, never backing down from a fight.  Had some really tough battles but managed to survive.  It felt like two different games.  That's why this game is so good.  It's worth at least two or three playthroughs.  Get it, play it, and love it.			"

												Way too linear. It's more like a choose your own adventure book than a video game. The 'quests' are all scripted and the dialogue option that you pick determines whether you live or die.Looking at the game descriptions, it shows that you have the option of developing a character in all these different ways and getting all these cool skills, but you can only use those skills in very rigidly defined situations. You don't even know the location of other towns down the road until you get a quest to visit them, and there's no way of questing on your own.Also, the combat is hard enough and the non-combat stuff is hard enough that doing anything other than min/maxing is suicide. So if you're running a stealthy character for example, you'd better spend every single point you can on stealth. No exceptions. You're either going to have a character that will only be able to choose a stealthy option, or you're going to have a character that has no options at all.I repeat that combat is HARD. They tell you up front that it's hard, but even a one on one fight where you're using a character entirely devoted to fighting is dangerous. And because the game is linear and there don't seem to be any random combats, you have very few even fights with which to develop your combat skills without getting killed. If I'm running a fighter and I can't fight, then what am I supposed to do?			"

												I can only recommend this great game! You will want to try playing as each of the starting character Vignettes as the replayability is amazing. Play peacefully avoiding any combat situation or play another character drowning your enemies in blood (mostly theirs)Didnt finish the game yet, but the EA experience so far was more worth it than many other full games I have played.More than 20 hours to finish the game as a fighting character. I still recommend this after playing release version.Please be prepared for a game where you cannot do everything in a single playthrough. You are supposed to play different characters more times to see it all. Its worth it.			"

												After a fair bit of playing I have to recommend this game. Not for the graphics, but for almost everything else. Finally a game where your choices matter. It is not a game that tells you your choices matter - only to later show you that the only thing that matters about them is one mission that's marginally different.In Age of Decadence your choices will define you AND the empire at large. You can bring down whole families or guilds, you can isntall an emperor. You can betray your closest friends and allies, or side with your enemies in a spur-of-the moment decision. These betrayals will have an impact on everyones life, and your own - normally the termination of your own unless you're aptly prepared. And all of this while being a very mortal character. Did I mention you're very mortal? No longer can you wade through a horde and come away unscathed, instead you end up dying in a back alley to a pair of muggers. This is a game where  you're not only told you matter, but you can see just how you matter in the changing landscape of the world.All this being said it's probably not a game for everyone, but if you love a story that actually ties you into it (did I mention that the main storylines of every class intertwine at different points throughout the game?) then this game may be for you.

												This is one of the best RPG games for the last 5 years. I know some may dissagree with me BUT here are my points.1.The story is not cliche and unlike other games this one has REALLY AWFUL LOT of different endings. You have to complete it like 1-2 times with every class/background. 2.It is really diffrent from other RPG's where you are basicly god and just take out 20-40 guys alone. Here in this game you have to be carefull even when you fight untrained robbers because when they surround you well (Load game/Exit/New game).3.The story (i mean the background story) to get the most of it you will have to play as loremaster and discover everything (which will be impossible on the 1st playtough even the 2nd soo maybe the 3rd. (You may think ''duhh why would i have to repeat and do the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over again?'' well lets just say every time you play the game you will discover 4-6 new quest and you may alter the destiny of the Great Houses).And so on, and so on if i have to say everything positive i would have already done another playtrough so yea.(just buy the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game you wont be dissapointed there IS ALMOST NOTHING NEGATIVE!!! ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE FORM BABIES WHO DONT CANT PLAY THE GAME BECAUSE ITS HARD!! which is true tbh but who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥when you have so much replayability?!?!?)Also very important i have to thank to ''donkeysaint'' who provided me with this game this may not be expensive game for you but i live in poor country. Thanks to him now you know how awesome this game is :P			"

												It's difficult for me to give this game a thumbs down. It has most everything I want in a RPG. As another reviewer posted:Difficult, deadly combat? CheckNo way to complete everything in one sitting? CheckStory with multiple angles and endings? CheckRealistic low-fantasy setting? CheckWonderful! Except...I found the gameworld lifeless. Absolutely dead. I found relatively few quests in AoD in the first two hours, instead being ported to a couple of quest locations and wandering around the rest of the time looking for something to do. The combat seemed fine - though not too challenging on my Praetor spear warrior - but I simply wasn't engaged. I killed some bandits. I killed some ruffians. I had one significant decision - whether or not to kill someone my Lord sent me to fetch - but beyond that there was little to do. The lore, what my character experienced of it, seemed promising but there wasn't enough to get much of a feel.I think my challenge with AoD - and the reason I returned it - was because it attempted to provide multiple playthroughs your character is so limited that the element of choice is removed. It's the old adage that if you have a hammer, everything in the world looks like a nail. Because you have to min max your character you are shoehorned into one solution. I built my character to succeed in combat. Therefore, the game has determined that I MUST pursue a combat-oriented solution to every problem. That's not role playing. That's being dicated to by the game design and there's a big difference.At least that was my impression in the first two hours. I hit that critcial point - continue or bail out - and I decided that even at 75% off that I really didn't want to continue. I wasn't engaged. The systems were nice - combat was challenging, nice crafting options, etc. - but I felt it to be less than the sum of its parts. Now maybe it gets more engaging later. Maybe it opens up for players down the road. But I wasn't feeling it enough to want to give it that chance. So in my view, this game is a thumbs down.			"

												A different sort of RPG, one which doesn't put a spotlight on PC nor caters to player's every whim. You'll have to play multiple times to piece together the story of the world and reasoning behind certain polt events. Massive turn-off points for an average gamer are these: no party members. No awkward romances with them (in fact, no romances at all). Combat is an option, but requires either careful preparation or a very specific character build, preferably both. And no matter what path you'll chooose, you'll have to read. A lot.So, definitely not for everyone, you'll either hate it or love it. Try the demo first.			"

												5/5This is a very good game for what it is. There has never been any RPG quite like it. Specifically, this game has   * CHOICES & CONSEQUENCES  * TONS OF WELL WRITTEN DIALOGUE  * DEEP QUESTS  * GREAT CHARACTER PROGRESSION  * AMAZING SETTING/THEMEYour initial impression may be to put the game down in frustration... I sure do! But then I pick it up and enjoy the hell out of it. Perhaps your character lacked the combat or social skills in order to accomplish an objective in the way you wanted. Get used to it! Don't expect your Assassin to be a mechanical genius.This is a dark, gritty, and 'hard' game that requires multiple playthroughs in order to unlock all the content.			"

												I approached the game expecting a good but flawed rpg, with a fascinating setting and some brilliant ideas turned down by being too much ""hardcore"" and try-hard just for the sake of it. Instead, I found out a great game, with a complex world populated by believable characters and factions that pursue their goals instead of hand-holding the player through the campaign, a very interesting multi-layered plot and world background that will require more than one playthrough to be fully discovered, a solid turn-based combat system that poses some real challenges to the player (especially to the beginners) but, contrary to the common belief, is not impossibly hard once you understand its rules (and also it's completely optional if you play a ""talker""), an outstanding reactivity to your choices that results in a great replayability (since each new game will likely be different), and also a very good writing.Granted, it's a harsh and unforgiving game and your PC will die a lot, especially if you try to play it like every other rpg or if you put your skill points with little care (in that case you may eventually find yourself in the impossibility of finishing the game). You'll need to save a lot, and invest your skill points wisely (a simple tip for the beginners is to specialize and go either full talker or full fighter, hybrid characters are more difficult to manage and require more knowledge of the systems to be played effectively).It's definetely not a game for people who thought Dragon Age: Origins to be too hardcore for their tastes, nor for people who want to play the hero and defeat evil. Nonetheless, it's a unique and very well-crafted game that brings some fresh air on the rpg scene, and deserves to be played by anyone who is willing to try a thematically mature and challenging game, and play one of the best recent rpgs. It comes with a demo, so you can also download it and see for yourself if it's your kind of game.			"

Early Access Review
								Story and Roleplay-The Age of Decadence is an excellent RPG where the actions you take truly matter.Now I know this is said of every RPG under the friggin' sun nowadays but don't roll your eyes yet Mr./Mrs. RPG-fan.You might have a different background in some game while going on the big quest afterwards making it a game with multiple beginnings but essentially one storyline.Or maybe 5 minutes before the game ends you have the only opportunity to seriously affect the ending.Mid-game events don't only serve to move the plot along but can have sometimes the single biggest effect on the ending and latter part of the game.In The Age of Decadence the background of your character informs the ENTIRE playthrough.Add to that the ability to double and triple cross your starting faction and you have a truly staggering amount of replayability.And not just boring old replayability where you do the same♥♥♥♥♥♥slightly differently this time around.Playing as a sneaky thief,a persuvasive merchant or a beefcake warrior are very different experiences.Combat and the lack thereof-In The Age of Decadence it is entirely possible to get all or at least most of the endings without ever fighting anyone or by doing almost mothing but fighting.I first thought that you have to choose one or the other in order to succeed but thankfully after the SP changes Hybrid builds are easily doable allowing for a full range of violent and non violent options for you character,within reasonable limits of course,you can't become a worldclass diplomat and absolute killing machine but a little bit of both is doable,effective and of course fun :D.Regarding the text adventures you can rest assured that in most cases you will be given a way out involving various non-combat skills.Also if you fail a check you can still save yourself later so don't worry if everything doesn't go perfectly from the start.The combat is turn based and reminds me heavily of Fallout 2 and other games where you have a certain number of action points to do various things.The fights are often brutal but possible to win if your character is strong enough.Don't expect to destroy 5 thugs on your own with a copper dagger out in the open.Go into an alley where their numbers matter less and fight them one on one,with poison and a bomb etc. basically you'll have to think tactically and use your brain instead of just spamming attacks until everything in a 2 meter radius is dead.This review is long enough as it so to recap:AOD is an RPG where you have immense impact on the entire storyline and not just details of it while offering you a detailed and interesting wolrd filled with mysteries and adventures.It's fun no matter if you're playing a diplomat,fighter,thief or merchant with it's variety of solutions for all kinds of cool missions.

												Tremendous replay value. Choose your own adventure type gameplay. I often have multiple saves so I can go back and be a jerk. The story is incredibly well written and a lot of fun. The price may seem a bit steep at first glance but it's well worth the money. You can choose a non-violent path to unlock bits of the story but you'll need multiple playthroughs to get things done. Die. A whole lot. It's great fun. Don't worry about being good, just suck for your first few playthroughs until you get the hang of it.			"

								If you're tired of the overblown, factory-assembled  ""AAA"" games made for the lowest common denominator, and want instead a game that's carefully crafted and well thought out, where both the world and the plot make sense, where the world and its denizens actually react and change in response to your actions, moreover a game that has some real challege and bite to it, this is the game for you.

												Okay this is my view after hours of game play...This game Can be frustrating but its fun! To save time on trying to review every point good or bad let me sum up what to do and what not to do....1. Do not treat this game like any conventional rpg like Balder's Gate... It wll not work.2. Do not try to multiclass your profession(jack of trades master of none) it will not work in the end. But major in a class 85% full spec to 15% rationed in a minor( I recommend that other minor to be ""Lore"" skill since you will need it to understand the strange things in the world.3, Choose your ""Starting Attributes"" wisely... Many encounters which are ""set"" in game will require ""attribute checks""(I do not mean ""skills  checks) and if for an example you are a warrior and have very poor strength...then dont think you are gona do well in battles swinging that huge Axe..or move that heavy object...If you are a warrior think like one....Spec your character... like one...""Attribute"" gains are very very rare...and temporary even in items...4. Finally...and this is the most important......Save often Before every encounter and Never spend all of your gained ""skill"" points right away on skills...Pool them till you know you need them in certain encounters to over come a skill check...Sure you could youtube or google every encounter to figure what you need par se to over come every encounter but...whats the fun in that unless you are stuck.Think of this game like a story driven ""choice selection dialog"" that success is determined not just by your choices but your selected starting attributes and skill selection scores that will ultimately lead your character to a finality in a chain of selected outcomes...wether or not you ""succeed"" or ""fail"" at your selections ...unless its combat...which is win or loose...but the game IS NOT focused on combat...(which is turned based).The game has great replay quality because each class can have different outcomes and the story npcs react differently to each class and choice rewards can vary...Edit: Never use your Whetestones/Poison Herbs/Healing Salves Unless you must for an encounter...they are very limitted and rarely ever respawns at vendors...use inns and healers to heal your character and buff weapons during hard to pass boss fights only...

												Interesting 'Old School' RPG where choice really matters-- certainly not for everyone.  Takes a few playthroughs with different characters to experience the story and or alternative paths.  Might frustrate people that you can reach a dead end or solutions don't pop up depending on your build.  Truth is that you simply can't experience the story with one character.  Combat is meant to be tough-- you are not a hero but you are playing a true RPG where you are a believable actor in a story with the ability to shape upcoming events.  Be prepared to read walls of text, this is a pick your own adventure in a dark world.  Graphics are servicable but dated.  One hint, save often and save character points rather than spending them immediately (you never know when you need a point or two to progress).			"

												For those old-school people, that love D&D, Baldurs' Gate, ect this is a jewel, a masterpiece. The game sucks you in and blows you away with the smoothness of the story, combat system and variety of ways you can go. I didn't get that feeling of adventure since Morrowind, they just don't make game like this anymore.  Yes, it is not easy, though some builds can make this game more of interactive book, others - like real good tabletop tactics.If your not that into graphics and wanna feel how games used to be, this is a 100% buy. Even if you're a casual player this might be interesting and rewarding as long as you keep away from hybrid builds.Treating this as a true Role-Playing game, this is 10/10.			"

												The Age of Decadence is a surprising gem. I didn't expect it be so good, so it's certainly a surprise. It's a wonderful RPG though, and a great roleplaying experience is bound for any who play. 10/10Pros:*Great Combat System (may take some time getting used too)*Great Soundtrack*Great World, Lore, Story, and CharactersCons:Nothing of note, though this RPG is absolutely not for everyone.------------------------------------The world itself is rather gritty and has a nice realistic display of combat, so it doesn't paint you as this amazing hero who can destroy ten people at once. The combat system is turn-based and hard hitting, turning into a blast once you get a hang of the system. Though, combat can be brutal... luckily, thanks to the wonderful development of the game, every instance of combat can be avoided. Which is very refreshing in the RPG world. It's clear the people who made the game care about it and put a lot of effort in it, with the world being highly believable and character's dialogue on point. The world and lore is wonderfully portrayed and something that was new for me. The story, characters, and places are surprisingly memorable, and though the graphics are dated, I enjoy them immensely. They're nostalgic of older RPGs and the style itself is pretty. The way the game does dialogues is well done, with the abilities and skills coming in handy and the little box that pops up when talking having a certain amount of charm. As for sound, the soundtrack is great, with beautiful tracks to go with towns and exploring, and epic ones for the right moments.  If you like RPG's, I definitely give this one a recommendation.			"

												+The story is great in giving you that special feeling of a dying late Roman Empire. +Very interesting combat system(slightly similar to Fallout 2)+The visual style is unpretentious and firm: no eye-gouging color blazing here - like in many modern rpg-s, which is better for dipping inside this game and acossiate yourself with your character.+The game could be very challenging at some points - but it gives you a great satisfaction if you won.+Great soundtrack also.- Journal is not detailed enough, most of your important quest interactions are not documented at all, some quests could be failed just because you missed some string in the conversation - had to search the internet to get it.Would be a very nice feature just to see the full conversation history in journal.Overall: 10/10 definitely worth the money			"

												This game is amazing. I've already played it over 60 hours, and I still haven't gotten very far in any of the main house/guild questlines, and I haven't finished the game once. I've been so enthralled by all the options, that I've spent all that time trying different characters, backgrounds, builds and approaches to quests and problems. Bit by bit I'm uncovering lore about the world across the different characters and the rich history is opening itself to me. This is a world with mystery and intrigue.The 28e price tag may seem a lot for an indie RPG, but I can say that the game has so much depth that it easily provides more value to an RPG player than most other options.

												I heard about this game years ago, filed it away to keep track of it, and was overjoyed to see it pop up on steam last week.  Having watched a few videos and reading about it I was feeling mixed about picking it up - something about the combat seemed less than fluid, but I like to support indie devs as I'm usually enjoy these games than AAA titles.Started the tutorial getting used to combat and found it to be quite intuitive - having played Fallout 1/2 many times I loved having aimed attacks.  Shortly after I started a new game as what I read was an easier combination - mercenary/pure fighter.  I restarted that role several times and I noticed depending on stats/skills I would discover secrets, and have new dialogue options each time which was great.  At this point I've put 2.5 hours into the game, died and restarted ~7 times trying out a wide variety of play-styles and classes and have seen just how different the very first part of the game can be based off background, stats, and skills.  Dialogue is top notch and the lore is also very interesting. The gameworld itself is also very dark - without spoiling anything I was told to kill a mark but let the gentler side of me try and help only to be backstabbed and killed.  Playing a goody-two shoes so far hasn't worked out for me (even a good-half shoes :)).As all the reviews say though, this game is not easy at all - fighting one-on-one is challenging enough initially, 2 or more is usually a death sentence.  Highly recommended			"

												GREAT game. Story driven RPG that is deep, mysterious, fulfilling -- these are things you wish you could say about every good RPG yet so seldom can. I'll start by saying it does everything a game like the original Fallout & II do right, but it has other things going for it too! A crafting system that is actually intuitive and fun, and dare I say things you won't find in other RPGs -- for instance, the game was DESIGNED for replayability... you can CAUSE the events in one questline as a certain character depending on who you associate and in another playthrough prevent or deal with the consequences or such actions. Since the main questlines all run parallel to one another -- even if you're replaying you are forced to make choices like if you ally with these folks, will it turn bad for you or others down the line? And the WORLD that the story takes place in is amazing. At first it seems to be the twilight of the roman empire after some kind of magical apocalypse, or whatever superstitions people proclaim fell the empire -- but it turns out to be SOOOO much more, and learning all about it is both difficult and rewarding. The game also has refreshing elements in it's narrative -- life is cheap and death is final. Many many games, RPGs in particular try to create this atmosphere but few managae like AoD has. It challenges your moral flexability and unlike most games which give you the choice of being a baby-eating sociopath or ""the good guy"" -- this game REVELS in the grey areas. You can be a good guy who does bad things for the right reasons. You can be an abberant opportunist, you can be a principled person who despite their morals has to make a couple of really difficult decisions -- or have situations thrust upon them that make a price or courage of such convictions evident. The game has fighting, exploration, depth, consequences, VAST agency, time-critical events, loot, and a rich character/skill system that ties everything together.Overall, masterfully done and I will watch this developer for other things coming down the line. Highly Recommended!			"

												A short/medium length game for a single play through. But the depth of character creation, character development, and worldly possibility keeps you wanting more. As you play there will be things you can't do, places you can't go, people you can't convince. And you'll remember each one and every failed attempt in an internal struggle when trying to design your second play's character.Possibly the best CRPG to come out in 15 years. Will play again.			"

												This is an excellent old-school turn-based RPG.  The game world is very imaginative, the dialog and quests are interesting in the own right for the writing, besides usually being fun and challenging, and the production values are quite good for a 1-man show indie product.   On top of this, you can be pretty much any type of character, including those who consider the pen to be more mighty than the sword.  You can go quite far without getting your hands too ditry if you know what to say to the right people, but OTOH you can also hack your way to the top.  Bottom line:  there's a huge amount of stuff to do here, considering the quest lines for each of the classes and all the side quests, so there's gobs of rep;lay value.On top of this, the world evolves around you due to both your acts and omissions.  This is a living world full of powerful NPCs pursuing their own agendae, driving change. whether you want it or not.  You have to surf the wave of change as best you can.  Each path you take gives you access to influence only certain evets---the others happen (or not) without you, and you have to adapt to those consequences.  Thus, even though you might ""win"" a chapter for whichever faction you're focusing on, the other factions will react and adjust, and you'll always find things challenging in the next chapter as a result.  Which means the endings are quite varied and there's all sorts of replay opportunity.One of the best ways to picture this is that you get different versions of the same first mission for different classes.  A merchant comes to the starting town and will have various encounters during his stay.  If you're a fighter, you can get hired to guard him from theives and assassins.  If you're a thief or assassin, you'll have to deal with the bodyguard fighter.  The various ""hands clean"" classes also become involved.  And depending on how things play out, the consequences can be dramatic either way.  And this is just the start of the convolutions.			"

												For those who just wants some keywords, this game encompasses spirit and quality similar to the titles Nox, Arcanum and Fallout1-2. It presents a postapocalyptic world in the past, low magic married with technology and many different main story arcs of different spirit: fighting, deceiving, assassinting, thieving, learning. I would say that this game leans more towards a RPS, that is a role playing simulation.  It asks you to act rationally, rather than epically. If for instance you choose the path of a warrior, in the start of the game you are simply a mediocore character that knows how to handle a weapon so so. This means that if you are getting into a fight with a thug that you see in the street, you better have some strategy or some plan on how to beat that guy. Otherwise if you just charge on and start slashing at him/her, chances are you will probably die. For this reason the game offers you a wealth of strategies very specific to each class of weapon that you choose. Weapons are no longer about damages and resistances but is about strategies. While directly slashing at a legionnaire with a dagger feels like chipping a wall, if you use the correct strategy and if you are skillful enough then you simply open him up like a can of tuna fish. And also for this reason the game does not randomly throw enemies on your feet. Every enemy you meet have some reason why they are there. They are not like a random encounter, it is you who is more like a random encounter for them. So yes, the game asks you to behave as you would in a real life situation but in a fantastic setting. If you were really a fighter skilled in using a dagger, you must use every bit of your skill in order to survive against an opponent who is a seasoned fighter, otherwise you will die. You must fight like you mean it, not you click it. And combat is of course by no means the only option. This game deserves the title role playing simulation because you can literally finish the game with 0 combat with only speaking your way around, by deceveing or persuading people, by impersonating people, by intimidating people, by forging documents. There are more than atleast 4 different story lines which you can follow, be it a fighting path, an assasinating path, a persuading path, a burglary path or learning the secrets of universe path. In this aspect this game is quite akin to Nox with the exception that it has more than 2 possible different paths that you can choose to finish the game. It is an ambitious project, quite unique. It is first of its kind in a very long time. With a larger dev team, this game could have been easily the best game of the last decade. But due to time limitations, I think the devs could not give the desired amount of attention to each quest line. The only thing that feels unsatisfactory is the length of the game, it definitely leaves you desiring for more and it definitely could have been much longer had the devs had the right resources. But this game shows that what people would deem as impossible, is indeed possible. And should be pursued.  It is quite a refreshment from the late trend of making games that is guaranteed to never challange the mental capacity of the player. I hope the devs of this game expand their team even more with like minded individuals and makes game on an even grander scale so that my children don't have to suffer games made for morons. Thanks.

												Rather than a typical RPG, its more like a very complex choose your own adventure storybook, with a well integrated combat game attached to it.The overaching mystery is rather stunning and satisfying, its masterfully woven into the underlying story, with tons of different perspectives and snippets.The human stories beneath them, however, start strong but falter towards the end (too many choices to be accounted for, too drastic and hasty a push towards the end).The writing is also impeccable, not too long as to be boring, not too short as to leave you clueless, generally appropiate tone to each character, with a suffocating atmosphere of despair (fitting with the setting), and with enough black humor to prevent the story becoming crushing.Its also not too long, a playthrough is around 10 hours, and two playthroughs can be achieved with very little repeating content. Even more is possible if you happen to love it, I tried 4, though the latter two were sped up using cheats to skip the 'already seen' parts.Shockingly, the game has superb combat for such a melee based rpg with no magic, all 6 weapons are genuinely distinct and viable, with multiple attack styles making you question your tactical choices all the time. Strategic investments into alchemy and crafting can be extremely impactful as well.The game has good music, good artwork (if sparse), though given the lengthy development of this game, the 3d world looks like the typical budget unity rpg, Its tolerable but certainly not pleasing to the eyes.Overall, would definitely recommend if you like stories, this one definitely branches in many many ways, not just the mainstoryline but also every possible sidequest. But if you want a more casual or combat oriented RPG, go play divinity 2 or any of the three mainstream RPGs (TES, Fallout and mass effect).			"

												I dont normally write reviews but I had to do it for AoD. This game surprised me, first because it was HARD. And I'm the kind of person that usually chooses hard settings in whatever i play. But also because it was VERY rewarding once you started to figure out how to play it properly. What i love the most is that you can play it very efficently without combat. I have made a playthrough of a thief without a single fight in the combat system but rather by boosting the right skills to be able to resolve problems within the chat system, being able to use your skills to take out the target without opening the combat system really gives the feeling of a sleek, agile fighter. Overall a strong buy and even though the story might be a bit confusing in the first playthrough you get to see more and more areas of it with different storylines and then it really grows together.

												A pretty cool, albeit short, cRPG, which takes after some of the best titles of old. If i had to describe it in three words, I'd say that it is ""Roman Empire Fallout"".Pros:- Interesting and uncommon setting.- Lots of options to approach most of the quests.- Rather nonlinear story progression.- Brutal combat.- World full of selfish аsshоlеs. You can be one of them and con other аsshоlеs.Cons:- Rather short. Probably inevitable, considering the small dev team and lots of branches, but still it saddens me.- Vast majority of non-combat interactions happen purely inside dialogue windows. Sometimes it plays more like a VN than an RPG.- Skillchecks, skillchecks, skillchecks. The success of most interactions relies purely on my character's stats and not on the OOC choice of words. Maybe that's a feature.- World full of selfish аsshоlеs. I've met at best three named NPCs whose fate I gave any damn about. Also one unnamed (IIRC), but a very well-mannered demon.All in all, a good game. If you like cRPGs and аsshоlеs clad in loricae musculata, you should definitely buy it.			"

								I have to say one of the most unique, intrigueing, and engaging games I have ever played.  If you don't like thinking, don't play.    This game is brutal if you don't consider your moves or plan ahead.  Try to be a hero and you will end up dead.  It is fantastic and hits you in the head with a cold taste of reality, ironically in a strange fantasy game.  I love this eerie game.  Well Done Iron Tower Studio.			"

												So I don't normally write reviews but here goes. I originally found out about AoD via word of mouth from forums talking about the ""RPG renaissance"" that seems to be going on lately. The first time I tried AoD, I liked the atmosphere, I liked the story, I liked the character creation and the combat system but got frustrated with the actual difficulty of combat and lack of permissibility when allocating skill points (more on that later).  I started off with your run-of-the-mill mercenary turned Imperial Guard fighter, going spear and shield, and investing almost exclusively in that since I read that you should specialize since you might run into problems later on, the problem was I figured this guy to be a semi-intelligent soldier rather than just a mass of muscle with something akin to a brain on top, and I was annoyed how even the early checks seemed to be offlimits and felt myself being locked out of A LOT of gameplay because of my decision to go with a pure fighter. Whatever, I just embraced it and just purused combat oppurtunities, the problem was my grasp of the combat system was also terrible so I soon found myself starting to resent both the game and my character creation decisions. I managed to get some upgrades that made the fighting a bit easier and when I got a little farther, the combat became a lot more intense. I soon found myself face to face with a wall I was led to believe shouldn't had happened due to my build. So I chalked it up as a bad game and left it to collect virtual dust in my steam library. Fast forward some months and my hunger for an RPG eventually led me to try this again. This time though, after recalling certain problems I had in the past, I decided to attempt a hybrid assassin build (with a little spoiler-free help from online) and was surprised with how painless my experience was compared to last time. Were the fights still hard, oh yes. Were there skill checks I just couldn't pass? definitely. But I never got the idea that I was forced into playing as someone who I didn't want to play as and was rewarded with getting a taste of this amazing setting. Right after I finished that playthrough, I started another mercenary only this time I actually tried to make it that ""smart soldier"" I pictured originally, and now that I knew more about the game mechanics, the combat scenarios, the skill checks, I was actually able to experience a huge amount of the game (with some parts naturally having to be missed) and got an even better experience overall.In short; the game takes a little bit of time to get used to but it is SO worth it. Don't be put off by comments like ""If you don't specialize you'll never make it"" or ""the combat is impossible"" and instead just play the game, and if something doesn't work out, take some time, possibly reroll or maybe search for a workaround and try again. This game was made with multiple playthroughs in mind and it really starts to show when you compare previous playthroughs with one another. Definitely one of the best games I've played recently with one of the most unique settings I've ever encountered in an RPG.			"

												As hard as Dark souls.. As unforgiven as Wasteland 1-2..  This is a cool game.. But i got to say.. It's trial and error. All the time.. Die.. Retry.. Die Retry.. Over and over.. Save allot!!.. But Yes I do recommend this game.. Still I don't like the combat in it.. Your always out numberd.. You almost never have anyone fighting at your side.. Meaning you get gangbanged all the time. And theres no indication on if you should do heavy, medium or light attack meaning if your gona hit or miss feels like a roll of the dice.. This game probedly is skillfull and I just suck but so far I feel like its RNG and completly luck based in combat.. On the other hand you can use your skills in the text scenarios.. Like use Critical strike to insta kill someone before a fight begun.. Or impersonate + sneak to get inside unoticed.. Allot to experiment around with.. I played assassin.. I enjoyed myself allot.. Still feel there must be made some changes to the combat.. Everyone keep telling me its Trial and error and should be so.. But If i have to die 5 times every encounter.. Then I can say already this game will become very tedious and frustrating.. As in games like darksouls where you could if you where good win fights in your first try.. here it feels like you must go in.. Get completly ♥♥♥♥ed.. Go back to a save before.. Go and Rearm up on cheap poison, net and necesary stuff to even have a chance.. And many times that wont help as you dont got enough AP ( action points ) to attack and use thos items.. Maybe i should go as some kind of warrior.. I don't know.. Like 7 more classes in the game.. Still I do recommend this game.. It is a blast when your making progression..			"

												Nope. Nope. Nope. Very failed effort. Compelling at first, but hardly playable all the way through. I would hazard to guess that many of the positive reviews were written by people who didn't finish the game.One reviewer pointed out that ""tedium isn't difficulty"" and I would like to echo that statement. Repeatedly telling the player ""sorry; you made the wrong character"" doesn't make the game difficult it just makes it a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ There isn't anything compelling as a role playing experience to find out that you should have put 7 points in disguise and 5 in fast talk (also to make things more inscrutable this game has, I think, fast talk *and* convince). There is no way of telling what skills you're going to need investing in and are bound to hit several roadblocks because of that. If you don't play a fighting character you're still bound to get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked at some point and if you do play a fighting character you won't be good enough of a fighter to make it through. I played a fighter (did the assassin plot where you don't have a choice not to fight; it isn't as sneaky as you might think: the assassin ends up being a brawler having to repeatedly take on 6+ opponents at once, something the game literally tells you not to attempt) and most fights I got through by reloading and retrying at LEAST 10 times each.Any given character will be able to progress through I'm guessing about a quarter of the quests due to insufficient skill checks and I see that the gamemakers intended that and I see what they were going for but it doesn't make for compelling gameplay to be told after sinking many hours into the game ""sorry: wrong character build. Try again.""			"

												This game reminds me of playing Fallout 2 back in the day. It has a story and you do make progress towards an ending... but you get a whole ton of freedom to do other things along the way as well as a ton of different ways to do pretty much everything. Not a lot of RPGs let you really approach the game in so many different ways, I did a grifter run where the only two fights I got into were me shanking a scholar to death in an abandoned house (was a close fight!) and me hiding behind some guards as they fought off some guys who were trying to kill me.Possibly the best RPG ever made. I just hope Iron Tower Studios keep making more amazing RPGs like this and can make them even bigger. If you like games like Fallout 1 & 2 then I highly suggest giving this game a shot, you can always try the demo first.			"

												This is an incredible game, one of the best crpg's I have every played. With such a gripping story, no matter what playthrough I follow, I always find myself trying to learn more about the game's mysterious and gripping lore. It also heavily encourages finding creative ways to complete tasks as combat is HEAVILY discouraged, and at a point to a detriment, I feel the game would be more enjoyable if combat was not so brutal and impossible. Regardless there are still plenty ways to get around combat. Also this is a very dark setting as well, it really gives you a sense of lost glory and despair and the actions you perform and witness reflect that very well, many people will die, including you. As for the replayability it excels in this as well, every class is a breath of fresh air and offers new perspective on the plot and can even drastically alter the plot in ways you couldn't excpet. You will find yourself playing every class at least once. Overall it is simply an amazing CRPG that needs more attention as this is quite a hidden gem.TLDR: Story's Great, Combat's very difficult, Replayability is High			"

												This game is flipping fantastic. The combat is not easy. It's also not difficult for the sake of being *omg so hard*, it's just fairly easy to die when people are swinging swords in your direction is all.The character creator is not easy. You probably should roll new guys a few times while you get the hang of what works and what doesn't.Other than that, the game gives you a ton to play with. The main story line is fairly short by design. The balance is that replaying with a different character setup will result in a dramatically different gameplay experience. The first time you play, you might rescue a guy, then help him get to a place, then join up with some other guys and go on an adventure with them. In the next game you might murder the same character from before, and be rebuffed when you try to join the band of soldierboys, instead doing something totally different. A character based on intellect might find out hidden secrets that a character based on bashing skulls might not even know are out there. The skull basher, on the other hand, will have unique things happen that are totally invisible to the pacifist. (Pacifist playthrough is definitely possible)The setting is great. The writing is great. The gameplay is great. Take a little time and get into the game, read the dialogs, try different characters, and you will feel the love that the tiny dev team spent years pouring into this game.			"

												TL;DR below. ~~~Lets start like this: if what you're interested in a game is live action, graphics or orchestral music or in short, ''today'' games ""standard"" this is not for you.If you enjoy a good game, with tons of interesting reading, information and lore, I have no idea why you didn't buy this already.This game is both wide and deep. And when it comes to RPGs thats what you really need.It offers a very detailed world (in its lore), real life situations that only require you to put your head to them.It's merciless and its beautiful.It hosts many locations with a lot of information about them. It lets you live your life in a decaying society while posing the option to unravel the mysteries and stories of the past if you only want to.I really find it hard to describe in words, but the stories and texts are very well written. The locations are remarkeably beautiful (to the graphics' lengths) and it has a lot of replayability and hidden mysteries.~~~TL;DRPros:+ amazing story+ high replayability+ decisions that really matter+ real life unforgiving+ incredible lore+ combat system that will make you tear your eyes out+ full of mysteries and secrets in the world+ an amazing and community responsive team that worked on this game for flippin' 10 years, they earned it.Cons:- not a fancy graphic game- no music- easy to play but slightly hard to master (especially combat)- requires a -lot- of reading and understanding what you read and do "

												Many will love this game, but it's not meant for everyone.Fortunately this is one of the few Steam games that comes with a full-blown free demo.  The demo gives you the complete first chapter of the game: if you like it you can transfer your saves after you buy the game.  The demo download button is located on the right side of the screen, just above the basic description.The game is a bit of a cross between Fallout 2 and the Dark Eye Northlands trilogy.The game is not set in Late Antiquity.  It uses the imagery of the Roman Empire as a shorthand device for describing a fallen civilization, but it's not Rome and doesn't pretend to be (ancient Romans didn't hang out in front of buildings smoking cigarettes).The game has a lot of text, and you need to read it and remember it to understand what is going on.The game can be played as a fighter, a talker, or some combination of the two.  Combat is unforgiving, but not really that difficult once you understand how it works.  The key is to specialize and to play the game the way it was designed to be played.  Each weapon in the game is slightly different from every other weapon.  This is one of the few games where the difference between weapons is functional rather than cosmetic.  Different weapons require different tactics, and the game comes with a combat trainer that allows you to try out most of the different weapons and armors so that you can figure out how to use them.Your decisions and skills will change the plot and plot options as the game unfolds. There are many different career paths and each one only shows you a fraction of some of the bigger stories going on in the background of the game, some of which you may manage to influence, and some of which you may not.Even within the different career paths, you can try playing as a fighter, a talker, or some combination of the two.  And not all of the possible combinations are good ideas.If you like this kind of thing you'll find the game tremendously addicting.  Play the demo and find out whether you like it or not.  I didn't expect to like it, but after playing the demo I was hooked.			"

tl;dr -> I levelled enough to foolishly believe I was a god, then got absolutely rekt when I got ambushed by a group of beggars. 11/10 brutal, gritty, realistic combat.I received a review copy of this game and was very excited to play it because I adore turn-based role-playing games (RPG), especially ones that take place in a post-apocalyptic setting (ex: Metro, Fallout, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchises). I was thoroughly satisfied with my gameplay experience.If you like post-apocalyptic settings, turn-based combat, exploring open worlds, dialogue trees, immersive role-playing, and gritty storylines, then you will really enjoy this game. The game takes place in a world where magic and science are relics of the past, and the current populace has resorted to medieval-age weaponry and equipment.The aesthetics are very good – the amount of detail in the character models and environment is high. Equipping different weapons and armor will change the appearance of your characters – a rather simple feature I love seeing in any game. The sound effects and music are good and add to the hardcore, post-apocalyptic atmosphere. The story is great and each character starts of a bit differently (a la Dragon Age: Origins). I really like how each person you can play as offers a different perspective of the overarching story. For example, if you roll (create) a mercenary, you will be tasked with protecting a merchant – who later gets assassinated. If you roll an assassin, you will be the person doing the dark deed. Decisions are far-reaching in Age of Decadence (AoD), and new missions can open/close as a result of your actions. One of the game’s critical strengths is brutal realism – if you try battling in a 1 versus anything-more-than-1 match, you will most likely die. The game is unforgiving in its realism.Controls are easy to learn and typical of turn-based strategy games. The tutorials are very helpful and each element of the game (there are many) are explained in detail. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with turn-based strategy game – the most challenging part of AoD is accepting that you will never be a godlike character, and trying to fight an army by yourself will result in your demise.Gameplay begins with you creating a character, and the role (merchant, assassin, thief) determines your main mission and reputation with the numerous factions in the world. Next, you will be introduced to a set of tutorial missions that will quickly get you accustomed to many relevant mechanics that you will be using to progress. The game emphasizes that you do not always have to resort to violence, and a bit of guile and willpower can help you complete events without bloodshed; many of the side opportunities that result in combat are extremely difficult.During combat, everything is turn-based, with higher initiative characters moving first – this is why trying to take on a gang by yourself can be near suicide. You can try to move/attack during your turn, and the artificial intelligence (AI) is proficient enough to use advancedtactics against you – like closing the distance if you are a ranged fighter, flanking/surrounding you, and trapping you in place with nets. Fortunately, combat is not the main lure of AoD, as plenty of dialogue events have more depth if you have the associated skills (like being able to bluff your way – with disguise and persuasion – into an enemy camp).Overall, the gameplay and story are interesting enough to keep you entertained, especially if you are a lover of branching storylines and turn-based strategy in a post-apocalyptic setting. The game is worth trying for both veterans and new people to the genre.Highly recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue ReviewsMy Website[theroguereviews.com] "

												Tl;dr - Turn based goodness with great tactical combat & a deep story that has multiple ways to complete each mission insuring replayability. Pro's - + Turn based combat w/aimed shot tactics+ Multiple ways to complete each quest+ Character building+ Interesting story to keep reader interested+ Quick travel option to go back to everywhere you once visited. (Including shops.)+ Replayabilty Con's - - Steep learning curve when building your character if you haven't researched the game before jumping in- Combat is not as easy as your typical CRPG, casuals may get turned off- No voice acting, lots of reading- Graphics, while they work for this game, may be outdated for some- Completionist may be turned off as you can't do everything the game has quest wise with one playthrough Great game here.  You can see there's been a lot of time & effort put into the creating/refining of this game.  As a huge turn based combat fan, this is what I've been looking for in a mass of quasi turn-based games likes Pillars & Sword Coast Legends. (Pillars is great, Sword Coast...meh)The elation of winning those huge battles that you're against multiple enemies with a handful of HP left or ""1"" like I did last night is awesome.  I yelled ""Yes"" while my family was sleeping.  ;)If you're a turn based strategy fan and like a tough challenge with a deep story that can be played multiple times with multiple types of characters, look no farther.

Early Access Review
								This game supplies old-school rpg goodness with modern touches and adventure-game inspired vignettes. It is ROLE PLAYING at it's truest -- the character you create will be capable of the role you made him for, and not your whims. however in playing with just 2 different character classes I've already seen at least 6 different ways the events of the first town can play out, and that's just scratching the surface. Normally I dont care to replay games in order to see the *might have been*, because in most games it doesnt alter the overall plot arch that much. In this AOD every major choice is cause for nailbiting and a compulsive desire to try again and see how else it could have turned out, and it's always interesting enough to be worth it. Better gimmick for replayability than the Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter reincarnation routine. Writing is excellent, setting is a fun take on low-tech post-apocalyptic (it's not the Hercules Adventures tm that it may look to be at first) combat is hardcore but totally optional for many characters. No one is your friend, least of all your friends. 10/10, gave up my recent Baldur's Gate playthrough to focus on this instead. That's saying something in itself.			"

The combat is fun, rife with options and I can pretend I'm Batman because with enough prep time I can solve any combat encounter.I highly recommend the game and would suggest checking out Dungeon Rats if you really enjoy AoD's combat system.

Early Access Review
								Best RPG I have played in a long time, scratch that, one of the best RPGs I have ever played. I started playing cRPGs with the original Baldur's Gate and Fallout, I loved Planescape: Torment, and I feel this is on par with those classics. Some have said this game is for power gamer's, you could play it that way if you want, or you could deal with that fact that your character is a simple mortal and can't solve everything, can't pass every skill check, and deal with the cards you are dealt, play to your strengths and avoid your weaknesses, because you can still cross the finish line with an intelligent merchant as well as a badass assassin, just that your merchant isn't going to have much of a chance to become the champion of the arena. That said, its still a difficult game, especially if you are used to newer games, but I found the challenge never too difficult, but that's just me.Playing through with multiple characters gives you a greater appreciation for the game as certain quests and allegiance to certain factions (who give you quests) can and will be restriced by your starting class, but feel free to change allegiances, in my favorite playthrough I was an assassin who betrayed my guild to rise in the ranks of the Imperial Guard. Each class comes with a preffered certain skill set, each has their own unique starting point and initial quests, and each will give you a better picture of the over-arcing story and how all of the pieces fit together, but each characters story is still complete in and of itself. If you want an original story that builds off of great successes of old cRPGs and brings something new packaged with an old school challenging difficulty, this is it. There's no trite fantasy cliches here, no paladins, elves, dwarves, orcs, halflings or any other trapings of rehashed uninspiried D&D. if that's what you want look elsewhere, for here there is just men and women in a struggle to survive amidst a grim unique setting with an old world Roman flare. No spells getting tossed around like bathwater, just grounded, interesting, and brutal combat, with some excellent writing, interesting choices, and gritty combat. 10/10.			"

Posted: February 6, 2016
												This game is outstanding, and deserves to go down as an RPG classic. It has its rough edges - the graphics look at least a decade out of date, and it is not intended to offer a balanced experience: but it also offers the most distinctive RPG experience currently available.The setting eschews the typical pseudo-medieval fantasy for something akin to post-Roman Europe: the last vestiges of civilisation hanging on after the collapse of their infrastructure, power-struggles and political machinations rife among the surviving city-states, propsectors scavenge old ruins for the remains of better time and everyone else does exactly what it takes to stay alive. The nearest analogy I can think of would be Dark Sun.Character creation is also distinctive - you can be a warrior, a thief or an assassin: or a politician, a mercenary, a historian, a con artist or a drifter. You have both combat skills (dodging, blocking and the various weapons) and civil skills (sneaking, stealing, lockpicking, persuasion, crafting, alchemy, Lore, impersonation...). The skills are many, no character can maximise all (or even many) of them, and they have a huge impact on your experience of the world.Combat is brutal  and unforgiving - but also deep and highly tactical. A good Alchemist can craft bombs and poisons that will make a huge difference to the way a fight goes. You need to select between rapid and weak shots, through to slower but more powerful shots according to an enemy's armour and mobility. You can't win every fight.The key thing to recognise with this game is that you're not playing a world-changing hero: you're crafting the story of a particular individual, and it won't necessarily end well. There are points where you make momentous decisions that change the course of the world - but there are also points where you are buffeted by forces you can't control because you don't have the skills you need, and it's important to recognise that in order to see everything the game has to offer you will have to play through with several, very different characters. You're guaranteed to reach some dead ends, and points where if you send your character up for the choice you want, they'll just get killed - and it all depends upon your build.My first character was an Assassin, set to sneak, steal and blag his way through the game - armed with a bow, and dependent on incendiaries for crowd management and poison for maximum effect. I struggled at the end of the first city, unable to complete the ""boss fights"" on offer, and it took me a while of frustrating repeat playthroughs thinking ""This is so unfair! How am I meant to do this?"" before realising I wasn't. I didn't have to beat the fight to progress - only if I wanted a particular outcome. Other characters might have been able to do this, but they wouldn't have had the same options as me, and in the end I just legged it to the next city. I didn't get the outcome I wanted, but that's very much how this game works: you make the most of the situations presented to you. My assassin got close to end game, before finally running out of steam - skills too thinly spread to make progress (not combat enough to fight through, not persuasuive enough to talk through). So that was that.My second character was a Loremaster (historian), who specialise almost entirely in history, crafting and persuasion, and completed the game's storyline without a single fight. What was striking was how different the experience was: seeing the same characters in different lights, finding that locations my Assassin had made it into with ease were now impassible because I couldn't fight, and strolling into areas that had been locked to my assassin. I still couldn't get the end game that I wanted, but I still had a whole range of choices about what happened, that really shaped the world around me.And that's the heart of The Age of Decadance: choice and consequence, and making the best of a bad situation. Most of your characters will come a cropper, and you'll be choosing between the best of a bad lot, blown hither and yon by forces you can't control, but still shaping your destiny with every choice. It's brutal, it's rewarding, and it's completely unique. If you want to power game, minimaxing your character and getting everything right, this isn't the game for you. If you want to weigh up every choice of weapon, skill and dialogue because they carry very real consequences, then I can't think of anywhere else that offers this much quality.			"

												Fascinating text-rich RPG, that I've only scratched the surface to! Excellent soundtrack! Greatly amusing skill descriptions, based on your character's proficiency in said skills! Who needs combat to make a good RPG?! :DI'll come back here when I can write something more coherent.PS. If you're running Win 7, make sure you locate your .exe (probably aod64.exe, not aod.exe) and use compatibility mode to make the game actually playable.			"

												Good game challenging but fun at the same time.  The fights are fun and addicting but the option to make smart descions by acctually paying attention the conversations can save you in a jam. You have to build a strong character or you wont survive but if you dont like the path youve chose you can start over with many differnt builds . I would say even though its difficult the fighting is alot of fun it gives me the drive for revenge whenever i die to comeback and win.  The graphics are ok but i like the theme of the Roman empire and the dark ages you can feel the brutality. Fun , addicting and challenging.			"

												This game has been fantastic fun so far for my girlfriend and I,We decided we would play an assassin in our first attempt and it took a couple of attempts but we eventually got a decent assassin, Aria, up and running and with a fragile but deadly build.We love the way there are so many options in this game and so many ways of doing things - some that you won't even discover in some play throughs!We haven't even finished our game with Aria yet but have been involved in all kinds of plot twists and turns, having made some friends and made a lot of enemies too. Here are our pros and cons;Pros:Highly addictive rich world where decisions matterDecisions  are not binary, you get a lot of optionsSo many different chararacter types and approaches to the game - we're really looking forward to trying out some other builds such as the grifter ""con man"" approachImmersive and deadly but in a way that makes you smile when you dieDificult but rewarding combat system, feels realistic and makes you feel epic when you get goodYou can use the local map to click to locations to avoid boring walksCons:People that dont like to read a lot of words won't be a fan of this gamePeople that don't like a challenge won't like this gameYou need to heavily specialise - dont invest a few points in each skill type and think you can accoomplish every quest, beat every foe and steal all the gold! (we like this though as it is logical - being a little better than mediocre at lots of things  is not going to work out if you are, for instance, trying to assasinate a highly guarded noble)Overall conclusions:Read more reviews, watch some more gameplay videos but in our opinion this game is one  of the best deals you could get yourself - invest some time and read the dialogue properly it is highly rewarding and you will find there are many ways to skin a rabbit and many factions and characters you can align yourself with (we, for instance, almost betrayed our own faction for a juicy deal).Get this game - it is a work of art and deserves praise, my thanks to the developers for this fantastic game!

												Just completed my second playthrough post-release. I think I'm ready to review this amazing game semi-properly. (edit: I have now played through the game five times and it was still fresh on the fifth playthrough.)    First off I'd like to say that if you don't like the idea of having hard skill checks and dying a lot of times because the game put you in frankly unfair combat encounters, this game is not for you. Please try the demo before buying and giving it a negative review.    The Age of Decadence is a cRPG that does a lot amazingly. It's one of the few RPGs where the setting and story actually feel related to the difficulty. It's set on a harsh world, with Roman influences, that the gods have abandoned, and mankind is left to die slowly.    ""In a land where the ancient evil has never awakened, the job of destroying the world was left to mankind."" From the game's trailer.But as you explore the ancient locations in AoD, you will be surprised, and wonder at what the old world was. You heard tales of gods, Magi, and beings invading the world and causing the apocalypse, but the reality will be quite different. I don't want to spoil more.    The game promises that combat will be tough, and it is. Until you get good equipment and are skilled at weapons, you will have difficulty in fighting one person, let alone two or three. And when you get to the point of being able to take on three well-armed people, the game still has a few surprises left... There's 7 different types of weaponry and 2 different defense skills, each with their advantage, and alchemy will get you poisons, bombs and potions (not magical potions!), and you still ahve some non-alchemical gear that might help - nets especially. Combat is great, though the only thing I feel lacking is the inability to choose (when it makes sense that you would be able to do it) the exact position you start in the several combat setpieces (no random encounters), since you only get a vague choice once (at least from my fairly limited experiece.) Combat is overall pretty good.Of course, you can complete the game without ever getting into combat! This is what I would call the ""easy mode"" of AoD, the Merchants' Guild quest. ~12 hours of tactical skill allocation (so you can get through the skill checks the best way) and a choose-your-own-adventure game with top-notch writing.Wait, 12 hours?! That's short as hell!Well... The thing is, AoD respects your time. It doesn't bloat the game time with endless trash mobs (Hi Dragon Age series!) but gives you 8-14 hours of quests with a ridiculous amount of choice and consequence. And there's the hybrid path; hybrid between a social character and a full combat one. This is harder and requires a bit of knowledge about the game, and I haven't tried it yet, I plan to do it whenever I boot up the game again. This is the best way to get some of the hardest content to get in the game. And let's talk about content.AoD has a lot of content, but you will only access a single fraction of it in one playthrough. The game fully supports being played countless times, as starting with a different faction and origin will give you a different view, a completely different set of quests, and access to places you've seen before. And in each playthrough, you will find something that you can't do because, well, your build isn't right. That's alright! Get a new origin and try a different character build after you finish the current one, and get it, since you should know ho to get it now. This is a game where achievements are actually quite useful, since they measure how much of the content you've actually experienced. There's quite a lot of people with 100+ hours that still haven't gotten some achievements, and that shousl give you an idea of how much content this game has.All in all, The Age of Decadence is an extremely ambitious game, and a breath of fresh air from the rehashed AAA console RPGs and the rehashed games trying to copy the great classics both. It's on its own level and it's become one of my favourite games of all time. Thank you Iron Tower Studios, for such a gem, especially to Vince, for both the idea of this game, and the great reviews and forum posts on RPG design :)			"

												This is a fantastic game.  It took a long time for it to be released, and the love and attention put into it really shows.  The story itself isn't too long, it's possible to get through it in a couple hours if you know what you're doing, but the game really shines when it comes to replay value - play once, then play again as a different class or the same class with different stats, and you end up with a wildly different experience.  Playing multiple times to see all the possible outcomes for story lines in this well-written game full of rich lore is the best part of AoD.If you like:>Great writing>Post apocalyptic setting>Medieval/Roman themes>Turn based combat>being challenged by your gamesThen I absolutely recommend Age of Decadence.  More casual fans of turn-based RPGs might also be into this, but keep in mind it's not very forgiving.  Save often, because you will die a lot.			"

												ENI've only played few hours but If you're a player of ""old"" RPG games you will love this because:- great player immersion from the very beginning (different backgrounds)- combat turns (fallout 1 and 2 soul mates)- different choices mean different endings- you can play the evil way and you will have a lot of satisfaction- you can't do everything (if you try, you'll die)- leveling system related on your way to play the game (more non-combat skill if you play the ""talkative"" way, more combat skill if you want to beat everyone to a pulp)You DON'T want to play this game IF:- you don't like to read (or you're not able to..but you wouldn't be able to read this too)- you're looking for something graphically fabulous- you click always ""easy"" when you select the game difficulty- you always need a guide explaining where you have to go and what  you have to doITA ho giocato solo poche ore ma posso dire che se sei un giocatore di vecchi giochi di ruolo amerai questo gioco perché:- ottima immersione del giocatore fin dall'inizio  (grazie anche alla differente scelta dei backgrounds)- combattimento a turni (fallout 1 e 2 hanno un sistema molto simile)- scelte differenti portano a finali di quest differenti- puoi giocare da malvagio e avere grandi soddisfazioni- non puoi fare tutto (se ci provi probabilmente morirari)- il sistema di progressione del personaggio è legato alle azioni in gioco (più si combatte + si alzano le skill di combattimento, più si parla e più si ricevono punti abilità sulle abilità sociali)Non vuoi questo gioco se:- non ti piace leggere (o non sai leggere..ma non staresti leggendo neppure quanto scritto qui)- stai cercando qualcosa con una grafica esagerata- clicchi sempre ""facile"" quando devi scegliere la difficoltà del gioco- hai bisogno di una guida che ti spieghi sempre cosa fare e dove andare "

												Age of Decadence has you wandering the decaying remnants of a once vast and powerful empire heavily influenced by the Roman one. Various factions are squatting in the ruins, vying for supremacy. Those the player can join (and betray). Your choices do very much matter in this RPG. The unique setting alone makes AoD worth a look.You can make your way through the game never lifting a weapon. Instead exploring ancient structures, deciphering old lore and using your charisma and wits to avoid fights. Or you can don lamellar armor, pick up a Gladius and stab your way to victory (or more likely, defeat).There's not a lot of handholding going on here, contrary to what one expects from an RPG in this decadent age.

												The first thing you might think when you look at the screenshots is that this is an old school RPG. And you would be correct. But old school doesn't have to mean dated. The Age of Decadence aims to combine the choice-based narrative of Planescape Torment with tactical turn-based combat. In the first town alone there are dozens of ways to change the world around you through dialogue and interactions. If fighting is more your thing, you can try the combat and get your ♥♥♥♥ handed to you. Everything requires a bit of thought.This is how RPGs should be made. Every quest offers multiple solutions, every character has their own motivations and will respond to you differently depending on how you talk to them. The only other people making RPGs like this are Obsidian and inXile. It is astonishing how Iron Tower managed it with a team of 5 people.The Age of Decadence is part of a new wave of old school RPGs. Divinity, Wasteland, Pillars of Eternity and Torment are the biggest names right now and the genre may get a bit crowded over the next few years, but The Age of Decadence stands out from the competition because of what has been achieved by such a small team.

												The Age of Decadence is a home-brewed role playing game(unique setting) that rewards multiple playthroughs and experimentation. The setting can best be described as a blending of many containing legionnaires, magic, an extinct ancient civilization, medieval themes and much more. Different starting options provide different content and ways of approaching the game which provides much of the games content, as one path alone will only provide a few hours of content once you become familiarized with the game-play. In regards to game-play this is where it excels as a role playing game. Depending on the character you wish to play you can be as diplomatic or as savage as one would please, leading to different situations in almost all playthroughs. Its combat though does have a bit of a learning curve and is rather brutal, and I can only suggest that if one would like to partake and excel in combat at all they must focus on it character development wise as you will quickly fall behind and die otherwise. Overall  I would suggest this game to anyone looking for a rpg with an incredible amount of replayability, interesting story, and brutal combat.			"

												I died a couple times during the tutorial, if you can believe it, and so decided to play a purely diplomatic character. I've become a merchant puppet master, arranged the assasination of the king and put my own half wit puppet in his place.If you're not a combat based character, stay away from the slums. You can't go five feet without someone wanting to extort you for money... It cost me around 1500G to get through there.So far a very interesting game. Well written with many branches and meaningful choices, the lore is very engaging, you feel like there's some sort of mysterious magic going on in the background. And there's no hand holding, I actually got a bunch of ancient era tech which I didn't figure out how to use until the very end. Highly recommended.--- Edit: I've finished my first playthrough... and it was pretty satisfying. Looking at the achievements though I can see that I've only scratched the surface. There are places and people that I didn't encounter due to the choices and the skills I chose so definately going to replay.			"

												The strongest point of the game are the different ways one can play it. Both words and weapons can be equally deadly in this world and players can explore a ton of diffrent playstyles. If you have played two unique playstyles in your first two games, you can even try to mix them in a third to get something completly new. This game gives freedom in both character design and playstyle that you will rarely find anywhere else.I also really like the setting of the game and is probably one of my favorite apolcalyptic-themed settings.All in all, I highly recommend this game to everyone and especially recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs but also wants to try something different and challenging.

This is a fantastic game, i've had so much fun with it, and it has so much replayability that many other RPGs lack. Very much recommended.Only cons i can think of is that its a bit hardcore, you want to save often (press F5)...and there is no shame in loading (F9).But tbh, thats part of the fun...because it does matter what you decide to do, your decision might very well get you killed :)			"

												This game wins major points on story, setting, variable playstyles and grittyness.You can play through using talk skills and hardly touch a weapon, or dive into some fairly challenging turn based combar. Theres plenty of skills, but you must beware of spreading your points too thin.Taking the moral high ground might get you killed, the consequences of your actions can at times be lethal.The game's not terribly long in itself, but you wont be able to see and do everything in one playthrough.Theres no ""classes"" per se, rather backgrounds and starting faction affiliations, which will to a fairly large extent influence your game. Try it with different backgrounds to see the story from a different angle. The story will also change, as your actions on behalf of your faction will change the story. Excellent replayability. Several possible endings, and also a bit of a small ""ending recap"" outlining the results of your actions (or inactions) when you move to the next main area.The setting's fairly gritty, society and technology has taken a dozen steps back after some disaster in the past, and is slowly recovering. The setting is medieval-ish with heavy influence from ancient rome. One part of the plot is figuring out just what occured during that cataclysmic event, as records of that time is largely lost into myth.This is a fun turn based rpg in isometric view,  some may complain about the graphics, but its not the type of game that desperately needs the glossy eye-candy. It's challenging, it doesnt hold your hand, but it isnt unfair either.I recommend this to fans of the good old isometric crpg classics. If thats you, I suggestest downloading the demo, and try that once as a talker type and once as a fighter.			"

												Age of Decadence is a truly amazing game for anyone who is tired of the traditional 'steamrolling' rpgs that are commonplace.Firstly, it is a difficult game with an insanely difficult learning curve and like myself, anyone playing for the first time will die a lot and have to restart over and over. Skill points are precious and scarce and forces you to specialise strategically with the knowledge that any given playthrough can only access a third of the game (lots of replayability as seen by my total playtime).Secondly, the story, lore and characters are wonderfully created, with a rich backstory to the world and intrigue for those who can be bothered to read the text. There are some really wonderful characters to interact with, and it is obvious that this game is really well thought out by the devs.Thirdly, the combat is extremely difficult and the game incentivises the peaceful route for most of the playable characters each with his/her own questline. Within each quest, there are multiple choices to take which enables 5 or 6 different quest endings per character, and around 10 different final endings. This game truly allows you to sculpt your own story as you see fit.However, for people who only play AAA games, the audio is slightly lacking, and the graphics are nothing special. Yet i probably prefered it as i found myself more immersed in the game as a result, and playing the soundtrack to Gladiator as i played enhanced everything.This is a solid game and i would reccomend it to anyone looking for a challenge. Its not for everyone, so wait for the sale if you are unsure.(P.S, if the developers are reading this, a sequel or expansion would be greatly received. I literally cannot get enough decadence in my life)			"

												I recommend this for its unique elements, story, and combat. I played it for over 40 hours, and could probably play it for another 20-30 without seeing everything. Totally worth the price, sale or not.This game took me by surprize. There is a depth to character creation, and how your character fits into the story. Fetch quests are pretty much non-existant as it will give you the option to travel instantly in dialog very often. (wish more games would do that) Much of the game can be played WITHOUT COMBAT, if you like that kind of thing, and build your character right. But combat can be very fun, even if the randomness can sometimes be aggrevating. Thankfully, there is a save/load feature that is pretty quick if something really bad happens. I found myself using it a lot just to experiement with various choices (do I let someone die or do I save them) both in and out of combat.PROS:Complex characters and story (most things have prerequisite skills or attributes)Simple character building with enough options to warrant replaysFast and convenient quick save and quick loadGood UIUnique combat (some weapons are really unique, and dodge vs block+armor mechanic)CONS:Just 1 real CON in my opinion, and that is the shortage of skill points and a lack of difficulty option to help alleviate it. That brings in these related cons:Save and load happens A LOT, unless you want to replay the entire game with one point difference in some skillOften don't spend my reward points in case I need them for some future quest, increasing the amount of reloadsHard to figure out what skill level is needed for many quests (save and reload, increase by 1 each time, etc)TL;DR: TRY THE DEMO!!!! Note the complexity of chapter 1's design (many ways to beat), and know that it continues to grow. Lore skills in particular gets very interesting and surprizing.			"

												This is arguably the most satisfying story-based RPG I've played since Planescape: Torment. That said, not everyone will like it - it is very niche specific and if it doesn't hit your buttons you might utterly hate it. 5/5 will play again			"

												Solid story-driven RPG that gives new meaning to ""know your role."" Excellent replayability, minimal hand holding (but the game mechanics are very easy to understand), and perhaps the first game in a long time where ""choices have consequences"" means more than a single NPC scolding you about something you did. Worth your money.			"

												Edit: I am at the 4th play and it still has new stuff that I haven't seem before. It is much better than I wrote!!!Amazing game! You can't play it only once! Each choice may cause a reaction that allow or cut sections of the game.Pros:+ Choices really matter a lot!+ Different play styles, weapons, hits and perspectives!+ Engaging stories, I wrote it correctly, stories because there are a few of them!Cons:- Players get frustrated because this is like real life, you die and you can't do everything or beat everyone.- Designed to avoid cracking the game mechanics, but most players want to know the checks score that they failed.Totaly worth the full price and wait for their next game!

												This is a brutally challenging CRPG that values realism. The game recieved regular updates while it was in early access.Personally, this game isn't for me, but that's only because I like a little scifi and/or fantasy in my RPGs.Technically speaking, the game is well made and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the genre.

								i think this is one of the best turned based rpg i have played in a long time! love the challenge but the combat gets on my nervs!! need to dumb down the AI their well to accurate and powerful that is the only problem i have with this game and abit more freedom would be nice so you can build your skills before a quest you know you need a certain level for but dont have it by that time.

												Tried the demo and I liked it, it's hard but each situation con be solved in many ways so you each time you replay it, the storyline can change drastically.It doesn't have the best graphics ever, nor a super developped and complex combat system but it has the feel of the classic RPGs, good storyline, believable interactions and it can get pretty hard if you try to fight everyone.The 33$ tag is a little steep but I feel it's worth it.UPDATE (3.9h)Just had an out of memory error while interacting with a NPC. That kinda stuff should have been delt with during the test phase, just bad code and poor QA. Game is still fun but that's a definite and serious CON			"

												Honestly, I've cheated through the whole game multiple times as I find turn-based games incredibly boring + this game is ridiculously hard and requires planning ahead with a multitude of playthroughs in order to get what you truly want.What I really like about this game is the writing and lore, the game is centered around the Roman Empire and it's fall, however, it's a very alternative world as the Empire is ridicously advanced technologically, yet lost to all due to a catastrophe which created the current world. Uncovering all of the mysteries and learning about the pasts mistakes and current choices that are available to take advantage of and determine the future of the wasteland is a very exciting process as I seemingly cannot get enough of the dialogue, until the game runs out of it.I definitely recommend it for writing/lore reasons since that is my favourite aspect of the game, however if you're looking for a big challenge in a post-apolyptic turn based game, I still 100% recommend it.You will not be disappointed.

												""You offer yet another sacrifice to Death, who smiles upon you and rewards your dedication by whispering insights into your ear....""I am currently on my 4th run or so, but have abandoned the first three characters - I enjoyed seeing them fail, called it a good story and built my current character, an Imperial Legatus. This game is f***ing RICH. It is hands down the best single player RPG I`ve played. The replay value is almost obscene. I am enjoying my current run but I already know that I probably have to complete the game at least 2 more times with different approaches to get to see all the content. In TAoD you can become anything: a scholar, a war-hero, a thief and relic hunter... but it does not only allow you to ""skill as"" one of these characters but live completely different storylines. You can even switch in between (just be aware that your ""Word Of Honor"" decreases if you switch employers too often...)Really amazed by this piece, so if you're into Old school RPG's and post-apocalyptic fantasy (inspired by Roman history), go for it.

												AoD is one of the truest RPG I play in sometime! It has branching Narrative real choices  that matter, and have a ripple effect in ways you will not foreseen.   The setting is imagine the fall of Roman Empire in the desert. Humanity is slowly dying in it own curruption and, last few men of power are trying reforge the Empire of old in there imagine. All of them to us old pre war technology with little if no understand of there real purpose beside being some ""mystical"" artefacts. How does the PC play into it well that all up to you. The player is no special snow flake or pre ordained by gods have no mystical power just flesh and blood with little more or little less political power depending on there background. There no true classes in this game just background which give a template of how to play your character. Do you have to follow that template no can tailor your character differently of course! Is suggested no if follow that faction questline. Of course you always free agent with your own goals. This game punish you try to be jack all trades you need to Specialized To make it in this game world. It possible to make it through the entire game without getting into a single fight. Another interesting thing about this game depending on your background and play style you're going to only be able to see so much. Making this game highly replayable if want to get the full picture. Combat it's hard you should avoided if you can, because three thugs can reck your world up! If you  go for the combat rout makes for a very interesting and very different game in it own way.My only gripe is a little buggy and the graphics are ancient but that's not a big deal. My  advice to the developer so this game could have been a picturesque interactive fiction/choice your own adventures rpg Since the game is mostly governed by skill and stack checks.  This is not about being superhero It's about surviving and possible getting better piece of pie then the other guy.			"

												Easily one of the best RPG's I have played in a very long time. It can be a traditional combat based rpg but it is also soo much more. The lore runs very deep and there are many hidden things to find and forbidden knowledge to discover, that are much more rewarding than combat. The game encourages multiple play throughs many of which will be trial and error to see what you can find only to fail a stat check and die. This is how rpgs should be... what a great find			"

												A really interesting branching RPG game.I feel like you'd need a lot of playthroughs to see everything available, as I know that LOTS of stuff was unavailable to me due to my skill choices (smart guy / terrible combat skills). I played the entire game only killing 3 people, and I think it easily could have been zero. My playthrough took about 12 hours, but given different skillsets / choices I think it could vary a fair amount.It's completely old-school, for better or worse. Don't expect the game to lead you forward and tell you what to do. I had one point where I actually thought I was stuck (due to my skill choices), but then ended up finding a clever solution that fit my skillset. I was pretty impressed with the game design.Overall, I would recommend this given that you're okay with a game that is unapologetically oldschool and rough around the edges.			"

												This game was a gamble for me at first: I honestly didn't know what I was getting involved in but I liked the trailer and the theme instantly convinced me. A demo played here, a purchase there and fast-forward a month later I was killing my social life with this title like it was no one's business; Where to even begin? The story is amazing! The characters and the plots & schemes impressed me with their depth; The game's combat is great too, once you get the hang of it :) it kind of reminded me a bit of Fallout 2 but there are a TON of different variables to work with here so don't hover too much on this aspect.

												Hard, realistically unforgiving and one of the rare few games whose dialogue options and their checks make perfect sense.7/10I have two complaints:1. Nothing is marked with this game, which, in my opinion, is fine for everything other than quest givers. The game's art style makes everything easy to miss, so at some point it changes into pixel hount (which is still fine by me, as long as I know what I'm supposed to be doing, and if I haven't found the quest giver - I don't).2. I played a greedy merchant who nearly single handedly took over three locations for his guild and found an omniscient being. It'd seem natural that I should seize power for myself at some point, seeing as literally everyone who mattered either knew me well or owed me. That's not an option. I think there should be a storyline in which you can drive away/poison your superior and take over the guild.			"

And then I figured out this was a revival of the old games, where you need to be extra careful. Also it adds a new flavour, choices. Compared to other games, the story is not only relevant, but vital as well. I found hard though that the camera does not follow me. But I get used to that later.

												I found this game refreshing, albeit challenging. It's not for everyone, which isn't a critique of people who don't like it. It is a bit challenging at first, and it can be frustrating. Here's why1 ) You'll find yourself having to accept decisions that you otherwise don't like (because the alternative is getting killed.) For example, you can try to kill someone, but his guards will immediately attack you. Or you pay someone 1 000 coins or die (usually you can avoid this altogether, but that's based on your char's skillpoints)2) Combat is specifically made so you can't run straight towards 5 mobs and mercilessly slaughter them. Remember how the guards in Morrowind used to be? They would mow you down (until mid-late game when you'd kill them and sell their equipment for heaps of cash)3) No real quest log, or hints. You'll have to actually read the dialogues to get a sense of where to go and what to do. The quests have names, and a line or two of the stage you're at.4) The Wiki page is a bit empty, so finding hints online is a bit difficult. The game however is extremely immersive, and once you get into the rhythm, highly addictive. The game may appear linear, as it is the same progression to cities, but when I say ""no two play throughs are the same"" I mean they won't be the same. They may be similar, but time has clearly been spent by the devs to make sure one decision has tangible effects. The story line is unique, the environment is engaging, and the characters have depth.So in sum:If you're looking for a game that demands your attention and total engagement, as well as being crucifyingly realistic, buy this gameIf you're looking for a laid back game, skip this one. Think Morrowind; no map markers, no clear indicators where to go. You're told ""Don't go into the Slums of Maadoran."" In this game, that's actual advice. You will die, or get robbed blind.			"

The combat is tricky playing with a combat oriented charater is a totally different experience.There are a load of bugs and crashes which I hope the continu to fix. Because of the auto save and the need to save to get through thigns alive it isnt really a big issue.Trying to switch factions later in the game makes things messed up, people that should be dead are still alive and such, keeping to the linear story wont let you experience this thus you'll only notice after having played the game several times.

""Let me see,"" Says the healer. ""A skull fracture, intercranial bleeding, subdural hematoma. You can probably walk it off.""They never said it was going to be easy. In fact, it's entirely the opposite. The Age of Decadence never pretends to be easy, never holds your hand except for the first message that says ""This game is going to be difficult."" This game doesn't let you play a jack of all trades; you're either very good at one or two things, or you're very dead. Hybrid characters are frowned upon; you have to play your cards right, trust no-one and say the right things to get out alive. What this game has in difficulty it also has a counterpart in it's rewarding combat system, it's sprawling questlines and dialogue trees and incredibly gripping, mysterious backstories. The lore in this game is rivalled by only few games; it's ideas incredibly novel and unique. Some people would claim that this game is too hard, too infuriating to play. I'd say they are looking at this game wrong. This isn't an RPG like many others, where you're 'Killy Mcbeardyson', slayer of countless bandits, dragons and champion of the entire world. This is a game where you just picked up a sword, you barely know which way to hold it (if that) and everyone out there is trying to kill you. You're alone unless you choose a guild to side with, and even then you have to watch your back. Everyone, and I repeat, everyone, in this game seems to have an ulterior motive, a reason for doing what they are doing, and they all want to survive. No-one goes down easy in this game. Even if you don't like combat, this game makes up for it in countless lines of well-written dialogue. None of it is filler dialogue, describing smaller characters or talking about the smell of a room or something redundant. Everything is concise, important and thrilling. Throughout many dialogues in the game I was kept on the edge of my seat, hoping beyond hope that my character's persuasion skill was high enough, that I'd taken the right dialogue tree to try and appeal to this character. To summarise, this game has a unique, original and well thought out setting (Post-Apocalyptic Roman Empire... I'll let you discover the rest for yourself), a challenging yet rewarding turn based combat system, and interesting, relatable characters who you can never trust, not completely. One of the best RPGs I've ever played. And with a Free(!!!!) demo, there should really be no excuse for not playing this gem of an RPG. jmcone's Personal Rating: Nigh Essential "

Early Access Review
								Score: 9.5/10Summary: The Age of Decadence is a must own for fans of classic CRPG gameplay. Every aspect of the game demonstrates the amount of love and attention to detail the developers have put into their work. Built around replayability and written with a smart, dry wit, this title is a dream come true for anybody who longs for the days of Planescape: Torment and Arcanum. The requirements of metagame knowledge and the staggering difficulty, however, make this game for a very specific audience and have the potential to frustrate even the most seasoned gamers. The Setting: The Age of Decadence takes place in a world with post-apocalyptic, steampunk, cosmic horror, dark fantasy, and ancient historical inspirations. The settlements on the surface of the game world look like historical Roman or ancient Middle Eastern cities and are written and populated to feel like authentic Dark Ages societies. Dig deep enough, however, and you'll see that the game's grounded surface hides a lot of ancient rituals, bizarre machines, and sleeping monstrosities. The historical sense about most of the game's political intrigue makes the supernatural elements even more mysterious and intriguing. The Character System: You play as a man or woman from one of eight different backgrounds: assassin, thief, praetor, loremaster, grifter, drifter, merchant or mercenary. Once you choose one of these backgrounds and customize your appearance (there are a solid number of options for an isometric game), you allocate statistics among several primary attributes and skills. The primary attributes are similar to Fallout's SPECIAL statistics, but the skills are something else entirely. Skills are divided into combat and civil skills; at character creation, your physical stats (strength, dexterity, constitution) determine how many points you may spend on combat skills, while your ""cerebral"" stats (perception, intelligence, charisma) determine civil skills. Rather than experience points, the game rewards quest completion and the achievement of certain feats with skill points, which may be focused in either type of skill. Certain world interactions will grant specialized combat/civil skill points as well. The system does a good job of representing abstract concepts with statistics, which carries over from game mechanics into narrative often, as your interactions with people and things will be determined by base statistic checks frequently (i.e. are you strong enough to open the door? are you smart enough to figure our what this guy is saying?). The Gameplay: The most common way to play this game is to specialize either in civil skills or combat skills. While hybrid builds are possible, they require very tight management of baseline statistics and skill points and an amount of metagame knowledge that a first or even second or third time player will not have. The game emphasizes ""choice and consequence"" and unlike in many other titles, that includes how you build your character: what opens up one path will prevent you from going down another permanently. While this may frustrate players who enter with the mentality of experiencing everything at once, this gating effectively makes your character seem like a realistic member of the game world rather than a superman and more importantly encourages multiple playthroughs with multiple builds. The combat is turn based and enormously difficult. You the player have no inherent advantages over NPCs whatsoever and unless you build the right skills and take advantage of the right tools, you will die repeatedly. On the one hand, this system can make combat immensely fun and rewarding if you like challenge: you'll feel like you've earned every victory. On the other hand, when your stats are too similar to your enemies', RNG can be what wins you the day or loses it, resulting in a lot of swearing and loading savegames. I would argue that this RNG dependency is one of the game's few big flaws.The Writing: Age of Decadence is one of the smartest and most fascinating role-playing games of all time, in my opinion. Be warned that the experience is rather cold and impersonal. While your masters will reward you and praise you for succeeding, your character will never have a close circle of friends and a love interest like the characters in many other RPGs. That's because the game is really about the world more than it is about you. Much like Dark Souls, your character in this game is merely a vessel/agent by which you can experience the story. The real main characters are the people for whom and against you'll be working and some of them are rather memorable, like a condescending ancient construct and a slimy merchant who may or may not keep conning you throughout the story.The setting is what really makes the game. The Roman-inspired themes are well handled: it's clear the developers did their research, but have still made their world unique enough not to be a copy-paste of ancient history. The mixture of steampunk elements, futuristic elements, long-gone magic, and cosmic entities definitely lend to this distinct voice. What's more, all the messages that narrate the game in second person (i.e. you enter a large room full of old machines, etc) have this cruelly sardonic humor to them that makes you laugh even when they're insulting you. The game has an enormous number of custom death screens that mock or praise you depending on often ignominious and sometimes epic ways in which you can die. Overall, it is very clear this game is a labor of love. It's highly replayable, highly enjoyable, and very, very smart. $20 (CORRECTION: 30) US is an outstanding price for a title with so much replay value.			"

												Age of Decadence, by Iron Tower Studios is an RPG which sets the standard against which RPG connoisseurs will measure future role-playing games for years to come.The game has a number of features which set it apart from most RPG releases in recent years. To name a few such traits, I must refer to the realistic attitudes, motivations and interactions shown by its character cast and in its worldbuilding, the turn-based combat system with a heavy emphasis on tactics, which yet remains surprisingly intuitive, or to the mind-boggling variety of outcomes of its main story and secondary quests. AoD is truly an exceptional occurrence in the recent history of role-playing games.The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic antiquity, depicting a world not all that different from how people of the Roman Empire probably used to perceive it in the days of the great Barbarian Invasions of IV-VI centuries. The setting is not strictly historical though, so expect partial ""contaminations"" and amalgamations of Roman era with Ancient Middle East and fantasy themes adapted to those two ingredients of the setting.Whereas other games ask for fast reflexes or perseverance in mouse button clicking, good old-fashioned common sense will be the main requirement that AoD poses of you as a player. This may seem like it goes without mention, but really, in this game ""think before you act"" is your guiding principle, along with ""save your game often"". Whether it's about an ingame decision - like fighting a group of six armed-to-the-teeth thugs - or about your long term strategy in character-building - like spreading his character's skillpoints too thin over too many unrelated skills, being realistic about your character's capabilities is what will keep you alive. Putting yourself in your character's shoes, circumventing his limitations instead of playing superman - isn't this what role-playing is fundamentally about?With realism being a chief design principle, building your character should be done with thought as to which skills will complement each other best. The two ends of the continuum are a pure fighter or a pure diplomat, but a player would rarely settle with a character concentrated solely on combat or on talking. In the majority of cases, your character will end up somewhere in between.There is a lot of depth to AoD's combat, with weapons split into groups where increasing your skill with one weapon in a group provides synergic effect to your skill with other weapons of the same group. To add to that, the same weapons can execute different types of strikes, or be used to strike at different body parts, with varying action point cost and to-hit chance. The end result is that switching from one weapon to another, or from a single weapon to weapon and shield, coupled with changes to the types of strikes you will preform with that weapon, can dramatically alter the course of combat, without any changes to your skill levels with the given weapon.Age of Decadence is unlike any other RPG you've played in that it will play out differently every time you replay it, depending on your character's background and skills distribution. The developers at Iron Tower Studios have spent a stupefying 10 years in mostly filling up the game with branches of the main and secondary quests, and with branches of the branches. Reactivity in an RPG can never be too much, and in AoD it reaches a point where the world begins to feel more real and alive than you are used to, especially if you have an affinity for its down-to-earth hardboiled novel-like writing style.Age of Decadence is an RPG done right. The game combines great writing and storytelling with branching storylines more complex than anything you've seen in a computer game. It boasts a perfectly balanced turn-based combat system and deep classless skills-based character creation and development system. What makes the game stand out among the titles of recent years (and decades) is how the quality exectuion of its systems results in you playing an RPG in the way it's meant to be played - looking at the world through the eyes of your character, walking the dusty streets in your character's own sandals.I can say without a doubt - AoD is a classic that just got released. I urge you to buy it and play it now, so that by the time the mainstream becomes alert and also proclaims it a classic, you will be ready to boast about how many times you finished it ""before it was cool"". And since the game is indie,it has the added benefit of being relatively cheap, so for the price of a triple-A game, you can buy two copies of AoD and gift one to a friend, who would later thank you for showing him the game.With all this said, really, what could be better...? I'd say Age of Decadence II, hopefully.			"

												Age of Decadence is a good game, and which development I followed for a long time. It was pretty exciting to see the result of years' worth of labor come to fruition and experience for the first time the craft and dedication put into the title. To preface, I believe I gave this game a good shot, explored the systems as much as allowed despite early struggles, and in some cases reached the limits of its game design. The released demo helps to get a fair grasp of what is to be expected, primarily the level of difficulty in its turn based combat. And the demo extends to other game mechanics as well and serves as a pretty good alternative to a proper manual, which is limited to in-game help section. If anything, if you are interested in this game and its underlying roleplaying gameplay, you'll do well to try this demo before reading anymore of what I want to vent. Now, having said all that, I must confess unfortunately, my first go at the game was less than ideal. I started out as a hybrid character who does not specialize in any specific task, but realizing my error, later tried at every turn to focus on a defined set of skills. The game experience changes markedly depending on what character you create, to the point that the most important choice in this game becomes the character creation. Some of the skills are definitely more useful than others, the most overlooked of which is Etiquette that I made a mistake of investing a couple points in, deluding myself a well adjusted swordsman or some such. Many skills aside from Alchemy and Crafting find their use in dialog checks, especially Streetwise and Persuasion. It is rather unfortunate that Stealing or Lockpicking are relegated to dialog choices rendering many of the NPCs and buildings in the game to merely decorative stand-ins.I found that due to the emphasis on choices and consequences, a large swath of content is gated behind certain checks based on these skills. For a character who against common sense aspired to be a jack of all trades, this created a funneling effect where I didn't have any choice being carried along the base plotline just to continue the motion of seeing to its conclusion before finding myself in a yet another similar situation of a pigeonholed exit. Rather ironic that the character with a broad skill set has no place to apply his trade, however meager they be. The passage of time remains as much of a mystery as the relics of the bygones world strewn about this post-apocalyptic world, burying some quests under the sands of time leaving no trace while others remain unperturbed. It all snowballed to a point the game simply and literally refused to budge, a hard crash within the game world with no exit to desktop, only an obscured 'exit' sign awaiting those who had failed the experiment to boot you unceremoniously to an ignoble end. Exit and New Game would have been a more fitting and compassionate choice.Did I have any more fight in myself after this draining exercise to subvert the game system to deliver my game avatar to an end commensurate with the effort to create him, identify with him, and navigate him? Not really. What I had really wanted was the game experience tailor made that gave way to whatever whim my character may take fancy in, the menagerie of choices borne out of randomness. Age of Decadence wouldn't give an inch to such nonsense and will hold no prisoner of my miserable dreams and hopes, of working with my deeply flawed character, holding his hand as we skip toward the Gates of Hell. It boiled down to 'decadence' in exclusivity that ran contradictory to my usual playing habits. It is understandable that there is only so much the developer of six or so people can do to take account of all options and actions that a player may take, and the game doesn't suffer any fools. A fool that was me bumbling through the wonderfully created world of fascinating lore and history. Overall I enjoyed it while it lasted, but there was no catharsis in this suffering, only the New Game offering a glimmer of new hope, and richer experience to be borne out of more wiser and determined roleplaying.Recommended, for the richness of the world, the choices a player has, and the world that compute and react to those choices. Just be sure to specialize, use common sense, and stay within the pages of this Choose Your Own Adventure. Do yourselves a favor and try the demo.			"

												its been a cool game, dialogue choices are different depending on what skills you have so your skills open up different dialogue which can then lead to finding some special artifacts, secret loot or opening up entirely different branches of quests and moving story in different direction. i really liked that aspect of the game, real role play where your skills really do matter in both what they do and in interation and dialogue choices.this is a propper rpg in that sense. id love to se more games have the skills this meaningful.the combat is quite tricky too depending on skill, even beelining direct for combat focused builds and pumping all stats into your area of combat expertise will still have hard combat. i have only done 1 playthrough so far and thats been around 25 hours, was combat focused build, still didnt beat arena champion (hes still too tough for my 200 kills character with maxed block and maxed axe) and i sill could go back into that save and finish off a few other things that i left/didnt do, so that could have easily been a 30 hour game if i didnt rush towards the end.i only rushed towards end part, not out of boredom and wanting it to end, but because at end part all the mysteries and truth of the world really open up and it makes you curious, so my curiosity made me rush end bit. a solid rpg, decent dificulty, good story, makes roman theme cool again! ....would be awesome if they made one set furthur back in timeline to the events that ruined the world, thatd be a cool game that id buy instantly.game lacks party though, your just yourself, 1 dude. would be awesome if i could find another game like this with party too, would be epic.

												This is the real deal. If you've ever wondered what cRPGs could be from a design standpoint, how they could evolve beyond their limitations, this is it. This game is unique, it offers far more than anything that has been done before. What am I talking about, exactly? ""Choice and consequences"" - the buzzwords that have been thrown around regarding cRPGs for the last decade or so. Most veteran players realise that this concept is an empty one. David Gaider of Bioware often says that from a design standpoint, you can only give the players the illusion of choice - a choice that has no real impact, that doesn't branch out the player in an entirely new direction. The logic behind this is that most players do not play a game more than once and that it would be far too much resource-intensive to invest in all the branching that would make player choice relevant.Age of Decadence is going boldly against this pragmatic, safe, frankly boring attitude. It will give you more choice that any other cRPG has ever done. You will miss content in one playthrough. Sometimes you'll make bad choices. Who your character is will matter in how the story evolves. It takes the word ""role playing"" seriously : how you build your character will dramatically influence your experience. It isn't for nothing : the game has been in development for 9 years. A lot of it was part-time, true, but the amount of content here is staggering. This is truly what cRPGs can be. If you've ever felt like this genre was stagnating, if you're wondered how they could realise freedom in a game such as this, then give it a shot.Of course, a word of warning : the game is strictly for an hardcore crowd and doesn't shy away from it. It is not meant to please everyone. The setting itself is far from friendly and the narrative has a sadistic pleasure in not catering to your ego. For some it will be a dose of fresh air, for others, well, there are already plenty of games for the others.Same thing with the combat - it is a frustrating affair, but oh-so-satisfying when you master the system and beat the sh*t out of everyone you don't like. The graphics, to me, are quite decent, but some people will find reason to complain. I say f*ck em, but yeah. Buy this game! We want to see more games out of Iron Tower Studio!			"

												This will be a very positive review for a game that I have spent many hours playing over the last year. The hours do not show on my account since I have played the game... somewhere else.I would like to start off by saying that this game is not for everyone. If you have liked Fallout (old or new) there is no guarantee that you will like AoD since it takes from many other game styles. The game is not really hard in a sense that is difficult, you will just have many options locked out from you in every play through since there are not enough stats or skill points to go around and make a well rounded character. That is not a problem since you will want to replay the game several times since there are many different outcomes and endings. Even the starts are extremely different (8 in total).The atmosphere of the game is really depressing (Fallout seems bright and sunny compared to this one) and the witting is so good that you can literally sense it without any animation. The characters are believable and they all have their ambitions and motives in this ruined world. That means that most will try to trick you or to lie to you to get ahead in life. So you are forced to do the same. Being the good guy is going to get you into a grave fast. The schemes that people make are really intricate and you get to participate in some really cool backstabbing (some with daggers, some with words). The range of world changing endings that can be achieved is comparable to those of Deus Ex Invisible War. I will not go into details since I do not wish to spoil it for you.Once you have played the game 2-3 times I recommend using cheats to increase stats to max to see all that it has to offer.			"

												Age of Decadence should be a good game, if not a great game. But... it falls a hair short of  average. Which is disappointing as a fan of Darklands and being a product of old school RPG's this ticked a lot of boxes.  Have some lineage with Dead State also really excited me.  This biggest flaw in the game is that is simply is not fun as you dive into it.  The plot in the first town is such that even a set of rail road tracks would accuse it of being linear.  The big problem here is that there is not much flexibility for accomplishing things.  There are lots of railroad track to get on, so there is some variety that I give marks for.  Simply put there is not too much to do and what there is to do feels like you are being told what to do.  Likewise if it breaks down into combat...The next flaw is you can build a somewhat decent combat character at the start.  You know who you can defeat in combat?  Nobody.  Literally.  Street urchins can beat you to death.  So great choices there. To be fair the  developer does state this up front.  Though truth be told I think what they mistake for difficulty is demanding you play the game how they want you to play.  Obviously this has resonated with some, which is cool.  But this is my own experience. Combat in Age of Decandence is awesome, it is a darn share that the game is such that it is the last thing you want, should or can do.  Makes me wonder why they bothered to include combat classes much less combat since it is highly discouraged.  The next problem is that the starter town is boring.  There is not much do to, assuming you can do anything as one particular quest is all combat and 1 on 1 combat is iffy, 3-4 on one goes exactly as you can expect.   There are maybe 10 things going on in the town.  Given the difficulty you would think the developers would give some opportunity to improve your character either via experience or skill.  There is no real way to get better.  That said there are some interesting events in the town as you walk around, wish there were more.A plus side is the developers do a good job of creating a fall of Rome inspired setting.  They pour a lot of detail into this.  Shame it is not as fun or playable as it looked on spec.  The town looks right, the characters look good-ish, the female characters are a tad mannish.  There are better RPG's.  People are mistaking different for better.  I bought this and do not regret doing so, maybe it will grow on me.  But for now it is a bit below par and I would have to not recommend anyone else picks it up.  Not that I am the boss of you,  it may be your cup of tea.GoodA really really good combat systemLots of character choices and customizationWell written plot, lots of informative text and attention to detailThe world looks good (having been to Italy it passes the eye test)Ease of navigating the worldBadA combat system that you cannot and shoudl not useNo day/night cyclesInflexible design, plot success driven by choices the developer has made, not how you want to play No voice over workCharacter models could have used another iteration			"

Early Access Review
								Highly recommend. Best game I've ever played since Planescape: Torment. Like other reviewers said, it is a difficult game, which I love about it. If you are going to play a merchant don't expect to bully trained killers. But it is so satisfying to come back with an assassin character and slit your enemies throats in your first move and step over their corpses without missing a beat.Or with an armored fighter slamming five guys around with a warhammer. In this game you start weak, but how you end up is up to you. 8 different storylines to complete and even then you will find some new location and think to yourself ""I need to come back to this place with a fighter/diplomat/thief.

												A diamond in the rough, Age of Decadence is what any hardcore RPG should aspire to be. There is no good vs evil or black and white. Everything is grey. It's a wholly immersive world with its true value being in its replayability; there are so many ways to do quests, so many quests to miss with several factions to align with or betray. You can avoid combat altogether if you're an exceptionally smooth talker. That's how I played my first character, and that was the most immersive and enjoyable experience. It's merciless. It doesn't hold your hand. There's even an achievement for dying 100 times and that's actually one of the easier ones to get. It's not like every other RPG where your character happens to be the chosen one, although ironically, you can convince a religious preacher that you actually are the chosen one which opens up a whole new branch of options (but only if you have the right stats for it). It's definitely one of the best if not the best RPG I have ever played and the fact that I have 50 hours logged and *still* haven't uncovered nearly all of the content or even played as half of the backgrounds (thief, assassin, grifter, drifter), speaks for itself.If this even slightly piques your interest, check out the store page and try the demo.

												I got hooked on this game, which was quite unexpected given the blocky graphics and frustrating combat.  It takes place in a Roman-era setting where several great houses are all vying for power, and there's a couple of guilds and factions that are egging them all on to advance their own agendas.  There's a very cool story underlying this about techno-mages and Gods that you can delve more into if you want to play archeologist in the ruins, but this is really up to you.  The charm of the game is that there are so many different story branches that you can influence.  My second playthrough was completely different than my first!  The game relies heavily on skill and stat checks.  I almost see this game as more of a puzzle game because it will take a few playthroughs to familiarize yourself with what skillchecks you need to pass at what times so that you can earn more skill points.  The challenge is that no character can pass EVERY skill check, so you have to be very careful in how you build your character.  As all the other reviewers have pointed out, you're going to have a much more enjoyable experience if you make either a pure combat character or a pure diplomatic character.  Your first two playthroughs should be with each of these, in fact.  Once you start mixing it up, you end up with a character that can't pass any speech checks, which results in having to fight, and you won't be able to win any fights because the combat, which is heavily reminiscent of the early Fallout games, is brutally unfair unless you put every single point into your weapon skills (and even then expect to spend a good amount of time staring at your reloading screen).  I think the biggest payoff is that after you've played through a couple of times, you MIGHT be able to piece together how to get the hidden best ending!			"

Early Access Review
								The Age of Decadence (AoD) is a gem that captures the essence of role-playing games, putting choice and consequence above everything else. Since there are so many clichés and misconceptions about what a RPG should look like nowadays, some warnings are in order. This way we can begin to talk about the game in comparison with what it is not. First, it is worth mentioning that if your idea of RPG is that of an action game in which you just push buttons to kills everything in sight, you will be disappointed. AoD is not the typical action RPG. Combat is brutal. If you don’t think tactically, you die horribly. If you pick up every fight, you are history. The game has the same unforgiving learning curve than Gothic 2, if not harder. However, despite its combat system being difficult to master, it is fair. Second, AoD is not a traditional RPG full of self-indulgent common places and bland quests. Don’t expect to get a job in the tavern to kill rats in the basement. You don’t have a group of buddies that will be part of your team. Do you want to be the Mr. Nice Guy that careless helps anyone that cross your way asking for help? Good luck with that. People will take advantage of you and gut you like a fish. You cannot be successful in every quest without ruining other people’s interest. If you defy powerful people they will mark you for revenge. AoD looks like a Hobbesian state of nature or the world of Game of Thrones without the most superficial characters. There is no space for quixotic dreamers here and you can’t survive for long if you don’t stay alert all the time. Of course, you can’t “invent the wheel” in the RPG genre and quests involving backstabbing and scheming for power are old news. However, in what AoD purposes itself to do, it does very well and without gratuitous self-indulgence. The character system was carefully designed and integrated with an immersive and addictive gameplay. Every single stat and skill have relevance and could make a difference between success and failure. Do you need to pass unnoticed by the guards? You have to sneak. You can’t sneak? Try to fool them with your disguise or persuasion. You can’t fool the guards? You have to fight or you are dead. Reactivity is key and your choices matter. There are no cosmetic decision here. In my second playthrough as an assassin, I end up on a very distinct path than the first and I suspect that in a third playthrough as an assassin I would still have many open possibilities. Considering that the game has seven backgrounds/professions at the start of the game (assassin, merchant, grifter, drifter, praetor, loremaster and mercenary) and each has unique quests, replay value is enormous.   All the elements of the game are top notch. The instrumental soundtrack is beautiful and captures the atmosphere of a post-apocalyptic world “inspired by the fall of the Roman Empire”. The graphics are good, but don’t expect the next generation graphics here. This is not a game full of cinematics that push your PC performance to the limit. Which is fine given the circumstances: we are talking about a cRPG produced by an indie studio without kickstarter funding. But what really stands out above everything else is the writing. The writing is strong and consistent. There is always a risk that a game with so much writing end up being compared with Planescape Torment, the classic that pushed the boundaries of game writing to insane levels. Fortunately, AoD achieved the feat of being even better. The lore is sophisticated and since every single quest is connected to the main plot, the game feels truly dense. The absence of filler quests is irrelevant, since there is much to explore. The biggest city of the game, Maadoran, is not gigantic as Athkatla of Baldur’s Gate 2, but it is definitely more meaningful. NPCs and their motivations are believable. Dialogues and quasi-literary “scenes” are memorable, reminding us of the scripted interactions of Darklands. And even in the middle of all the backstabbing that are some moments genuinely warmhearted – came to mind the dialogue with a farmer that cries about his tough life. AoD have been in the developing process for 10 years, which is perfectly reasonable for a RPG of that caliber, especially one made by a first timer indie studio (let’s not forget). Some little design tweaks and polishing of rough edges are necessary, but 90% of the game is already finished and 19 locations out of 22 are available in the Early Access build. I have a fear though that because AoD took so long to see the light of the day it will fail to live up to the hype of its hardcore fans or end up being treated with indifference for most RPG gamers. I hope that I’m wrong. AoD has all the marks of a classic. Let us give it all the praise it deserves.			"

												While I haven't played for very long, I can definitely recommend this game to people who love an older style of RPG.One that's fairly unforgiving, and will result in many retries to get the desired outcome, but it sure is worth it!So many avenues of approach to every situation, depending on your own specialties. You can completely avoid many fights with the right skills, or gain the upperhand with a cheeky stab before the fight. Or just try blazing in, shield up and weapon at the ready.Very very good game, and a very refreshing style of play			"

												So I’ll be honest I did not expect great things when I bought this game but I was happily proved wrong, this game is a fantastic crpg it has a multitude of different backgrounds for your character to choose from and the entire world changed simply by choosing to do 1 thing different in my second play through. 9/10 only problem I had is that the game felt a tad short but the endless replayability is pleasingNote: DO NOT BUY ENLESS YOU LIKE CRPG'S "

												I've played as a thief and I lockpicked every chest and door, stole everything that was to be stolen and stealthed everything that needed to be stealthed. And it was fun. <3I actually got lots of inspiration from it for future D&D or RPG Maker games.. =3Is the game hard?Meh. I don't know. I wouldn't say it's hard, it's just not your usual ""go in and kill""-kind of thing?I've played old games and they were kind of the same (like Lionheart: Legacy of the Crusader), if you're like me and love this medieval game with a cool skill check systems (with numbers and skill checks), then this is very cool to dive into.I don't wanna spoiler, but I slayed him. ♥ I drugged my character, so he could move faster and act more often, and threw all sorts of bombs that I had in my possessions to it and finished it with a few fast dagger stabs.(I found a bug on the way and reported it on Steam, Vince seems to be a very active developer since I've been seeing his name a lot around here. 10/10 support <3)I loved it, and I'll get back to it when I get the chance. I might go with a Mercenary next.I was very weak in the beginning, but late game I got so powerful (good equipment, thanks level 8 Crafting), that I became a killing machine (120ish Kills in the end).Anyway, I should write a review not fangirl about my character.The game has a lot of text to it, lore and a nice story. <3If you're new: Play as a merchant if you want to do less fighting and more socializing.. Mercenary if you want the other way. (You should a fair amount of Strength tho in order to join the guards. :3 If you wanna be a more Dexterious kind of fighter, you can always join the Assassins or Thieves.)Anyway, great game. Lots of fun. Loved it.			"

Early Access Review
								Steam and various developers, large and small, have left me quite jaded with early-access games of late. This game has piqued my interest though, and been on my wishlist for some time but my recent experiences with such things had left me hesitant to purchase it Then I see that Age of Decadence has a demo!  I played the demo for an hour and was sold, even though I was absolutely terrible at the game. It somehow combines the feel of Baldur's Gate, Fallout, and other old RPGs with a new edge that makes the whole thing fresh. Meaningful text content and choices, combat made intense for the risk of it, and a setting where you're only the protagonist because you think you are - otherwise, the npcs are equal. It's absolutely unique while being very familiar, witheringly frustrating while being utterly addictive, and I immediately recommended it to my brothers.  It restored some of my love for the genre, and my faith in current game developers in general. It is definitely a game I would recommend. Indeed, if you go throught he negative reviews, you'll only find that they consist of individuals who couldn't hack the difficulty, can't be bothered to read story choices in an RPG, or seemed to fail to understand that the game is still being developed.  If you can handle those things, do yourself  a favor and buy the game.			"

 This game is  NOT  for the faint of heart.  To be upfront with you, I had alot of fun with this game. It does nothold your hand in any way, and if you make a stupid choice then you will die. If you make a smart choice, you might still die. If you make a set of choices that ionevitably lead to one noble or another♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at you, you will be ambushed, and if you are not prepared for taking on 3 men, armed-to-the-teeth, wishing to kill you, then you will die. If you ARE ready for this situation, chances are, you will still die anyways. Akin to Dark Souls, this game punishes you lethally and often if you are not careful, however, comma, it has a very generous save system allowing you to save at will, and it auto-saves before anything drastic and at the start of every fight. So, yes, your badass arena champion COULD be killed by a few of the local street punks, BUT you could just re-load in and slaughter them. Some would say this game nudges you fairly heavily towards going down the path of not killing a single soul: never getting into a fight. I would say that they just push you to make a REAL combat build. You see charismatic, intelligent warriors in other games, in this one, if you want to fight and live, you have to put in everything. So yeah, you are going to look like an ugly brute, and in this world of choosing between the morally shady and the outright evil, you probably ARE just a selfish brute: a psychopath who is just mad enough to do the dance of death over and over. This game makes you focus heavily on whatever it is you are trying to do, and with so many different endings to see, it isn't the worst thing in the world to have to specialize in just a couple skills per character.This Game is punishing, and someitmes you realize you went through half of it just to come to a point in which there is no possible way for you to progress (see the part about making bad choices above) and so, you WILL have to scrap that character and restart. It is ok. Just let go of your hatred, padawan, start thinking smart, and hopefully Lady Luck will get you that little critical that will have you barely survive a fight against only one other man. BUY THIS GAME(PS The developers still work really hard on this game and still add things... they are very responsive to the community and all of their players thank them heartily for their tirelless efforts to make and continue improving such a wonderful and unique experience in gaming.)

												For years I was put off by people saying this game was ""very hard"" so I never committed to buying it. Finally when the price got low enough I decided to give it a shot. I will tell you right now this game isn’t ""hard"" but it certainly isn’t the normal modern RPG, it's intelligent and you have to be smart in what you are doing or you will fail. The story writing is excellent (immersive). The game play is fun. The places are interesting. The NPCs have soul. The only real issue so far is combat is very difficult to figure out, and probably too much so. It hard to make a combat character who is just a thug that wants to smash things, but it is possible.------------Amendment: You can make an axe murdering thug! From the pinned discussions.

												Firstly, if you're in doubt, just try the demo. If it appeals to you, buy the game because the game is more of the same.Now, real review time:One of my favourite games from the last couple of years. It's not perfect, but it has strong design that very much appeals to me personally. I think it's the only game on Steam where I have all achievements and specifically went achievement hunting because most achievements represent different story paths/endings and I wanted to see everything on offer.Overall, this game is the most fun I've had with an RPG since the ones released in the 90s and I thoroughly recommend it.Performance and graphics are not ideal. I've had some technical problems, but nothing that broke quests or anything. Mostly odd graphics problems that could be fixed by restarting or the occasional crash. But that's also rather unimportant in my opinion, considering what the game does. Technical problems are annoying, but never stopped me coming back even for a second.The game is not that difficult once you understand what's going on in the systems, or at least can be made relatively easy by placing your skills right.Some general tips if you want to try it out:    Don't skimp on learning the ropes. Do the tutorial, read the help menu etc.    Save up skill points. Don't place them until you need them. This is especially useful in combination with the next point:    Save and reload a lot to see what options are available to you. Almost every single quest in the main questlines has branching points, options for betrayal etc. Make hard saves when you enter/leave major cities or hit major branching points. Feel free to set the number of quick/auto save slots higher than the default of 3.    For different playthroughs, I recommend starting by completing the game as a pure talker with no combat skills or physical attributes, following the Merchant questline (aka easy mode). This gives you a good general overview of the game without any challenging combat. Then try a pure fighter with focus on combat and crafting/alchemy, following the Imperial Guard questline, to get a grip on the combat. After that, you should have enough of a grasp of how the everything works to try your hand at hybrid characters.    For combat skills, focus on one offensive and one defensive combat skill. Never take both dodge and block. Critical strike is useful, but not necessary if you've other skills to focus on.    For non-combat skills, persuasion and streetwise are the bread and butter of talkers, along with impersonate and maybe trading. Lore is very good and opens up locations otherwise inaccessible. Crafting also has many non-combat uses in combination with lore.    For your very first playthrough, I'd recommend going through completely without guides/spoilers if you can (well, except the general tips like in this review). However, once you've completed the game in one way or another, don't be afraid to use google to check out some of the things you couldn't figure out (e.g. how to get into the Tower Of Zamedi or The Abyss)    Look in every nook and cranny of each map. There's a few things that are unfortunately rather easy to miss, even with highlighting of interactable objects turned on. And unfortunately NPCs don't have indicators (above their heads or similar) for when you can talk to them.			"

												Years ago, I had stumble across AoD on the net. Looked really interesting, so I checked the site a few times, but the development seemed to have stopped. So I registered the game under 'Vaporware' and forgot about it. And then I saw it on Early Access here and decided to give it a whirl. And yes, AoD IS brutal and unforgiving. You NEED to specialize on one or two skills and stick to it. That also means that your gaming experience will be different depending on the type of character you are playing. It reminded me of Planescape Torment in that aspect. You could play as a big brute, trying to club your way through quests. Or be a conman and prey on gullible victims.  On the other hand, the turn-based battles feel a lot like the classic Fallout games, but much harder. Your character interacts with a world in which your actions can have far reaching consequences. It is a ROLE-Playing game. Be your character. Just play it. It's worth it.			"

												It took me a while to get into this game but now that I have I am enjoying taking lots of new characters with different skillsets through, making decisions and seeing where it gets me.  It is very possible to dig yourself into a corner with this game where you have neither the skillpoints nor the skillbuild to continue but once you realise that a single playthrough is actually not that long restarting with a different build/path becomes less of an issue.   Even with a combat build combat you have to be willing to replay the combat several times as random chance can always kill you.  Luckily the game autosaves at the beginning of each fight (and most if not all of the important conversation chains) reducing the risk.  I love fact you have a wide range of options available for most scenarios letting you make lords into emperors, backstab your guilds and the fact you can do an entire playthrough without touching combat once.  As long as you dont mind those things to much you'll probably love this.  Do try the demo.			"

												Highest replay value so far in any RPG that I have played.The mainstream RPGs bore me after a while; I never replayed Skyrim, Mass Effect, Dragon Age franchise (except for the intros in DA:1). I also did not replay Wasteland 2 or Fallout 3 or Las Vegas. But I usually play them for around 100 hours. This one is different in the sense that you can not possibly experience all the contentin one playthrough, by content I mean unlocking locations and solving every quest. Unlike the Eldar Scrolls games, in which you can become a thief and a mage and an assasin, all at the same time, which I find boring and unrealistic as it is not really 'roleplaying a ( meaning 1) Character' anymore, instead you roleplay multiple characters at a time. The Age of Decadence delivers a much more satisfying approach to this common paradox in many other RPGs, as it forces you to roleplay 'one' character.			"

Posted: October 22, 2015
												Tl;dr/summary at the bottom.I like the game, but it has plenty of issues.  It's a rough around the edges RPG in the vein of the original Fallout or Arcanum.  The gameplay mostly takes place in one of three areas: dialog screens with skill checks and choices, the openish world exploring, or the combat screen.  And yes, the graphics are atrocious, but think of it like you thought of Mount and Blade, in that it offers something pretty unique for where gaming is nowadays.There's turn-based combat which is actually very intelligent, with characters being able to perform multiple types of strikes with various effects (i.e. an aimed attack at the arms reduces the opponent's attack accuracy. at the legs reduces his/her dodge ability and mobility) based on their weapon of choice.  There's many weapons, a crafting system, and explosives made via alchemy.The biggest problem with the game is tied to its biggest strength, which is the cause and effect.  The fact that it's so responsive is great.  There's many outcomes to most questlines.  This is a great thing, and it's the biggest reason to get the game as far as I'm concerned.Unfortunately, the skill checks are really demanding and very arbitrary.  They're fun at first but only if you don't think about how arbitrary they are.  I enjoy the idea of a skill check and I've loved them in literally every other game I've seen them in, including the aforementioned Arcanum and Fallout.  It feels rewarding to make a character a certain way and have the game recognize that character's specialty. Nice to have a smart character with new dialog options that a tough dumb one doesn't get to even see.Each skill is ranked from 1-10, and to increase your skill ranking, you spend skill points gained from quests.  Dialog checks use these 1-10 rankings to determine outcomes.  So you'll see [intelligence] precede a line of dialog and realize that its success or failure is based on how high your intelligence rank is.  If your intelligence is high enough, it'll read [intelligence success] in green.  If it's borderline, it's white.  If it's too low, the dialog choice won't even appear.The following is a typical gameplay experience.  Let's say there's a character from a questline up ahead.  You've saved 25 skill points so that you can raise an appropriate skill when needed.  Better quicksave, because who knows what he'll require of me.  Ok, there's a persuade check in white.  You choose it. and even though you have a 5 persuade rank, you fail.  Ok, reload the quicksave and put the skill points into persuade so you now have 6 persuade.  Half the time, it'll still not be enough persuade.  Let's say that this time, 6 persuade is enough to pass.  Ok, keep talking, things are going well, and now you've got a streetwise check and an intelligence check.  Well, I don't have the points for streetwise, and even though my intelligence is 9 I somehow failed the check.  Reload, do some quests (of which there are less than you'd like), get that streetwise up, and still fail the check.  Even if you succeeded, there'll be ten other instances of checks during those other quests you're doing and you'll fail those a lot too.  Sometimes not, but it's really just random.In Fallout and Arcanum you had an idea of what you'd need to be proficient at going in.  In this game, they've split hairs with the categories such that it's really absurd to think you can predict what you'll need to be good at.  Sometimes you'll think to yourself, why would that need to involve ""impersonate"" or ""streetwise"" at all?  Why can't I just ""persuade"" this guy to let me do what I'm trying to?  Why is this skill so much weaker, yet still included?  Why does this other skill even exist?  When skill points are so scarce, why can't I have some idea of what I need to invest in to get the most out of all this?So you save points all the time, do quests, find out the checks, reload, invest.  It might as well be called ""Save Scumming: The Game.""  That's especially true because of the dice roll aspects of combat, which also feel unfair very often.There's a quest early on where a man tells you to kill another man who is threatening his livelihood because they both work in the same field.  In the current playthrough, I'm the apprentice of the man who instructed me to kill the other man.  My character has practically no combat skills.  I don't want to kill that other man but I also don't want to do nothing.The choices of that questline are as follows: ensure that your instructor is replaced by hastening new guy's arrival (and announce to everyone that you're betraying your boss), kill the man and ensure the safety of your instructor's job, or try and persuade the new guy to leave.  There's a guild of assassins in town, but I can't hire them to do it for some reason.  I don't get to try and be this new guy's apprentice, or warn him about my boss anonymously.  I can choose to do nothing, but the game resolves itself in a way I don't want, and I miss out on the points that I need to build my character.  So I picked the persuade option to make him leave and it says it succeeded.  Then I get a new, out-of-the-blue result from a hidden ""perception"" check which actually tells me that the persuade option didn't affect anything, and that this new man thinks he outsmarted me.  I'm now left with either the option to kill him or do nothing.  Reload, try again.It's moments like that which really frustrate the hell out of me.  It's just unfair.  We have a system in place of skill checks, but lets upend it and make new rules on the fly when it seems like it might be interesting for the story.  That's honestly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Even the hidden skill checks the game sometimes does are fine, whatever, but don't have a reported success actually be a failure.I like the game but it's just so damn frustrating to see things like this.  So 7 lore isn't enough but 8 is?  so 3 x isn't enough but 4 is?  Well those 2 Y points are useless then, I wish I could get a refund on that, but the entirety of the gameplay is really just knowing what you'll need beforehand and investing skillpoints into relevant skill areas to keep going.  It kind of becomes just a formality after a while.  You can probably look up online the perfect ratio to do the most content possible on a given archetype's playthrough.  It kinda stinks to know that going in.  I thought the system would be a bit more subtle than it turned out to be.  And I did beat the game, this isn't me ♥♥♥♥♥ing because I couldn't beat it or it was too hard or something.  It's unfair more than it is difficult, and that's a real shame.  Still, get the game to support future games.  It has so much potential to be greater in sequels, I think, or future RPG releases by this company.  And it IS a fun game when all is said and done.  I recommend doing a combat character first before doing non-combat, to get a basic understanding and so that you don't get too screwed by these kinds of skill checks on your first play.Tl;dr and summary: The game shoots for the stars and reaches the top of a 5 floor apt. building.  A good game but falls very short of what it tries to do.  Still deserves to be applauded for the effort.  Combat's interesting, skill checks are really random and unfair but do feel rewarding when they work in your favor, graphics are terrible, and the story is pretty good, not amazing though.  It's written in a style I don't particularly enjoy, with far too much embellishing and attempting to impress readers, but it's still worlds better than many other games.			"

												This Game is HUGE. It provides unique gameplay consistent of so many great things.  Combat system is genious, many weapons and items choices. Where u win one fight with one gear u may fail other fight with the same gear, u must think and plan what u use. Tactical decisions also make huge difference, u need use the terain advantage,position u self corectly , consider what weapons enemy uses, consider your own attacks type, actually u need to consider lots of thing, but this make the game so much more interesting. One fight may go in so many different ways.Decision making - actually in this game decisions matter, depending on what u choose game changes and the number of the possible plays is huge. Charakter screen is just great, so many skillz so many posibilities, i love it. Every skill point matters and u need plan where to put it. Even skill description is so amazing, when u get new skill the description changes with the most funny way, i smiled alot reading them.Storyline and dialogs - story is just great, it will consume u. Dialogs change depending on u skills and choices. Very funny     and meaningfull. I am not good with words to describe them. You need try it to understand.Game Difficulty - this depends on you and what u wanna play, if u play merchant or Loremaster with talking skillz u will have peacfull gameplay, if u choose to fight u will die before u know it :). Going combat oriented character increases difficulty Huge time. If u go to kill every one in the game - its close to impossible, i dare you try it.Music - game sounds and music - HUGE so autentic. When u hit shield with hammer - amazing sound effect :)Evel sheming - u can betray most of the people here (in game) u can plot and kill em all having no master and rule the world.Friends - u have no friends in the game, every one trying to use u and frak u big time. So kill em all :) (if u can).Graffics - i read lots of negative comments for the game graffics and i am daring u to find another game with size 2GB with so much content and to have better graffics, i think u will fail miserably finding one. Graffic actully need a reward considering the size of the game.This game puts RPG to whole new level. In my own opinion there is none who can match it now.Developers did amazing job.saluteGreetings			"

												The best roleplaying game I have played in a long, long time.It has a specific style that might not be to everyone's liking. Beware that if you want to have the best outcomes, you'll have to adopt a bit of a power gaming mindest. On the other hand, maybe you don't always have to stand your ground, maybe sometimes it's better to turn away from that dangerous alley. Not many games offer so many opportunities to backstab other people when things start going south. Do give it a shot!Great game, would...will play again!			"

												Good fun game - very impressive for an indy.Reminds me a bit of Dragon Age: Origins - lots of different starting classes, with each one providing a different experience in terms of run through. Similarly, it's very quest focused but unlike, say, Balder's gate the side quests can often have more wide-ranging repercussions.More negatively, It's also very area focused, with each part of the story being in a distinct part of the game world. This can be a bit frustrating, as you can't go back to previous areas to do quests you skipped once certain events have happened (I'm a bit of a sub-quest nerd). This is, yes, a bit more realistic but can be a bit of a shock - the transition events aren't necessarily that obvious, so you think you're completing a minor quest but actually it jumps you forward to the next section, with your other quests half done.It is quite pricey for what it is. I'm still on my first playthrough after dithering and reloading quite a bit, but it is still moving quite fast. The environments are quite small, interactions are a little limited and the graphics aren't all that. But it is fun and engrossing, well thought through and well written.			"

												What this game lacks in graphics, it makes up with story and options.I bought it back in Early Access and can say that it hasn't disappointed - each guild allows you to see a different aspect of the Empire when you follow their questlines, and while the combat system is unforgiving at first - THERE'S A TUTORIAL OPTION WHEN YOU START A NEW GAME, USE IT TO GET THE HANG OF COMBAT - I feel it's quite rewarding when you get the hang of it.Don't start with a hybrid character unless you're not put off by restarting the game and/or dying a lot, though.

												Carve your own path through a brutal RPG that doesn't hold your hand. No filler content or fighting rats in basements. You can't see it all in one playthrough but the length of the game is perfect for focused characters with their own strengths and weaknesses. A true RPG. Fantastic atmosphere and well written dialogue and world history that will make you want to play again to learn more about the world.			"

												Age of Decadence isn't for everyone. The combat is brutally difficult and often tedious. It can be avoided completely with non-combat skills, but you need to know which to invest in or you'll find yourself spread too thin. And as for the game's looks - it would've looked bad even when development began, over 10 years ago.And yet...For those willing to really delve into the game, your patience will be rewarded. The story's great, and features an unprecedented amount of reactivity. Almost every conversation leads to a decision, and these choices often have huge consequences that won't become apparent until much later. Age of Decadence works much better as a visual novel than as an RPG - just figure out which skills are the important ones, invest in those and enjoy the story as it unfolds before you.			"

												Highest replay value so far in any RPG that I have played.The mainstream RPGs bore me after a while; I never replayed Skyrim, Mass Effect, Dragon Age franchise (except for the intros in DA:1). I also did not replay Wasteland 2 or Fallout 3 or Las Vegas. But I usually play them for around 100 hours. This one is different in the sense that you can not possibly experience all the contentin one playthrough, by content I mean unlocking locations and solving every quest. Unlike the Eldar Scrolls games, in which you can become a thief and a mage and an assasin, all at the same time, which I find boring and unrealistic as it is not really 'roleplaying a ( meaning 1) Character' anymore, instead you roleplay multiple characters at a time. The Age of Decadence delivers a much more satisfying approach to this common paradox in many other RPGs, as it forces you to roleplay 'one' character.			"

												Good fun game - very impressive for an indy.Reminds me a bit of Dragon Age: Origins - lots of different starting classes, with each one providing a different experience in terms of run through. Similarly, it's very quest focused but unlike, say, Balder's gate the side quests can often have more wide-ranging repercussions.More negatively, It's also very area focused, with each part of the story being in a distinct part of the game world. This can be a bit frustrating, as you can't go back to previous areas to do quests you skipped once certain events have happened (I'm a bit of a sub-quest nerd). This is, yes, a bit more realistic but can be a bit of a shock - the transition events aren't necessarily that obvious, so you think you're completing a minor quest but actually it jumps you forward to the next section, with your other quests half done.It is quite pricey for what it is. I'm still on my first playthrough after dithering and reloading quite a bit, but it is still moving quite fast. The environments are quite small, interactions are a little limited and the graphics aren't all that. But it is fun and engrossing, well thought through and well written.			"

												The best roleplaying game I have played in a long, long time.It has a specific style that might not be to everyone's liking. Beware that if you want to have the best outcomes, you'll have to adopt a bit of a power gaming mindest. On the other hand, maybe you don't always have to stand your ground, maybe sometimes it's better to turn away from that dangerous alley. Not many games offer so many opportunities to backstab other people when things start going south. Do give it a shot!Great game, would...will play again!			"

												TL;DR: Interesting idea, but poorly executed. Let me start by saying that I appreciate difficult games. I am very fond of true roguelikes, and restarting a game multiple times doesn't bother me, as long as I can expect a different experience each time. AoD does not deliver this. What we have here is a very linear progression, but with artificial limitations force by the extremely stringent stat and skill points. There may be multiple ways of accomplishing an objective, however the end result is essentially the same. This model essentially forces you to choose to be either a talker, or a fighter - hybrid builds are invariably fatally underpowered. Generally speaking, since you have less skills to spread your points as a fighter, it is easier to build a strong pure fighting character than it is a pure talker - there are several different types of persuasion mechanics as a talker, which are sometimes tested at the same time. You might be great at disguise, but if the check called for disguise AND trading, you're screwed. There are crafting abilities as well, however your points are spread thin enough as it is, and sinking points into crafting can set back your progress significantly. Note that the above are all gameplay complaints, but I'd like to talk for a moment about the graphics and interface. Now, I'm not normally a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, but this game looks...not good. At best, the graphics are 10 years behind current gen. I think they would have been better off with an isometric view (like Baldur's Gate) than trying for full 3D. Additionally, the controls are very wonky, and the screens extremely bare. The setting itself is intriguing, and is the basis for what hours I did give this game. There are interesting aspects to the story, but some of it is never fully fleshed out, and what is there is vastly overshadowed by the poor overall design.			"

												Age of Decadence is easily the best RPG I've played in years. I consider it one of my favorites alongside the original Fallout and Arcanum. My first playthrough didn't have any combat at all but was full of intrigue, amazing choices for a 'talky' character and fascinating world building and lore. My second playthrough as a combat character was just as much fun. The combat difficulty curve is a little steep, but once you get the hang of it you truly get a sense of accomplishment from every battle you manage to win. This game doesn't hold your hand and takes you seriously as a player. It's a thougt-provoking game that makes you stop and consider the ethics of a post-apocalyptic Rome at every turn. The graphics may not look like much at first glance with obvious engine limitation, but the art direction is top notch and the atmosphere it creates is a feast for everyone with a little imagination. Truly a masterpiece in the genre. The only complaint I have is that there isn't more of it.			"

												Great game!I thouroughly enjoyed the character creation and replayability of the game. Choices matter, both what skills and attributes you choose, but also what you decide to do in the game world. High points for me were both the branching quests and story lines and the turn-based combat.Low points would be the fact that the end game feels a bit more limited compared to the start in terms of what you can do. The art to me was nicely directed and felt coherent and suitable for the setting, still, I can imagine someone finding the art and graphics a bit lacking. Doesn't really matter to me.I recommend anyone with a fleeting interest in old-scool, hardcore RPGs (whatever that may mean to you) to check out the free demo and see if you like the, slightly unusual, way the game plays. I certainly did and got many hours of quality entertainment from it.			"

												Age of Decadence is a fantastic RPG that easily puts to shame many AAA releases from the past few years. It is one of those games that truly lets you roleplay however you wish, and this gives it great replayability value through all of its factions, multiple ways of building your character and different stories to be experienced. I have only felt like this in Fallout 2's New Reno, where I had the freedom to join any of the families in the city. Oh, and I could also become a pornstar. Age of Decadence takes it one step further with all the possibilities it offers and is a must play for any gamer that misses the ""golden era"" of CRPGs.Pros:+ Interesting and unexplored setting+ Lack of a clicheic main story, playing as a nobody+ Multiple factions with individual and completely different storylines+ Challenging and complex combat system+ Plenty of ways to build your character and solve quests+ Best replayability value in ages+ Great writing+ Beautiful soundtrackCons:- Visually unappealing- Lack of content in the last city- Combat is partly based on luck- Crashed a lot at launch (improved now)Read the in-depth review here.[thegameslashers.blogspot.ro] "

												Considering how differently the game plays based on what type of character you choose, I should preface this review by saying that I played as a loremaster on my playthrough (though I plan on replaying the game and trying other roles).Age of Decadence offers most one of the most unique and interesting settings I've encountered in an RPG. It's a post-apocalyptic world in a Roman & Arabian inspired setting. However, as you explore more of the world and discover some of its long lost secrets, you'll also find elements of fantasy and sci-fi as well. It makes for a strange & interesting mixture but the game manages to pull it off without making the world feel random and incoherent.In terms of gameplay, if you play the game as non-combat based character, it plays less like a typical CRPG and a lot more like an adventure game with stat-based dialog checks and a heavy emphasis on choices & consequences and non-linear progression.One of the great things about the game is that there's practically no filler content. There are no tedious slogs through boring dungeons or endless waves of repetitive combat encounters. The game also has a fast travel system that lets you instantly teleport between locations, something I'm not a huge fan of in most RPGs but here it actually works in the game's favor. This results in the game being on the shorter side for this type of game (it will take you about 15 hours on your first playthrough but I can easily see someone finishing the game in around 5 hours on repeat playthroughs). However, considering the game just begs to be replayed multiple times, this is something you'll appreciate.The biggest issue with AoD is that it doesn't make the greatest first impression. The starting area is visually the least interesting area in the game and a lot of the stuff you do in the starting area is relatively mundane compared to what's in store later in the game. Also, the 3D graphics and top-down viewpoint don't work well together, resulting in you constantly having to rotate the camera. But if you can get past these things, you'll find an incredibly compelling world to explore where you'll go to any length to learn more about its secrets (like sacrificing a whole bunch of slaves!) Highly recommended for fans of turn-based CRPGs with a heavy emphasis on replayibility & choices and consequences. Actually, due to the variety of playstyles available, even if you're not a fan of turn-based combat, I'd still recommend trying to play it more like an adventure game with a non-combat character just to experience the setting and story (I completed the game without once getting into combat).

Early Access Review
								An highly addicting RPG with lots of choices! Multiple playthroughs possible and highly recommended.This game is one of the best RPG I have ever played. Why? Well this game is really unique in how much influence you have as player on the story. Normally games usually 1 linear story or maybe 2 stories (a good player/evil player) this game goes way beyond that. There are also a lot of endings that are really different from eachother. I have over 100 hours in this game and I can honestly say I still dont have seen everything. The good thing is you can play this game without ever having to be in combat. Most games dont give that option.The combat system itself is turnbased and has some pretty unique animations. Also you multiple choices how to build your character for combat if you desire. Playing an assassin with dagger is really different than playing a fully armoured soldier with a shield. I find the combat system pretty satisfying and there is an arena in the game.One thing to remember is that this game actually need mutiple playthroughs. If you play the game right it in theory it can be finished in a couple of hours, especially if you avoid combat. There are a lot of factions and houses which can be joined with unique storieslines. It is highly recommned to play these at least once. The background lore is really deep. If you play the skill ""Lore"" right you will enter a whole new universe beneath this game.Music in this game is pretty good and gives you the right feeling for the location/setting.Are there any flaws in this games? Well, this game has the tendecy to need knowledge of min/maxing skills and attributes. If you like to succeed certain ""skillrolls"" be aware that sometimes you will have to reload. Sometimes you need certain skills to be high enough or else you block a certain storyline. Personally I did enjoy finding the exact right build for characters but i can imagine not everybody likes taking time for this.This game is on discount today for 50%. It is easily one of my favorite games and I came back again to play it after a year.  Even when I finished it multiple times. This means it is highly addictive to play.			"

												Age of Decadence is like well prepared, carefully planned meal, that was removed from the oven a little too soon.It's still delicious, and you don't regret eating it, but you can't help but think it would have been better if it had stayed in the oven a little longer.The game starts off quite strong, and if each location in the game had the same level of detail as Teron (the starting city), I would have no regrets giving it my unqualified support.  Unfortunately, as the game gets progresses, it appears the developpers had less and less time to add the little details that help build the game's atmosphere.  In Teron, every doorway has a description when you mouse over it, NPCs have time to chat, and it feels as though you have dozens of possibilities of where you take your character.   As the game progresses, it feels as though the options become more restricted, and there are less sidepaths to take for your personal story. I can understand that after 10 years development, there is a desire to finally get the darn thing out of the door - but it appears (from my perspective) that the later sections of the game have less attention to detail compared to the earlier sections.Now don't get me wrong - Age of Decadence is a wonderful old-school game, and I heartily wish there were more games like it being developped.  I feel that if this game had been released in the late-90s it would have develloped a cult following, similar to Arcanum.  The writing is of a higher quality than most games released today, and the game's lore leaves you wanting to dig up every scrap you can in this dusty world.In the end, do not let any of the above discourage you - it is a fantastic game, it is only the aftertaste that leaves one wondering how much greater it could have been.

												Basically this game is the best RPG ever and if you disagree, you're a down's syndrome Mongoloid who was dropped on his head a few times too many. The writing is down to earth and well done, the C&C is unparalleled ( Witcher and Bioware garbage need not apply), the characters are believable, and the combat though infuriating for a newbie is well fleshed out. The replayability is a large function of the game, meaning that no one character can experience all of the possibilities and events the game has to offer. If you don't like that, you can bugger off.Also, if you don't like the combat you can still enjoy the game through the various non-combat routes. You just have to build your character accordingly. You can do a non-combat thief, a loremaster, a merchant, etc.. 10/10 game			"

								There's a reason why there hasn't been a single negative review in a long time. If you are looking for that RPG where every choice is meaningful, every stat and skill matters, and the story consumes you, you found it. The setting is unique, resembling some kind of post-apocalyptic ancient Rome with echoes of Cthulthu. Making comparisons to anything is difficult because the story is so fresh. The dialog is perfectly written, with hints of straight-faced humor mixed in with vivid evocations of a harsh world. There are so many branching plots, choices and consquences it's amazing the devs were able to keep track of it at all. And your choices matter big time. They shape the story and yourself. All stats and skills are viable, and have a major effect on how the game plays out. Each time I have played has been very different. I have played every major RPG since the 80's, and then some, and I have no problem stating this game has the highest replay value of all time. There are a tremendous number of story branches, often opening up new locations, NPCs, subquests and the like on successive plays. Graphics are passable but fit well, extracting the most from the simple 3D engine. Sound is excellent if repetitive, some stirring battle tunes and eerie wasteland dirges, Combat is turn-based and very satisfying, fairly deep, but heavily RNG based in it's current form. There are tons of special attacks and techniques, and each invididual weapon has a different set of them. You can develop very different strategies depending on weapon choice, what kind of defense you choose, enemy armor, etc., and strategy does matter; learn or die. If you choose to spec into it, there is a crafting system with about 10 weapon types, armor, shields, helms, alchemy, etc. And then there's the skill checks. Friends, if you want your choices (in stats and in dialog) to matter, hoo boy.  Skill checks can be visible, hidden, or a combination. Sometimes they will be linear, branching, chained together and so on. And don't think your  stats will only be checked in combat, oh no. You can slash your way through, but I don't recommend it on your first try...this game is tough, like the setting it lives in. You can solve problems with thievery, stealth, oratory, assassination or any number of techniques, I highly recommend you try it out. The demo is free, and while the game has made huge strides since it's release, it does give a good feel for the gameplay.  The Early Access is very playable, stable and it's a good sized game as it stands, but more is always being added. The devs are extremely responsive; I submitted a bug report and devs literally fixed it within minutes of recieving my email. Buy this game.			"

												Wonderfull game -- not for everyone, though! Please, do check out the free demo before you buy it.It's hard but rewarding. A unique experience definitely. You won't be able to run around doing fetch quests or kill hordes of rats for xp. But! The quests that you will be able to do are all well crafted and really thought out, while every fight is a struggle for survival where no one can feel safe.Great game for the lovers of cRPGs, but more importantly -- for people who can appreciate the wonderful story and harsh challenges that the game provides.

												People can complain about the graphics all they want, but even after only 3.5 hours of playtime, I stopped caring about that almost as soon as I began playing. Buy this game regardless of whether you like RPGs or not, it just might change your opinion on them (in a good way). This is a very well made game, and while it has crashed on me once, the devs seem to be very on top of things so I see even more possibility. Buy it.			"

Every run feels unique and your choices drastically change the outcome of your playthrough. If you're looking for a challenging and rewarding old school RPG then look no further than Age of Decadence.			"

												This game really blew my mind in ways I didn't expect it to, I was expecting a roguelike RPG from the demo, but when I got into the game I found it all really immersive, and soon I found myself reading the lore a lot more.This game isn't perfect, but I can say with faith that it's entertaining if this is what you're looking for;+Fresh and very immersive atmosphere, the game really made me feel like I was in its world more than any other RPG.+Pretty unique as far as the story goes, not cookie cutter at all, tons of moral ambiguity, and even though I never learned much about each individual character, it was nice slowly discovering explanations to the fate of the world, who others are, et cetera.+Not really one to critique on the audio of most games, but the music in this game is amazing and it fits the setting perfectly, but the sound effects are kind of eh. No voice actors for characters, but I didn't really mind.-Very unforgiving atmosphere, both in character, and out of character, and not in the way that you're probably thinking (if you think Dark/Demon Souls type of unforgiving, boy are you gonna be disappointed, and angry) In my opinion, this is the only and biggest flaw I've experienced in this game and it can♥♥♥♥♥♥you off to the point of ruining the game, but for those who are patient enough to play this game and go through the trials and errors, it's a plus. Personally it annoyed me. I'll elaborate-Some options you want your character to make are simply never presented to you, and there are very few ""checks"" that give you a second chance at convincing. So often you find yourself picking options you don't personally agree with, I can't tell if that's not what the devs wanted, or if the game is just trying to show you how sometimes it's smart to play along.Okay so now the bad, this game has tons of ""checks"" or ""skill tests"" if you haven't figured that out, they test your skill to see if you succeed at doing an action, like sneaking into a place, convincing people that bad ideas are actually good ideas, trying to kill people when they're not suspecting it, etc. The problem is that you really need to keep up with these skills while not letting your combat slouch or you'll find yourself in a scenario you simply can't get past, even after having restarted 50 or so times, so you either have to get into the habbit of saving very often and rolling back when you hit a wall, or starting a new character. This is the type of difficulty you'll face. I didn't enjoy having to restart the same fight 40 times to win, nor did I enjoy making a new character twice because I thought pushing a barbarian off a cliff infront of his guys was a good idea. So if you don't apply your skill points well you'll find your master swordsman can't read a freaking paper, or you can't perceive things correctly and report false information unintentionally. Honestly if the developers made this game a point and click adventure I'd still enjoy it, but this aggravated me.conclusion;Great game as long as you don't expect a game that focuses on combat like TES or Fallout.$30 is a heafty pricetag but I'm not really complaining.If you don't like reading quest text, you'll be disappointed about this game.

												Truly one of the best games I have played in years. Reminds me a little of Rome AD 92 on the old Amiga (for those of us old enough to remember!)Turn based combat is actually really good though feels clunky at first. Same can be said about the navigation.Nice touches of humour in the game too.The quests keeping the story going are actually one of the best parts of the game. You really start to feel immersed in the plot and your character. Overall I'd give it 9/10. One point off purely because it's very freaking difficult!			"

												I've been following this game's development since it was just in its little babby shoes walking around a crappy worn down town getting viciously murdered by the occasional bum. And I'm proud to say that I adore how it's developed into the lovely post apocalyptic, Roman themed, beautifully atmosphered, cynical chunk of tough love that it is today. If you enjoy Romans, having a bad time, reading, post apocalyptic scenarios, turn based rpgs or getting killed by many variants of hungry homeless people, then I'd say give this game a shot. Just remember that the best way to learn what do to in this game is to die, alot.			"

												 This is a really awesome CRPG in every way except for its graphic & controls.  I'm gonna be completely honest: the camera is far from good.  It's kind of like Fallout 1 & 2 in that way... & in many others... & those are still 2 of my favorite games of all time.  It's kind of like a low-magic, post-apocalyptic, Lovecraftian medieval sci-fi/fantasy Fallout 2.  & that's a compliment.  The writing is incredible, & the player choices are some of the most varied, interesting, & meaningful I've ever seen in a game.  Moreso than in Fallout 1 or 2, actually.  The stat system is really interesting too.  Basically every non-combat ability/skill check has its own formula to determine if the player fails or succeeds (& I think sometimes how extremely they do so).  It makes for a really minimalistic yet deep RPG experience at the same time, which is really interesting & cool.  It's also cool how you hardly have to kill anyone if you don't want to & if you can manage to resolve conflicts in other ways.  (Maybe you don't have to kill a single living creature; I'm not really sure.)  I really hope they come back to this & update the graphics & controls, though.  Maybe they should hire a new programmer for the latter part.  I'm not really sure.  Their writer(s?) & 2d artist(s?) are clearly fantastic, though.			"

												This is a wonderful RPG that breaks the usual mold. As the authors note, that may mean you hate it, but I loved it. /i have played through the story 6 times so far yet I feel there is more to discover. (I did much of my play on my wife's steam account so not many hours logged here).In AOD story is king and the what background you choose for your character will dramatically alter your play experience. You cannot under any circumstances do everything there is to do in the game in one playthrough. Each background, provided you follow through with it, will give you different experiences and opportunities. Each will be part of the same overarching narrative, but the part you play in it will vary wildly and the outcomes are pretty wide open.Most gameplay is driven by dialog choices, so in that sense this is something like a grand choose your way adventure crossed with a more traditional RPG. You can play the game through to its conclusion without a single combat, or, you can resolve nearly every conflict with violence.  But not all paths are equal in this freedom. Choose to be an Assassin and you had best be prepared to kill. Choose the life of a merchant and you really should re-think any attempt to intimidate the local brigands. Some reviewers complain that the gaim railroads your choices, but that is not the case. What it does is meet out consequences for your decisions and choices. If you want to sweet talk your way to greatness, invest heavily in skills and stats that support that, and then stick to that game plan. If you want to fight, you had best be the most hardened warrior you can imagine because the game is not going to cut you any slack. Every character cannot do everything. If you want to experience the full breadth of the game, you must play it more than once, choosing a different approach each time to see what can happen.Combat is unforgiving but you can master it. The key, like other areas of the game, is specialization. Pick a fighting style and master it. Choose one of the two defenses, and any of the weapon types. Keep those capped out, learn the system, and you should do fine. All in all, it's easier to talk your way through this game than to fight, but some avenues are only open to those with the steele to master combat.Many games promise multiple endings, and they tend to come down to some final binary choice, but AOD truly has a wide range of outcomes and combinations that will change your fate, and the fate of the world. You can choose who rules, rule yourself, destroy the wold, become a god, become a slave, and more. Looking at the achievements will give you a good idea what is possible but it won't make discovering how to achieve them any easier.This is a game about breadth rather than length. One play through will only be a few hours (unless you spend a lot of time fighting which takes longer). But I found myself going back again and again because every play through was an opportunity to take different paths and make new discoveries. In that respect it is one of the riches RPGs I've played, and I've played a lot in the last 30 years. "

												I love the replay value in this game it makes you have to do multiple playthroughs all focusing on different things in order to get all endings instead of simply usuing the strategy of ""oh ill just save before the final bit"" and that you actually have to care about developing your charachter and not spreading to thin			"

												Good game. I really like the way it plays differently for the different classes and if you choose different skill sets while leveling. The player character customization is also excellent every point makes a noticable difference. Another point in it's favor is that it does not really hold your hand through the quests you can actually miss a lot in this game if you do not explore. Yet another plus is it make take some searching but it seems they put multiple ways to finish many of the quests.  The combat is tough but fair. I look forward to seeing more offerings from this company.			"

												This game defines flawed gem.  It has a lot of rought edges but when it's working, it sings in a way few games can.The game feels like two games: a overly difficult tacitcal RPG and a choose your own adventure.  The tactical RPG is when you chose a character based on combat stats and the choose your own adventure is when you pick stats based on personality.  I guess the devs wanted a game where your character couldn't be everything at a given time but they gated it in such a way that there is little overlap which is a shame.  The moments when a choose your own adventure toon starts murdering the wicked are just so good but, by design, they are few and far between.  Hence why it's a flawed gem.When it's bad, it's meh.  When it's good, it's one of the best experience I've ever had in a game.			"

												This is one of the better games I've played in a long time. The lore behind this game is very interesting, truly an age of decadence(Cultural decline due to obsession with wealth and fortune). This is a turn-based game that is very difficult, however each time you die, you learn more about what you might have to do in order to survive. Since this is a 'Choices Matter', its often better to avoid fighting if you can and thats what makes this game amazing. There are 8 classes and with 7 Reputation groups along with a large variety of skills to train. Age of Decadence has a large variety of extensive dialogues which makes the game more interesting and easier to get into. Its very etiquette in its details, and really allows you to make your own choices in a lot of ways, granted it is a Linear game. I often found myself stuck on deciding on what to do, because the decisions were that interesting and difficult to make. The only con I'd give would be the fact that once I ended up beating the end game content, I felt there could have been more. Overall I'd give the game a 9/10. Very good game, especially if you like Tabletops and medieval style games.			"

												I played many RPG... all kind, this game is one of the best.Original universe, the story take place in a post-apocalyptique Roman empire full of mysterious ruins where people fight for survival, a golden past or peace.Well written, you will make difficult choice where you have to truly think, do you really trust that lord to who you just swear loyalty? Doesn't i look more and more like a go-to-war dictator?Good and bad are kind a blurry in ""Age of Decadence"".Your choices will have consequences that you will see, will you help the mongols or not? Who is gonna rule the first city and how?The gameplay is good, not perfect for my taste but good, battle or dialogue are never the same so you won't get bored.I have only 2 reals critiques to make, the game is not going to blow your mind with his graphism.The second is: the game is to short, i wish the universe was more rich, more factions to join or betrayel, more cultures to meet, more NPC.When you realise this is the worst thing you have to say about a game you known it's a very good one.Honestly if the most important thing in a game for you is the story/universe you can buy ""Age of Decadence"" with your eyes close.

 Review - The Age Of Decadence === Overview Age Of Decadence is a Classic RPG set in a post-apocalyptic world where society went back to pre-industrial levels, in a fashion resembling the Late Roman Empire mixed with oriental, middle-eastern influences. After the Great War, a conflict that happened hundreds of years before the game's current time, the world was left devastated. The few cities that were not obliterated by the weapons of the Gods tried to rebuild, after the Old Empire fell. A fragile balance holds together the region where the title is set, hidden conflicts between the three major Noble Houses, the Guilds and the threats from beyond are always there to break this balance at any moment...=== Gameplay Analysis At the beginning of each game, you will be able to choose between eight different starter origins. Most of them will determine an unique main quest line, while others will gibve you the freedom to forge your own path, with no pre-made allegiances to any faction. Regardless of your origin, you will be able to distribute 16 Attribute Points and a variable number of Skill Points in the abilities you find more suitable for the character you intend to play. In Age of Decadence there is a great quantity of Skills, which are divided in Combat and Civil. The former will be maestry with a specific type of weapon, dodging, blocking and critical strikes, while the latter will be focused on a wide array of talents, ranging from Lore, the knowledge of forgotten technology, to Persuasion, to nobility Etiquette, to Trading, Lockpicking and Stealing, plus many more. Each level of these talents will cost you more Skill Points each time, so better focus on just a handful of them with each character! This great level of customization and development of your character is the key of this game's success, a great replayability that will take you many playthroughs to do everything that is offered.Once you created your character, your quest will depend on your origin. If you chose Thief, you will have to do a robbery, while if you chose Mercenary, will have to protect a merchant, and so on. The starting quest will carry itself through the entire game, but of course there are ways to ""alter"" its objective.The world of AoD is location-based, meaning it is not completely open-world but instead has environments you can freely explore and a World Map to travel between them.A key element in this title is the great level of interaction with the NPCs: depending on your skills and origin, you will find a myriad of different dialogue trees and options in almost every quest and dialogue in the game. Some of these options depend not only on the level of your skills, but also on your Reputation with the different factions, your allegiance to specific guilds or groups, your statistics and even what you are carrying in your inventory in that moment! Truly, Age Of Decadence will surprise you with its staggering amount of different choices, each play with different characters and different abilities will be like a new one with all the possibilities. Personally i made 7 playthroughs with 7 different characters, and still there is much left to do and see!Of course, maybe you are more a combat type. Well let me tell you, AoD won't leave you disappointed with its extensive and deep Comab System, of which i'll talk about now: in AoD combat is Turn Based, and exclusing specific occasions, you will mostly be alone in the fight. Each weapon in this game has unique proprieties, for example Crossbows have a chance to knockdown an enemy based on your skill with them, while Hammers have a chance to dent the enemy's armor, making it weaker, and so on with all weapons. But this is only the start, as there will be specific attacks for each weapon, some unique also, that will lead to different effects on the enemy: an attack aimed to Arms will redice anamy accuracy and even disarm them on Critical, while a Whirlwind attack will hit all enemies around you, but with reduced accuracy.In combat, you have to consider many factors: Armor and Weapon hardness, determined by the material they are built with, an armor harder than a weapon will give it an hard time damaging it, while the other way around the Armor will be damaged instead. Then there is Dodge and Block ratings, influenced respectively by Dextreity and Strenght, and also by what armor you are wearing, eventual penalties, damaged limbs, or maybe just being Entagled in a throwing net. You also will have to consider armor damage reduction, critical reduction, which will reduce damage and critical chance of the enemy respectively, Passive Chance, which is a % chance to activate the weapon's passive ability, for example Crossbow enemy knock down. Well this is not all, but i think this is enough to make you understand how deep and interesting the combat system is.The longevity to complete everything in this game i'd say it to be around... 80-90 hours.Note that this game does NOT have difficulty options, and is a very challenging game to begin with. So i'd say challenge rating is High to Very High.=== Technical Analisys  Graphics  The art style is very good and depicts the game rightfully. Visually speaking, the game is not comparable to today's standards, lacks particullarry complex effects, shaders and all the fancy stuff we are used to nowadays. If you seek good graphics, then this is not where to look. Performance Performance is generally good, technically this game can run even on old configurations, there are though some sections where perfroamcne drops badly without reason, luckily for us they are very rare. Generally, solid engine with few problems on this side. Sound Music and sound effects are okay and congruent with the environment this game is set in.  Stability Few crashes in over 50 hours, very rare but possible. Overall a very stable game. Artificial Intelligence Enemy AI is quite good, they will know how to act if you have say an heavily armored character and acti differently with light armored ones, they will employ tactics and generally ba a challenge. Bugs & Issues At this point, all the major issues has been long cleaned up by the constant developer support, no major ones to report.=== Conclusion Age Of Decadence is one of those RPGs that come out once every few years, a real gem to place in the vault of those games which deserve a place in every collection, and while it is not perfect and has some dents here and there, its deep gameplay and storytelling on their own make it worth it. FINAL RATING: 85 / 100  "

												Great RPG. I love the post-apocolyptic post Greco-Egyptian-Roman world that it is set in. The storyline feels very historical at points, but completely original. The learning curve was excellent as I've come to despise being spoon fed for the first half an RPG. You sink or swim immediately. It has all the elements that made Fallout one of the most memorabe games ever. The replayability so far seems quite extensive and there is a lot of possibilty on the horizon for this game to expand down the road.			"

												It looks dated as hell, the character creation is nowhere near as detailed as it should be and no matter what you do your first characters will suck in so many ways that it's depressing.Love this game. When reviews say it's hard, they don't mean that it's a hard game. the game is not that hard at all. The difficulty comes from retraining yourself in how to think about what you're doing. This is most pronounced at the beginning when you have to really specialise and the forst city, Teron, really highlights the number of options for a lot of the quests. Most of the options will not be open to you, or you will have no idea you're even missing them. It's a clever game that makes you want to try it again a different way simply becuase you can't create a god-like character. Shame on you IronTower Studio!			"

												This game is a huge disapointment. I have played ""hardcore"" rpgs before and this game is not hardcore it's amazingly shallow. The game and other reviewers out there claim you can play anyway you want when really there are basically three ways to play. You can be a sneeky assasin using stealth and surprises to avoid fair fights you can be a smooth talker and charm your way out a trouble or you can supposedly be a bruiser and solve every problem with a blade. I say supposedly because the combat in this game is so unbalenced it's laughable. Every fight finds you out numbered and out gunned even if you devote every point to fighting you will find yourself banging your head as you are butchered by half a dozen enemies and then the game will mock you for thinking you could fight have a dozen guys at once. The world is also strangely bland and empty other than some named npcs who get their own portrait most of the towns in this game are populated by non intertactable generic vilagers who may as well be part of the scenery. There are many other rpgs out  there more deserving of your money don't waste your money here.			"

								-Do you hate giant worlds of bland, procedurally generated content filled with meaningless ""quests"" and storylines?-Do you hanker for absolutely brutal, highly realistic and utterly unforgiving combat?-Do you enjoy fine tuning character builds where every single point matters?If all of the above apply to you, Age of Decadence is definitely might be the game for you.The game is about one character, set in a post apocalytpic civilization that seems to once have had both Star-Trek like miracletech, like Force Shields and Holographic Emitters, not to mention teleportation gates, but also some serious anachronisms; Sentient Animated Stone Guardians are armed with swords (forged from Meteoric iron, but still a sword), the Old World was ruled by a Techno-religious priesthood with superpowers... and I should stop the spoilers. =DI've found this game incredibly enjoyable. The replay value is off the charts, the variability of combat and builds and story choices are all tied into each other in a way that only years of painstaking, laborous work by a true master can achieve. This isn't just a game, it's the creator's vision chiseled out of Torque with manually constructed storyboards, sanded down with gorgeous art and music, then polished by thousands of hours of playtesting - tens of thousands if you count the volunteers.This game isn't for everyone, but for us hardcore nuts, there is no equal.

Early Access Review
								This game is brilliant. If in fallout 2 you have a few quests where one can choose one path or another - here its only a few encounters where you have no choice, doesnt mean that that choice wont bite you - but hey sometimes you get the bear, sometimes bear gets you. In this game bear gets you a lot - so a lot of different saves may be a good idea since one may want to roll events back a bit and change taken path (have never seen any game with so much opportunity for betrayal).Other thing that sets this game apart is that you see plotline from different viewpoints - say you a merchant - you set some things in motion and later as you play as an assasin or a thief you get to play part in events. It doent take your previous self actions in consideration, but sometimes i was like ""hey, i did that"" or ""huh, so that how it went"". In any role you have number of paths, number of ways to change at least some details of the story.Ofc combat is hard, and getting harder as i write this (AI improved). But its true only if one wants a character that capable both speaking and fighting at the same time. Only a portion of content is availible for any character - more you want to bite - harder it will be to chew. Plus there is skillpoint managment - hard to anticipate what levels would be needed to pass this or that check - so going in blindly and failing only to load and come back prepared is essential part of the game. Ofc here you can affort to fail sometimes and there is some fun in that, but later when you know a lot you can design a character and path that it would take kinda like prisonbreak simulation.			"

												Overall I think this is a good game. The combat is not perfectly blalanced and the way the skill tests are designed can cause  some frustration but once you accept these things and play around them you're in for a good time. The strongest point of the game is possibly its atmosphere and setting. The questions at the heart of The Age of Decadence drive you forward and keep you playing through the difficult combat. Even having to re-start the game with a new character because your current one is unable to progress due to the way you have chosen to allocate your skills seems worth it. I give this game a 4/5.

												Very different experience from typical RPGs. You can kill everyone you meet, yes, but you can also manipulate people and talk your way out of 98% of the game's encounters. You can play politics, gain favor and trust from liege lords, then betray that trust for further personal gain. Extremely replayable and highly recommended if you're looking for a different RPG experience. Not recommended if you don't like to read.			"

Early Access Review
								I cannot recommend this game enough. Great difficulty, immersive dystopian roman game world, good characters and storylines, lots of different ways to play. If you are looking for a challenging tactical rpg with great replay value this is it. If you want to feel godlike and wade through dead enemies, I'd head elsewhere. 1) High difficulty/you are not god. Not every fight/situation is win-able sometimes it's best to avoid an area/quest/person. I love this because it really enhances a feeling of realism/roleplay.2) Immersive dystopian game world with tons of lore and a basis in roman history. I think that speaks for itself.3) Characters and storylines. This definitely added to the immersion. Characters have their own personalities and motivations and on top of that, it always feels like everyone is trying to attain those goals (and stay alive, of course).4) Lots of different ways to play. This should probably be at the top. While there are 8 ""origins"" you can choose to do pretty much anything you want with those origins. Want to be a thief with no sneak or lockpick and opt for disguise and persuasion? Go ahead. Want to completely screw with the system and play a hammer wielding, shield bearing thief with 0 social/subterfuge skills? Sure (though you may not last long if you keep thieving). But let's sum it up this way, I have 5 different Assassin files. Every single one is following a completely different path (some more succesfully than others).To be fair there are a couple of issues I have with the game as it stands now (early Feb 2014). I'm sure others have mentioned many of these (although the game is still a work in progress so hopefully these will be fixed):1) saves are sometimes problematic. You can't save during combat (good), but sometimes you don't get to save between combats or for prolonged periods of dialogue which can cause you to repeat certain game sections more than necessary. Also autosaves would've been helpful.2) heavy armor and block are almost useless (although this is possibly my incompetence). I have only ever been successful with dagger and dodge in combat. Also, dagger is overpowered (which while I do enjoy sometimes should probably be fixed).3) Not quite enough non-combat quests for certain classes in early game (this I definitely expect to be fixed by the end)4) This might be intentional, but sometimes you get into a conversation with someone and get stuck at a dead end of the conversation where you only have one or two options, neither of which has a chance of success, and can't back out with a neutral or non-committal answer. These are at points I wouldn't expect (as opposed to the time I screwed up and put my poor character in a death-death situation). Again, it might be intentional and if you save frequently it's not too bad.			"

												One of the best RPG's I've played in a very long time. Think of it as a low magic plansescape torment. If you live by your wits, combat is dangerous. If you live by the sword talking is hard. The game gives flexible alternatives to you. Minor Spoilers You have a bandit camp you are asked to clear out, you also have an expedition from a rival house to clear out. The traditional RPG solution is kills the bandits and then kill the rival house expedition. Take a few levels in jibber jabber though, convince your paymasters to *pay* the bandits to attack the rival house. Give your paymasters plausible deniabilty if it goes wrong deny all knowledge personally, clear up the bandit problem, kill the wounded lone survivor of the bandit and keep the money. Perfect outcome. Minor issues with the camera zooming in and out at random when my character gets too close to a wall, but other than that. No other issues. Would bluff my way through life again.9.6/10			"

												One of the best games of recent years. This is my second copy, I have 4 completed playthroughs on my first copy (fighter, merchant, assassin, Praetor) and picked up a Steam version because I thought it deserved a positive Steam review.AoD requires you to shift your mindset before playing. The warning it gives at the beginning, where it talks about how the world of AoD is harsh and unforgiving, it's not for vanity. Accept and go about quests the way you would in a Skyrim and you'll quickly find yourself shanked to death in an alley. Throughout it all though, it remains fair. The NPCs of AoD may not trust you or like you, but you have plenty of warning and foreknowledge if you keep your wits about you. The game, on the other hand, certainly gives a great deal of respect to the player and his or her time. There's no padding from pointless backtracking (you generally get teleported where you need to go if you so choose), no fetch quests, no assuming your character's motivations for you. If you want to stab your questgiver in the back, you almost always can. You can play all sides off each other if you're keen on it.This is not a game where you can complete everything in one playthrough. I'm on my 5th playthrough and I'd be surprised if I've seen more than 80% of the content. Every action you take, every line of dialogue, everything you choose, it will be remembered by the game and it will make a difference. One of the core pillars of the game is its systems of choice and consequence, and the game has it in spades. You will likely need to finish multiple games to piece together all of its systems and lore, each background/quest line only gives you a single piece.The game is fully beatable (and perhaps most rewarding) with ""hybrid"" builds (combinations of talkers/fighters). That being said, the easiest builds for learning the core gameplay systems are ""pure"" talker or fighter builds. I played the game as a merchant and managed to complete it without killing a single soul, then I followed up by playing as a Imperial Guardsman who killed in excess of 250 people. My third playthrough was an Indiana Jones type loremaster who managed to pass most skill checks as well as being able to handle himself in a fight. All these playthroughs are supported and possible to the point where each run could have been a complete game in its own right.So long as the graphics don't turn you off, you'll find a beautiful game. Despite all the intricately tracked variables and moving parts, I've never had a single bug of substance (the only issues I've ever had were 2 crashes and a small camera bug at the beginnng of a game). AoD has a level of craftsmanship and polish that set it as a gold standard for RPGs, be they indie or AAA.			"

												Iron Tower Studio’s ultra-challenging cRPG is simply wonderful. A fantastic setting that is a joy to experience, and with the flavour of history spicing it up. I have played alot more than Steam thinks I have, and intend to play alot more still. With truly challenging combat, a powerful narrative, and some of the best role playing you will get to do without playing a pen-and-paper RPG, it simply is a game you must play. (Yes, it gets brownie points for having a demo)

								Where to begin? This is a one of kind brutal turn base RPG, set in a Ancient Era of the Roman Empire. While there is influences of the Khans, and Egpytians the complex culture that exists in this world. The monsters in this world are the people, and how far everyone is willing to go to stay alive and keep their head out of water. And spare their miserable souls to the heiarchy of the gods.You will be lied to, you will be cheated, and many times you'll find your ""bad♥♥♥♥♥quot; warrior being taken down by four thugs armed with nothing but shivs and pants. However, not every battle is optional. Using your insight to find the lies within their dialogue and making decisions that suit your best interest of survival.Combat is brutal, as everyone else on these reviews may tell you. While functioning on a map that is color coated based on your mobility the game will help you make ""smarter"" decisions when battling people. It will not hold your hand as you choose the best options each turn. Similar to the fallout V.A.T.S. where the character may choose a limb and strike at the location to of the enemy to cripple them or an advantage they carry over you.The dialogue is superb, and the characters all their level of charm. Each offering different dialogue choices on how they feel about you, where you come from and where you stand with other political affilates. There are multiple options, and so many paths that the story will have you wanting to see every side. I will be honest, the audio and graphics are nothing special to look at, and at times a sense of world interaction seems empty. It would have been cool to interact with the world around you more and utilize it in taking advantges whether it be the height of a tower, or a small doorway to fight enemies one at a time. There are times the game does this but I wish I would have seen more. Overall, this game is great. It has a free demo, so if anything do what I did and try it. After a while once you truly, ""understand the system"" you will appreciate the game so much more. Try it out, the money is worth it. "

												I could actually mistake this for an old game in the same vein as the original fallout--and did at first, since I didn't read much of the description before buying it on sale because it had been on my wishlist. It does have many of the same positives and negatives of that breed of game, and I love it for all of them. While the game is a little short, it has a ton of replayability and choices actually do affect your route in a significant way. This can lead to you unintentionally screwing yourself down the line, but it's rarely such a screw-over that you have to restart from scratch. The lore is engaging and the low-fi in-game art is paired with exceptional profile portraits and solid writing. I got truly lost in the world. My only real beef is the occasional typo, but I can see how that could happen with so much text.tl;dr: it's like fallout: nv if Caesar won, but also there's a little elder scrolls in there			"

												I find this RPG to be very refeshing.  Its not just another rehashed RPG.  The depth feels like an older game as  do the UI and graphics, LOL but its engine flaws are minor and dont interfere with the gamplay itself.First off its challenging but not terribly hard.  Im no expert gamer and I caught on just fine.  Patience and strategy help. Combat isnt as hard as some make it out to be .  There are various attacks at your disposal as well as purchasable items like nets, black powder bombs, liquid fire, or be an Alchemist and make them.  Positioning can be important as well.  Weaken your opponent hurting his defenses or accuracy before using your stronger attacks. Use some strategy.  Combat becomes easier as you learn what attacks do what, and using what works best to maximize the Attack points at your disposal each turn.  Oh and some encounters arent designed for combat.  Skill points are important.  I like to save before using a stash off them so I can see just what abilities affect my character the most. The story is well written and keeps my interest.The story plays out differently depending on your decisions and what class you chose.Ive experienced no crashes or glitches while playing.  The camera feels clunky at times but you have the ability to center the camera back on your character if you feel the camera angle you want is getting away.The game probably isnt for everyone.   Your not a hero thats going to steam roll through the world.  You dont have a party  to rely on although some encounters you do have help from (guild,raiders,mercenaries, etc) but only for that encounter.  You cant be an expert at every skill.For me though this game has held my interest longer than any other RPG in recent memory.  Maybe because its a little different and requires some thinking and strategy.  I was hesitant on purchasing due to reviews that made the game out to be very difficult, but trust me if I can figure it out and find it very enjoyable then most RPG fans can as well.  If you like going from start to finish as fast as you can steam rolling anything in your way then this isnt the game for you.			"

												This is a fantastic game! I found the story and the world to be refreshingly different and I wanted to read more about it. I wanted to discover what had happened and why the world had moved on, etc. I became very immersed in the game to uncover more and more of the game world's past. There have been precious few games for me that I have gotten lost into and this is one of them. I loved every minute of it, and discovered it through buying the game ""Dungeon Rats"" that is set within the same world. There wasn't the usual in-your-face political and social commentary that far too many games espouse these days in order to vomit out the liberal agenda of their devlopers. It simpy told a story and allowed you to participate within it and shape the destiny of it. Well worth the full price and I truly hope we get more from this indie company who once again left the big boys in the dust by making a FUN, STABLE, and THOUGHTFUL game. This is a must have for any fan of rpgs.			"

												Age of Decadence is a great turn-based RPG set in a unique alternate world where technology stagnated around the Bronze Age due to a cataclysmic event.  The player will find themselves thrust into the remains of a once-great Empire fractured into various city-states that operate under their own rules and have shaky relationships with the other city-states.  It’s a deadly world where you may die as easily by a sword thrust as you will by finding yourself on the wrong end of political intrigue.The first thing to mention about AoD is that it doesn’t play nice when it comes to combat.  In short, you are a human in this game and will die as humans do when peppered with arrows or having an arteries slashed by daggers.  You will – and should – die often as you try the wide variety of attack and defense combinations and combat options.  As you get better and find your preferred skillset (i.e. sword and shield, dagger and dodge, ranged weapons, etc.) you’ll realize another important thing: your opponents are humans too and die just the same.The other very important aspect of AoD is that individual characters classes play quite differently and have unique storylines and encounters because of it.  While I enjoy the brutality of the combat, AoD offers multiple options (Merchant, Loremaster, etc.) where you can finish the game by avoiding combat entirely by using wits and charm instead.   Whichever way you choose to play, it means that there will be parts of the world you will not see in a single play-though – a thug isn’t going to be allowed into the king’s court just as librarian will not last long in the arena – and this makes replaying as different classes very satisfying.AoD is a solid RPG in a unique setting that makes character customization actually count for something.  Having a player’s decisions matter, whether it is putting skills in lock picking and finding a special dagger or choosing to murder your employer, and seeing the consequence of those decisions is a real stand-out here.  I highly recommend the game to anyone who likes their games rewarding because of the challenge. "

								Do you like to have choices with real consequences in games you play? Would you like to have a branching storyline which starts off differently depending on 8 different character backgrounds (in an essentially classless character creation system)? Would you like both challenging and tactical turn-based combat and a deep dialogue system?If so, you have found the right game. Age of Decandence has all of this, in spades. This is a game which does not hold your hand and where your character is a ""hero"" which can easily achieve anything. In this game, you are only a small cog in a big machinery and if you fail, you will die... a lot. If you want power, you will have to fight for it - prepare to reload a lot and learn things the hard way.This is also not a game which railroads you along the same path no matter what you choose to do differently. This is a game where story, choices and character progression is woven together better than in any other game I have ever played. You could only stand frozen with awe at the thought of what these guys could do with a bigger budget. Therefore I consider buying this game being a matter of honor for RPG enthusiasts. This game symbolizes more than any other how good a game can be if you include all the things which has been removed from today's modern dumbed-down RPGs.			"

Early Access Review
								Age of Decadence is a CRPG that is just getting ready to move to Beta and has been some time in development.Age of Decadence feels like a game specifically designed for those that love to replay a game. To play with the numbers, experiment with the skills and statistics, a game you either need to love doing just that or be willing to spend quite a lot of time with, to get a feel for the underlying mechanics, to be able to explore the many possibilities and varied storylines.The replay value is enormous. The experience and storyline vary quite a bit depending on your choice of class or skillset. It can be *very* frustrating to reach a point in the game where you just can't do what you'd like because you don't quite have the stat or the skill - and it can be just as rewarding when you go back and try again after tinkering with the numbers. It is anything BUT a game where the only difference between a thief and a warrior is the title.I like the feel and the setting for the game. It has a setting and a backstory that is both well thought/fleshed out and unique. Things that happen within both make sense and have the feel of  ""A Canticle for Leibowitz"" to them. (BTW great novel you should read.)I am looking forward to playing it off and on through development and seeing what it has become when it finishes. If you are a die hard CRPG fan I think you will too.			"

												An amazing game!much better than anything bioware has put out in the last 7 years. Choice and consequences are in abundance in this game, their are multiple solutions and outcome for various quest and encounters in this game, and furthermore your characters background can also effect the outcome in these situations. while bioware attempts to tote that choice in their games are meaningful, they lack the depth that Age Of Decadance was able to achieve, your character is truly your's to mold, your character actions have weight, your character has agency. It's refreshing and sadly rare to see so much freedom given to the player, sure their are games that give you that freedom such as mount and blade warband, but these tend to lack a story enriched experience, and tend to come off bland in that regard. Then of course their are games like say dragon age inquisition that are very story rich but only cast an illusion of choice, and player agency, it doesn't matter option if your presented with an option  A save the magi or B save the templars, there is no real sense of consequence for your choice other than missing out on a few quest and loot.Age Of Decadance however manges to find the right blend, while it make not be as large of a world as the previous titles i compare it to, it makes up for this with giving you mallable and story rich world, driven by your choices. if your looking for an amazing rpg to try out, this is the game.

												I am going to leave the original review so others can see the concerns i had but having received feedback from the devs immediately I understood the design mistakes i was making and tried it out. As said i love the concept and now enjoy the actual game far more. Great fun combo between story mode choices and exploration/combat/encounters. Thanks Vince for the prompt and helpful suggestions and Goral for the forum guide recommendation.---Previous Review----The game is a great concept and i honestly love the random events, choice system and realism of falling for cons or trusting blindly resulting in something actually good. Example: Depending on skills when a girl runs up being chased you may or may not realise this is a trap and you may or may not, depending on skills, give her a break.Anyway that being said i cannot recommend this game because of the sheer forcefulness of the skill checks in the main story. If you do not have the pre requisite skill levels in the pre requisite skills when you go into a story based choice you will fail and you will die. So you are forced to take certain skills to certain levels with no ability whatsoever to bypass, make an alternate choice or progress. This kills it for me, i lose all options on MY character and instead have to become a cookie cutter cardboard simulacrum of the devs idea of what i should be.Sorry but change this system and i think the game opens up dramatically to exploration and choice as, i believe, it was intended.

												A very engaging and unusual RPG. It's a bit hard to understand everything at first, but once you grasp the idea, things run smoothly. With a huge variety of choices and very flexible character development system no two games will be the same. Combat in this game is really tough, which also makes it unique. Still there are some backdraws to this game as well. Game / save game loading is quite slow, graphics could be a little better, maps could be more friendly, map rotation with ""middle"" mouse button is definitely a bad idea, changing attack methods several times every turn due to AP restriction is frustrating, etc. etc. Still a solid 7.5/10.

												Hello,This game, indeed unusual, is, in my opinion, a pure marvel. The diversity of choices and point of vue depending on the faction you join or the abilities of your character invites you to re-play the game to see it differently. And you can see it so differently that it even appears to be another campaign. The challenging fights makes you use your wits, either to avoid them or to remain standing afterward. I really enjoyed the game mechanics I hope there will be more games in that line. (Please do not fall like so many did, ending up in dissapoingly easy games.) I fully recommand for anyone adpet of paper RPGs. The system, way different from D&D, might unsettle you at first, but it is really worth grasping, way more challenging fights than modern D&D games. Thanks to the dev, and enjoy to all the others.			"

I feel like what I did didn't matter, and was unable to truly make the impact, or at least the feeling of an impact that I truly wanted from it.

												Age of Decadence...An interesting experience to say the least, and a far cry from what I expected...Here's what it promises;""The game features a detailed skill-based character system""It really does. The skills you equip your character with /matter/ to a huge degree - and in combat, whether you use axes, swords or daggers will have a real effect on how combat will 'feel'. A dagger wielder making quick throws to the legs, then strategic cuts to the main artery versus the 'big sword, big hits'.Outside of combat is no different; Being able to talk a cult into believing you're the chosen one and having the world react, to starting a combat with slaying half the opponents before the fight's even begun.I'm incredibly impressed with this skill system.The problem is we've all read these things before, thousands of times; empty promises and we've learned to tolerate them. Iron Tower greatly impressed me here.""multiple skill-based ways to handle quests,""Check. And pretty much every one of them, too. Sure, some of 'm will boil down to combat no matter what, but take it back a few steps and you can see it coming (which is important, because combat is proper brutal).If you feel like you might not be able to handle something ... chances are, you shouldn't be walking in alone.""choices & consequences""AND THEN SOME. This is probably what impressed me most. Now, here's the flipside;The game is *way* shorter than I anticipated. 11 hours, and I finished my first playthrough, but playing 'semi-ironman', there's so much I want to do different and to see the world change...Look. I love the TellTale games series for their 'choice and consequence' BUT ... I'm also aware their choice and consequence is an illusion. A sleight of hand to make you feel like your choices mattered, when really, they all lead to the same thing wit hsome variations.Here, not so much. *completely* different *and* unpredictable.Unpredictable /might/ not be up your alley; I sure as hell wasn't /planning/ to end my first game by bringing my chosen liege under alien mind control but there you have it.It feels FAIR though.""and extensive dialogue trees.""Also check.Here's a game that exceeded my expectations, and converted me to the 'sure to pre-order' on their next release.Easily worth the price, on sale or no.My nomination for the 2016 ""I liked this game before it was trendy"" award.

Early Access Review
								15 out of 10: A must play for every old school RPG fan.The game is a true renaissance of cRPG classics, it's like a rich interactive book including more text and choices & consequences than even Planescape: Torment did. The tactical turn-based combat system is as much fun as Fallout 1-2, Arcanum, The Temple Of Elemental Evil, or Divinity: Original Sin feature, plus it's really challenging and unforgiving, this makes victories even sweeter and triggers your adrenaline gland every time you're 5 HP away from finishing the final opponent. The character development system is really diverse, both combat wise and text adventure wise. The graphics is a combination of old school isometric and modern-day 3D, once you get used to how the camera works you'll find it convenient. The small graphical details, the lighting and textures are pleasing enough for the eye if you're a high-end graphics fan, visually it's as good as, say, Heroes Of Might and Magic V.I've been playing the early access/demo builds of The Age Of Decadence for several years, and the new features and content added always make it even more fun and more polished. The replayability aspect of the game is unprecenent as on every playthrough you can follow a new path and view the factions, the characters and various aspects of the setting and its history differently, it's like a series of books exploring a story through the eyes of different characters involved. The endings are also mutliple, and it entirely depends on your PC's choices and characteristics what he/she achieves in the end, provided you don't fail on the way. Do save often before taking key decisions, both to avoid failures and to explore various possibile outcomes of your actions.I'd say I've never been so excited about and so much enjoying a game for several years before it has even been released.

pu]An interesting, and rewarding approach to RPGs[/u].  Some of the things that make this game enjoyable for me are:- A Combat system that is very logical at its core : One with a feeling of realism and obviousness, but that still allows your imagination, creativity, and preparation to dictate the course of the encounters.  You can visually assess your chances of success before committing to a fight, but there are unseen elements that could turn the tide either way.  The core system is simple and removes the randomness and fantasy elements (your gear is a big part of the fight), but the skills and player-chosen styles can easily off-set close odds.  It's actually disappointing that more games don't use a similar system.- A Skill system that is based in reality :  Your skills make sense and play into the interactions you have nearly every step of the way.  Your skills (and lack of skills) dictate the flow of conversations, turn of events, and the opportunities to explore different paths throughout the story.  You will play a different game with every different combination of skills you choose, whether it's a combat experience or a non-combat one.- A world that you're actively impacting : How you succeed and fail (depending on your perspective) shapes the course of the story and the interactions you have throughout the game.  People do not forget, and life doesn't just go on.  Not only is the player's experience altered by their choices, but it's felt by all characters and by the turn of events that you witness.- A game you'll have to replay : Beacuse the play styles are so different, and result in such a different story experience, you'll be surprised at how much you missed in a single play through.  The dialogue is rich, and the story thorough, well planned, and well-guarded.  You won't learn things for no reason at all.  You'll hear the common woes of the people you meet, but you'll actively need to pursue the pieces of the puzzle if you want to put it together.   Because different choices result in different experiences, you may meet the same people across different play-throughs but feel like you're talking to a very different person.  The game is fantastic about making the characters dynamic, and you'll realize that you're really only ever getting to know someone from the perspective of their disposition toward you and the way you've impacted them.One Con to speak of:While the game is great there is one big draw for me.  I wish the game was longer, or bigger in scope.  I wish there were more cities, more regions, more items, more characters, more everything.  I realize there is always budgets, but this is a game we would all benefit from it being bigger.  I want to be playing my favorite characters right now, but I've already done everything and beaten the game, so that's that.  :(   Some play styles are quick.  You'll hit an ending without realizing what you're getting into.  It will make sense in the grander scheme, but can feel like you just dumped all your hopes for that character and that play through down the drain.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this game.  Both for the price point, and to support this development team's next endeavor "

												The Age of Decande is a top down RPG with isometric battle mechanics, much to the likes of games like the old Fallouts. It excels at what most of the RPGs nowdays try (without success) to portray: a big, live and dynamic world and a actual sense of freedom. I say ""actual sense"" because in this game you can be almost anything you want to and still be able to go through the main quests and much more. You can be a gigantic brute dumb as a bag of bricks, an agile swordmaster, a sweet-talking merchant sociopath, a silent thief or assasin and even a loremaster seeking knowledge of the past and new experiences. There is depth to all of these choices in narrative and gameplay. To make a good analogy, If Skyrim an ankle-deep ocean this game is a ""Mariana's Trench-deep"" lake.Of course, this game has problems. One of them, which is the graphics, are not objectively a problem. Hell, as someone who plays Dwarf Fortress this game's graphics makes me shed a tear of joy. The main problem to me seems the lack of polish, which is understandable considering the gigantic amount of content and the small but ever-persistent to help team of developers. It's also their first RPG, so I'll give Vince and his guys a break. I'm looking forward to throw my money at their future works.light 8 out of 10.			"

Although it is possible to get over 200 Kills in this game, it is also possible to finish it without 1 single kill and just talk you way through. Now that is good varied gameplay.I never thought exploring Fallout Rome could be so fascinating and I would definately purchase another game based in the setting if they ever make one.			"

												Awfully good RPG stuff. You can pretty much play whatever style you like. I did one as a guy that only knew how to smash things with a hammer, was lots of fun, the combat is quite good. I played again as an all-brains character and finished without having to do combat a single time.There are some spots in the game that I just couldn't figure out what to do with, even the 2nd time through focusing on a character that should figure it out (brains/lore/etc). It bugs me....but, that 2nd game I did find locations the first game didn't reveal and vice versa, so there is variety in replays. Not random mind you, just things some paths through the game will uncover where other paths won't.			"

												Ok this game is hard. Its hard for no reason in some spots. Its forces you to reroll charcaters because you miss spend points. If you don't build your combat charcater an almost exact same way as it expects you too you will die repeatedly and get frustrated. You are constantly outnumbered in almost all fights as apparently having allies is out of the question. This game will make you rage quit over and over.It has plenty of good too for 8 bucks. It has multiple ways to beat situations. Your charcater willl have flaws and cannot solve every problem and that will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off multiple times. But when you do have a long odds victory you will feel like you earned it. Pros	1. Multiple Starts, stories and quests.2. Fun combat with lots of options.3. Good world, it pulls you in to learn the lore and story. You think you know it, you think you've heard it, but then it surprises you. Cons	1. You lose way way way to much2. If you don't know the mechanics you get beat up bad.3. If you like combat you have to be a alchemist, crafter who only specializes in melee combat(one style offense, One defense)			"

												This game is what we need in this world of often bland and cliche RPGs. While it's not a particularly long game it makes up for it in replaybility. This game is unforgiving and cruel. Often time making the right choices get you killed and the wrong ones will let you squeeze another day out of your pathetic and moderatley insignificant life in this game. This game is wort every cent and I won't bother spoiling the game for you. Wouldn't want to spoil the frustration of you getting totally destroyed in most fights.			"

 The ""Too Long, Didn't Watch"" Review:The graphics are dated, the music is meh. The combat is very, very hard. The replayability of this game is ridiculous. Many, many dozens of hours are potentially available here. Very massive, very immersive story full of choices....and consequences. Truly a gem and that rare game that's worth the full price. 5/5 Worth every freakin' penny.The ""Meat & Potatoes"" Review:Just exquisite. Ten years in development, and it pays off well. I will replay the hell out of this game and be on the edge of my seat through each and every playthrough. No magic and dragons and the like. No easy, kill everything to grind away mechanic. No, my friends. You are here to PLAY this game. To outwit this game. To outsmart the 100+ named and 750 ""generic"" characters. To master the games 600,000+ words of dialogue. This is a game for the ages, in my humble opinion. It will never bowl you over graphically, but it'll leave you wanting more and more and dying to see each and every aspect of the worlds story. You become immersed into this game and it's world very easily. The clunky movement is quickly overcome. The dance through the dialogue is forever enchanting. Try the demo, it's entirely free. I too would be THAT confident if I released this gem of a game. You'll want more. And more. And more. Start playing now. Quit wasting time with the reviews. 5/5 and worth every penny. Happy Gaming!!!			"

												The little indie that could.One part throwback to an earlier era of RPG's but at the same time a step forward in many invovative ways. A great combat system that puts a touch of reality to combat. Multiple branching storylines and character designs allow for a huge amount of replayablity.Don't be put off by the Fallout style graphics, this game is definately a hidden gem.Recommended for all old school CRPGers!

												Best RPG in ages. The character you build matters and interacts with and affects the story in fascinating ways, the combat is satisfying, and I think the setting it fascinating. Being a single PC combat type game, it's probably got the most to offer for fans of Fallout. Plan on replaying multiple times with different builds in order to experience everything the game has to offer. And save lots. Lots and lots, especially if you plan to engage in combat.			"

												My simple ""review"" of Age of Decadence. Divided in pros and cons. It may contain some half-spoilers so be warned.In no particular order.+ Solid writing (obviously relative to other CRPGs, not books)+ Challenging combat at times+ Replayability (i only finished it 1 time but from other started games i can say that the game play very differentely depending on your character and choices).+ Interesting and original gameworld and story for a CRPG (truly original, not as in: ""It has dwarves and elves but dwarves don't have beards !""). Weird but mostly logical mix of science-fiction, greco-roman culture, postapocalyptic (think ""Canticle for Leibowitz"" kind of apocalyptic), a world that illustrates the 3rd Clarke law: ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"".+ A rarely exploited theme: Political struggle described in a semi-realistic way. The player may influence the outcome but himself is not one of the main figures invloved,+ No clear distinction of good and evil - the grey morality thing that many CRPG try to pull off is actually done well in this one.+ Indiana Jones vibes (very subjective)+ Some pretty art (illustrations for some in-game events or items in inventory).  On the other hand the engine and 3D assets look often rather bad (see below)- Graphics (3D technology used and the looks of some of the towns/locations) are rather bad.- Difficulty curve for combat focused characters is weird: the beginning of the game is by far the most difficult part.- A few small bugs here and there even after a year of patches.- It isn't party based: such a waste considering the tactical combat system implemented (a very subjective point).- Player may feel a bit railroaded in a few places to push the plot which contrasts with the most of the game where you are left the choices.- Character system where you can add points to your skills on the fly, at any place, any time. The result: game begs your to savescum. Could have been done better imho.- Most playthroughs (from what i've read, only finished the game once so far) lead you to the same place = The Temple as some of the endings require you to be there. A little disapointing for a game that is supposed to be strongest at doing branching story and real choices and consequences. Overall i am quite impressed. With the exception of the very beginning of the game that felt a bit underwhelming i had a blast playing it. Despite the flaws (the biggest one would be the technology used, the game simply looks ugly in many places) it is an interesting attempt to make a CRPG that tries something new (a truly branching story) and at the same times tries to make an enjoyable turn based/stats-chek heavy/story heavy game a la early Fallouts, Arcanum, etc...Final score: 8/10 (This is very high in my book, 5/10 = an average game, not ""game worse than Hitler"")			"

												The one thing you need to know about this game is that all enemies you face are built using the character generation system that you use. This makes any encounter with two or more enemies difficult for you without understanding the mechanics of fighting. Most of these fights can be avoided by player and character smarts. You are not a hero like other games are. Expect to Die. This is an RPG experience like no other. However, the vast amount of content is locked behind specific paths. The game must be played from multiple angles to fully appriciate the full depth and scope of this game.			"

												A wonderful game where there are so many options for a player and where your actions actually make a difference in the world and the endings.  I look forward to more games like this.  Any person who even remotely like role-playing style games will LOVE this game, top to bottom.			"

												I usually struggle to finish most of the rpgs a single time - it gets borring. But this game... I have already finished it like ~8 times. And every single of the playthoughs was unique. Even after reading a lot of about it on forums, this game still continues to surprise me.I never though that I would say it about any of the games, but hell yeh - this one is better than baldur's gates and fallout.

												Mind numbingly slow. In every way. Nearly every decision you have to make regarding how to complete a quest and how to develop your character is a trial and error ordeal of figuring out new ways to die. Most combat situations are explicitly there to serve as dead ends, literally. So if you thought of being some super bad assassin, pouring all of your points into crossbow, dagger, and dodge, you will still find yourself in an unwinnable fight before even leaving the first town. While an interesting and glorious death it may be, ultimately it is simply a lesson in what not to do. So you have to start a new game all over again, and try again with different stats and hope for the best. This makes the entire gameplay experience rather tedious overall. A fact that is compounded by the unforgiveably slow movement speed of your character. I liken the hours I've put in so far to the punishment of Sisyphus, with the boulder rolling back down the hill for a different reason each time. Good premise, good dialog, promising combat engine, solid world building, but so agonizingly slow that it saps all the fun out.Some suggestions to turn this game into something wonderful: - INCREASE MOVEMENT SPEED! - more side quests to earn points for character development - stat boosting equipment to give your character that extra flexibility in addressing situations, like a bloodstained tunic that boosts streetwise when worn, a make-up kit that improves impersonation if it is in your inventory, soft shoes that improve sneak, craftable picks that improve lockpick, perfume that improves etiquette, etc...

												What RPGs should be right now!A game where decisions you make change the game, where your stats have a meaning in everything you do, not only battles. A story that is fun and nice. This is how RPGs should be made.			"

												I wish I'd not bought this game.I played two hours last night and really liked the heavy text/story driven style. The conversation options were fun (being an impersonator and just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting everyone is great), and the skill options were interesting and had amusing descriptions. I was a bit surprised by the dated graphics but I can enjoy a game without good graphics so I ignored it.Couldn't wait to play more tonight. Never has my opinion changed so quickly. I got to the 'biggest city' and just kept thinking, it's ok, there's bound to be more to it. There wasn't. There are minimal things to do. I couldn't complete any quests because you need to have exactly the right build to pass whichever skill roll is needed. There are hardly any NPCs. There is nothing interesting to look at. You die repeatedly, but it's not based on skill at all. You need to reload and choose a different option. It's basically a choose your own adventure game. I kept thinking it was a decent attempt considering it must be such a small games studio. It must be small right, cos this game has been in development for 11 years! 11 YEARS! WHAT....were they doing with that time? The game isn't even long apparently, so it's not like it just starts out slow, which I'd be happier with.It's a shame I didn't come to this realization a bit earlier and gotten my money back. I feel robbed.Oh, and it's crashes, a lot.EDIT: Response to developer as I can't respond in comments;-I meant, player skill. It's all dice rolls. Which is fine. But as you say, don't spread too thinly. So either go combat or not. The problem is, if you end up in combat with no skills, you are dead. The problem with THAT is, you have no way of knowing if it will end up in combat or not because you're not sure if you're going to get the option to try to impersonate someone for example. Ok so it ended in combat. I have to reload and choose the other option. Hence, a choose your own adventure book.The other problem with spreading thinly is, and what I've read elsewhere, you've designed this game for replayability at the forefront. So you put all your skills in one area. So you can only do quests that use that skill. You say you have 100 quests. There are 8 I think, 'classes', and about 10 non combat skills. Some quests have multiple ways to solve them, one of those options almost always being combat it seemed. But how many quests are geared toward a certain skill? How many times do I have to replay the game to have the skills to see all areas, remember choices, complete all quests? I feel like this replayability factor should be made more clear.Some people will love that. Some people will hate it.I like to play games a lot, but I rarely replay games as there are so many good games I would like to play, and only so many hours in the day.Also, a factor of replayability, is locations and setting. You want to see the world again. You say you have 22 locations. I'm sorry but I don't find the locations i've seen so far interesting. They look ok I guess, but nothing that makes me want to spend more time there. In Maadoran for example, in each district there were maybe 3/4 you could interact with, that weren't merchants. Some of them had rich story parts, but that ended up going no where. No quest or anything. That would be fine, but if you're trying to focus on story and setting, rather than visuals, you need to have more than 4 npcs tell a story, with the rest of the npcs be copy/paste jobs.I'm not saying it's a horrible game. I enjoyed parts of it. But my urge to keep playing quickly diminished after hitting a wall and realising I'd have to start again.			"

												Ah life can be a cruel mistress sometimes, one day your walking down an alleyway just minding your own business, the next your getting stabbed by three different people for refusing to hand over any of the nice swag that you stole from some other hapless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2 blocks down the street.  Such is the case and many others in the Age of Decadence probably the only RPG I've ever played that doesn't treat combat (or anything for that matter) lightly and treats you like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you were expecting otherwise. Seriously the tutorial is like harder then most average fights in other rpgs.  And it's ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant.But heres the best part about the fights..... you don't have to fight at all, invest in a charismatic character and you don't have to fight anyone and you get a story with well written dialog and ACTUAL C&C unlike say Mass Effect or Dragon Age.  And don't get me started on the lore oh my lord it's genius, its based on the fall of the Roman Empire mixed in with some muslim influnces and even mention of Aztec and Chinese thrown in as well.  There are several factions in the game and each one offers a completely different playstyle and storyline. There are some caveats however, for one as mentioned before this game is notoriously difficult more so than Dark Souls, combat isn't exactly deep but servicable, the music is bland and repetitive, the graphics are not terrible lets just say that, despite the graphics the load times are frequent and lengthy (could be my system), this isn't exactly a flaw as it ties in with the replayability but the game can be a bit short however each playthrough can be completely different so if your expecting a long romp like Fallout you will be disapointed.This is not a game for everyone I only recommend this game to diehard rpg fans who want to see something different if your coming here from Skyrim or even Dark Souls  and expect to be a jack of all trade character prepare to be dissapointed.

												This game is just straight up abusive. It doesn't give you a good indication as to when you'll be railroaded into missions, which is frequently. It suggests you avoid combat whenever possible, but also advises you to start as a straight fighter character, who lacks any discernable noncombat skill. Pick this game up if your life has been too happy recently and you need to balance it out with some unbridled rage.			"

Early Access Review
								You are not special.  This is hard, but beautiful.  You can go through the game without fighting anyone, if you are a good liar, orator or bull**** artist.  Conversely, if you dont care to talk much, spec yourself for violence, and murder away.  You might kill more than one person before you rot away on a pile of bodies.  Start again, and kill more, then more still, then have your aha moment and revel in your combat mastery.  Or get frustrated and quit.  I love this game.  Though it is early access, so if you want to wait for a finished product, do so.			"

I love the gritty crapsack world, love the dialogue, the fighting system, the overall atmosphere (including the art to some extend, it could look somewhat better - but beggars can't be choosers or so they say).Would recommend highly, if you are into this kind of punishment (and rewarding) - if you arent resistant to fits of rage, not so much.My personal 9/10 overallNow it just needs to be completed :P			"

												Things to expect:Crash 1-2 per hour.Sub-Par autosave system (crippling the aforementioned issue)Encounter bugs 3-4 times per hourCountless writing issues (repeat sentences. referring to game as ""in beta"", bad writing, etc)Immersion breaking text (Sometimes your character becomes omnipotent and knows details he shouldn't)Incomplete-feeling citiesexamine is often a cop out instead of allowing a player to interract or enterwaaaay too many people that you can't talk to, mostly idle place fillers.The game feels like it's in early access, I'll be completely honest. Judging by the aformentioned issues, Expect even more that weren't obvious on the surface, either because the devs lack competence, they rushed it, or they were simply too undermanned for an ambitious task.  Which ever way, know what you are getting into if you purchase this.  With all that said, here's why I really enjoy this game.The game makes you feel as though your choices mattered. Your character creation is living proof when you're able to complete quests and advance. This feels good. real good. Specializing skills is highly rewarded, and you feel a sense of progression as quests are completed.  You're often faced with difficult and game changing decisions with severe consequences.  Neither path is right or wrong, but it changes the way many factions see you.  People who you once♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off might change their mind about you if you continue to gain influence, and still see you as valuable.  The amount of variables in play keeps me coming back.  This is all from one tiny perspective, as there are tons of other playstyles I could have taken at character creation that would garner an entirely different experience.  That is the beauty of this game.I would love to see a lot of these issues polished and fixed. This could be a really great game, honestly.UPDATE:A full playthrough of my 'talker' character lasted 19 hours. I was not rushing whatsoever.I was disappointed to see that much of the choices I experienced were illusion of choice. I say this based on my frustrating experience with an assassin.Assassin - You are forced to fight heavily armored opponents on the 3rd mission and beyond.  There is no build up.  There are also no alternative tasks, paths, or ways to acquire much more than a couple skill points to progress.  Essentially, you have no choice but to build your ""assassin"" as a brawler and tank killer. You will literally be storming the front gate of armies.  If this doesn't sound very assassiny to you, it's because it's not.  I would be fine with this design choice if it was in fact a choice, but it isn't.  You might wish to avoid any kind of personable skills and focus strictly on sneaking, assassinating and raw power/speed.  This is not viable in this game because you're often given 1 path to execute a task.  At one point in the assassins story you're forced to either have charisma and impersonation, or fight 2-3 full armored bandits while you're dressed in begger clothes.  This is an impossible fight without cheese tactics or being heavily outleveled from only seeking the main quest.  This is poor writing and laziness.There should be basic tasks or quests like 'kill this merchant', 'take out this leader' 'take out this politician', not major game changing quests at every god damn corner.  It's infuriating that you can't simply play your character without dabling in politics.  The devs claim this isn't some hero slays the dragon kind of game, but in reality their game plays out like some ridiculous drama. Overall: 5/10Buggy, poorly written, but worth a playthrough IF IT WASN'T $30.  Totally not worth the asking price. If you can pick it up for $5-$10, go for it.			"

												It took me 4-5 restarts before I had the hybrid character I dreamed of with over 100 kills and the best ending. No joke -- you should really specialize in just 3 or 4 skills on your first couple playthroughs, unless you want to start over. Charisma is a dump stat, for the most part. Save your skillpoints and don't spend them until you need them. Make manual saves before you spend a bunch of points. Do yourself a favor and don't look anything up of forums, because there are spoilers everywhere.That being said... this is the best RPG I have played in recent memory. Do I recommend? Absolutely yes -- but play the demo first to see if you have the patience. I've been totally hooked on this game for the past couple of weeks, and I'm doing a thief playthrough right now. I'm really amazed at how different backgrounds make a completely different experience -- not just at the beginning.			"

												I love RPGs.  I've been playing computer RPGs since Pool of Radiance was new.  I love challenging RPGs, and I especially enjoy RPGs where communication is important to the game.  Age of Decadence purports to be a challenging, communication-heavy RPG.  It puts forward repeatedly how deadly combat is and how it should be avoided.  It then gives you no tools in which to avoid combat.  Skill points are sparse enough that you can pick one, maybe two communication skills to specialize in.  That's assuming you have no interest in crafting or lore.  It then requires a skill check of TWO skills in many conversations, making it highly unlikely you'll be successful unless you've played through to that point and rerolled a new character.  Combat skill points are equally sparse.  Guides considered ""helpful"" tell you to always save before combat, try the fight 10 or so times, and if you can't crack it, reroll with a different set of skills and stats.  It seeks to be bleak and ends up being frustrating.  I didn't enjoy it at all.  There are  much better options out there for your money.  Go elsewhere.			"

												There's a critical combination of both difficulty and linear progression that turns a difficult but rewarding experience into something that's just unfulfilling.  If character creation were more generous, or the situational skill checks more forgiving, it might potentially be an enjoyable play.  Unfortunately, the brutal limitation in character creation means that you need to create a character with a singular focus, and then ONLY make choices that utilize those build decisions.  What that means is that the wealth of ""options"" are in fact an illusion -- if you make a character who can fight, that's your only option.  If you make a character who can socialize, you absolutely cannot fight.It's an extremely limited experience in the guise of something deeper and more dynamic.  I wish that I could recommend it, but I simply can't.  There's a fine line between challenge and mechanical encumbrance; AoD crosses that line, to its detriment.			"

												I get the idea of a 'realistic' game, which makes combat very difficult if you're outnumbered, but if you're designing such a game it seems reasonable to include a decent number of roughly balanced, one-on-one encounters.  Instead, playing as a Praetor, I found that every single potential fight I could get into had me outnumbered at least 4 to 1, and swiftly defeated.  That, combined with the fact that the game managed to hard lock my computer twice when going through area transitions, kind of soured me on the whole experience.			"

This game replayability is also high, you can restart once again playing with other character to gain different perspective.			"

												I won't lie: I found the early sequences to be obnoxiously difficult, the level of ""Guide Dangit"" to be incredibly frustrating (and I say that as a Dwarf Fortress player), and story itself to be disappointingly short. Having said all that: I would still recommend this game to anyone who asked.Remember how I said that I found the story to be disappointingly short? The key word here is ""disappointingly."" From the second you exit the tutorial and begin character creation to your final moments -- be they in an epilogue or watching your life bleed away in desert sand -- you are bearing witness to a beautifully crafted world with carefully considered lore.The time spent piecing together what you've learned, figuring out a character's motives and carefully considering what sort of butterfly effect your own actions might have despite your very limited view point...It all comes together to create an incredible and evocative narrative.You aren't a hero, and you aren't a villain. You're just an average Joe in a crappy world who has been swept up in a power struggle between forces far more powerful than you can possibly comprehend. I only wish the game gave you more time to explore that world.That isn't to say that the game isn't without its flaws, but those flaws are largely mechanical. If this were a tabletop game like D&D, you'd likely complain that the DM has developed every adventure with a set of very rigid characters in mind. It might be better, at times, to step away from the RPG mindset and into the mindset of playing a VN. But despite its flaws, or perhaps in spite of them, Age of Decadence is a truly incredible game.If you're looking for an expertly told story in a finely crafted world with CRPG trappings, this is it.

												While this game suffers from mediocre graphics and a crappy user interface, it's one of the better RPGs I've played, and it's more of an RPG than most other games that claim to be in the genre, because there's more choice and freedom to play how you want to play.The game supports three or four basic play styles (melee fighting, ranged fighting, and talking), which can be combined to some degree, and five different organizations to join, which give five different sets of quests throughout the game. The organizations are often in conflict and it's interesting to see the same events play out from other angles. This encourages and improves replayability, since you only get a piece of the truth on any given playthrough. There are also eight different backgrounds, which determine your initial start to the game, and a whole bunch of skills to specialize in, which shape your character in very different and powerful ways.The story is ostensibly about the squabbles between three lords and four guilds in a medieval setting, but there are clues that the story is actually set far in the future after a calamity destroyed civilization. Most characters won't be able to uncover the game's backstory, but with diligence, exploration, and a lot of skill points put into lore you can discover it, adding another layer of depth to the game, giving deeper meaning to and alternate explanations for various beliefs and legends, and providing enough fun to justify another playthrough. The writing is surprisingly good, too.The combat is challenging but fair. Bad luck can ruin your day sometimes, but by being smart and ensuring the odds are stacked as far as possible in your favor you can almost guarantee success, so you're not at the mercy of the RNG. It's important to know when not to fight, too. The really difficult fights can all be skipped, and almost all fights can be avoided if you have other skills or simply avoid the situation entirely. If you really want to win every fight, you can make a purely combat-focused character, but it's nice that there are other ways of playing.Unfortunately, the game's user interface is pretty crappy. There aren't nearly enough keyboard shortcuts, too many repetitive clicks are needed to perform basic operations, and you'll often find yourself running around in frustration before eventually searching the web for the locations of various people because the game doesn't tell you where they are and doesn't mark them on a map. Precious few details are recorded in the in-game journal, so if you miss a bit of conversation you may again find yourself searching outside the game for clues. The game also makes it too easy to lose a battle due to a misclick, which is made more likely due to the number of clicks needed.Despite the poor UI design, the game is technically solid. I haven't seen a crash yet, and only minor bugs (like some out-of-place text when you die in certain situations).Each playthrough should take about 8-12 hours (although you can do a speedrun much faster), and there's enough content to make at least three plays through the game worthwhile. There are a bunch of endings (six? eight? more?) for completionists, and they're all quite different. I haven't seen most of them, and don't even know how to get to them, but that just means there's still more to discover!In short, if you can look past the slightly obnoxious interface, there's a great game in here. I bought it at full price and don't regret it one bit. I also very much appreciate that they have a demo, so if you're on the fence, feel free to give the demo a try!			"

You will enjoy seeing new angles and oportunities by making different characters and different choises.The lore is interesting and uniq. (And fitting my low magic fantasy setting dreams.) Though I will spoil nothing here.Combat system is also good and unless you make an increddibly good fighter you are almost unable to defeat several enemies at once. But even the weakest characters can survive the whole story by beeing careful enogh.Character stats, skills, exp, items and other RPG elements are made great too, never ever seen an RPG system as flawless as in this game.Some people may say it doesn't look good enough but is it really a valid point against such an awesome thing?So I'd say whoever you are this game definitely worth its money.

												A brilliant but very challenging game, offering various styles of play and alternative beginnings/ends meaning lots of replayability. Choose wether to resolve quests using diplomacy, stealth or combat. Dialogue and quest progression can alternate alot depending upon your skills/attributes, which directly impact your avaible dialogue options (also wether these succeed or not)It also has some very interesting lore, which you can actively dig up tons of by seeking out storytellers, or going on an exploration trip traversing old ruins and temples.Be warned though, when I say it's a challenging game, I mean it. Get used to saving alot, and be ready to get stuck not being able to complete some of the earlier quests until you get the hang of what a good character build is.			"

												Great game.  Love the freedom of choice.  Your action will affect the game.  Combat is very difficult be sure you know what your doing.  Can you prevent it.  Can you find a way around it maby stroke a deal.  Everything is possible.   If you must fight be sure to plan ahead and use tactics and every tricks you have.  From a distance.  Applying poison to your blade.  Maby use some alchemy and throw a bomb or a flask of greek fire. I love the game of thrones series and this game reminds me about it. How far your treatury will go for your own survival.  Will you bettray your lord.  Will you play spy or simply go head in and expect to win every battle has a hero,  HEHE good look hero you are gona need it. "

												I was having a lot of fun doing the non-combat quests and finding more diplomatic solutions to potentially violent encounters, slowly building up both my non-combat skills and even more slowly my combat skills and my personal armory so that I could eventually do the more combat oriented stuff. But then my quests I can do in the first city dry up, I follow a quest to the second city, get notified all unresolved quests in this city will be closed if I move, I decide I can live with that since there's nothing left here that I can do. Get to the next city and can't make any progress in either of my quests I came for, can't get more than a tiny spatter of skill points since I can only find quests I either can't complete or don't get skill points for completing, once I finish exploring as far as I can without getting killed and doing my rounds of the stores I find I can't even go back to the first town without automatically completing all of the quests I hadn't found yet(or couldn't complete) in the new city so I can't even go back to buy the leather that they sold there but don't sell here...Yeah this game has a lot of potential but it's badly damaged by travel difficulties and long load times. The uncompletable quests wouldn't feel quite so bad if it didn't take forever to load and I wasn't stuck in a single city.All that said I still think it's a good game that's worth a try, I got 22 hours before I hit my road block and I'll probably try again later when I'm not annoyed with the game anymore.

												tl;dr:PROS:-interesting, immersive, and original setting-engaging, tactical combat-great character system and itemization-unparalleled reactivity, choice, and consequenceCONS:-requires a fair amount of experimenting to get a hang of the game-skills are unbalanced-game content seems somewhat incompleteThe Age of Decadence is a turn-based RPG focusing on tactical combat, urban and political intrigue, and choices with meaningful consequences. The setting is Roman-inspired low magic fantasy. The game is an aquired taste; it displaces many of the cliches of current RPG games, which will likely turn people off at first. You're not the Chosen One who can master every skill and cleave through hordes of enemies; you're just another guy trying to survive in a harsh world. You can't see everything the game has to offer in one shot, as a lot of the content is mutually exclusive to certain story choices. Theres no level grinding or respawning enemies; every combat encounter is placed on purpose and designed carefully. And they're difficult for the unprepared, but realistic; if a thief lures you into an ambush in an alley, the enemies aren't there to drop XP and loot- they're there to kill you.The dialogue is rich and immersive, and the game builds an interesting world, even without AAA graphics. You use skills in dialogue through binary checks, though some have the possibility of partial success. The combat is deep and good tactics are crucial to winning even the earliest fights; if you run and start slashing, you will be dismembered. For the most part all enemies use the same derived statistics as you, so the playing field is pretty even. Theres no HP gain on level up, and the range of hit points is small, somewhere around 20-60; so every point matters. Simple decisions like poisoning your weapons or switching your outcome can be deterministic in winning a fight.The level of reactivity in AoD is unparalleled. Theres more ways to finish quests than any game I can think of. If you play without spoilers, it will take you multiple playthroughs to see everything. AoD was developed by an independent team over the course of 10 years. Unfortunately, this shows in the game. Its rough around the edges, especially in the later stages. The first act around the town of Teron is exquisitly crafted, its by far the best first town of any RPG. Theres so many options, secrets, and great dialogues. The second act of is strong as well, but theres not as many really inspired moments as in the first. After having so many options for resolving each quest in Teron, its jarring to run into quests where you have only the 'fight or pay' options. A lot of the content here starts to feel tacked on, just simple combats that add no real weight to the story. By the time you get to the city in the third act, the place feels empty and unfinished. I wish the developers had had enough time and resources to really bring this region to life.A common complaint is that the binary skill checks and strict gifting of skill points requires extensive meta-knowledge and save-scumming; this is only partially true. If you play a focused character and stay true to form (e.g. a talker doesn't try to fight everyone), you will generally be fine. Playing a hybrid character does require a good working knowledge of most of the games structure, but I found this to be a very enjoyable challenge. Then not only did I have to contend with the quests themselves, but also the order I approached them. Its very rewarding to tweak your skills to just the right level to set up the perfect double cross.The skills are diverse and interesting, but quite unbalanced. Lore and Crafting are far and away the best skills and practically required, whereas Etiquette is hardly ever checked, and most of the situation where you use Traps seem simply tacked on. The game keeps carefully track of your reputation with the world and each faction, but these stats are hardly ever checked, aside from Body Count. Again, I feel that these are more great idea that the developers simply didnt have the resources to flesh out, rather than oversights or poor design choices.I've played through the game 4 or 5 times now, and its easily my game of the year, and definitely in my top 5 of all time. Its a contender with Fallout 2 and Planescape: Torment. The amazing thing is its this good while only being 80% done.			"

												Extraordinary choice-driven RPG with an emphasis on social interactions rather than on combat. You can finish a playthrough quite quickly for a RPG, but the whole point is to replay the game a few time from different angles to actually understand the lore, since the world can change *a lot* based on your choices and show you significantly different sides of the story each time.

Posted: October 18, 2015
												A most peculiar game.The first thing that bears mentioning about this game is that it is, in fact, not that difficult. I say this because most of the many, many times its blocked my progress I haven’t really been able to pinpoint what particular failing in my gameplay led to the obstruction. At first I thought it was balancing my character too much, so I specialized in combat with my second build. Did this help? Not really; I’ve yet to win a battle without at least 30 minutes of save-scumming. In fact, save-scumming is so much a part of playing this game that it seems to be one of its key mechanics; you seem to spend more time retrying digital dice rolls than experiencing the game’s very interesting setting or uncovering it’s pretty decent story. It’s kind of like watching Gladiator in HD over a modem; theoretically possible but there’s a lot of buffering… That’s why I’d say this game isn’t difficult, though it is extremely obstructive and that gives a certain illusion of difficulty. The game is also highly skill-based; there are certain sections of it where gameplay degenerates into a succession of skill-checks. I find this mechanic intensely annoying, for it has the effect of limiting your options to a set of pre-ordained alternatives rather than allowing for more free-form gameplay. Want to use persuasion to get rid of some thugs? Too bad, you have to have the ‘impersonate’ skill. Want to fight with the enemy guard who catches you in the wrong place at the wrong time? Too bad, you are insta-killed if your dexterity score is too low. These little bits of bad game design litter the game with yet more roadblocks on the path of doing much interesting in its world.This is a tremendous pity too, because its world is a unique and interesting one. Set in a fantasy world combining the fall of Rome with influences from Arab culture, it has a lot going for it as a setting for adventure. If the mechanics would just let some adventure happen that is… The game also successfully takes the bleakness of a world where all communal spirit and empathy has collapsed (almost to the point of absurdity) and runs with it, which would complement the unforgiving mechanics if those mechanics had it in their spirit to complement anything. Furthermore the game removes some of the immersion breaking elements of traditional rpgs in its style such as instant healing and the ability to possess an entire party of fighters at once; steps in the right direction as far as I can see. Some people will probably like this game. Some people will probably like any given game. A sizable chunk of me actually likes this game, although on the basis of setting and story alone. However I have reason to believe that, whoever you are reading this, you will not like this game; for it is a game full of dislikeable elements. Its mechanics are retro, as in retrograde, as in backwards. Its conversations force you to play pot luck with the skill choices you’ve made. Its combat uses save scumming as a key mechanic. Unfortunately- because there’s a lot of good in this title- this game’s faults frustrate its virtues (and the player…). Not recommend. "

												Very few games these days have me chomping at the bit to come back again for a new playthrough IMMEDIATELY after completing the game. It's even worse with RPG's. By the end, I'm usually so far done that I can't wait for the credits to roll and check it off of my arbitrary ""Games to Complete"" list.AoD had me thinking about multiple playthroughs all the way from the initial encounters in my first playthrough to the final few scenes that I could realistically entertain. I never once touched combat other than to see how hilariously quick it would be for my worthless conman. Spoilers: I hit a guy. Once. For 0 damage because my spear I bought for no good reason failed to puncture his armor. THEN I died.I can't wait to explore a full combat, or at least combat-heavy, route and see those set pieces and scenes I missed. This is without mentioning the very intriguing backstory that is only handed out in morsels for non-Lore characters or people unwilling to explore specific areas due to skills/stat combinations. A post-apocalyptic world in what seems to be a faux-Roman setting only gets better as you peel back the layers of the world.I only had access to vague lore (but plentiful enough that I could suss out the main thrust of what happened to this world) and the concept of creating a character to venture out and find out every bit of information is so wonderful. This game fosters multiple playthroughs by feeding you just the tiniest bits about what you COULD be doing. I'm constantly reminded by what my alternate reality self could be doing to resolve conflicts ranging as far from smalltown squabbles to literal empire-defining intrigue and revolution.Age of Decadence is not a massive, heart-stoppingly huge world like far too many video games attempt to be these days, and it works its magic within those constraints. This game knows what it is and how to execute so well that I can't stop recommending this game any chance I have.			"

												Choices matter in this brutal, post-cataclysm world inspired by the aesthetic of ancient, crumbling Rome. Where Age of Decadence doesn't display much decadence, the branching story delivers a rich and replayable experience as you pursue multiple questlines based on your skills and choices. These choices can have such an impact that you may find yourself repeatedly reloading save files just to see how another decision might play out or simply playing again to experience a nearly completely different story.Age of Decadence isn't perfect. There's still a scattering of bugs, and the game could benefit from free exploration of the overworld map. Nonetheless, it is a solid entry in the realm of story rich, character driven role-playing games.			"

												There were many aspects of this game that I loved. And there were a few that annoyed me. The game sets itself up so that you cannot do everything, in fact, specializing in two traits is often too difficult to manage until you have a very firm grasp on the mechanics of the game. Personally, I feel like it is a great philosophy that is slightly over done, but still very manageable. The idea is that no one can be so skilled that they are a master of every discipline. While I appreciate that, it is annoying that it becomes very difficult to make a character who is both stealthy and good with a dagger, and makes certain abilities, like herbalism, useless because they are only passively helpful where everything in the game is so aggressive. I quit once I faced a quest that had me diving into a well to solve a puzzle of sorts. I had created a character that was very smart with high dex and low charisma and strength. I had the smarts to discern what was required of the puzzle, but not the strength to aquire the missing piece. In order to have completed the quest, it felt like I needed to design a character specifically for this situation, which would have been fine if it were a main questline option, but it wasn't. Regardless, I will come back to the game because it was a great time 90% of the time. Combat is enjoyable, even though I will complain that being an archer is difficult since you can never hire someone to engage in melee, and you almost always start within two turns (or less) of moving distance apart. (I still had great success as an archer for a large portion of my adventures, although it was hard). The developers have continued tweeking and adding content since launch, which is the biggest reason that I will advise someone buy this. They are committed to quality, not profit. The game is a niche play, but well worth the investment due to the many ways that a person can go about playing the game.			"

												This is one of the better RPGs I have ever played, and it isn't for everyone. Let me start with the cons:The graphics are unpleasant. The user interface is ugly, and at times trying to work with. The combat is fundamentally unforgiving and complex (it is an utter mistake to focus on one weapon)... and escape doesn't really seem to be an option (at least, not one I could ever figure out). Markers are woefully absent from city maps -- making them a terrible chore to navigate. This game will require you to do a lot of reading, and not all pertinent text triggers a ""quest"". With that said -- the game is brief (6-8 hours), and every decision you make matters in some way. There are radically different ways to approach each situation: brute force, stealth, diplomacy, technology, conspiracy, assassination. There are dead ends, but there aren't any ""true"" dead ends -- there's just another path that you didn't consider. After about the third play through, you begin to understand the insane richness of the world. There are so many interested parties at play, but you can never see them all at once. In one play through, I avoided all direct combat; in another, I served a great kingdom as a solider; in another, I became a god; in another, I killed everything that claimed to be a god. Do you want to nuke a city? -- you can. Become a cyborg-lich? -- valid option. Operate as a pacifist who prevents wars from breaking out? -- you'll be complicit in some deaths, but you can. Or do you just want to become a legendary murder-ma-jig? -- oh yeah,  all options. This work is flawed, but if you can get past those flaws -- it is nothing short of brilliant.			"

												Working well on a Windows 8.1 machine with nVidia card.I've had this one on my wish list for a long time, and finally bought it today on sale despite having many games in my library that I haven't yet played. And I couldn't be happier.There is a demo available on the main page, and I strongly suggest you try the demo first, as this game doesn't play quite like a traditional RPG. It is dialogue-heavy, but manages to be so without being full of silly melodrama. The plot and characters are great, there are genuine benefits for choosing interpersonal skills that go to waste in most RPGs, your stats matter, and there are real consequences for your actions -- you must choose your loyalties and stick with them, or suffer. In some ways it reminds me of an old DOS classic, Darklands, but without all the wandering all over the map, and a lot less combat.Buy this instead of Pillars of Eternity if you want to get immersed in a story.

												Recommended with reservations. It is difficult to learn, and yes, save often, you'll need to. The game is in the style of Baldur's Gate and Blackguards. Do not expect high quality graphics but it is very immersive. I found it as immersive as Dragon Age: Inquisition but for different reasons and easily lost 4 hours just getting my character started off.The frustration was with the number of replays / reloads I had to do to get anywhere. Retracing your steps far too many times. Trying different ways to win at the combat. This seems like a game that still needs developing. It needs some form of difficulty adjustment.In summary a game should be recreational not work - this one is hard work but it has a lot of good points. Unfortunately the older style of interface and linear linking of scenarios does not give the player many choices and we are used to playing open-world games now.			"

												Unique & ChallengingAge of Decadence allows you to explore the Machiavellian politics of a post-apocalyptic world. Beneath the surface the player might discover hidden secrets and lost artefacts in ancient ruins, but most likely he or she will end up dead in a ditch somewhere. It's all about making a character that is able to survive and prosper in this extremely harsh and brutal environment.Ultimately, this game requires a different approach. You won't be able to see and do everything in one playthrough. Instead, the idea is to view the world from different angles. The agile thief with knowledge of traps and access to the proper equipment will be able to reach places that are unavailable to other types of characters, for instance. You can play as a diplomatic scholar or a conspiring merchant (etc.). The character system allows for a lot of experimentation.It's all about quality over quantity. If you fight someone it's a unique event and contextually motivated (no random encounters). Every quest has multiple solutions. Every choice will have some kind of impact. Most importantly, your character won't be running pointless errands or collecting x amount of this or that.Highly recommended for fans of Fallout 1 & 2, Planescape: Torment and Arcanum. "

												A hardcore game that old school RPG players (specially those who play or played PnP RPGs) will enjoy. You'll have to restart often and/or have plenty of saves.  The world is well designed and combat is unforgiving, but you can finish the game (as I have) without entering combat once.If you're looking just for another RPG with quest givers and quest markers, lame dialogues and easy combats until some kind of boss-monster  appears, then this game is not for you.For the new generation of RPG players I recommend you to give this game not 1 try, but many tries as this game is a very good example of how real RPGs should be.

												Awesome game, best RPG I played in a long time. It looks like crap and everything is brown, but who cares? The world feels alive and your choices actually matter. Very high replayability, as you'll only see a fraction of the content in a single playthrough. Combat requires more than two brain cells and can't be won by simply mashing a button until everyone is dead. And if you don't like combat, it's possible to finish the game without a single fight.If you want a pretty game that will hold your hand and keep telling you how special you are, better look somewhere else. But if you can handle a little challenge, give it a try. It's worth it.			"

												I might be missremembering, but I think it was 10 or so years ago I first tried the combat demo. A friend of mine was at the time still playing around with modules from NWN. So it's highly possible it was that long, if not longer. Now I thought the graphics were a bit rough at the time, and you know what? I still do. Yet from that combat demo, a very strong game has emerged. It's well worth the money. The people at Iron Tower deserve support for their commitement in finishing their product. The game is unforgiving. You will die. If you bring any experience with you from any other rpg, thinking you are somehow better, and stronger than the compitition, you will die on every street, shady bar, and back alley of the game.Think of it like you're actually there. Do you really want to die for that person, or this cause? No matter what road you pick, be the hero, be the coward, be the bystander. You will still die. All the ""fade to death"" screens aside, the writing is superb. and you will find yourself forgiving  any rough spots on this gem of a game. Keep up the good work. I will be there to support your next title as well.  "

												An RPG that truly reacts to the class you choose and presents you with a different viewpoint depending on your choice of skills. It has a rare ability to provide unforeseen wow moments.

												I love this game. I like a game that makes you think. Solving problems with a sword has never been fun for me. I like being the underdog that is nothing and needs to work with power. This game has the best system in making me feel useful. No button mashing here, no Diablo Monte Hall BS. Your actions have consequences, npcs will remember things you have done. I love it. Three guys should be impossible to fight in real life and it is almost impossible here. Taking on two enemies and you may survive, but you'll need to hide from the others. I have always hated the games where I could wade through a bandit camp, fighting a guy and his buddy, that is only 20 feet away is just smoking a cigarette. Not here, buddy will come and help. Then you're surrounded and dead.You actually need to outsmart your enemie without combat and that is a fresh change in today's button mashing approach to games. I actually convinced one group of enemies to attack another. I then walked in after the dust had settled and claimed victory. No game captures that, but AoD does.I will say this. If you  like flashy unrealistc armor with shoulder pads that look like they could launch helicopters from, then this is not the game for you. If you are unsure, down load the demo first. You get the tutorial and the first chapter to play for free!I love this game, but I prefer story over graphics. This game so far, has an excellent story.			"

Fought my way through a bunch of weak enemies that offered very little challenge and then boom some chit chat and its over.It feels like there should be so much more to do,because honestly there should be. You cant even leave the final area once you enter it to finish up any extra quests you have.

												Probably one of the best games of its genre. I've been longing for a game like this for ages; there simply isn't enough on the market in my opinion.Reminds me of my time in Fallout 1 and 2 minus the humour. Being able to play different characters at different starts is great as it allows you to piece together the whole story slowly, bit by bit. As there are a bunch of skill and attribute checks, playing through multiple times can unlock options you never thought possible before, as some of the checks are hidden for until you actually meet the requirements.Primary complaint would be that there isn't a whole lot of minigames and such to partake in.There's a demo that gives you the whole first chapter. It's quite lengthy already (I put close to 10 hours in the demo itself), so go pick that up before you buy the full game.My most hilarious fail in the game would be, selling all my clothes and running around naked only to be repeatedly stopped by guards. I was too poor to buy my clothes back. I could have saved myself by going to the merchant who sells cheap clothes, but the guards stopped me in my tracks. After several failed attempts to buy clothes in Teron, I abandoned my character to his naked fate.My best death would be Berserk style, ""As the last guard falls down, you regain your ability to think clearly and observe the carnage. Not bad at all. Of course, it wasn't the smartest thing to do, but it was a good fight. Nothing makes you feel more alive than killing others, the more the merrier. The harder they come at you, the better.More guards show up, at least a dozen. They hesidate and you laugh. ♥♥♥♥ing cowards. Three men step forward - no eagerness in their eyes, only fear. They die fast, doomed by it. A self-fulfilling prophecy, if there ever was one.A crossbow bolt hits you, then another. If they think that it's enough to keep you down, they have another thing coming. You charge forward, killing two more before some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ chops your arm off at the elbow. Good thing you're ambidextrous - never know when it might come in handy. Good thing for you, bad thing for the man next to you.You leave him with your dagger in his throat - something to remember you by - grab a sword off the ground and switch your attention to the next victim. You have a feeling that it's going to be the last one, so you put your best foot forward and do what you do best. The sword breaks and you throw it away. Now you're ready...""			"

												Age of Decadence is hands down one of the best RPGs i have ever played. Is it perfect ? No, there are a lot of things that could be better and so on. But all those things are insignificant to what Age of Decadence does.I knew Age of Decadence probably will be good RPG, i omitted early access because i didn't want to destroy my fun playing unfinished game. What surprised me was that Age of Decadence simply took my expectations and run away with them.So to start. I think Age of Decadence is imo game that should be classified with Mask of the Betrayer and Planescape: Torment. After finishing it, feeling i got is essentially like those games. Here story is main focus. Difference though is that in both Planescape and MotB there was central story you followed but in AoD there isn't one. AoD gives something much more important. True Role-Playing. Game doesn't pigeon hole you to one story you should follow. Game instead gives you every tool you can wield to shape your character and your future. Unlike Planescape and MotB game doesn't give you fake ""discoveries"" to make. In those games almost everything is set for you to uncover it. In AoD literally everything is for you to explore and to know and game doesn't set you on linear journey in which you will see most of the things. You can learn of secrets, rumors, events and so on and only you can verify them. Every-time you delve into some event you have this feeling that what you did is not the end and there is something more under it. This sense of unknown is what both PST and MotB didn't have and why AoD is just so awesome in that aspect.Unlike most of RPGs AoD delivers trully RPG aka Role Playing game. AoD campaign outshines even PnP RPGs in amout of options you can choose and play. Even if you would have best game master i bet 100$ he wouldn't be able to accommodate to so many options game gives. More that that we are not talking here about just C&C, we are talking here about THE C&C. There is like♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of choices in in AoD that completely changes things and world in game. My only minor complain is that almost all C&C don't have hidden consequences that can bite you in♥♥♥♥♥later in game (from my play trough though), usually if you have to choose something outcomes are usually short lasting and predictable.I absolutely love how game handles events. When you do something you usually are taken to scene of event instead of trekking whole city to it. This disallows preparing for combat events and you usually start in place designer wanted not where you wanted it.Story itself is fascinating. I really really really liked it. Which is achievement itself when you consider just how different one playthrough can be. I don't want to spoil anything but my character was combat oriented and story by end of it really really got interesting despite fact that i played basically murder machine with head count something above 60. Ending i got felt just right to what i did in game. It wasn't grand or amazing. It just fit my character well.This is the benchmark all role playing games will be compared to from now on.I really wish game had 2D background. Listening to this small but amazing OST really sets the tone and i feel 2D handpainted backgrounds would really really make game a lot better.I played in my playtrough as combat oriented character (literally 10ns in almost all physical skills) and i can safely say combat is really really really amazing. It is not the complexity of it but scenarios in which you fight that makes it. Always outnumbered, always trying to scrape barrel for that one right slash. It really gives you options to handle differently events in game. I often had to replay and change my tactics because something that worked for X didn't work for Y. You may not believe it but i think this gme has the most balanced combat model ever and despite that it is still fun and allows for bad rolls.Game is short but i think being short is big plus here. I finished my playtrough in ~15 hours but that time may wary probably on build you use and choices you make. Ending i got (which i wanted) was really easy to do and there were other things to do, to get different ending which could extend game. Either way game main focus is replay-ability, if game would be something like 50 hours you wouldn't replay it a lot and game literally gives you every now and then huge C&C that can completely change focus of your story. So most fun from game is those replays, to see things unfolding differently or from different points of view. When i finished The Witcher 3 this year i thought RPG of the year was already set. I think now it is safe to say that AoD is easily the best RPG of the year. It is the benchmark we will be using for years or decades and i really really really want to see AoD2 or just continuation of that world or lore. When i was trying to get into game i thought that roman empire theme would hurt game but in the end i think the fit perfectly to that world and lore. Sure there are things i didn't like but those problems are simply to insignificant to matter. I think 5h more would make this game legendary +5 instead of +4.In other words Bravo ITS bravo. This is the rpg benchmark it is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing it exists. I hope ITS will make AoD2			"

												This is an interesting one. If it had come out 15 years ago it'd probably be a classic right beside Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, and Fallout. I played the entire game as a shysty mercahnt and never got into combat once. The game truly allows for pacifist runs, unlike many modern games which sort of allow for it, if you try really hard. The game seems to encourage not running into fights you aren't positive you can win. The combat is a bit slow, and not really exciting, you can't do much except attack with sword or attack with bow, but there's nothing wrong with it. It's functionally fine, nothing to write home about. The story is interesting, but the world is great. I'd love to see another game with more of a focus. This game didn't seem to be totally sure what it wanted to be because the different guild paths are so totally unrelated to one antoher it feels like several okay games in one, instead of one great game which I think it could have been. Overall probably no worth the initial asking price of $30, but well worth a look if you're into old school RPGs.			"

												Easily one of the best games I've played all year. It felt very difficult at first, but that was only because I skipped the tutorial, and didn't realize you could actually choose different attack options. Once I found that out, the game was tough, but fair. In the beginning, you're just some guy. Not an epic bad♥♥♥♥♥hero. If you're fighting a group of people, chances are it will go like it would in real life. You'll get jumped. The game is rather realistic in that aspect.  That said, you can overcome any challenge, and usually in several different ways. The lore of this game is amazing, and quite deep. Probably one of those things that absorbed me the most. The world building is something I cannot praise enough. Easily one of the top Worlds I've ever experienced. Up there with Sigil, and a few others.  There is a great amount of replayability, and gameplay wise, I love this game. The combat is simple as turn based games usually are, but there is a deep element of strategy. I should also say, the choices you make in this game MATTER. Deeply in fact. They will greatly change and effect the world around you. And I mean a lot. Also, from what I can tell, this game has a buttload of endings. I could be wrong, but it felt like there were a ton of ways it could have gone. I've only finished a single playthrough, but you can bet I plan on doing another.A word of warning, if you want to fight everything, I'd mostly put points in nothing but combat, and don't expect to  be able to complete objectives which might require you to have non-combat skills. Thankfully, most things can still be acomplished through combat anyways.			"

												Great and engaging story that keeps me coming back. Currently on my third playthrough and loving the world the game has built. Wish this game had gotten more attention as it deserves it! If you are lookign for a combat based rpg, this might not be it. Combat is really challenging, and designed to be so. While that makes victory all the more sweet, it is maybe slightly too far in the ""you are going to die. a lot."" direction and might turn some people off. That being said, this encourages more thought and alternative approaches. One of the few games that you can go through without fighting once and still be satisfied!			"

												Although i personally do not like this game i will still give it a thumbs up.Most negative reviews off this game are mainly going on about how you have to pick all your skill points very precisely and if you dont it limits what your character is able to do. Seems rather realstic to me you cant expect youre brute monster killer to be able to sweet talk some high level charcters into thinking you're after world peace, if you are sick of games where you solve every problem by killing everything in sight and have the problem later on of having too many skill points you end you end up dumping them into random useless skills then this is a brill game for you.This game does have quiet a bit of trial and error but not just through RNG, you have to decide early on who your character is going to be and then stick with it.I did enjoy the part where you cant kill all ten bandits within a lair, most of the time your will probably just manage to kill one before the others get you, instead you will either have to sneak in, negotiate a peace or find some other way completely out of the box.I wont be playing but still worth a recommend for people who enjoy this genre.

												Over the course of a week, I have systematically alienated friends and foes alike with my incessent ravings on this game.The one game it truly reminds me of is planescape torment, it has so much choice paths none of my many playthroughs have ever been the same. When games suggest they have nonlinear paths, they tend to overexaggerate. This game out of all the ones that I have played has the most complex and immersive storytelling.Lately I have been acheivement hunting to get 100% and still been finding new quests along the wayHowever it is brutal...So very brutal.Restart after 2 hours because of bad speccing brutal.And I love it!

												It's not often I get surprised by a game, but this was certainly one of them, a pleasant surprise this time, this is truly one of the most indepth RPG's I've seen in an incredibly long time, boasting an interesting and for the most part balanced skill system and a gritty brutal world to explore it manages to apply the concept of replayability to something close to perfection by dramatically different choices, outcomes and experiences based on your character choice and in game choices. This isn't a Dragon age the same game once you reach Ostagar experience, it is a completely different story and adventure if you choose a mercenary who joins the legion vs a mercenary who joins the boatmen (to give an example). Although there are some major world events that are brewing which will remain the same but that is understandable. Definitely worth the money and the hours you will spend on the experience.			"

												This game deserves some recognition and encouragement for sure.Age of Decadence is the good example of challenging (they called it hardcore, I don't agree, you just need to use your brain vs mindless hack and slash) and downright super fun RPGs that is sorely lacking (but slowly gaining attention, making a comeback)!You are able to choose to play between 8 different roles in a power struggle between 5 factions/powers. It is impossible to play a *GOD* character that is able to do everything in one playthrough. The game punishes you when you try to stretch your character too thin (eg. mercenary trying to be good with fighting skills yet trying to be a con-artist, sweet talker and at the same time stealing stuffs and sneaking around).You HAVE to become one with the character's role that you are trying to play in that playthrough in order to be sufficiently adequate to PROGRESS, yes you read that right, to PROGRESS. Think on your feet, prepare yourself like how you will if you are in the situation in other words, ROLEPLAY. This game although lacking in state-of-the-art graphics and requiring you to focus on your role, it did not disappoint by providing you with enough depth and lots of surprises along the way throughout your adventures and decisions. That is only if, you succeed in progressing. Otherwise you'll either forced to end your own life ingame (a.k.a restart, really there is like no other way if your sneak is not good enough because you want to improve your persuasion to convince someone but your persuation is also not good enough :p), or get pulled out and slaughtered like pigs in a pen, despite how unwilling you are. Be warned.'Nuff said, buy it and enjoy if you like a game that is as what I've described above. Recommend to buy it on a discount (which I did) and will be worth every cent.			"

												This game is just great and i wonder why i never took the time to write a review for it considering i've been playing it since the beta and keep coming back to it.The game is very well designed with an epic story that unfolds differently depending on your role in the events. A drifter might finish it with very little knowledge of the overall plot or grasp every tiny bit of it while manipulating everyone he encounters to his own benefit, ending the game both rich and full of wisdom. A playthrough as a loremaster or a member of the assassin guild might give you totally different insights, considering the 3 powerfull families you can pledge yourself to, the different guilds and all the different path within each of them, the story is both deep and great. The content is monstruous and as of now all bugs have been cleared and content has been added making the game even better.Imagine you are given a job but your skill is too low so you fail it, well this is ok the story continue taking into account your failure, do it good and be rewarded, do it extremly well and maybe you'll earn yourself a promotion or an opportunity... But this can only be seens through multiple playthrough and this is something great about this game, it is not overly long but each playthrough can be absolutly different. You can complete the game without killing a soul or being a monstruous murderer with over 200 kills, or anywhere in between. You can lie, you can cheat, you can steal, plot, rob, murder, manipulate, betray, be a zealot, have honor, be true to your word, be of unquestionned loyalty and every of this will be taken into account both in term of dialog choices and npcs reactions.But the game is not all about dialogs, choices and story it also have a turn based combat system that i enjoyed a lot. Some may think it is randomn or offers no strategy but i can assure you there is. Fights that may seems unfair can be win given proper placement, strategy and using tools the game gives you. Crafting, alchemy, nets and bolas, different weapons or aiming different body parts all helps make some unforgiven fights a breeze. It might not be easy for newcomers and might require some time to apprehend but the options are there.What can i add? having played the game recently i think they did a great work adding locations, plants to pick up, randomn npcs activity and new places to rob and steal. It adds even more depth to an already really immersive world.The only thing i see that may annoy newcomers is how dependent on stats the game is. Failing a quest is almost always due to not having the proper skillcheck or attribute, this is something i consider normal in this type of game but some paths (thieve guild for example) might be seem as really hard or unfair if you didn't allocate the ""proper"" skills for the job. I must warn any newcomer that the game was not created with the idea of doing everything in a single playthrough. It is possible with a hybrid build but the game was designed to be played multiple time and failure as i already said is not a game over but part of the experience. I must insist that each playthrough are really different, it's not just a few lines, some content is hard or blocked unless you join a faction. This is in no way like in ""Tyranny"" where replaying the game gives little more than a few flavor text depending on choices, Age of Decadence did it the proper way !I also want to add that you might want to check there combat only ""mini"" game Dungeon Rats if you enjoy their combat, and stay tuned for the next game they are working on that will take us into space..

Everytime I play through regardless of the build I feel like im playing an episode of the HBO Rome series. It's gritty like HBO's Rome complete with violence and language but missing the boobs. I can't wait to see what else these guys come up with. Great concept of skill leveling and really interesting builds for classes. You can go all out combat or try something not so combat oriented and be just as successful. Great job!			"

If you read further: ""The game has to be hard, dying should be easy, and you should have reasons to pick your fights."" if you want to feel like a god than play prototype.

												This game made me feel like a filthy casual even more than Dark Souls and CSGO comp matches combined. I honestly haven't played an RPG in which you feel like killing people actually HAS consequences until this game. There are vast opportunities for the player, ranging from the starting class, to chosing a guild, to exploration and discovery (largely based on lore).Thats another thing, the lore is done amazingly well, and it fits with the feel of the game. The player truly feels like a small cog in a large machine. All in all, I would highly reccomend this game, as long as you're ok with dying. A lot. You will die.9.5/10 one of my favorite RPGs			"

												This game is excellent and as far as I am concerned one of the best RPG games of this moment. I generally never write reviews, but made an exception this time as I think this game above and beyond all others earned my time for a review. The choices you can make in this game really do matter. Depending on your stats, skills, factions and decisions you are given a unique perspective of the ingame world. The replayability factor of this game is very high as a result of that as you never get to experience all the content in a single playthrough. Your experience is likely very different when you play as a Loremaster than as a Mercenary for example (when you focus on their assumed strengths that is, but this too is not written in stone). A Mercenary will generally experience plenty of combat, whilst a Loremaster generally avoids all combat, but instead discovers all the lore of the world of which Mercenaries generally remain clueless. This factors into the broad variety of endings one can work to. Of course there are plenty of starting alternatives such as Praetor, Merchant, Assassin, Thief, Drifter or Grifter which play very differently.RPG games are all about meaningful choices and well written stories. Both are incredibly well done in Age of Decadence. If we compare this for example to Baldur's Gate (which I still consider one of the best RPGs), we find that the level of intrigue is much greater in Age of Decadence. Many parties are out for themselves and depending on your lack of 'expertise' in a certain area, they probably will take advantage of you (just as you can take advantage of others when you are competent at a certain skill). Baldur's Gate in that sense was far more direct: kill and loot everything in an area and occasionally help someone when the reward seems greater before moving on to the next area. Age of Decadence can have far more lasting consequences and sometimes it can take a long time before revenge is taken. Age of Decadence adds the element of politics which greatly amplifies the depth of the game.The combat is also excellent in the sense that initially it takes some time to understand the interaction between weapons, armour, action points, different attacks, combat skills and support items (such as bolas, nets, grinding stones, various alchemy potions, poisons and bombs). In Baldur's Gate what was the best armour was generally obvious and there was no debate. In Age of Decadence, what is the best armour depends up to great extents to the amount of action points you have available and your skill level. If you immediately wear the best armour and the best shield for example without being proficient in them, you will hardly be able to block any attacks and hit anyone. What is best thus very much depends on your proficiencies. Many other games are far more simplistic in this regard. What is the case for armour is also the case for weapons in Age of Decadence. There is no 'best weapon by default'. In all fairness the variety that spellcasting offered in Baldur's Gate was great and Age of Decadence does not have this, but there is plenty of complexity involved in Age of Decadence to make combat intriguing and challenging. Age of Decadence does not have a truly open world exploration like Baldur's Gate does, but I do not think open world exploration would be appropriate for this kind of game. For Baldur's Gate it is easy as every problem is generally solved by means of swords and spells and whilst resolving all problems by means of combat are an option in Age of Decadence, it is far from the only solution. You might for example intimidate, bluff, persuade, impersonate, steal, sneak, poison, assassinate or run and flee towards a solution. Perception, constitution, strength, dexterity, intelligence and charisma all play a role for various solutions in the game. Some characters might not notice certain items or objects in the world. Others might not be smart enough to use certain items. Some might not have enough constitution or be dexterous and/or strong enough to accomplish a certain task. You can be sure of one thing and that is that you cannot do everything properly at the same time. You have the make tough choices. Age of Decadence has certain areas and events which will only be discovered if certain requirements are met and thus for these two reasons a completely open world would not be optimal. In any case Age of Decadence does not feel like it is not an open world. In certain ways, the events that take place are much more dynamic than those in Baldur's Gate. Exploring an area can get you in all kinds of trouble which was far less the case in Baldur's Gate. At the same time, Age of Decadence does have an excellent travel system, so that the tediousness of travelling is completely gone.Another thing I like is the functionality that the skill crafting offers in terms of stripping items into basic crafting materials after which custom made armour and weapons can be made. Other skills such as alchemy are great in their own way by offering a great variety of options (which generally tend to complement combat skills). This kind of flexibility besides the great variety of social skills was completely lacking in Baldur's Gate.I have noticed some state that Path of Exile is a far better game than Age of Decadence. I have played both games extensively and I have to disagree. Path of Exile is just mainly about combat and grinding. It has no politics, social skills, factions or intrigue of any kind. Path of Exile does have excellent character customisation, but so does Age of Decadence in its own way. The story of Path of Exile is all in all terrible. It has illogical events....some are there merely to look cool. Path of Exile is lacking in the lore department. Age of Decadence does not have that and the true extent of that only becomes known when playing as a Loremaster. All in all Path of Exile and Age of Decadence are both great games (just to be clear). They are generally not meant for the same kind of players. Some players do not care too much about being immersed in the game....they prefer to skip the lore component of games and just get straight to fighting and for those players Path of Exile is the better game, but for players who want to be immersed in intrigue and get a great story, then Age of Decadence is the far better choice. Few games provide so many avenues which can lead to the acquirement of power just as is the case in the real world.I do not think this game is for those gamers who want to play the all star hero who excels at everything simultaneously (and does not lose). Then again, this kind of gamer is generally impatient, prefers high quality graphics and dislikes reading. This game might not have the greatest of graphics, but graphics alone do not make a game great. Most games with great graphics are generally shallow. This game certainly is anything but shallow. It is true that Age of Decadence has a fair amount of text to read through at times, but it does add a level of immersion which would not be possible by other means. If you are not one of the above described gamers and like immersive RPGs which are full of intrigue and choices which really do matter, then I think you will find this game awesome. In a way it is like Game of Thrones. If you think the purchase price is high, then I would recommend putting it on your wishlist until it is on discount. I certainly think it is worth buying.			"

												This game should be named ""Age of Skill Checks"", heh. Really, the game works best if you treat it as some weird mash-up between an adventure game and the typical CRPG. Exploration and pushing your character points into non-combat skills like crazy is the best way to see all the features of this game, NOT through combat. Combat, while mechanically sound, is not the focus of this game. The game tells you time and time again to avoid combat. You CAN succeed in all the combat encounters the game, but it is highly not recommended unless you are extremely stubborn and know what you are doing.So the draw of the game is mostly the same as an adventure game: exploration and puzzle solving. Except in this case the game's puzzles are solved through your choice of allocating points into non-combat skills. In other words, you pick and choose which story elements you want to uncover through judicious reloading the game then reallocating your pool of spare stat points into the various non-combat skills til you find the right combination.Alternatively, and probably a better idea, give up on trying to see all the story elements/features in a single playthrough, and rather play throught the game ONCE focusing on one general way of solving problems, accepting that you cannot solve every type of problem and focusing on solutions you can find. Realistically, you can't be expected to do everything.Just not combat. Don't focus purely on combat. You'll thank me later.			"

												I wish I liked this game more than I do, because it tries so hard. But having played the first chapter through several times with different characters, I've found that while each had different details, each also felt too much the same, and I ended up with really no emotional incentive to continue into the next chapter with any of them.I think the thing that bugs me most is that there's just not enough built-in story to carry the weak mechanics, and not enough player leeway to give the feeling of an emergent story; in the end, I'm doing boring things in order to expose the ho-hum single conversation that will advance the unengaging story.It's as linear as a JRPG, without the depth of writing *or* the interesting combat mechanics that make those satisfying. It's as story-light as a tactical RPG, without the multiple tactical options that make those interesting.Honestly, I think the developers would have been much better off using RPGmaker or another such tool that would provide all the basic mechanics and engine for them, so they could really work on their story and flavor. But instead all their energy has been soaked up getting mediocre mechanics and production values onto the screen, with nothing left to make it shine.			"

												I bought this because I was interested in playing a game that has a low magic setting and allows a low combat playstyle, simply because I'm interested in seeing good ideas on how that can be accomplished. However, this game doesn't have any. Every single conversation option that carries you forward in any way simply checks if you have the right character values, so there is really no skillful way to navigate social situations, you just have to know what skills you need to pass the checks. The entire game is hard for all the wrong reasons. A single wrong decision can kill you, but there is no way to suss out the situation and get any kind of idea what will happen other than just trial and error. You get situations like this (spoilers): You're approached by a merchant who asks you to come to his house and check out his wares, the second you agree you are teleported to the house and locked in a room with two bandits, you get one more check of your dexterity to see if you can run away, failing that they immediately attack you. Unless your character is a skilled fighter (which you aren't with low dexterity) you're dead. You load, the merchant approaches you again, you refuse to go with him and continue on your way.Stuff like that is pretty much how this entire game goes down. You encounter a situation, you try to weigh the best response to it, the game throws a skill check at you, if you have the right numbers on your character sheet something good happens, if you fail something bad happens. The only way to skillfully navigate through gameplay like that is to simply know ahead of time what skill values you need to get a positive result before going into conversations. I have no problem with games that let you make bad choices, but when the bad results are down to skill checks I can't influence in any way I'm not really playing a game, since a game needs to have some kind of skill involved. Likewise, when there is an actual choice involved but picking the wrong thing then just boils down to: Load and pick the other thing there is no real gameplay, since only foreknowledge of the outcomes lets me make an informed decision.So basically: This game is extremely disappointing if you were hoping for a low magic / low combat game but aren't willing to completely forsake actual gameplay and just quicksave crawl through ""choose your own adventure"" style conversation trees that can kill you.

												It's a very limiting RPG which requires you to min-max stats in order to experience things you want to. Basically, the element of exploration does not exist as you'll fail so many times that you'll know what comes next, and you'll know it because you min-maxed to be able to get through that.The game world is dead, lifeless and there just ain't much to do. I was hyped for this game, but now it just seems like a big promise unfulfilled.			"

A lot of choice in structuring your chacter and chosseing some intersting combiantions that require you to llok at a problem at a diffrent angle rather than run around a mindlessly murder everything with your favoirte tool of destrcution. It is non-linear so it gives you a good look at the story from multiple perpectives and you can piece togther through multiple play throughs what happened.

												This old-school style RPG succeeds brilliantly at creating a series of vignettes for the player to interact with. The system is heavily based on your skills and attributes, and the wide plentifulness of content is gated by skills which makes the player constantly guess what they're missing. The problem is that everything else--and I do mean everything else--is mediocre to bad. The setting is unimaginative and the characters are intentionally made flat and unlikable, which means that for all it's success in creating a game with mystifying and challenging goals, both the background, pulp, and the payoff of these goals feel completely hollow. Dialogue is extremely uninteresting and nearly all of it has the same literary voice. There's a conversation with a certain character that has very strict requirements to initiate, but once you do initiate it, they basically end up spelling out every single secret the world has to offer. Once you get to this conversation, you have no reason to ever pay attention to any of the dialogue except for your own options. This is drilled into your head by the fact that there is a skill check in nearly every dialogue menu and there are only 2-3 instances where you can do anything meaningful without a skill check.The combat system is acceptably mediocre, but the way that encounters and combat skills are managed is truly awful. The developers favored realism over feasibility, except in cases where realism would ever favor the player. For example, during the first act, you are tasked with taking on a bandit camp. True to what would be the case in a realistic scenario, these bandits travel in packs (5 people), and have poor equipment, but are roughly as good in combat as an inexperienced imperial guard. The problem is that the player *physically cannot* reach a point where they are better than an imperial guard. Consequentially, this means that the player is facing five opponents equally as strong as they are. The intricacy of the vignettes wears off quickly when you realize what you have to do to meaningfully interact with them. Because the world is so boring and the game is so skill check heavy, all you're doing is unlocking meaningless content. The whole game is a glorified excel spreadsheet.			"

								Most people I know who play this game love it for the rich tactical combat, the gritty fight-or-flight realism or the unrelenting difficulty. While all three of those assets are truly impressive, what I find most flattering about the game is the story and atmosphere. Whereas a game such as Fallout clearly shows the decline of humanity into its current state, The Age of Decadence merely places you in the center of it without a truly clear idea of what's to come or what came before. I find myself utterly fascinated at how a civilization was crushed before it even began without so much as a clue as to what led up to it. One of the most intriguing concepts for a story I've seen in a long time!As to the combat, realism and difficulty...what else can be said that hasn't already been written about? Buy this game!			"

Why would I want to replay those hours?Very upsetting.Be warned.Go to the forum and type ""stuck"" see what comes up.I am voting positive because developers offer support and are in-tune with the issues presented.

												The Best Game i've ever played since Baldur's Gate...i will update my review as soon as i finish my first playthrough....First 22 hours of gameplay : 10/10  MasterpieceIl miglior gioco che abbia mai giocato dai tempi di Baldur's Gate.....lo finisco e scrivo una recensione piu' accurata....Prime 22 ore di gioco : 10/10 CapolavoroUpdate :I recommend this game not only  to every hard core role playing game fan but also to people looking for a different experience.This is the best game i've ever played since games like Baldur's Gate , Planescape : Torment , Morrowind and even DIablo and Diablo 2 .Why Baldur's Gate ? The graphics , the artwork , the taste behind every choice made by the developers ( i think this game has one of the best graphics in the game history because graphics is not just about effects and realism .... it is mainly about style....and taste....at least for me )Why Planescape : Torment ? The lore , the choices you have to make , the amount of text and the quality of plot and storytelling.AmazingWhy Morrowind? The World , the immersion , the freedom you experience since the beginning of the game ( and this is a tiny little game compared to morrowind . you do not need vastity to make someone fell FREE in the game ) Why Diablo ?? The ATMOSPHERE ....the mistery ... the colors.... the evil yet fascinating essence behind every corner in every location of this game.I would like to thank the developers for giving us this Diamond in this ""age of  decadence"" for gaming.Consiglio questio gioco ai fan del gioco di ruolo puro ma anche a chi vuole provare qualcosa di diverso dal solito.Confermo che questo e' il miglior gioco che abbia mai giocato dai tempi di Baldur's Gate , Planescape : Torment , Morrowind , e anche Diablo e Diablo 2.Perche' Baldur's Gate? La grafica , i disegni , il gusto dietro ogni scelta fatta dagli sviluppatori ( secondo me il gioco ha una delle piu belle grafiche nella storia dei videogiochi .... a mio avviso la grafica non e' solo ""effetti"" o ""realismo "" .... ma soprattutto Gusto  e Stile...almeno per me )Perche Torment ? La storia , non solo quella narrata ma quella scritta e presente ""dietro"" a quella narrata dal gioco . Il modo in cui viene narrata . IncredibilePerche' Morrowind ? Il mondo di gioco , L'immersione . la liberta' che proverete fin dalle prima fasi di gioco ( e questo gioco è minuscolo rispetto a Morrowind ... non serve una mappa enorme per dare quella sensazione al giocatore)Perche' Diablo ? L'Atmosfera , i colori , quella sensazione di misterioso ( ricordo le prime fasi di diablo 1 ) quell'aria di maligno e affascinante presente in ogni locazione che esplorerete . Grazie agli sviluppatori per aver tirato fuori questo diamante in un momento buio per questo genere di giochi.			"

												Original No rating review.  Edited comments below:I only say no to recommending this soley on the current listed price of $29.99.  It's simply not worth this much for what you get.  Firstly you would expect an indie title like this to pay around 9.99 (I could even see paying 19.99) but not 30.  The gameplay is fun and the world story is pretty good.  Combat is very sluggish and uninteresting.  I understand combat is not a main focus of the game and the devs actually encourage you to seek a non combat method to solving problems but it almost appears like they spent little to no time developing the combat system.  The game is not that long either and there is little to no ending.  Once you complete the storyline instead of being treated to a well deserved ending (which is the main drive for finishing a RPG) you are immidietly taken back to the main menu which is such a anticlimax and a let down. The devs have stated the game is about the replayability and not the ending but that seems like a cop out response to their lack of creating closure to their story. Overall out of 5 I'd give it a 2.5.  Half way decent and I suppose if you have a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of money just lying around and looking for a game then try it otherwise I advise you to wait until this drops down to 5 or 10 dollars because for 30 it just is not worth it.Edited:  I have been watching a lot of let's plays recently about this game and have played a bit more than from my initial released review. Although I still disagree with the pricing of the game I will say that the story and the amount of care that went into the history of the world has warrented me changing my recommendation from no to yes.  If you are an avid fan of turn based RPG's that are challenging and make you think with a cleverly written history then I do recommend you pick up a copy for yourself.			"

												I'm sick and tired with this modern era of so called RPG games where you are a hero already as an infant baby and can archieve/handle every situation either immeditialy or returning years later to same quest as if it waited only for you. Usually these RPGs are crowned with hollow conversations and choices that hardly matter anything.The Age of Decadence takes immeditialy different approach. You are meaningless worm, just one person among others and people aren't afraid to treat you like one. NPCs are well planned with their positions and motivations and they will take use of you because it's simply their benefit. You have to archieve your position with your acts that will not usually please everyone; when you bow towards someone, you show your♥♥♥♥♥to others. With several different factions and own your decisions between them either to help or betray them this game does offer not only huge, but also intresting replay value.The absence of class system provides pleasant diversity to solve problems in several ways and limiting less what kind of character you want to do. This however might make game a bit unintuitive for beginneers as the world is more than unforgiving. As natural it is, you can't learn every single thing.As you can see, this game looks old graphically, but it's the content that is gold under the shell when you get hang of it. It's also dialog and text heavy, but well written one. Definately worth of trying if you are bored with these meaningless, stereotypic modern RPGs and haven't took Homer Simpson's advice to Bart as part of your life: ""If something is difficult, better not to try it all""			"

I did find some of the frustration in needing to reload to add points to stats at differrent points, but in the end game you can be completely screwed if you didn't invest in one or two certain traits that may have been the complete opposite of your build. And everything that makes this game special, everything people are praising it for in the write ups, goes right down the tubes in the ending. I was having a blast, then utter disappointment with an end game that seems hokey and hackneyed. What a waste.			"

								Age of Decadence is an extremely unique RPG experience, The way dialogue works and the high quality writing reminds me of Pillars or Eternity or Baldur's gate, the combat is very difficult (Not Dark Souls difficulty, personally) but you have a selection of non-violent approaches and dialogue options/skills that can help you avoid some extremly hard battles, If you are a hardcore turn based gamer and enjoy long, difficult battles then the fighting approach is for you.  The Quests seem to be well written and features a few different approaches to every situation.  You won't find the more modern use of waypoints which can make it difficult to locate the more hidden quests but you can easily look up guides or just search around the games main towns and talk to the many characters, On the subject of characters, they have a ton of personality that makes them each feel like unique individual's, The in-game portraits are very well drawn and really bring out the personality type of the character. The game certainly isn't for everyone but it's certainly worth trying for the story if nothing else. I highly recommend the game in its current state and the official release is less then a month away.Pros/ConsTraining+ Informative+ Well Written DialogueMain Game+ 8 Backgrounds to choose (which affect starting parameters)+ Reputation with factions+Lots of skills & attributes to choose+ High-quality portraits+ Interesting character's filled with personality+ Choices & Consequences+ Good graphics+ Varied, well-designed environments+ Unique setting & story+ Large assortment of different items and equipment.+/- High difficulty (Some people like that in games)			"

												The game feels like it has so much potential but the lack of clarity in regards to what skills you will need to do which actions leads to metagaming and guides as a necessity. The combat not only is unecessarily punishing, even on combat oriented builds-but the options that lead into combat fail to accurately describe what your getting into. As in, the text will say that there is a guard in front of you and a crossbowman in the nearby tower, but if you chose to fight them then not 2 but 4 guards pop out and attack you as apparently they were standing in plain sight. The world building and story seem good, but the lack of foresight in regards to mechanics and the constant reloading in a necessary attempt to game the combat system leads to annoyingly frequent breaks of immersion. As picking the ""correct"" choice in almost every situation ends up being a game of guess who, where if you are wrong, you die. But don't worry, you can always reload 6 more times to find out the correct option you were allowed to chose with your skills!			"

								Really enjoying this game. I know they are still working on it, but the game and story is quite refreshing. No grinding, trash, or junk.  A excellent RPG for those who really care about choices and consequences, and a unique experience. So far, I've explored the first city and hit a few quests that had multiple resolutions and some I just couldn't solve. Maybe later, but it definitely has the feel of a classic. Not some combat grind like Skyrim, Diablo, Dragon Age, etc, etc, etc. Fights are tough and shouldn't be entered lightly. There are other skills, but when push comes to shove, it's a nice fighting system as well. Turn based, and allows for multiple actions. So far, an excellent and refreshing experience.			"

								I rarely write reviews, and even rarer do i find a genuinely unique rpg.  This game is so vastly different from every rpg i've ever played.  Failed quests don't exist outside of how you felt about them.  Rather, it's about shaping the world.  I love that.  And so different from every other rpg is that you will NOT be able to get every skill check.  Hell, you'll be lucky if you can pass any if you're doing a combat oriented playthrough.  I love that.  So much replay value, and from me, that's the highest honor, as i think what makes a great game, isn't the graphics, it isn't the story, it isn't the items or the crafting or the ai or how good the voice acting is.  It is the replay value.  And there is an immeasurable amount of replay value for how short this game can be.  Before you buy it, i recommend trying the demo, to see how it feels for you.  As stated, this game is quite difficult in terms of combat, but it feels right.  It makes you feel human, just some dude, not the chosen one or some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (though you can beguile others into thinking you're one :D)4/5 cats with hats.  would die again. And again. and again.			"

Get the demo and play it, if you like that, the rest of the game is like that but more and better.February 22th 2016. Almost a year has passed since I picked up this game, even after release the devs are still working on the game, but in a good way, as it stands now, the game is solid, fun and has a lot of replayability. I have finished the full game 3 times now, but played a lot more in beta when the ending wasn't there, so you can say I played the game to the 'existing end at the time' more then half a dozen times. My favorite build so far was the diplomatic grifter who betrayed everyone at the first chance he got.			"

Early Access Review
								Quite refreshing RPG to scratch that old-school isometric itch.The game writing is great, and really passes the feeling of those Glen Cook ""Black Company"" worlds, where life is short and brutal.This game makes you think twice before going into the fight, and think triple before trusting someone, unlike easymode modern games where you play ""Bill the Slayer of Rats and Destroyer of Worlds"".In AoD you can get betrayed and shanked by a successfull knife punch just like any other guy next door, thinking ""why the hell did I have to play hero and went to save that damsel in distress"", or ""damn, it did seem like a too good deal to be true"".You get to choose your character gender, attributes and skills, as well as the very important initial employment or faction. The storyline is very branching for the path you will choose, very responsive to your decisions, sometimes with nice twists.Do not expect a ""kill 10 rats"" kind of quests here, the tasks you face are much more complex and sometimes may be resolved in over 5 different ways, overall making up a very fun and immersive experience.The game world itself is very detailed with very interesting lore and story behind and in front of it, and is very immersive. Of course, if you are playing dumb and strong character, you will not be preoccupied with lore so much, being busy caving skulls of your employers' enemies in with a hammer. On the other hand, for the intelligent and knowledgeable character the world is a whole different story with lore to uncover and people to manipulate.That being said, some combat mechanics are very questionable, and since the developer team is quite small, does not seem they will be able to make any noticeable changes and improvements.Overall, combat characters will have better quality of life, longer gameplay and overall enjoyment than social talkative characters.I recommend this RPG, especially to those youngsters who had Skyrim as their first ""RPG experience"" to see how the actual RPG feels like.

												Let me start by saying that Age of Decadence isn't a bad game, at least not as far as I could tell.  It's clearly a game where the developers have put effort into in terms of decisions and consquences.  It's also a game that is exactly as it is advertised: really hard and unforgiving.That said, I just couldn't get into it Age of Decadence.  I really wanted to enjoy this game, but I guess it's just not the game for me (and, thus, I have a hard time recommending it to others).  While interacting with other characters was fun and I was interested in seeing the impact I could have on the world, the world itself was not particularly interesting or fun.  There is a moment where you feel like the game might encourage and reward exploration, but places outside of the main cities are small and serve little purpose other than their original quests.  It becomes really hard to care about what's going on or your role in it.The combat system does not make this any easier.  It's a simple (not in a bad way) system, and the game doesn't lie when it says its very difficult.  It is, but not in a good way.  I don't mind difficult games, and I typically feel like greater difficulty enhances the gameplay experience, but the difficulty here feels artificial and forced.  Losing isn't learning experience that helps you figure out a puzzle, it's just frustrating.  And, consquently, winning isn't particularly rewarding either. Finally, there's not much to say about the story.  It's not bad, but it's not particularly interesting either.  Again, the game isn't bad, but can I honestly recommend it to others?  No, I can't.  I wanted a refund but I was 3 hours over the limit, so I guess this review will have to do.  Thanks Steam!			"

Usually, the reviews on steam are pretty on target....as an RPG you seem to have no bearing on events.  If you have a high enough points in a skill you pass and there is your game.

												After 35 years of gaming you migh think immersion is dead and you have seen it all.Not so with this game, it took only 2 hours to get completly immersed into the story.This is not you standard ""divinity sin/final fantasy' story line of childish cliché fantasy plots.Its a harsh post apocalyptic world, not the kind as in fall out or its clones but more realistic like in the series 'walking dead'. The story line is actually different with each class and they intertwine, its a work of genious.As a progammer i can say this software has many many complicated formulas on everything, and you can even choose to play it as text adventure with a non combat char and succeed in finishing the story. Normally i skip all the bla bla and get right to the fights as i did with Divinity Sin and its clones, nothing more boring than a Tolkien rip off story number 126082633626. But this game really has a thick plot and i cant praise the storyline enough, it contains everything im interrested in: history, war, intrigue, people that respond as they would in real life, no heroes, no divine racist elves or other crap cliche's. I actually made a non combat char just to read more of the lore , and now im going for a hybrid just to unlock as much content as i can. How long ago it must have been that i played an RPG with more than 1 char? Maybe WoW in 2003 where i made a pala and warlock or NWN where i made a pala and monk. Neh only games close to this immersion are Dead state or the Banner saga or other indy games in which you can taste the devs love for their own products.Well enough praising lets get to the pro's and cons:Cons:-  Steep learning curve, this game has plenty of number crunching and is not for the less experienced rpg player, it takes days to find your perfect build, but that is also a pro if you like that sort of thing (i do!)- Interface could use some more streamlining and auto functions especially when choosing your attacks for each round, its tedious but you get used to it as the game pushes you further along the story line.- The graphics are not suberb but doesnt hurt your eyes either when maxed out and a medium card can handle that with ease.- some crashes when doing weird things with the interface or when just loading area's, but nothing the auto save cant handle for youPros: - Total immersion, superb story lines- High replayability as every class offers its own total unique experience- Turn based and tactical combat so you can chill in a chess like manner and not get all hyped up in a click fest designed for hyper active 15 year olds (not that i hate shooters or action rpg but sometimes a hard working man needs to relax after his daytime job)- weapon porn for the grognards- devoted devs actually respond to bug reports and they know every little corner of the game when they tweak and balance codeI do a lot of 'miss buys' on steam and 2/3 of my games are removed to free up hard disc after a few hours of playing but this one was money well spent. My advice is if you are a RPG player dont think just buy, if you are a new comer to RPG's try something simple first or this will forever be your standard and your life as gamer will become difficult to please in the RPG genre, also the steep learning curve might turn you away from a genre that can deliver real good products like this one. If you have any RPG experience, buy now, its obviously a game made by RPG lovers.			"

My first few attempts were horrible but I lend that to poor choices during character creation. Since my fourth attempt, I think I finally realized how making the right choices makes or breaks your success in this game. Cant wait to see how the rest plays out. This game is hardcore and I recommend it highly for anyone who wants a true challenge that is unforgiving.			"

												It's definitely worth to disregard 2 generations old graphics, because underneath lies RPG made in exquisite oldschool formula. Choices are unforgiving, world presented mostly by text (and there is a lot of it) and much of the important content hidden from unwary eyes. It's relatively short, so you can rush through and dump the game into the bottomless limbo of your library in under 20h. However AoD is certainly not made with that in mind. Your ending, not to mention story, characters, locations and lore that'll be presented to you depend on your character's origin and various choices you will have to live with later on. My playthroughs with loremaster and assasin varied so much they seemed like two different games set in the same universe.Play it.			"

The story behind the game is deep enough to make you wanna repeat it. And even though the graphic are a litlle bit rough, they awe you with certain magic-like feeling. Recommended!			"

												Well, this game is very clear about it's target audience, so for this audience, it comes highly recommended.Thus, if you like to grind, if you prefer unfair, ridiculously unbalanced uphill battles for at least the first third of the game, go for it. If chores, tedium and unending roadblocks are your thing - this absolutely is the game for you.I do need, however, to end some of the rumours about this being a ""hard"" game. Or a roleplaying game, for that.First of all, there is nothing ""hard"" about the combat. It's a basically pretty well executed turn based system, based on tradeoffs. Strategy and tactics really isn't that tough to grasp, you just need to grind and grind to gain a *lot* of skill points and equipment until any type of tactic has a chance of actually *working*...No, the simple fact is, that, especially early on, the odds and numbers are so riduculously stacked against you, that it's pretty successful at creating the illusion of being difficult. Plainly, in the early game it is *mathematically impossible* to win most battles, and once you've created MinMax The Unstoppable (aka blocking or counterattacking machine) with enough grinding, it can even become a walk in the park. Difficulty is entirely artificial, and in the sheer numbers.Also, you really have no true choice whatsoever in what character you'll be playing. No matter your class or background, in the beginning you play a sickly, anorexic pauper with no friends. Period. Because from the start, everyone on the bloody planet - and their mothers - have better training, better weapons, better armor and higher combat intitiative (enemies ALWAYS act first in combat!) than you do, and generally outnumber you to boot. Every street thug, gang member or plain bum will beat you like the readheaded stepchild that you are...And no, even with good streetwise and social skills, and if you make all the checks and know about the battle ahead, there's no way to bring some friends to even the odds or lure the folks to a trap/ambush of your own. Remember: Sickly. Anorexic. Poor. No Friends. And - no options other than what you can click in the predetermined menu.Frankly, this really is a well made game by folks who obviously care deeply, but certainly not everyone's piece of cake. Me, it reminds entirely too much of the pen&paper stone age in the 70s and 80s - when DMs were telling you ""Oh, and by the way, you're dead, no saving throw. Just because.""Or, in other words, I'd prefer enemies from the same planet as my character. Enemies that, after I hit them with 2 arrows from a long bow and 6 times with a poisoned dagger, are frackin' DEAD... and not keep doing 3 times more damage to me than I do to them, and hitting me twice more often...Really good game, really, totally, absolutely not for me, sorry.

												Before you do anything else, if you are interested in this game, I urge you to try the demo. It will tell you a lot about it, and it really helped me decide with confidence whether to buy it or not. As my playtime suggests, I love this game. It is very much as advertised: A hardcore RPG with a non-linear story, choices and consequences, and, if you happen to encounter it, tactical combat. Now, this can be a good or bad thing, depending on what kind of player you are.First off, the game is as hard as it suggests. The combat is brutal, while the dialog requires some forethought, and if you fail at both, you're probably dead. However, it is not unbalanced by any means. You can complete the game without ever lifting a weapon, slaughter anything and everything that get's in your way, or anything in-between, granted you have a character capable of what you're aiming for. On the other hand, you make a character who's spread too thin, or specializes too much in the wrong areas, you will probably reach an impassable wall. That being said, you can do just fine on the first playthrough if you pick a background and playstyle that suits you and works well together. Read the background descriptions, pick the skills that fit that description and stick somewhere around the default attributes, and you'll probably make it far. Once you get past the initial difficulty factor (which can be jarring for many people), the game is just brilliant in my opinion. The combat is very tactical and has a lot of depth, and the story is great. Remember how every single RPG centers around the all-powerful savior of the universe clashing with the bigbad? Well, that doesn't happen here. You know how every alignment system ignores reality completely by labeling good as the selfless martyr who can do no wrong, and evil as the chaos-mongering fiend who steals, ravages and kills for the hell of it? Thank heavens that's not here. People feel like normal people in this game, and while they are a bit colder and crueler at times than real life, it feels organic, rather than like people being shoved into ridiculous black-and-white world views. There is a lot of reading, but it's done really well I think, and a good part of it is optional stuff that you don't need to worry about. It's addicting to play an armor-clad mercenary who actively hunts and fells powerful adversaries, or a magnetic grifter who manipulates people like a cat playing with a ball of yarn. The world is brutal, and that makes it so satisfying when you conquer it. Another great thing about the story is how the non-linear aspect is done. In my experience, games that advertise choices and consequences often disappoint me, because they just stop at ""Are you a stereotypical hero or villain?"" or ""Which guy do you save/kill?"", without actually mattering a whole lot. In Age of Decadence, though, you can visibly see the consequences of your actions, especially in multiple playthroughs. Entire Houses can crumble into nothing or rise above the rest, depending on who you influence, help, stop, or kill, and it feels great when you do because of how harsh and unforgiving the environment is.Anyways, I'm rambling a bit. To sum up, Age of Decadence is a very difficult game, but the difficulty is done well and is rewarding in the end, with a well-written story that actually is non-linear, in a world that feels far more realistic than most stereotypical fantasy settings. Still, it's not for the faint of heart, and if you have a hard time with the difficulty, you may want to pass.			"

												The Age of Decadence is a solid, Character-driven RPG. If you're looking for a tactical-combat fix, I'd reccomend Iron Tower's other title, Dungeon Rats, which is a party based tactics game based in the Age of Decadence Universe. With that said, this is a great RPG. There's an insane number of branches and paths through the game, and multiple ways to solve most problems. The game does, in my opinion, have something of a reverse difficulty curve, with the first area actually being harder than the later ones, since by later on you've gotten a feel for your character and started to be able to specialize in the areas you need to excel in. The game is demanding, and I think alot of its charm comes from it's ability to make you feel like an average human in the context of the world. You aren't special, you aren't the chosen one, and taking on more than 1 foe at a time means, much like in real life, unless you are a skilled fighter, that the odds are against you. You will probably lose the fight and die unless you had some tricks up your sleeve going in, such as bombs or poison.I really quite enjoyed how the story fit together. I know there are some complaints with the story ""jumping around"", but that's because theres a lot happening simultaneously, and you characters can't be everywhere at once. Maybe your doing a job for the assasins guild, but at the same time the merchants guild is moving a shipment and the theives guild is trying to steal that while the imperial guard are staging a coup, but you only see a sliver of whats happening from your role as assassins guild grunt. Being able to play every different angle of the scenarios is really neat, and the story only really starts to come together after you've played through as a couple different character types, though it will still be coherent on your first playthrough.My main complaints are with some bugs and balance issues with the combat side of things. Combat is fun as it is, but certian bugs (not being able to poison more than 1 throwing weapons at once comes to mind, as well as having to unequip a two-handed bow to use belt slot items) really hinder the viability of certain builds. The devs have stated that they will push the combat changes from Dungeon Rats to Age of Decadence, which would probably clear up most of my current issues with the game (this was stated about a month ago when the final content update was put in place, hopefully the update will come soon).  Additionally, certain aspects of the gameplay ended up feeling a bit ""cheesy"" as I would end up holding my skillpoints in reserve as I found certain scenarios that I would need a specific skill for, and then beef that up after a reload to pass the check.All in all, Age of Decadence is a very good, but not quite great character-driven RPG. Lots of branching paths, lore-rich universe, and a solid but not yet great combat system. 8/10.			"

												This game is pure, unadulterated awesome.  I cannot recommend this game enough.  If you like to think, if you like significant and meaningful choice and consequence, if you like character development, great TB combat, games where you can almost completely avoid combat through dialogue (if you want), a great story, and a very interesting setting, this game is a must buy.  I, personally, would like the game more if I could have a party (that I create myself).  This is a single character game like Fallout, Diablo, Lionheart, etc.  Also, as significant pros for me, this game has almost zero filler combat, and every battle is done for a reason.  There is no endless hordes of enemies, and there is no walking around smashing endless hordes of barrels filled with health potions and gold.  This game removed all the tripe from your garden variety RPG, and gave us a sensible game, in a realistic setting, and it all makes sense and is believable (for the most part – Mote in God’s Eye is a pretty far out there story but done believably).  I think people will enjoy this game more if they go into without pre-conceptions on how this game should be as it really turns some staples and conventions on their head.  I also think crpg fans who don’t need all the bells and whistles of the first/third person action games with rpg elements blockbusters from BioWare and Bethesda will find this game to be an instant classic with more replay value of any game I’ve ever played.

												Game does bring some of the nostalgy back, times of Might and Magic series and even earlier. But, the game corners you with being totally not user friendly. I could find a lot of things in first city only because I read guide on how to find them. Second city I played without any guides, and it is so frustrating to find any points of interest. There is nothing written about where slums are, I am not sure why I would want to get to palace, or arena. So after wandering for an hour and not finding slums that are needed for my questline, I give up.			"

								I've owned this game for quite awhile, though I never played it at any length until just recently. While I was initially skeptical and even forgot about AoD several times over the course of it's development, now that we're reaching the end I have to say -- the result so far that I've experienced is brilliant.As other reviews will probably point out and as indeed the description of the game itself details, it's not for those seeking an easy power trip or for the casual gamer. Combat is hard. Really, really hard. The world is gritty and characters will often mislead, lie to and cheat you. Before I list what I felt were the pros and cons, I should probably put a disclaimer as to that most of my time spent playing has been with a combat orienated character, though I've dabbled with a talker. The real positives here are:1. While combat is unforgiving, it's IMMENSELY rewarding when you win a fight. Especially early on. The combat is also the sort of frustrating, but well thought out system that gives you an undeniable high when you've taken the next step to figuring out what works in your current conflict. 2. Branching paths. Most games now adays have them, but AoD does it well. While you'll still end up in roughly the same places, your path to them varies greatly depending on your early game choices. More importantly, these branching paths can take you through customary game violence to zero bloodshed and all smart - or depending on your choices - very dumb negotiating and wordplay. 3. As I mentioned before, the characters like to screw you over. Well, you can almost always return the favor, sometimes in very satisfying ways. Not that there's much more satisfying then repeatedly stabbing someone. 4. The writing is excellent. While I normally object to a senseless amount of obscenities being thrown about, (which I think AoD somewhat qualifies for) it doesn't ever feel out of place. The plot, which is really whatever nearest goal your character has at the time, also moves very fluidly and I was never left feeling bored or especially lost in the narrative sense. The cons: The only one truly worth pointing out is that the game isn't finished. There are bugs, typos, misplaced dialogue sequences and so on. But that's to be expected until release, and likely a patch or two after it. I'd normally say it's a con for a game with a difficulty curve this high, but I spent a good bit of time in the tutorial chucking spears and nets at bad guys, learning my way through combat. Everything after that was just good times.			"

								The game is a hardcore rpg. Extremely hard combat and your 1st several builds are almost bound to fail simply because you do not know how the game works. So prepare for failure from the start, but dont be discouraged. Sometimes failing in this game can be good for you, more often then not it will just lead you to another path in the story *unless you meet an untimely demise*. Combat is extremely hard and while being extremely well balanced its balanced for veterans who played this game for ages, meaning this is like DoTA 3.0 - unless you know what you are doing you might not have as good of a time as you might desire. I might add that while it might seem that combat is unnecessarily hard at 1st in reality its done in a way to draw a line to what content your hero might see in the game. Generally speaking there are 2 playstyles - social and combat. There are hybrid builds in the middle of them, but they are vastly harder to pull off then either of the main playstyles. On the bright side - there is a lot of content and variability to the game * apart from neutral quests*. You will need at least 7 playthroughs to see 100% of the game. So there is that going for the game. There are a lot of choice and consequence decisions which GENUINELY MATTER. Yes im looking at you, ME3. Its created by a really small but dedicated team and main developer is as down to customer as it can get pretty much. Basically - 'our guy'. So do support this awesome game, - yes it has its flaws, graphics are dated, there are errors and some imbalances, but the devs LISTEN to the community and change the game accoardingly, while maintaining the 'artistic integrity' making it for one hell of an experience. TL DR: Story 9/10 Original, Fun, Extremely realistic.Gameplay 7/10 Somewhat flawed and unnecessarily hard at times.Sound 6/10 Some of the tracks are not as good as others.Graphics 3/10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ customisation is included here aswell, but its engine limited.Likeability 10/10 The game wins a lot of points by the overall spirit and charisma of it, - its a hand crafted and balanced world with a  lot of reworks based on community feedback.Final Score: 8/10 The game loses points just because of how hard it is to get into it initially and the cummulative problems in it. 10/10 if you are a hard core RPG player and a MUST HAVE, otherwise its still a great purchase. Absolutely recommended for purchase.			"

												I've been playing games for well over 30 years. RPG's, action games, puzzlers, adventrue...you name it. Say what you want about mechanics, graphics, writing...the only thing that makes a game worth playing is FUN. Why else do we spend countless hours playing? I could not find one enjoyable thing about this game, nothing that made it even remotely FUN. Before you say ""you don't get it"" or ""you aren't into hardcore games""; I've successfully beaten several of the classic Wizardry, Ultima, and MIght and Magic games that balanced FUN with challenge. Don't dare put ""The Age of Decadence"" in the same category of classic CRPG's...because it severly lacks what the classics had, and that's playability. It can't be called a role playing game if you have to do things a certain way, it becomes a guessing simulator. Sadly, I was 1.8 hours over the limit for a Steam refund. I see plenty of people enjoy this game...but the ones like me, who don't, REALLY don't like it. On to one of the other dozens of games in my library...			"

								The team creating AOD is truly ahead of the curve here. This is not your run of the mill hack ""n"" slash RPG. It offers stellar dialog with in depth character building and quest. The few quest that they have to offer ATM wont simply have you running from point A to B. Decisions will take some serious thinking because the wrong actions, or reactions could leave you pushing daisies. AOD will truly immerse you in your character and story. If you're still on the fence about buying a  20+ dollar Alpha game, I would just tell you to do it.  Once you play and see its potential, you will be saying money well spent			"

								This is a very intriguing game that is not for everyone. It is very difficult but also very rewarding, and properly gives you the feeling of gaining in power, something done only in good RPGs. There are multiple ways of progressing through the game, although some skill choices are curently not very useful in the early release. $25 doesn't give you many hours of content, but you can replay with multiple characters and have a fairly different experience each time. Overall I support the development of games like this and can't wait to see how the finished game turns out.Pros:Immersive world, dialogue and characters.Good music that fits the theme of the game.Pretty deep skill system that rewards different styles of play.Combat is challenging and is somewhat luck based but overall it's a good system.The devs know what makes a good RPG and are excellent at having you ""feel"" the power of your character grow and feel like the decisions you make have an impact.Multiple choices in quests, often with no clear answer. Some things will have negative or positive consequences much later in the game.Cons:Sometimes you can get stuck and be unable to progress due to putting points in the wrong skills. There is no way to ""grind"" more skill points, so in these situations you are sort of screwed (I'm sure this will be better addressed in the final version, and No I'm not saying they should add a way to grind skill points!)Overall not much content yet, you can only go to about 5 locations out of the 20 total, and there aren't that many quests right now. Once again I'm sure the finished game will feel much larger and longer.A little too linear - Yes there are multiple ways to go about things and the game is not too linear in this sense. But certain things bothered me, such as my sneaky assassin being unable to go to the temple in the slums without either paying 1000 gold or fighting like 7 guys by myself (100% impossible in this game). You would think I would be able to use my points in sneaking to wait until night and get to the temple, it is supposed to be a whole slums district and one band of thugs can completely seal the whole thing off from everyone?Overall a very good game. I would give a 7/10 for the early alpha just because it is somewhat low on content but if the final game is as good as I think it will turn out to be this will be at least a 9/10 for sure. "

								With a full release you're in for a Gem. At least if you were born in the 80s.. This is THE classic game you've always wanted developers to make since your glorious hours in Steamworks Arcana, Torment, and  Baulder's Gate titles.It is fair and harsh, it is written magnificently, and plays like a fine book is read. This on can be replayed as many times as you replayed Fallout, just to try different builds, but yet more lies in wait.As you find yourself taking different paths in a world that's fate is ever changing from the choices you make. I am not taking Mass Effect Rogue/Paragon.I'm talking you skip lunch one day on guard duty, stand an extra hour to witness a comet fall, leaving to investigate you discover a small winged creature, It's eye closed you poke it with the butt of your spear, it awakes quickly and stares into your soul revealing to you the fate of the universe before disappearing in a cloud of smoke.Mind Smoted you leave your post, looking for answers. Raiders attack from the weakened position you left at the fort, twenty years later you've become a great Mayor on your way to the throne, but alas civil war erupts for your opponent for the crown was there the day raiders came over the walls and ravished his mother in front of him after killing his father.Adopted by a Nobel and with a burning desire in his chest to change the world for the better he rises through the ranks becoming a great warrior, with many friends including master's of assassins he has hired on occasion, ending the lives (over the years) of those who manned the walls on that faithful day.Finding out who you are he sends assassin after assassin you end you, but with your honing of your knowledge over the years you have learned dark magics of protection which you must now utilize in you life of constant attack.Your people become weary of you dark arts and mean to usurp you with you rival, saying you won the crown with dark magics. Now on your throne with your hand picked elite guard warrior priest, you find yourself at the head of a summoning circle, bringing forth a dark army to subjugate your people.Succeeding in your pursuit, you now march forward across all the know world crushing those in your path, for the Demons of Darkness require a bloody toll for your rein to remain.Five years later your late night secret toilings have produced an answer to the Demon blight, but in the action:you will tear the continent asunder. OrYou could sacrifice yourself. OrAll the first born children of man will be marred with evil taint in a 40 year Pact.All because you wanted to skip lunch.10/10Old review:I very much enjoyed the game, but from a testing point of view it's not worth the effort, and not at all the price considering you are paying them to test their beta. Wait for a full release, if it ever happens it'll be a great play overall. Not now though.			"

												I don't normally write reviews, but this game has made me so heated...so...annoyed...and so enraged I just can't help myself.  I bought into the hype and bought the game.  Put plenty of hours into it, and can finally put into words why it drives me insane.At first I was very impressed with this game, but now the shine has fallen off and I hate it. I hate it a lot, because it has potential but the devs are so smug and proud of the garbage they've created that it will never ever be fixed.Let me describe a typical scenario in the game to you. You find a library (from another quest) and go there on your first playthrough (at about the 10 hour mark). In the library is a generator, and your current character doesn't have the stats to fix it.

You play through mostly the same♥♥♥♥♥♥again, for 10 hours with your new guy, and get to the library. You pass the skill check, and find out the generator lets you open a secret door.So you go through the door and find...nothing. Jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ See there WOULD be something here, but your perception is too low. Perception is decided at character creation, and you can NEVER RAISE IT THROUGH GAMEPLAY. OH, and the only way to know what level you need it at is to read a guide or check online, because the game doesn't tell you...so the surprise is ruined anyways. So now you can either remake AGAIN to try to see this crap, or do what I did and right click -> uninstall.The game is FULL of multi-level hard gated skill challenges like this, and sometimes it's totally arbitrary. Combat is very RNG and swingy, which makes save scumming a necessity. Basically it's everything that was terrible about old school RPGs coupled with game devs reveling in the ""difficulty"" of their game. News flash, that's not difficulty. Trial and error requiring hours of investment between each trial isn't difficulty, and it's sure as♥♥♥♥♥♥not fun.I wish I could have figured this out before spending the time on the game I did so I could refund it. Don't fall for the Steam reviews and the hype. Game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it shows at least some twinkling of potential...which is why I'm so upset over it. It should have everything I like, but because of the way it's designed it's hot garbage.			"

												The gem is a rare gem. It offers an amazing and unique experience. The best part is realism: your adventure feels real. NPC's will fool,♥♥♥♥♥♥ use or kill you if they can benefit from it, quests are not just a concept of rewarding you with experience and money for just playing the game, many situations have no resulution unless you meet some criteria (if there's a mechanism that requires 8 lore to operate, you need 8 lore. period. game will not just give you an NPC to handle it for you), environment and seciety is unforgiving: insult someone hard enough now and he will kill you right away or send assassins later and finally the game doesn't walk you by hand as if you are a child of some sort. And yeah, add a high replay value: I think you will need 8+ full playthoughs and dozen more partial cover all content, uncover all secrets, do all achievements. And there's value in making more and more attempts: the world is charming, mysterious, complex, interesting.			"

												The closest thing I can compare this game to is the original Fallout, set in Roman times with gods and demons mixed in.  For me the great things about this game are the following:- Tons of ways to approach a situation:  Depending on your character build (combat based or non-combat based), you can complete a quest/task a different way.  For example, you want to speak to a lord but the way is blocked by guards. If you are strong enough, you can fight your way in. Or you could talk your way in or sneak your way in. Add this to the fact that there are multiple factions to align yourself with (and each faction has their own unique quests)  adds more replayability to these quests.-Tons of Skillsets : There are numerous skills to place skill points in each one will affect how you approach a situation and will benefit/hinder you depending on the situation. For example if you spend skill points on charisma you may be able to talk your way out of situations or influence people to commit certain actions that will benefit you, but since you didn't place those skill points in the lore skill or disarm trap skill, you may not be able to explore certain areas (such as dungeons) and certain quests may not be open to you-Good atmosphere: The story combined with the character interactions and the soundtrack make this experience enjoyable and helped immerse me in the game.-Brutal game: This is a good and bad point. For those who like unpredictability or suspense in situations (like me) this is a pro. Exploring a dungeon with too low of a trap disarm skill, you're dead. Get ambushed by bandits and fail to talk your way out of it (with a non-combat character), you're dead. I have found that even with a character with maxed out combat stats with the best weapons/ armor in the game can still get killed.Consequences that have an impact on the story: How you approach a quest can impact character actions and whether certain characters live or die. For example: In one quest I want to help a noble start a revolt in a city, overthrow the current ruler and place a puppet ruler which this noble can easily control in his place. To do this I need to convince three influential figures to join this noble's cause. If I fail to convince all three, then the revolt fails and all of the conspirators are killed. If the revolt succeeds, then the current ruler is killed. There are also quests where you can determine which faction controls a certain city. You can work toward helping a certain faction control a city or you can play both sides or even backstab your allies for personnal gain.Now to the cons: - Short game: Once you complete these quests, there is very little replay value and once you have repeated the same situation several times through many playthroughs it loses its tension and becomes routine. I have played about 33 hours so far and have beaten the game twice, so it is not a very long game.-Jumbled narration: The story is great once you are able to piece everything together. However certain actions will move the story forward preventing you from completing certain quests. I was trying to complete a quest but wanted to explore a different city, when I visited the city the game moved to the next section of the story which made it hard to follow the story.-Brutally hard: This is both a pro and con. Because you are allotted only so many skill points, your skill points may not be high enough to complete a certain situation/quest. The only way to receive more skill points is to explore other areas, win in combat or complete other quests. If you can't explore other areas without losing the ability to complete the current quest and you suck at combat then it makes it difficult to get through current quests and you're forced to skip them.-Unbalanced: I have played this game with a combat character and non-combat character. It is SO MUCH EASIER with a non-combat character. Since you can talk your way out of situations, you don't need to buy fancy armor or a nice sword so you have a ton of money for other things. With a combat character  I usually don't have any money, have some of the best weapons/armor in the game AND STILL DIE. Also you usually get more experience points using a non-violent solution vs a violent one. With a non combat character I only died twice completing the game, with a combat character I died probably 100 times.-Lack of tutorial: For me I felt that the tutorial could have done a better job explaining certain functions and actions, especially with a combat build character. I had to learn a lot through trial and error.Overall if you are looking for a challenging, story rich game similar to Fallout, then I would recommend this game. If you are still unsure then I would suggest downloading the demo before you decide. While only the first city is available there are numerous quests to undertake and many factions to join and the demo gives you a good feel of the game.			"

												I've been following this game for a few years, since the release of beta with first playable city, Teron. This is a really good example of RPG that manages to find balance between story and combat. The story is rich and compelling, while combat is deep and rewarding (though you may find loading quite often, lol)The replayability is also great, with different backgrounds out there, different weapons - you can be more talkative type, or more straightforward figther.All in all, highly recommended!

								I am not sure where the ""Classic RPG"" comments come from but as gamer that got his first computer back in 1980 and played the classics when they new, I would say the actual name this would have gotten back then is an Adventure game, only not a normal one because whilst it contains walls of text, it does also contain RPG elements. So its neither a classic RPG or a classic adventure game. But as with all games that contain walls of well written text, this game draws you in to the lore pretty quickly. But its not for everybody. If you like lore, like reading a lot, like the detail that only text can provide, you will like it. If you like the graphics to provide you with that detail at a glance, then perhaps not.Also I found the early access version seems to be just a demo, which is very off putting for me.Interesting title though, will earn some hard core followers i am sure of it but I do not believe I'll be one of them.

								A refreshing change of pace in the current RPG world. It all feels very real, very gritty. You're not some god-like superhero that's been bestowed power from the heavens, you're average Joe, and by the way, some guy just stole your wallet.It's tough to make it in this world, meaning you're going to be dying, reloading, restarting from scratch a lot, but that's what makes it so immersive. You truly feel as though you're apart of the world. You have to judge characters at a glance, take what people say with a grain of salt, and essentially play your cards perfectly in order to not be slaughtered like a pig.The game mechanics give off some oldschool vibes. Most of the story is text driven, and the import plot points of the world are hidden within text with a few random NPC's, or hidden behind certain dialog choices. The combat is turn based, and very unforgiving. You may find yourself cursing your character choices in the character creation and how you can't win any fights because of it, but sometimes that's just how the game plays. It's possible to participate in the whole game without being a proper fighter, but that also means taking a completely different route throughout the story. The fact of the matter is, you AREN'T a superhero, and you're not some master jack of all trades either. Your skills, your stats and your decisions with NPC's limit the available routes you can take throughout the game dramatically. They set you on a path that is hard to deviate from. If you weren't good at combat at the start of the game, chances are, you never will be and you better stick to your words. Some may view this as a detriment, but I find that it adds depth and weight to your actions. It also has a nice effect of adding replayability. There are many different ways to reach the end of the game, and I can safely say I've barely seen a quarter of them.All in all, I find that it's a great RPG. However if none of this sounds fun, then maybe the game isn't for you. I love it though, and I can't wait for the full release.			"

Early Access Review
								Let me start off by saying, do not get turned off by every ""this game is too hard"" and ""ive died more times than I have whined about dying"" comments, yes, combat may be slightly frustrating at times, but the game rarely forces you entirely into fighting situations, almost always are you offerred alternatives, persuasion/streetwise, and various other skills can be used to avoid armed confrontations, so, if you are a somewhat patient person and do not mind dying in the double digits over the course of an hour and/or can think for yourself, you will easily be able to figure out what skills to increase, clearly distinguish who you should speak to, who not to follow into obscure alleyways, and what jerk is ripe for an insult.Concerning the game itself, if you're looking for a purely historical RPG this is not it, BUT, if you are even the least bit interested IN history particularly the late Roman Empire, this game should very much intrigue you. The story so far is fantasitc, everything blends together so well, the characters are great, the dialogue in this game is outstanding, very much in excess but not without great writing for almost every conversation, I really cannot imagine what is to be added through future updates/when the fully completed game is released. The lore is somewhat interesting, if you are into RPG's with thick story and background information, especially concerning history,(term used lightly) magic and other fantasy elements, you should definitely find what you are looking for. I have read some bad reviews that regard the graphics of the game as subpar and unbearable so much as the game becomes ""unpleasant"" or whatever, and, if you do happen to be a person who upholds graphics above any other aspect within a game, then 1: You're an idiot & 2: you probably will not enjoy this game. I will admit that the graphics are not ""next gen"" but if you are not a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, it really should not be a deterrent from purchasing the game or even enjoying it. All in all it is a wonderful game filled with a variety of treats and sour moments, laughs and most definitely tears, but do not let the bad times bring you down, just, try not to read the death screens, they are really depressing and make you feel extremely insignificant.9/10			"

								A really original game amongst the rare hardcore RPG species. Age of Decadence gets rid of many problems plaguing the genre, like meaningless filler content and forced player character power fantasies. The game experience is condensed, but highly replayable and non-linear - you'll have to calculate your every step carefully and you never end up having to turn on that infamous ""meaningless activities mop-up auto-pilot mode"". Highly recommended for fellow ""Ironmen"", who have innate allergy to the ""load game"" button. The game is really unforgiving, be prepared to invest some time learning the ropes. The combat uses a fairly robust turn-based system, which offers enough variety, like aimed attacks and a well designed weapons/armor system, to keep things interesting. Encounter design is mostly great. Most of the time combat is entirely avoidable, actually I think you can finish the whole game without getting into fight, if you play your cards right. The pseudo-romanesque low-fantasy world is really well-though-out and original as is the story the game tells, and I can honestly say that I've never played a game with such a non-linear story design like in Age of Decadence. The amount of player agency is just staggering, and it proves how much dedication and love the developers have poured into this monster!Download and try the demo and see for yourself. I doubt you'll be disappointed.			"

								Get ready to die, a lot. Get ready to reload, even more often. Get ready to hoard XP until you firn the perfect use for it - and then die and reload again.AoD is not a pretty game - neither in the visuals, nor in the character. It's an intentionally bland, gritty and unforgiving setting, in which you are not The Chosen One, you have no Great Destiny, and elves, dwarves and wizards neither will help you, nor do they exist. Your enemies will not be All Powerful Demons, whom you will fight with Legendary Artifacts. Instead, most of the time, you'll be fighting thugs or beggars with sticks and stones.There is little XP to be had in the game, and it will not be enough to create the Charming Persuasive Warrior Mage Assassin you may know from contemporary titles. In fact, you'll need to hold on to evey XP point until you really, really need to raise a skill (of which there are plenty of, often used in combination). And even, then your Master Manipulator may get shanked by a smelly thief armed with a rusty metal spike. Your Fearless Gladiator can still get stoned to death by angry beggars. And so forth, and so forth. If you try to play this like you would play Dragon Age, your character will die within the first minutes of the game, no joke.The developers prepared dozens of death screens for your entertainment, and you'll see a great deal of them, even if you play the game right. The world of AoD doesn't warn you of impending doom, doesn't provide tool tips, doesn't highlight important characters and frankly, just doesn't care.If you're fine with all of the above, you may love the game, try it. If you're not, there are other titles you'll have fun with, try them. This is not everybody's cup of poison, as an example - myself. I've tried the game, understand what it tries to do, can appreciate it, but have left it behind.			"

								The Age of Decadence. Where do I even begin to describe this beast of a game? RPG's nowadays tout having choices. And consequences for said choices. You'll find that most of the times, they're fairly small and maybe not so imaginative and won't affect the story for the most part. Not in Age of Decadence! While you are still a player in an elaborate play, you are still capable of turning it on its head unlike a lot of other games today, and I speak from experience given my extensive run into the world of rpg's. Unlike most RPG's today, you can play as a""pacifist"" (I use quotes, because you will most likely be the cause of many a people's tragic ""accidents"" and ""mishaps"") That in itself in an achievement - you can go through the entirety of the game without ending a life personally and still come out on top. I yearn games which allow me to avoid killing my fellow men, even though it is encouraged or easier if I do so. Or, you can follow the path of a warrior and cut down anyone who thought it'd be smart to give a psycho a mean look. Another thing that is very notable about this game, is the almost absolute lack of morality! It's almost black comedy levels (I imagine that was the intent, but I digress). And it's glorius! Whereas in other games, you will be condemned utterly as the worst scum of humanity, or your meanie acts will be considered for the greater good. Not here! In order to make it, you got to be the baddest badass or the most cunning schemer to ever grace (or profane) the land, and exploit almost any opportunity that comes your way. As told to you by a warning whenever you start a new game -""Look out for yourself, because no one else will"". So grab your sword, or prepare your ink and pen, because you are in for a bumpy ride that might end up with you on top of things. Or at the bottom of a ditch after a brawl gone bad.			"

												One of the most excellent RPGs since the days of Fallout and Planescape: Torment. The days before dumbed down shooters became all the rage. A true must own for any hardcore RPG fan. Plot: The game is set in an alternate world, where a Roman-esque empire had mastered magic. The details have been lost to history, but apparently there was some sort of war that left the world in ruins. Now, hundreds of years later, modern leaders/robber barons have each set up their own little kingdoms and are vying for control over the remnants of the known world, like dogs over scraps. The game is well written and filled with ancient secrets, plots, and intrigue - which the player may either ignore or participate in, but it will affect the game regardless. Choosing to help someone be named Emperor could cause someone else to panic and make drastic decisions. Choosing to do nothing might allow certain factions to gain more control than they would have had you intervened. Everything is connected and each choice you make or don't make will probably have some repercussions down the line. It feels really good to make choices that matter and aren't just window dressing. Overall Gameplay: Gameplay in this game is LARGELY based upon which skills you pick and which choices you make. A stealthy assassin working for the assassin's guild is going to meet different people and fight different battles than the cunning grifter who gets by on lies and deception. The streetwise thief is less likely to be taken in by the lies of others than a gullible mercenary. Dialog itself might well be considered its own gameplay. Dialog is affected by your skills, but just because your skills give you an option doesn't mean that option is a generic ""win button"". In fact, different skills will open legitimately different paths and sometimes, a combination of skills are needed in order to achieve a certain outcome. The game has multiple endings depending on your choices, so it really is almost as if there are several different games worth of content - and odds are that you won't be able to see all the content in one play-through, so multiple play-throughs are both recommended and enjoyable. Combat: For those of you waiting for a hardcore turn-based RPG that doesn't pull its punches, the past decade and a half has been full of mixed blessings and downright disappointments. Fans of the original Fallout's gameplay were told that Fallout's combat was ""outdated"" and Fallout 3 became a yet another shooter with RPG elements. Even the as early as 1999 Baldur's Gate and the infinity engine games gave us real-time with pause gameplay in lieu of actual turn-based gameplay - again with the excuse that turn-based games just wouldn't sell. Well, not Age of Decadence. From day one they've stuck to making a turn-based game for turn-based enthusiasts and they have succeeded brilliantly. Combat is challenging, varied and - with the right skills and gameplay choices - completely optional. The game is single player, so it's similar to Fallout 1 & 2's turn-based gameplay - albeit with a variety of different moves and items you can use. For example, a fast attack will hit accurately, while a regular attack or a power attack will each do more damage, but be less likely to hit. You can attack multiple enemies at once with a whirlwind attack, or attack arms or legs to either trip your enemy or make them drop their weapon. Also, you can poison your weapons, use ranged weapons, throw nets, bombs or even acid. Different weapons have different options. A spear, for instance, can interrupt an enemy and hit him before he can approach you to attack. A dagger can strike faster and more often than a sword, but a big axe or a spear can strike diagonally. Because of these many options, combat can be just as much about good strategy as it is about stats. There are no trash mobs, no rooms full of random enemies whose sole purpose is to slow you down and make the game longer. Each combat encounter is hand-designed and comes about due to the choices the player makes. Were you tricked into following the wrong sort of person into a dark alley? Well, enjoy the fight. Did you murder an Imperial guardsman? Well, his friends are going to want some payback. Did you tell the leader of an enemy army to stick his head between his legs and kiss his own rear end? You get the picture. Overall I have to say I haven't played a game with this many choices and consequences in a long while. The fact that it has challenging combat is a welcome bonus, though many have said it's too hard. So the question is: should you buy this game? Well, if you want your hand held, want to be guaranteed success and don't like reading, I suggest you wait until you are a bit older. To the rest of us who remember an era before player characters would magically resurrect at the end of every battle, before quest compasses let us play the game on auto-pilot, before ""combat"" meant mashing buttons: I say, welcome home.

								Hello everybody, My name is Shaun Meyers and I'm the writer for a review and article website known as Universal Gaming Reviews. I've just finished writing my Early Access Previews article for The Age of Decadence and I figured I'd share it with those that are interested in the game. The game is set in a post apocolyptic setting based on the fall of the Roman Empire and features an excellent setting and great writing/back story. The game is still in active development though so there's still much to be improved upon and added and my article talks about the current features but many things may be subject to change. I'll be writing up a full review for the game in the future which I'm looking forward to. In it's current form though it's already looking to be a promosing turn based RPG and I've enjoyed the time I've spend with it already. Thanks for reading the article folks, happy gaming!You can read our full preview article here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/2013/12/early-access-previews-age-decadence/ "

												This game feels a bit jilted. While playing it, I love the concept of advancing through different scenarios different ways. However, I found that you are not really advancing based on how you play your are advancing based on your stats. There is a difference.My first play through, I am playing as a high charisma/persuasion character. In doing this, there is little choice I have in the overall story to progress. The game takes what stats you are proficient in and creates the illusion of choice. In truth, you can only succeed the way your stats go.Regarding that, the stats are all or nothing. You can't really pick and choose how to build your character, if you are a fighter you have to go all fighter or you get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you. If you are charisma, go all the way or you will flounder and fumble through the story.The game creates and illusion of choice, and over all the world seems pieced together rather than fluent and living.

								A pretty difficult game, still in its early stages of development so there are quite a few glitches and crashes. Despite this, it is a thrilling game which has a very steep learning curve. It drops you into the heart of a ""post-apocalyptic"" Roman Empire-like setting where combat is extremely difficult. Going up against an opponent with barely any armour and a dagger is often just as dangerous as a trained legionnaire. Don't let the combat difficulty get you down though, as there are often several ways to go through a quest/ mission			"

								In Iron Tower's defense, Age of Decadence never presents itself as anything other than a game for masochists. The very first screen shown for a new game boasts that it will kill your character over and over and over again. This is presumably meant to underscore the grimdark darkness of AoD's post-apocalyptic grimdark setting, in which there is only grimdark. Some do enjoy this; I'm just getting to find it tedious. After a dozen or so character deaths in the game's opening stretch it becomes impossible to care what decisions you make; pretty much every choice can and likely will end horribly, turning the game into a grind of trial and (fatal) error. The storyline and atmosphere are best described as black comedy, but without the comedy. There are no heroes, every major character you meet is a vile ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, yet the game seems to take itself quite deadly seriously even with nobody or nothing worth caring about. There are a variety of choices to make depending on your stats and skills, and the character system looks like it would offer considerable freedom and variety if you could slog through enough of the game to really develop your guy. There just isn't enough substance to justify the meatgrinder this game puts its players through.			"

												There are a lot of good reviews, i recommand this game but i'll put 3 stars out of 5Here is why:-Games crashes a lot, during loadings, or even in fight-There are few decisions to take, and if you don't have the right skill at the right moment you're ♥♥♥♥ed-Fights are well too hard, unbalanced: ok it's written in the game description you can't just play superman and kill everyone on your ownI have killed around 100 people with one character until now, and spending more than 2 hours to kill a group of 4 people because you lost HALF of your life in 1 turn, because of ONE critical strike-Skill points are not balanced compared to how much you need them for quests, and not enough quests-No freedom, you say what you are told to do and that's all, don't even think stealing houses you randomly see, or kill whoever you want, you will do as the game is done for-If you want to fight and kill everyone, you have to max the fighting skills and so you will not count on anything than strenght, dexterity constitution and body count else you will get ♥♥♥♥ed by every man you crossThe is the kind of game i'm looking for, but it's not ok yet, so damn much things to fix because it's SO frustrating			"

												I want to like this game. I really do. But I can't. It feels like a great idea that was poorly executed. In training they recommend that you avoid battles when possible but in doing so you avoid half the game. The battle system itself is awful. A stone can dent steel armor but a small shield can easily turn away most blades. With a non combat character the game is boring and with a combat character I find myself fighting multitudes of enemies by myself. The so called diplomatic options suck. The training arena is pretty fun but that's it.			"

								This is one of the funnest and most addicting games I have played in a very long time. If you liked fallout 1 or 2 you will likely love this game. If you played Bg2 on insane this is also probably the game for you.The difficulty is exceptionally high and getting started can be like hitting a wall. Combat is punishing. That being said you do not have to fight all the fights or like any fights if you choose a non combat route. If you play a mercenary in the imperial guard you will have some unavoidable encounters, but most will still be able to be circumvented  through alternate means. You can go through the game without killing anyone.It is a rpg is the true sense of the word; designed to deliver heavy firepower to distant targets, oh wait... I meant it is a role playing game in the true sense of the word. The amount of text is on the order of planescape torment and there are always tons of ways to solve every problem. You will constantly make dicisions in the game that will completely change the course of the game. The way you solve problems will affect a ridiculous number of things. You can backstab, lie, cheat, and steal and when you do and the people you screwed over find out, they will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ You can play pretty much any role you would like within the game, but it is not the type of game where you become a god, swatting away flies, destroying omega weapon and saving the world from the evil sorceress Edea... etc.  The amount of different endings is larger than can be conveniently counted.The combat system is exceptionally complex, but simple to start. Gameplay is intuitive but punishing. When i first played this game back in the demo it took me a lot of character recreations and liek 2 hours to just get passed te first quest as a mercenary, because I insisted on fighting out both of the fights. There were other options and those other options were equally rewarding but i wanted to play the hero and whoop♥♥♥♥♥ Playing the game like that is doable but difficult. You can play a combat hero and slaughter everything but the skill floor to start out is very high and it isn't really what the game is about.If the things i have said make it sound like a fun game to you will probably love it. It is fairly short if you ignore sidequests and such short but the replayability is very high because the actual size of the game is immense; you will find yourself rolling up new characters to do things you couldn't do the first time through. You will not touch even 10% of the game your first playthrough the mutability of each plathrough is just that extreme.			"

								Reminds me of Fallout 2 in all the best ways.  The writing for the dialogue as well narration is excellent; darkly humorous and vibrantly descriptive.  See any of the ""death"" pages for an example.  If I have any complaints, it's only three.1) CompanionsI get lonely.  2) Active skills and NPC participationI would like to be able to pickpocket NPC's at will, place burning vials in their pockets, etc.  The gameworld sometimes feels static due to the lack of options for interaction.  Maybe I am spoiled and think being able to talk to EVERYONE or loot any homes on a whim is the norm.  On that note, more loot sprinkled about the world would be nice.3) CraftingIt would be nice to be able to customize gear with your crafting skills.  If I already have a sword or suit of armor; why can't I just improve it as opposed to having to craft a new item in order to add traits (like balanced or masterwork)But that's really it.  Keep up the good work, I can't wait for the finished product.  I hope it does well enough that you can keep producing nostalgia fixes for us who miss when RPG's were driven by story before all else.  Oh, and I love the Glen Cook quote before the title screen; you classy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.8/10 would bang.			"

								If you like Fallout 1&2 and Arcanum this game is must have. It is really all I love about RPGs in one package.Pluses: + Very good Post-apocalyptic setting.+ Many ways to advance character+ Quests and side-quests are unique and very good plot-wise. No ""grind 10 sculls from monsters"" or ""collect 10 shards"" approach.+ Believable world full of conspiracies and betrayals+ Variety of fractions with different questlines+ Always few ways to finish quest, sometimes chance to turn on your guild and change allegiance+ Hardcore turn-based fights. Some of them is doable but side-quest battles may be very hard and even undoable for some characters.+ All fights are customised and not random.+ Many branches of quests - you cannot finish them all in one gameplay. You see only part of grand schemes.+ High replayability. Game is very different if you change type of character and fraction. Minuses:- It is really may be minus to someone but it is really hardcore. Fights are hard and non-casual. - You cannot make character and see all content for one playthrough. You just can't have so much SkillPoints to do it + plot wise some branches incompatible- Game graphics not very good. Not very bad either. (it is minus if you want only looks from the game)			"

												I couldn't make it though the first quest I got it was so riggid and bland. I don't want to say what an RPG should be but this is just poor gamedesign. The begining of an RPG is supposed to be the strongest point hooking you into the lore and the rest of the journey. Instead I had to fight vastly higher leveled units or leave an old man to be beaten to death. No other option, no ""fly you fool I'll hold them off"" or reasoning. I got the feeling it was to introduce you into the cold hard world where you can't hope to win the 'right' way but it just further drove home everyone's else complaint in the game; play the way the devs wanted or lose.

								I highly recommend this game. I have played through a 'dialogue' thief and a 'combat' assassin. All the previous reviewers are correct: combat is very tough and realistic. It takes a long while to get the hang of it. Even if you are skilled appropriately, you will still need to use intelligent tactics to take out your opponents. I particularly like that even on a ""combat"" route as opposed to a ""dialogue"" route, the game is equally enjoyable. That is very rare in an RPG these days and shows a lot of promise for the final version.A major con is that there are many, many bugs in this early access demo and it has crashed more times than I can count. But that is to be expected from early access versions and I can live with it given the very interesting story, quests and combat. I consider my 25 bucks well spent and look forward immensely to the next update.			"

								Age of Decadence fills a nice niche inbetween the action rpgs of today and the old-school rpgs like that of Baldur's gate admirably. The combat system feels really natural for a turn-basedlite system, one can easily get a good feel for the dos and don't of the system within hours. The graphics in the game aren't the best but they are still great, there are some genuine moments of awe when you first enter certain areas or ♥♥♥♥ up certain areas with your dumb actions. Obviously though, the story is one of the strongest points of Age of Decadence. A bit too linear for my tasts but nonetheless, the story accounts for what seems like hundreds of variables and is filled with rich side-quests that actually aren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Vince and the others have consistenly pumped out story updates, bug fixes, and other patches over the course of the game's development with no sign of stopping anytime soon.

								Note: Game isn't fully released yet. Personal Rating: 8/10Replayability: HighBudget: Worth it. Length: The currently released areas, which isn't the full game, takes at least a few days to play through if you already know how to play successfully. This is the kind of game you restart several times. Age of Decadence is a snap-back to the old-school roleplaying games like Planescape: Torment and Baldur's Gate.. Litterally. The only truly bad feature about this game, is that graphics wise, and also to an extent gameplay wise, the game is outdated by at least a decade.For those who still enjoy such games, this is a must-have title.  It features origin stories and various opportunities in the game depending on what story you chose. Set in a strange fantasy setting that can be a little difficult to understand at first, exploring this setting and trying to get the full picture is half the fun of this game. Exploration, roleplaying and choices. In this game, you do not HAVE to fight (at least, I don't think so), but if you play a character who can't, save often. Being smart and being socially adept are much more important and rewarding features in this game than being a god of war, but being unable to defend yourself in this game (or just a poor fighter in general) means having to play it VERY smart. The game has incredibly good dialogue, but as it's still in production, don't expect everything to be perfect yet. Occasionally. I was captivated by this game for many weeks, and I'm very much looking forward to the full release.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but it's just.....not good. I'm a big fan of story based old school RPG's that you can talk your way through like Planescape, Fallout, etc, but this just isn't even close. It feels soulless. Towns feel dead. The story is mediocre and falls into the bad fantasy writing trap of thinking ""making up a bunch of details is the same thing as making a world, right?"" No. You can make 3 houses and tell me that they're bickering and write paragraphs of boring history, but unless you can make it *feel* like a world it's useless. You walk around boring bland locations that use about three different colours. Personal taste I guess, but this stuff is just totally unmemorable and mediocre.Combat is embarassingly bad. It's just not an interesting system.The game succeeds at giving you tons of options. It's just that all of them are boring. "

One of the possible playthroughs is super violent, you have to kill almost all of the city guard.And now comes the ugly part of combat. If you like hardcore- you'll love the combat. If not, well... you have to spend your skill points veeery carefully or you're in trouble. But, as I've said, there's a non-violent path of silver tongue. And through dialogs you can find out a lot about the world. The very interesting, post apocalyptic world, the Empire, which didn't survive the magic wars.As to overall rating... There's a demo for the game. I'd suggest you try it! "

								So here is the 20+ Euro worth AoD: 'no worries, it's going to be fully done some time soon in 201X'...It's darn short by any standards. That seems so till you realise that each faction has it own story & agenda, and it's not just like choosing the flavour for an ice-cream (that is, the cases when it doesn't matter what guild's tattoo you are wearing, you are expected to do the exact same things anyway), here even when going trough the same faction's story again with a differently built char you will find out, much too your own disbelief, that you missed out quite a few more alternative progression paths... and just when you think you've got a good grasp on the workings of politics & intrigues of the world you are visiting you get slammed by bits of 'ingame mythology' telling of demons, angels and the great magic of ages past... yet not all men are created equal, where one sees magic and all powerfull creatures other sees but applied knowledge and a firm grasp of advanced technology... all the while most people around them neither see nor question anything and just choose to 'blindly believe', after all faith is all that's needed for their salvation...Then come the superb graphics and attention to details: the game is 'chock-full' of absent art banners and an occasional missing inventory item icon but beyond all that you still have to take a bow to the artist(s?!)' amazing rendering of armours & weapons; fluid combat animations, not to mention the surprisingly well done rendering of roman & eastern architecture you will often encounter...Oh, have I mentioned the awesome TBS combat mechanics - if you don't know what that means then perhaps you aren't the target audience for this game... (take no offence 'if we all liked the same things this world would be a really small place and the 2 of us would be 2 very busy people'), along with the possibility of crafting your own weapons & armours (yeah, that's way more then just cosmetic and generic choices) and alchemy (of course there are even shroom based mixtures alongside poisons, liquid fire & black powder goodies)... Long story short, you need to see it all to believe it. As if you could see it all... just about any new patch brings more content, balancing tweaks and pokes the fan base for input regarding a new combat mechanic or tweak they would like to implement in the near future.So, is it done yet?! What's the ETA, guys?! Will we get it before the Easter bunny does?! Stop asking already and just come play it (there's quite enough content already to keep you busy for ages!) Who knows, you may end up liking it enough to play it for long-long time after 'it's done' and, like myself, never regret purchasing it (you do know there's a free demo just for you?!) It's special: a full featured first town... no holds barred, just a whole lot of opportunities... at least for those around you...			"

								Age of Decadence is real treat for any fan of the RPG genre. For those who enjoy combat, AoD contains a robust, challenging, turn-based system that accommodates multiple styles of play, and avoids trash encounters. If you would rather play a non-combatant, that option is supported too, as AoD integrates quest solutions into its detailed, well written, branching dialogues and text-based encounters. On top of providing strong supporting systems, AoD includes the most complex and nuanced plot in a video game to date, and you will be shocked by just how much you can influence the story. Overall, AoD shines in many areas, from its tactical combat and intricate lore to the premiere writing and unparalleled plot structure. I have played many great RPGs, modern and old, and I can say without a doubt that Age of Decadence is the best so far.			"

												I make dude with good spear use and good dodge. He bad♥♥♥♥♥ With his help Cado steals 50 000 euros from local government. We have to get gold out of city. We kill many mobs of useless poor people, then we kill two trained guards at the gate. But there is crossbowman up on wall. I go get him, get hit a bunch but buddies follow me. With their help we kill the crossbowman. I rejoice and steal his 5 yen. then i go to stairs to leave to next part... Cant leave because buddies are in the way. I cant talk to them... I cant move them... I come to the conclusion that this is where I will die.9/10 would starve by allies again.			"

												Seems you have to restart over and over, each time optimizing your skill points each time a little more to get a little farther. Kinda lame.Edit: I am sure that is true, but with the liberal use of noob-traps and other cheapy pitfalls i cant say this is worth it.			"

												Fail a skill check (and you will always fail some no matter how many times you try it) and a plot comes to a juddering halt. No alternative approach to it, just you failed. I'm at an impasse on 5 different plots in the first town. None of them can advance no matter what I do. My only option left is to head to the capital and the game tells me that all my outstanding plots will resolve without me. Call that fun because I don't. An exercise in frustration. Positive reviews promised so much more. Maybe their expectations were lower than mine. Not worth it, even on sale.			"

												It’s not that this game don’t have its merits, I see many things in its core that I really like.It reminds me from the time I would play actual RPG with my friends, where role play mattered and the story and decisions were key to the game. This game brings a bit of that feeling back, which lacks in almost all computer RPGs.Unfortunately it reminds also the games we played under a mean (normally unexperienced) GM, which confuses punishing with challenging, and scrapping meagre XP with accomplishment.In my play through AoD with a cleaver silver tong scammer girl, I thought I could talk my way through anything, and it actually feels like it in some moments. Soon I started to see myself forced to learn lore and crafting, as apparently talking someone else to do her bidding didn’t occur to her, but I like mages and realise my hopes are just too high for a game... so OK.At this point all was well, my cleaver manipulator with the knowledge of an evil genius would cross through spike pits as gentlemen would offer their own body for her to step on to protect the lady (in my imagination, as this doesn’t really happens in the game).The first sign of trouble came with a particular fiscal feat that would require diving in putrid water. Apparently my clever Alexa Luthor would do this for a questionable man that asked. I went with the story and as it’s reasonable to expect her physical traits fell a bit short. I thought to myself “why suddenly the best solution in her mind is to do it herself?” – Brick wall. This character won’t be able to get it done.Shortly after: another physical fit. While blinded by the “weather conditions” I couldn’t shake the feeling that this was more like a task for my minions… but hey, one cannot have everything, and she didn’t have the strength. – Brick wall.At this point I was already questioning allot of things and looking over the internet about those same challenges, and apparently consistently players with characters based on soft skills get very frustrated whit a series of brick walls were the story seems to need the warrior stereotype. I particularly like the posts of this fellow that would argue the only solution for his problem was counter intuitive for his character, and he could not get himself to do it: like killing the golden eggs hen. I sympathise with the same hen.Now I started looking more and more into it, and I realised the places I was looking forward to explore were locked, because somewhere 10+ game hours ago I choose the most significant option B over option A, and because of that the item for this thing that I didn’t even know existed never unlocked and never will. The dev offered an alternative, and if I only read the instructions over the internet and ignore my character’s story which I’ve been developing over all this time, I can still get through one or two of the many brick walls.I see people saying things like: “This is a hard game, that’s why.” and “You cannot reasonably expect that any person with any set of skills can do everything.”Well my friend, breaking rocks with a pickaxe is hard, and you don’t see people running to do it because it’s fun. Challenge is fun, when people are given the opportunity to overcome and are rewarded for that.What is the challenge of a role playing game? To play the role through tough decisions.This game has it sometimes, but other times it breaks it.Regarding the second claim, that not everyone can do everything… well, obviously! That’s why most people buy their cheese at the supermarket other than make it in an old bath in the backyard shaft, and that’s also why a master manipulator with deep pockets gets people to do their bidding, instead of taking (and failing) the physical challenges themselves.I have to mention that the most annoying thing about this game for me is the continuous claim that if you fight people, you should expect to lose. That the real world is brutal, and the odds are against you. Well, truth is that from my perspective in the game characters specialised in combat get the best rewards and bit all most significant challenges. Check the Steam achievements and you’ll find encouragement to the player to fight and kill everyone in a particular town… a town with two military factions full of soldiers. WTF?!To be fair, the standards the devs are trying to hold themselves to is something very rare to be seen. The last I remember Fallout and Fallout 2 did it well some 20 years ago, and I'm still waiting to see it happening again.If you are willing to endure poor graphics and text boxes, I recommend Neverwinter Nights or Knight of the Old Republic, it’s more fun than AoE.

Posted: November 30, 2015
												I want to recommend and like Age of Decadence... I really do.But this game has issues. I do not just mean that it has bugs, though it has those. Its issues are... How best to describe it? Alright... If you like Indie games (and if you don't, you definitely won't like AoD any way, so why even bother looking at reviews for it?) you know that every indie game has some rough edges where you're slightly disappointed at how a little more effort could have made it good, but that you're willing to tolerate because the rest of the game is good and the developer doesn't have a huge budget to work out every kink.AoD is a game comprised of nothing but those rough edges and that can get really grating. Especially if you've followed the development of this game from the start and know that the reason for this isn't so much lack of budget (though there was never much of a budget) or lack of talent (Vince and co.  are certainly talented) or even bad engine design (Dead State uses the same engine and uses it much better), but simply the fact that with every one of these issues the developers went 'it's good enough for now, we'll smooth it out later' only to never go back and do that because they were busy with the next part.That doesn't make it a bad game... Just a very rough gem that never ended up getting the polish it needed (and won't in the future). If you're the kind of person who doesn't get a constant sense of 'this could have been better with just a bit more work' or if you're able to enjoy games despite it, AoD is worth getting. If, like me, you're even more bothered by it than the average person, though, avoid this game and the frustration it brings.At the request of several commenters, here are some examples:The writing is often far more verbose than needed, while at other times lacking relevant details.Dialogue options come with heavy consequences without actually having any indication what those consequences are going to be. (""Come into my shop."" ""Sure"" *start inescapable combat that's not winnable for a non-combat built character*)Equipment isn't balanced. (fully half the armour in the early game doesn't offer enough protection to balance out its penalties and with the exception of throwing weapons, only one or two weapon types per weapon group are worth using)Location maps frequently only bare a token resemblance to the actual location and navigating locations at the hand of the map is a daunting prospect.Various conversation bugs (or else design flaws) such as the conversation with the group of refugees at the gate not allowing you to talk to gate guards again.Various animation glitches, such as an npc moving and attack whilst still in the 'getting choked by a bola' animation.Mouse develops a mind of its own when not in fullscreen on a 16:10 monitor.But don't take my word for it: Play the demo. It's a good representation of the game as a whole and all its flaws are not just there because it's a demo. Ask yourself if you enjoyed it enough to be willing to go through 20 hours of that. If you are, buy AoD, if you're not, don't.(Not that it matters that I editted this, because I've noticed the number of 'helpful/not helpful' votes negative reviews for this game get. Seriously, there's negative reviews with 100+ people finding it helpful, the highest voted positive reviews have, what? Less than 30 'helpful' votes, good job gaming the system to keep all negative user reviews off the store page AoD fans. The fact that this is intentional isn't helped by several thread in AoD's Steam discussion forum actively reminding people to do this.).			"

												Terrible writing, the dialog read like an eighth grader wrote it. I thought that it was cute the way the game goes to extraordinary length to stress to you that you really need to avoid confrontations if possible, and then drops a mandatory fight right out of the gate during an early quest. Interesting idea, but this game definitely feels like an anachronism of game design; the sort of thing I'd have expected from a bargain bin in the early 90s.			"

												I want to like this game because it's obvious that a lot of work went into it without having access to much in the way of budget. The writing is entertaining, there's ample and well thought out lore that feels immediately relevant, and there's a plethora of dialogue trees and questlines promoting replay. Also, the setting is really intriguing and unique, and making combat inherently risky and more ""real"" while offering non-combat choices is a refreshing approach. That said, the graphics are dated. While the sprites are very well done (the portrait art is some of the best I've seen, full stop) the character models are primitive. I'm not sure how much of that is a limitation of the engine, but I've seen other games using the same engine address that limitation through creative artistic design choices. Though the writing itself is strong, the storytelling left me a bit cold. If an RPG isn't going to motivate the player by pushing them to level stats or find bigger and better loot, then it has to pull them along by engaging their sympathies with the main character. That never happened for me. It still felt like I was just walking around clicking on things and talking to people because that's how the game moves forward, not because I was motivated to progress along a quest line or for any particular roleplaying purposes. Finally, and this is the thing that made me give up on the game, there are too many false choices in a game that prides itself on the strength of its dialogue. Many if not most of the conversations felt more like traps than actual role playing, reminiscient of the old ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books. They boiled down to, ""You see a knife. Do you a.) try to eat it, or b.) stab yourself."" Without giving specific examples (to avoid spoilers) one that stands out results in either betraying the person you offered to help or having to fight an angry mob. As a persuasive, streetwise, charismatic trader I oddly never had the option to negotiate, an option I felt wasn't unreasonable to expect and which was my intention when I began the dialogue. I finally ended up simply avoiding the encounter, a choice I found myself having to make too many times through the game. The alternative, which I also exercised fairly often, was reloading until I found the right sequence of responses to progress. As I say, I want to enjoy the game, but, frankly, there are too many other RPGs that have addressed the shortcomings here without being excessively ""casual"".  "

								Hard, rewarding, and mass replayablity make this one of the few early access games I can enjoy for hours a day and still have much and more to do. Money over shadows morals and action gains reactions no matter what you do. Every update has me coming back for more and when it is finished I would gladly buy it again.

												Terrible performance on a rig that eats The Witcher 3 on Ultra at 1440p for breakfast (this game is dropping in to low 20s FPS wise on Low settings) while looking like a game from the early 2000s.Overall the game is a bit dull and the story doesn't seem to be that interesting. The combat is purely stats based, so if you didn't balance the character perfectly - tough. The combat itself mainly consists of stabbing, then moving back a bit, then stabbing again once your opponent catches up. Maybe throw some things while you are at it.It's serviceable, but it's not even close to the new XCOM games when it comes to fun and engagement, and the new XCOM games are rather simplistic when it comes to tactical RPGs. If anyone wants a good RPG, I'd rather suggest people picked up the Shadowrun Series, Torment: Tides of Numenera, Pillars of Eternity (though that one might be a bit dull for some), Underrail and The Witcher. Some people may enjoy this game, but I am quite thankful that I got a refund for this.			"

								The ultimate choices and consequences game, where decisions made durring character creation and harmless conversations can come back to haunt you, or mug you, or you will just get plain murdered by bandits.There is a lot of freedom in making a character and choosing a style of play, be it simple warrior, snakey assassin or maybe even fat merchant. Quests, lore and story are all nice, nothing wonderful but the writing is solid. Graphics are not the best but are at a level that matches the style of the game, simplistic but detailed while not being all flashy and a drain on systems. Combat is fun but a tad hard, but it kinda adds a better feel to the game as you have to stuggle hard to survive in this harsh, brutal and extremely frustrating world. I'd give it a 8/10.			"

Early Access Review
								This freaking game... I used to think that I was capable of doing what needed to be done in these sorts of games to at least get through each encounter, even if battered and bruised, but to survive to fight another day... I read the reviews beforehand, I thought these were much the same as those for similar games I've completed with just a little bit of forethought, and I thought that maybe I could make it through most of the game without batting an eyelid... Boy, was I wrong...You cannot be a jack of all trades and master of none and still hope that your skills will get you through. You cannot hope on blind luck that maybe, just maybe, those guards in the distance will somehow not notice your presence and leave you to your own devices... You cannot enter a potential conflict and think that you'll then be able to talk your way out of it, or that there'll be some saving grace or guardian angel to prevent your inevitable demise... This game is unforgiving... You are useless... You are as if you (yes, you, in the real world sitting there reading this) decided that you would step away from your computer for a few minutes, pick up a dagger, sword, etc., and try to take over the world...You are not a god. You are not a champion. You are not even in the running to make the finals of a computer game tournament. You are useless: a random person with no particular ability to do anything, trying to make something of themselves in a world where only the strong can become recognised, and the weak do anything to please so they don't offend those in power. You could simply take up a trade, hoping that taxes don't increase too much, your lord won't restrict the rights bestowed upon you for being their loyal citizen, and, above all, that your city won't be raided by a more powerful army where you'll likely need to forego many of the ""luxuries"" that you've become used to living in an established settlement. You could do this, but where's the fun in that? If that sort of life suits you, try a real life simulator. If you want to be a god, try any other RPG.If not, and you really want to work (and I really do mean work) towards achieving all that you feel is entitled to you, then, perhaps, this game is for you. You won't be able to finish all the tasks put to you. You won't even finish half (I've yet to try the ""god mode"" listed in the guides, but it seems that this will restrict the story you develop.) My only suggestion (after numerous failed attempts at living in this unforgiving world) is to focus your development on the character choice you make in the beginning. I've yet to determine if this method will be successful in all situations, because even the most eloquent of speakers runs into trouble in this game, but it seems to be your best bet if you truly wish to survive.Put simply, you will die... Many times... And often at the most inopportune moment... But... To succeed in these situations makes it all the more worth it. A fantastic game, and a credit to the developers. Your survival is up to you. Your life is yours to lose. The question is, are you willing to risk making that sacrifice?			"

This game really makes you wrack your brain at times thinking of alternate solutions to an inevitable confrontation.  The environment this game creates is that of a desperate post apocalypic world plagued by poverty and political conspiracies that sort of looks and feels like the downfall of the Roman Empire.  The best thing about this game is that it's made for a very particular gamer - there are no shortcuts and this game aims to kill you every step of the way.  Being prepared pays off.

												Sigh.... This game is a great concept but the creator made this game painstakingling hard. You'll spend your whole day re-loading every mistake you made to perform a better outcome. I tried really really hard to adapt to the impossible difficulty setting to this game. I mean you have one character and in fights you're mainly by yourself vs 4 or more enemies. in addition your hit chance is against you while the enemies are more than likely going to hit you. Sure you can increase your stats but if you spend your stats unwisely you positive adavancement decreases exponentially. I spent several days trying to perfect thief and it just doesnt work... Crossbow lvl 4 sneak steal lockpick all lvl 4 Dodge lvl 4 and I still cant get past beginning areas whether the skill challenge is too high or im out numbered and I do♥♥♥♥♥♥for damage or I cant hit♥♥♥♥♥♥ I really really wanted to like this game. I bought it for early access and was hoping the creator's would make some minor changes to ease the difficulty from impossible to hard at least but they didnt.  Sorry for the bad review, but you can't make game impossible to beat. Im the type of person that must do everything and complete it. If I can't complete a mission after I tried ALL options avalible game was made to difficult.			"

												This game is bone-jarringly terrible and it's not what it claims to be.There is no meaningful amount of freedom in this game.  You're allowed a few starting choices such as which guild you want to start with and which faction you want to ally with.  From there, you're often railroaded through scenes without even the illusion of choice.  For example, I wanted to play a persuasive assassin for my first play-through.  A rogue who uses poison and guile to perform their vile tasks.  No, that's not possible.  Spoiler alert: you're going to kill your first mark with a crossbow whether you like it or not.From there you'll notice the terrible writing.  It's awful.  The content is like something from a Jerry Springer script.  Which is disappointing, because story was advertised as one of the highlights of this game.  For example, certain NPCs swear because this world is 'edgy'.  That would be fine, but for two reasons.  1) They swear like they're disgruntled teenagers from the modern world.  The language used and the way it's presented clash with the setting.  2) The profanity is a placeholder for actual content.  I have absolutely no idea why half of these people are swearing so much because there's nothing in the script illustrating why they feel the way they do.The combat is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  It's dull.  Simply not good.  There's no dynamism.  You select from a lame, text-based menu which attack you'd like to perform, then you run away.  You keep doing this until one side dies.  And yes, the combat is balanced to present you with a fair chance of dying.  But it's not difficult because it takes skill.  It takes no skill.  It simply requires you to have built your character to be a combat character.  If you're not a combat character, you're simply going to die if you get into combat.  There's no way to talk your way out of it, either, once you're in it.  And some setups throw you into combat with no warning.  It's punishing, but not at all made with any sort of an eye for gameplay.Without freedom of choice, a good story or good combat, I find there's just no reason to play this game.  Which makes me very curious about all the positive reviews it's received.  If you look at the negative reviews, the majority of them seem fairly well-written.  However, they're heavily downvoted.  All of them.  And all of the positive reviews are heavily upvoted.  To me, this says that these guys either have a rabid fan base, or they're paying for positive reviews and favorable up/down-votes.  Either way, it feels like there's some seriously dirty false advertising going on.			"

												Been playing this a while now and I have been impressed I am usually not very into this type of game but this one has been refreshing....however I have been plagued with several memory errors CTD's.  It's ashame because I like the game but it's just not as stable as I would like.  I have a pretty high tolerance for bugs and the occasional crash....but it's just too often for this game so I have to not recommend at this time...maybe with more development and support it will get better			"

												I don't know... something just seems a little off about the balancing of the game and its linear narrative. Let's take a look:The game isn't actually hard (much to every other reviewers chagrin). Instead, you have to be crafty and calculating. The game forces you into a Game of Thrones-esque universe. It would be sort of fun if you were given multiple ways to handle situations. I like to play RPGs as myself - what decisions would I make in a given situation? But before you have any options, the game forces your character into murderous plots filled with espionage and crooked politics. Once you accept that you'll make Cersei Lannister look like a saint, the game becomes a bit more fun. However, the linear gameplay is somewhat of a bore. ""But Nothing!"" another fan says, ""how is this game linear with 7 different factions to join/help!"" It's linear because you DON'T have 7 different factions to join. You pick one at the beginning of the game, and then you're stuck on-rails to do their bidding. If you fail, there are a small handful of quests that you can do, but they're seemingly inconsequential, or they benefit only one faction. In other words, the game dictates what you do and how you do it, limiting choice. Choice is further limited by the situations and encounters you have. Since the story is linear and you have only one faction to truly be apart of, your ""choices"" come down to how you kill someone or advance yourself/your organization. Do you bring some extra muscle and do it yourself? Or do you cleverly convince a group of assassins to do it for you? Either way, that one person is going to die with little to no consequence as to how he dies. Finally, there is the problem of balancing. This is indirectly related to choice because you have to know exactly what skills to invest in at the beginning of the game based upon the faction you chose. Otherwise you'll find yourself at a critical juncture without the necessary skills to progress. Do you die at this point? Can you reload to reinvest your skills at an earlier save? No. The game just sort of awkwardly stops. It would  be nice if you could try something else. Think of it as a ""boss fight"", only instead of swords, you fight with words and perhaps a clever diplomatic approach will win the day. But no, you're either given one choice, or both choices involve skill sets that maybe you didn't develop all the way. You'd literally have to restart the ENTIRE GAME just to have another chance at it. That's not fun. It's frustrating. This isn't Dark Souls or some other Rouge-Like, where half the fun in the game is in the mere combat/progression, while the other half might be in a narrative arch. This is a game that is almost purely a narrative, with little to no variation in the story based on your choices (except the all-important choice of which House/Guild you work for at the beginning) - it is nothing but an unnecessary chore to have to replay different segments of the game AGAIN just because the developer made a problem insurmountable. That's not ""hard"". It's just obnoxious. So, I can't recommend this game. I definitely would love more games to put less emphasis on combat and more emphasis on diplomacy, but I don't want choice and consequence sacrificed as a result. This is nothing more than a novel as far as I'm concerned. Is the story good? Yes. Does the player have any agency in it? No.			"

												Challenging games are fun as long as there is something compelling to make you go on. This game is just frustrating. So much for roleplaying when there are not enough viable non-combat options in a game that discourages combat. Either you save-scum, use a guide, or hoard your skill points to get through whatever multiple-skill checkpoint/item requirement that will prevent you from starting all over. Specializing is a good option for very few viable builds. Along with the bad graphics, it's just not worth it.			"

Early Access Review
								I confess I was caught by the trailer. The first two sentences are sufficient to show that AoD is not the traditional RPG where god-like characters roam over a Manichaean world. Fortunately the trailer isn’t the best part of the game (bet you can recall some games that it is), and AoD is not the traditional RPG in many other ways.  First, the game is realistic: No matter who you are or the sword you have, you can die miserably just by being outnumbered by a common gang. Words have consequences, so being careless with dialogues is not an option (unless you like to reload the game every five minutes).  Think that you will solve problems just by reloading and waiting for a lucky roll of dices? Forget it; there is no place for lucky ones: your success is determined just by skill and ability.  So if you don´t plan and think you will be stuck. Talking about planning and thinking, a curious thing about the game is that it is so unforgiving that in a certain point you start metagaming to survive. You stop distributing your skill points according to your preferences waiting for what the game will require you to do. You save your skill points because maybe you have to use your persuasion or streetswise when you turn the corner, or maybe you have to sneak to avoid an undefeatable enemy. In most games, all this metagaming would be a bad thing, but in AoD it is a plus, since it is a challenge in itself. Second, AoD developers seem to have made a decision of cutting off any filler content. That simply changed my perspective of traditional RPGs and made me see its many design vices. Remember those towns from Oblivion full of people completely irrelevant to the game? In AoD you don’t have to waste your time clicking in every person on the map. Only a few of them can dialogue with you. In addition, you don’t have rooms full of chests that contain only trinkets, encouraging the players to be lootmaniacs. When you find a chest, it is worthy to open. Third, you don’t have to waste your time on “FedEx quests” (to quote one of the developers) in which you waste absurd amounts of time running from A to B, B to A, etc. If a dialogue mentions you have to talk to somebody, there is an option of automatically going to the place where the person stands. The fact that some players were complaining that this “instantaneous teleport destroys immersion” says a lot about the state of things in RPG gaming nowadays. What does travelling per se adds to the content of a quest in which you have to talk to someone in an already visited place?  I guess what kills immersion is the time spent making repetitive things completely irrelevant to the content of the quest. Another innovation is in the writing. Each background leads you to a different quest, but all quests are related to the same events, so that each background makes you see the game in a different perspective.  The massacre of the imperial guards is a big thing from the perspective of an assassin, but it is just an unforeseen bonus in the chess game of the merchant’s guild. The reality of AoD has so many aspects and layers of profundity that gives replaying value another meaning.  One thing that is also worth mentioning is that there is a down to earth view of the world shared by most NPCs, even when the subject is the forgotten magic (and they will mock you if you make naïve questions). This is in stark contrast with the grandeur syndrome of most RPGs.   Those innovations are not mere improvements based on successful RPG games for PCs, they are in fact innovations of the very RPG genre in games, which is no small achievement. This game slaps in the face of those who think that RPGs are predestined to be silly teenage fantasies made by silly teenage-like adults. It is RPG in its purest and mature form.			"

												If you are in for the Ride and might take it several times from slightly different perspectices - go for it.If you are in for the end and the conclusion like me, if you want your actions to acutally matter and play a role for the world you chance, like me, - you might take a step back.At last that is how I see it.As for the mechanics:Content is gated by hard Attribute/Skill checks. You have them, you get it. This requires vast meta-knowsledge if you want to expierence at alot and quite some try-and-error that might unfold on you after you sped hours on yourplayhthrough. You must be ok with the idea on seeing it later on yet you might feel like missing someting essential.Combat is basic. Tere are options yet those are hardly worth it. Also the game does not scale. If you play a fighter character you get encouters that are for other classes entirely skipable or somewhat ""challenging"" due to skillpoints being in other talents. Yet for a fighter there is no challenge. You build your character right and you will kill everything and that means quite something. The different attack options are also not worth it. Just kill the dudes outright.Dialogues are quite like content and exploring; you have the required skill at a set level and get a choice or you dont. There is not much besides that and options that require these skills are mostly supperior and open up new options. Besides that dialogue is pretty basic. Infact you rarely get choices at all (without skill) so most of the dialogues are pretty much linear. You are in for the ride as I said it. You wont change much.Conclusion: The most important part of the game is the character creation. At this very point you decide what content you can see, access and beat. Dont spend your skill points and raise them as the content you encounter requires yet that does not work for skills. As for the story it may unfold its lore on you, but the more you know the less imporat your actions become and finaly the end is pretty much basic and unsatisfying.			"

Early Access Review
OverviewFirst off, everything in this review is my personal opinion and experience.  If your a casual gamer this game probably isn't for you.  Aside from having a rather non-interactive tutorial (except for the combat tutorial that is optional before you actually start the game) it also has a very steep learning curve.  Actually it's learning curve is nearly non-existent. ProsThis is the only game that I am aware of that combat is completly optional.  This allows you to get more involved in the story and character interactions.Combat isn't simple.  At the beginning of the game a one on one fight is about as much as you can handle.  If you end up against two people it's going to be a decent fight.  If you have to face three I hope you've saved recently because unless you have back-up (which you don't very often depending on your background) You're going to end up reloading.  This adds an element of difficulty that I feel is missing in many games.  You're never going to see a Dynasty Warrior's style hero slashing through 500 enemies in this game.ConsI've found that you pretty much need to play a combat character or a non-combat oriented character.  Trying to do a mix of the two is nearly impossible.  You'll find yourself in situations where you aren't skilled enough to talk your way out of a fight.  And then once you get into the fight you'll end up dying because you aren't strong enough to survive the fight that you weren't able to talk your way out of the game.  I list this as a con, but also find it to be one of the more entertaining aspects of the game.  Trying to strike a balance between a smooth talker and being able to keep yourself alive in a fight, or trying to figure out which non-combat skills your assassin needs to be able to get by without losing his edge and ability to take out his targets.Biggest flaw I've found in the game is that combat is extremely dependent on item use.  When properly applied a few nets and bolas can make an unbeatable fight a flawless victory.  SummaryOverall an enjoyable game.  Hopefully it will get some tweaks as it progresses and will improve into an even better game.			"

								A really(!) tough turn based cRPG. There is no hand holding, no popamole, no dragons around the first corner you kill with your super uber mega char in a split second. It is as old school as it gets. If you know the classics, played the Sir-Tech games on hard and love a fresh setting (low magic/demons, roman empire), then this really might be for you. There even is a demo (THAT oldschool), so try before you buy. After all it's Early Access, so it is not yet complete and it has bugs, even crashes (at least for me), but the devs are really a helpful bunch and I am sure they will turn this diamond in the rough into one of the true cRPG classics of our time (as if there are many).

								If you are a casual gamer who wants everything spoon fed to them whilst expecting to be the toughest son of ♥♥♥♥♥ in the entire world I suggest you look else where.This game is hard to begin with, I mean really hard, you will die over and over and sometimes you'll get confused about where your supposed to go or what your supposed to do. You will discover an awful lot about this game through simple trial and error, no single character is able to experience everything that this game has to offer in one play through and nor should it!! Too many games nowadays are watered down crap shipped out for the masses to enjoy without any real challenge, this game however breaks that trend and is a return to the way games should be made.... aimed at actual gamers who enjoy beating at game that is made solely to kick your♥♥♥♥♥Do not give up after dying the first 20 times, stick with it, tinker with your stats and see what works for you! You will feel a sense of accomplishment when it finally clicks and you are able to progress onto the next challenge in the game.The dev team from all i've read about the game seem to be really passionate about their product and are active on the forums, helping anyone and everyone who is struggling or has issues with the game. Great display from their team and one that you do not see much of nowadays with all the awful trash on the market.I highly recommend this game, if you are a real gamer who wants to use your brain to overcome to the challenges in a game, this game is definitely for you!!!

												It is one of the best RPGs I've ever played and that's including titles such as Fallout 1, Arcanum, Vampire The Masquarade: Bloodlines, Planescape Torment, Baldur's Gate 1/2, Betrayal at Krondor, Wasteland 1/2, etc. It's also the first cRPG in a decade that brought freshness to the genre, e.g. 1) Story being presented from different perspectives and different POVs. I don't remember anything like it in any other game which raises its value even further. Something fresh for a change instead of another ""chosen one rescuing the world and fighing the dragons"". I think it would appeal to all A Song of Ice and Fire saga (hopefully someone will tweet it to them :P). Sadly, many people will probably rage quit before they even notice that (or might be too stupid to notice that).    2) Combat. It actually is enjoyable and makes me want to fight instead of mindlessly left clicking on everything that moves (or sends something that moves). The challenge makes it rewarding once you win whereas in Fallout 1/2 you could have defeated almost anyone with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats and quick-save->quick-load strategy since even with 0% chance of hitting you could have done a critical hit (on the other hand you could have missed a target from point blank range when using a machine gun and having 95% chance of success). In AoD there isn't a universal strategy for every fight. E.g. when fighting a fast and agile opponent that had very high dodge stats using a smaller but faster weapon was more wise (as it should be). You would never hit him with a big hammer but you would hit him with a small one and since he was so agile thanks to practically no armour it was enough to defeat him. The same goes for spears - for the most time they are a superb weapon because of it's unique properties but there are fights where you're at a disadvantage (closed spaces for example). There are ways to overcome this but it's not like you can have only one weapon (like turbo plasma rifle in Fallout) and defeat every opponent with that. 3) Replayability and  Choices and Consequences. They actually do matter and you can never do every quest in every possible way without replaying the game. And that is a good thing IMO. In Fallout New Vegas for example I did practically every quest there was, investing in speech at first since I knew that I could open safes or hack into computers later. For some reason no one would do it before me. Well, not in AoD. If you won't do quests in Teron someone else will and you can't go back for them. Which makes sense and which makes me want to replay the game. I don't want to replay F:NV though since I've done everything there was to be done and walking for hours was tedious (BTW, that's why I like teleporting, although I won't make a point about it).    Anyway, it's really well written and it's not as unforgiving as some may think. In Maadoran for example I chose to be a stupid brute (read: mercenary) that worked for Thieves Guild. As it turned out because I've invested too many points in combat and not enough in lock picking/disguise and other thief skills (since I assumed I was a muscle for them, not Arsene Lupin) I couldn't do much at the end of Maadoran when Levir - the leader of the T guild there - asked me to. But that didn't ruin that much since I still had the option to go to Ganezzar. I expected to be executed or something like that but it wasn't the case (which again shows that writer actually thought what he was writing, trying to kill a killing machine wouldn't be the smartest move and in all honesty he had nothing to gain from that but a thing or two to lose). I haven't tried all the options available yet so I might be able to see a different outcome but my point is: you don't have to repeat the game from the start to enjoy it. The game despite being difficult, still gives a player a certain margin of error, big enough to not be frustrating.There are more pros (and I should write more on C&C) but I don't have the time right now to write about them. I prefer to play the game a few more times (read 10 at least :P). Once I do I'll write something more. As for cons, besides camera being a bit clunky I have none. And even that isn't that bad once you learn to use middle mouse button (which sometimes doesn't work for some reason and I have to use ctrl+mouse button).Edit:3) You're being guided what to invest in. If you're playing a merchant it's logical that you have to silver-tongued so you invest in speech skills such as streetwise, persuasion and trading. If you're playing as a Loremaster you invest in lore + speech skills, if you're playing as IG or assassin you obviously need comabt skills, etc. First quests show you what you'll need further. But to be honest it should be obvious what merchant or IG need. Goral Just now  Not true but since you haven't actually played the game it's no wonder. Looks like you've had the game opened for less than 2 hours for the sole purpose of baseless slating.1) Even if you fail some skill check you can continue the game easily, you just won't max your character and become a demi-god (which happens if you squeeze every SP from every quest). To me it's refreshing and a nice change when compared to Bethesda games for example where you can become a demi-god no matter what character you make and what decisions you make. 2) If 1 way is closed for you you can be sure that at least 3 more (with different skill requirements) are open. For example to get into an outpost you can either sneak in or kill the guards or impersonate a loremaster or poison the guards or just betray the lord who gave you this quest and switch sides.There isn't much randomness to combat in Age of Decadence. A very skilled player can even kill every possible opponent and win every fight without even 1 reload, i.e. he can play in ironman mode. See here: https://youtu.be/_9oCOPtF8VM?t=3sA beginner like you might think that fights are random and if you get unfavourable roll you have to reload. But once you grasp the rules and start using some basic tactics you can win every fight with at least 70% effectiveness (some like Eyestabber have that number much higher).

												I played this game in early access for a while. I liked it so much that I decided to stop playing so I could enjoy the full experience on release.I really enjoyed the game - for a while. The writing is good, and the uncovering of pre-war mysteries as a loremaster kept me hooked until the end. The first parts of the game are full of things to do and objects to interact with, but in the later stages, the game starts to feel really empty.Many of the maps, while beautifully crafted, have almost no interactive objects; it feels a bit like the devs rushed the last half of the game.

												This RPG is as ""indie"" as you can get. Empty, lifeless levels greet you at every turn as you navigate the story of the game. The game would be better off as a novel or a point and click adventure than what we got, as the writing is great, but pretty much every other aspect of the game is mediocre at best.I had to cheat in order to have an even marginally fun experience.

												Gave this one a shot but in the end, it's a pretty horrible game. - Graphics are terrible, no detail whatsoever. Enviroment feels very bland and fake. - Almost no envrioment interaction like lootables like chests, houses, or desks. Most places are empty with no interaction. 1 combat skill point per combat. Combat skills are upgraded a 5 point inrements. After your initial character build it might take 15 or 20 combat points to raise a combat level like ""daggers"", ""blocking"" or ""swords"".Bad dialog. They didn't even attempt to make it resemble the Roman era. Few dialog options. Very little to do. No much to explore, very few quests in a very small world with only a few zones. Since in combat you are nearly always going to go up against 4/1 odds you need to back yourself into a corner to limit the amount of enemeis able to hit you. Not always an option. If you leave Teron, the first location without completing certain quests, you lose the ability to complete them. You can go back to Teron but the quests are gone. With so few quests and so few combat points given from combat, losing quests and points because for going to another city just ruins that game. You're forced to reload an old save and try to take on 9 enemies against your one over and over and over until you've beaten it just so you don't lose the XP by completing a SHORT chain quest. Can't recommend, going to uninstall and never play this again. At least it was on sale and I got 20 hours out of it. Although much of that was idel/on pause.  "

								Spiritual successor to fallout in a creative, new, and thoroughly-worked setting of a low magic roman Game-of-Thrones kind of world. When people started saying replay value they meant games like this, that had completely different stories based on what you did or how you played, entirely different worlds populated with different characters and challenges that you solve in different ways. Replay value was never intended for♥♥♥♥♥♥like Angry Birds, it was intended for games like this. Play the demo. Create an actual character with a distinct way of solving problems, not just different dialogue choices, different faces, and different sexbot characters to woo. I don't know if you get it or not yet, but this is a REAL GAME. It's a game. It's hard to defeat, and it's fun as ♥♥♥♥. Play it, or don't, whatever. I already bought it after I hit the end of the demo and got mad that I couldn't continue. When's the last time that happened to you? Years ago. Same with me. So I bought it. It's the same game after buying it as it is before, but with more of itself for me to ♥♥♥♥ around in now. Finally, someone got it right. All of it. The design, the marketing, the actual game. It's good. Thanks for reading my review. I recommend this game.			"

								From what I've seen so far this game is awesome for classic rpg gamers. I'll update and finish this review when the games complete but I haven't been this interested in a game in a long time. Weird thing is I can't put my finger on it: there's just a large list of things that are ""right"" about this game. It's so incredibly challenging and you actually feel clever for succeeding at plots. I've played through the first 3 acts with 3 different characters something I rarely do in a game. looking forward to the finished product.... seriously stop sleeping and finish this game!			"

												As a very well written and interesting game.  I was quite dismayed to find so much cursing in it and also the way your choices decide your fate.  I would have liked to make a morale, kind and ethical individual but I couldn`t even by choices the character has an wicked heart no matter what you do, you will murder, steal or do all sorts of bad things even if what you`re doing seems right at the time the game will somehow twist your choice eventually to turn you into a very bad person whom is only out for their own power and prestige.  It just didn`t make me feel good after playing a couple of hours as I became a cursing, murderious, dishonest and wicked character as I progressed and those were with the somewhat good choices, so I thought at the time.  I am guessing though this is how the time would have been every man or woman for themselves and in that regard the devs developed it very well it`s a very awful time and world and the people are thus also been molded by their surroundings of suffering and hardship but even in the most harrowing of times the human spirit has always had hope and compassion for others otherwise we would not be here today but in this game their is none which is not realistic.If you like these kind of games, I recommend it but it would have been nice to have the barrier between what is good and what is wrong.  Because of this I just can`t recommend it.			"

								Brutal! If I had to use one word to sum up this game that would be the word I would use. Age of Decadence is an excellent RPG that has all the hallmarks of one of the classics. What puts it apart is not just the difficulty, but the approach. If you try and solve every problem with your sword you will die! Again, and again, and again. Political save and cunning are the only tools to surving this unforgiving world and combat is for once a last resort to dealing with the issues presented before you.			"

								The first time I played this game, I truly realised its difficulty. When I first chose to become a thief I never realised how much trial and error it takes before you even finish the first act. The game is difficult, not for new RPG players, I would recommend to people who want a real challenge in an RPG, not something that can be completed first time, but something that really makes you think of your actions and how it affects the world around you.To be honest when I first played this game I had my doubts, forced paths didn't seem all that amazing however after time I realised that this is what made the game a good RPG. It will take time for the developers to finish, I am willing to wait, however just remember that this game can be both surprising and challenging at every action you choose, may it be a peaceful, truthful approach or more of a tactful, down to earth approach, any class can be changed to any aspect, from a mighty merchant to a faithful thief. The options you have in this game is so immense, its replay value is outstanding, the amount of things I missed the first time really changed the game the second time through. From tricking an entire religion into believing you are the 'Chosen one', to saving a god trapped in eternal fog, killing anyone who enters it.From an honest review I would rate this a 8/10, its not the best RPG, but its one of the top in my books.

It's really nice how your character can be a powerful champion that everyone acknowledge but you don't really understand what's happening. Or being the baddest traitor but protecting your lord by following the wisest path. The combat is difficult and the game needs to save often. See it as an Oblivion game with the highest difficulty.

												From the reviews, I thought this might be a good game.  So it was on my list, and it came up for sale at a really good price.  I got it, and now I'm thinking I know why it was on sale.  Though it has some of the elements of D&D, it seems like a game that needs more work.  For example, I have a bow and 10 arrows, but while I can equup the bow, the game says there is no ammunition.  There is no place to put the ammo on the player.  So what is the point in having bow and skill in it, if you cannot even shoot the arrows?The map is cumbersome and difficult to navigate.  While the rotation speed is good, you have a hard time figuring out how to explore.  From dialogues, you learn that leaving the town is a bad idea because the air and water are contaminated and there are nasy raiders ""out there"".  I've only found about three things to do as a Rogue, and once those are done, there is no clue as to what to do next.  I'm still exploring the town, but have found almost nothing.I'd have to say the sale price was still too high for this game.			"

												This game is so dope.You're not the hero. You're not the chosen one. You're just some guy trying to make it in a harsh, unforgiving world where almost everyone is trying to rob you blind, scam you, or just kill you for no good reason.Combat is brutally difficult. In the beginning, you'll have trouble taking on a single two-bit thug - and even when you become a real badass, taking on two or three soldiers at once is still pretty damn hard. It feels realistic and satisfying.The writing is good and I didn't make it far into the main story, I like the Roman-esque setting and a lot of the decisions have harsh consequences.			"

								Age of Decadence is a very hard game especially for melee warriors.I have started the game with a Loremaster (but the stats were customized as 4/4/4/8/10/10) as I understood beforehand that melee is not a good option for this type of game. I have finished the game, completing all but 2 quests, without doing any melee combat. With this type of non-combat playing, i felt like i am in the world of Spartacus with all those plots. Then I have played with a melee character, and after so many tries, I have found that shielded fighter (with max block skill) is possibly the only option to pass all melee encounters. I have won even against 7 enemies in a single fight and killed total of 60 enemies before i gave up playing. This type of play doess not feel like Spartacus by the way :)Although i like turn-based tactical combat most, this game is for hardcore roleplaying fans. If you like reading long texts, plots & roleplaying, this is the game for you.My only concern about the game can be the length of the game as the developers say that the early access is roughly %60 of the final game which i have completed in 1-2 hours.

								This harkens to classical infinity engine games while implementing a fine take on turn based tactical combat reminiscent of Fallout. If you long for the days of old when rpg's didn't offer trivial choice and consequence for the sake of marketing it on a box, support this project and the indie wave!The game radiates an atmosphere of distrust and reminds you at every turn that trust must be earned in this new world. The choices you make have consequences that are not always readily apparent and may cause unforseen consequences that still make sense in the game's world. The combat is difficult and subsequentally the game does not give off a hack and slash vibe; you must think carefully before committing to combat. You are no hero in this game, no mighty superhuman foe, but merely a mortal in a very dangerous time in history.Carry on the good work!			"

												The variety of the game comes from its multiple ways of handleing quests, and not much from actuall choices. That happens because the ""Choices"" presented are far from clear, with simple ""talk to that man"" becoming ""you are part of his guild now"". Your character is often constricted and led to the next unexpect outcome/scene by the few possible lines you can pick - and are often forced to pick even when all of them are plain bad for you, with no way out of the conversations. Extensive dialog avenues, not ""trees"", bring moments when NPCs will say some long long lines, what would be a good thing were them better written (and not only relying in creative ideas, that are there, I'll give them that).

												The combat difficulty is counter-productive if you want players to enjoy the game and sell it. As a new player I've failed the same combat situation over and over again. I couldn't proceed as preator, having to start a new game. I managed to survice one combat after reloading like seven times. Sure, I could probably have spent one entire evening in the Training area and looking for tutorials on the net. But I haven't got the time. Put a Difficulty gauge in for goodness sake. As a programmer I can only assume and hope that you did put in a hidden difficulty variable in any combat resolving processing. Else you're in trouble.			"

								This game still has tons of minor bugs (and a couple of of them are game-breaking) but it showed a lot of potential as well. OK, heads up first, don't buy this game if you are NOT a hardcore turn-based RPG fan. The learning curve for this game can be quite steep and it may take you hours to figure out how to enjoy the game properly. However, once you figure out the game this game is very fun to play and the plot in the quest is very good.I'd usually like to start my first playthrough as a Dex/Agi combat chracter so I chose assasin faction. One thing I learnt from this game after 10+ hrs of gameplay is that AoD is like a dark souls version of turn based RPG, you will die A LOT during combat and learn from your mistakes/your build. Looking forward to play some non-combat focused factions like loremaster or merchant.			"

												Gameplay - It feels like you're being railroaded even though it's ostensibly a 'free roaming' game (within as much reason as any RPG.) Dialogue options insta-move you to the location you need to be at, stealth elements play more like a graphic novel than a game. A lot of the sense of personal skill is boiled down to your allocation of skill points.Graphically - It looks dated, like it was made a long time before 2015. Maybe circa 2010 or so. For me that's a big issue in what is only a year-old game. The Camera is locked to the map area too tightly as well - rotating the camera in free mode can cause it to bump into the edge of the map and suddenly rotate away from your character like the map edge is made of glue and your camera just got stuck to it.Audio - Honestly didn't stand out.All in all I just can't reccomend it. It seems more to me like the developers had a Roman era military fetish and wanted to build a game around that without just basing it on the actual Roman era.			"

												This game has a great concept and great potential.  Unfortunately the devs confuse terms like ""challenging and hard"" with ""arbitrary and tedious"".  The typical interaction: 1 - I am presented with a choice and little to zero information on how to make that choice2 - I make the wrong choice - oops death.3 - I reload, still wrong  choice.4 - I reload again - OH!  They wanted me to do X....This is neither hard, nor challenging.  It's just a methodical slog where your primary options are to either (a) read a walkthrough or (b) savescum your way through the options.  I'm confounded by all the reviews likening this to PnP RGPs (unless they had an adolescent GM with sadist tendencies).  This game would be like if your GM said ""There are two levers and you must pull one"" then when you say ""I pull the left one"" they reply with ""Sorry, wrong choice you die.  Make a new character"".  This game plays more like a choose your own adventure book than a classic PnP RPG.Yes, combat is hard and deadly.  Check, got that and that can be good in a game.  However ""oops, you died because you chose to scare the loremaster off instead of killing him""... that is just fickle and arbitrary.Great game if you feel like trying to guess your way through the devs plotline to discover their story.  Bad game if you like real choices and player development in an RPG.Edit:  In addition to being a bad game, the devs (and a fan it seems) have the attitude that they'll just convince you how wrong you are for not liking their game.  A disturbing trend I'm starting to see on Steam actually.			"

								This is an amazing example of cRPG done correctly. The first thing you will notice is that it is very heavy on text. The second being that the animation is rather clunky. The third will be that you are dead and have to start again. This game is brutal and it behooves you to consider your course of action carefully. Unless you are a trained and well equipped fighter you WILL die if you try to resolve your problems with violence. That being said it is very possible to complete an entire play through without ever fighting. The sheer amount of content that is in this early access title is mind boggling. The world is populated by a plethora of interesting characters, your options to interact with them just as interesting. (You can even convince a religious sect that you are the chosen one come to lead them to the promised land.) INVEST IN THIS DAMNED TITLE. THAT IS AN ORDER.			"

								Great game. Hardcore RPG that seems to be rare these days. Few bugs but it seems that when i do certain quests and all of the dialogue has been completed, the screen goes black and then it goes back to the start menu for the game. I reload the game and it does the same thing. I dont know if its a bug or if its just because its still in early access and doesnt have that content unlocked yet and i have to wait or something. Other than that, seems flawless. Highly recommend it for people who love good old fashioned RPGS which every choice you make could be your last.			"

												The game developers wanted to give you an old school game that was difficult but rewarding.  A noble concept.  Their idea of accomplishing that?  Drive you nuts with lack of real choices.  Sure, the combat is difficult, but several fights that, storywise, you knew were coming nonetheless start with you surrounded and, get this, ALWAYS going second.  In one fight, three people each get two attacks each against you before you can go.  Now I know what the monsters in JRPGs feel like.			"

Early Access Review
								 A solid, turn-based, isometric RPG with some decent ideas behind it, as well as some fairly punishing combat. It shows a lot of potential in it's early access condition. That said it is very much an early access game, and not very long. What's more most of what works in the game is entirely social (as befitting some of the game concepts) making it almost like an adventure game, or interactive novel with skill checks, at least as far as I've played it. It could use more in the way of ruins to explore, tombs to raid, and the like. What's more given that several of the character types like Mercenary are very combat oriented in their intended builds I do think some effort should be taken to make them a bit more viable when they choose to fight, especially early on (all jokes aside). What's more the weapons could use some fine tuning, as it seems light weapons like daggers are rather overpowering, at least in the battles I've engaged in so far. Still as far as early access goes, it's not bad at all.			"

								***Edited review***Full disclosure, I originally gave this game another negative review. Now that I know what was going wrong my experience with it has been far better.This game is great for people who are into hardcore rpgs. The story is well plotted and most of the characters are interesting. However there is one major issue that makes this game very aggravating. If you are playing a pure diplomat character it is very easy to fail skill checks and have no idea why. Often you will fail a persuasion or disguise check despite having high stats and no clue whatsoever is given as to the reason, which is usually some external stat not mentioned in the text. You will find yourself trying on different clothes, playing with stats only to fail fail fail.If this one issue can be addressed during beta I would say this is an almost perfect game.			"

												Using bad game mechanics and poor game systems to cover up weak writing and poor game mastering is not acceptable.  It is increasingly sad that making games 'rogue-like' has made this acceptable.

								I purchased this game for €20.99 during the steam summer sale and asked a refund after two hours. Although the game is in early access, the developers claim the game is almost finished (1 map left to go). I bought the game because of its claims to be an RPG where you can quest without having to combat all the time. I played a loremaster for this reason. All i seemed to be doing was: talk to quest NPC, fail the quest, reload save game, change skill stats, try talking to quest NPC again, get a little further in the quest and fail again, reload save game, ... Well, I didn't enjoy the experience. The graphics look low rez or blurry, like an old game would.			"

												Pretty disappointing, really. For 25$ I was told this was non-linear and some kind of rpg breakthrough akin to fallout.WRONG! Basically you have to make a PERFECT character for the EXACT choices you decide on playing in the game. It is completely linear. I suppose when they compared it to fallout, they thought that by making 99% of the choices you make end in instant death or you fighting 6 people in the very beginning of the game was edgy or something. Beginning of the game, crank a ton of points into evade, come into a story-line evasion check, fail. Been playing the game ten minutes. What the ♥♥♥♥?This game IS written amazingly, and the story is great. If you enjoy save-scumming over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again just to pick that ONE right dialog that doesn't get you killed or fighting 30 people alone, this is the game for you. If you want an open-ended non-linear RPG that breaks the mold and does something different, wait for another game.			"

												Not really impressed to be honest.  The game is running off code that really makes me think the engine for this was built in the 90s (like when you see the system message telling you its switching from 8 bit to 16 bit color because it detected a Super VGA Driver).  The character animations are exactly what we got in games in the 90s....that jerky stiff arm n leg movement.  As far as the actual RPG aspects of it they seem decent enough but even that feels very dated.  I think this was something someone worked on over two decades ago and finally got around to finishing it without modernizing its engine.Finally tally,  if you can get it for 5 bucks go for it just for the 'nostalgia' feel in playing it but thats about all I can recommend.

												There are no likeable characters in this game. There are no honest NPCs in this game. SIde quests involve either being robbed, stabbed, or misled, and the main quest involve either murdering people because you were told to or manipulating others to murder each other because you can. Role playing as a decent human being will get you killed very fast. Why would anyone play a game that involve this much reading when you just don't care what happens to any of the in game characters? Blah Blah Blah, House X will benefit if you do this, House Y will benefit if you do that.... So what? They are just as bad as each other, and whatever the ending is, it is definitely a bad ending because none of the factions are ran by decent people.This is a old school RPG, so if you want to complete the game you have to either save and reload frequently or read online guides. Compared to other RPGs like Pillars of Eternity and Mass Effect, which can be played blindly with very little reloading and no help from the internet, I feel Age of Decadence is simply inferior because the death and reloading is immersion breaking. It was a business driven game mechanic for the 1 coin for 3 lives arcade machines of the 1980s, but today it just looks out of place. I like permanent death no reload games like jagged alliance 2 1.13, x-com long war, and this war of mine. In those games death matter because you have to keep going and the person you spent hours interacting with is now lost forever. Whereas in this game death doesn't matter because you just reload. This is just bad game design.There are other little annoyances, such as font size is too small on high resolution monitors, you are forced to start combat encounters in melee in tiny rooms even if you try to play as an archer, map areas need to be unlocked and you can't free roam, camera angle changes after every text interaction, too many stats are displayed on screen in combat when only chance to hit and damage range actually matter.If you have the morality of a typical GTA protagonist and you enjoy tweaking complicated excel spreadsheets, and you don't mind dying and reloading all of the time. Then sure, pick up this game. For everyone else, there is simply a lot more games which are a lot better in storyline, gameplay and game design.			"

												For a game that has been 10 years in devolepment, it is... 10 years too late for the market. It praises ultra hardness, being obsessed with numbers and history of ancient armours/weapons like the back of your hand.Example... What is a Zefet? No idea, until you read through the info about it. Pro-tip, could've just said Zefet [dagger] on it, but then again, that would make the game easier to understand.By all means, play it if you hate ""normal"" or ""easy"" games, this game will brutally eat your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for breakfast, plugging it up with a cactus to keep you fresh until later. This game offers you the path of combat or non-combat... why would you choose combat, when you are liable to die from a SINGLE enemy in a leather armor, armed with a dagger and nothing else, while you have a bronze armor, medium shield and sword?You don't have to lift up a weapon throughout the entire game if you REALLY want to.. I'm sorry, I am NOT in the market for Real Life Simulator 2000 BC.Combat should be optional, yes, but not avoided at as much cost as possible.4/10 - Refunding this game.. And I've been watching this game for the last 3 years. "

								This game is not worth $25, wait until it goes on sale for a large discount before buying it if you really must.This game consists of very little content wise so far.  The first section basically is you going around town playing gofer randomly being jumped by scumbags.  There is no overland map or outside the villages/cities to travel to if you need to go someplace for a quest it either takes place in one of the couple of towns in the game or you are trasported to the map that you need to go to.  Going back to the first town from the second doesn't seem possible and I don't remember being warned before turning in the quest that caused my being sent forcibly to the next town.  If you have something to do there before then finish it before turning in any main quests you complete.Most people bring nothing to the game as they cannot be interacted with.  Most stuff in the game similarly cannot be interacted with.  This makes the maps that do exist feel empty to me.  It also makes some of the skills mostly useless or at least far less so then they could be.The movement system is crap, point and click.  There is no free movement with the WASD keys.  Those just control the place that the camera is in the area you are so you can have your character completely off of the screen.There doesn't seem to be much in the way to actually craft, not alchemy, unless you find preexisting things and break them down as you don't seem able to purchase raw materials.  You also cannot experiment with stuff and create your own armor and weapons you can only buy the plans.  However you can do that with alchemy, there just aren't that many compounds to find apparently.  The combat system is♥♥♥♥♥♥and the character seems overly weak.  At max con you get relatively few HP.  Unless you have high levels of skill in whatever ability you are using they are pretty useless, but not for your opponents.  Most of the noncombat skills are overpriced per level for the amount of use tyou seem to get out of them.  Even at 10 in a skill, which seems to be the max, it can still fail.			"

								The Game is fun to a point, when you have to die over and over because your guy can kill 2 baddies then some strong baddie appears and you miss miss miss miss miss miss miss then he kills you in 1-3 shots. I sucks !! The main thing in the game that should be fix is the odds ! The fact that you can only do quests to level up, that you are limited to what quest offers to level up its funny. If you fight , well make sure to have lots of constitution and action points since otherwise all the attacks will lack. Yet how many time you will miss instead of hitting an enemy. so in some situation where you can't have enough health since health potions are too expensive and your health doesn't regenerate over time which is a big flaw in the game. The point of an indie game is not to try to act like a REAL game, its to keep it old school yet ENJOYABLE, you want people to buy the game, to actually Succeed and follow the story plot. Not to get frustrated because you kill 2 enemy and 1 kills you or if you join him you both get killed by some other enemy. When you start up and can fight one guy at full health, good because you can get gold and get better items, but then you are always over match by the enemy ! You should be able to have a fair fight as your main character and kick♥♥♥♥♥ these games are why people end up making trainers and hacks because they just get annoyingly boring. Yet I'm willing to see if the developpers are smart enough to improve the game !			"

You'll reload a lot in this game. I was aware of the old school appeal of this game (hard and all), but save/load is not difficult, it's frustrating...The game make great effort to say that avoid combat at all costs, but that's situations that combat is inevitable and combat in this game is a chore.I guess I'm a casual now :/			"

								This game is ridiculous!!! I am an old school gamer who appreciates strategy but this is damn silly!!!! This game seems to punish people who enjoy combat. I hate to tell you but ALL RPGs revolve around combat. I respect the fact that I strat the game as an average joe but I cant defeat two thugs  no matter what strategy I use or what I do. I saved and replayed the same battle about 15 times with no luck. At low levels you just dont have the skill numbers needed to be victorious. Very poor game design! Way over the top!!  Please remember real life is tough enough. When I play RPGs I want to play a character that is a cut above not get killed by two street thugs. There is a fine line between challenge and simply not fun. This game is NOT FUN!!!! Enjoy my $24			"

The Demo is actually a lot of fun !!! but not the game just play the demo and be done with it if your smart.			"

												The developers have lost the plot. They claim to try move away from the mainstream RPGs of overpowered characters. Please note that the reason most RPGs work that way is because that’s what the players want! This is game too difficult to be fun. Good storyline, but not recommended for casual gamers. Hardcore gamers might find it fun provided they cheat through the impossible combat scenarios with console commands.			"

												There is something inherently wrong with how defensive abilities are being handled.  Heavy fighters stand little chance against Dagger wielding swashbucklers.  If you play a heavy fighter you will probably die alot more than a light fighter because of dodge and defensive skills versus a heavy fighters reliance on his armor.  At the moment it is better if you just play a light fighter with high dodge skill until they study the effects of armor in their game.  If you are a heavy fighter type beware, it's frustrating and perhaps not your cup of tea, but if you like the light fighter dagger wielding type than you'll most likely have more fun.			"

												EDITEDMy original review and following forum post titled I WANT A REFUND, are all coated in a nice layer of hatred for this game, a need to get my money back at the time, and frustration with the way the game plays, not to mention the fans and just wanting to be an @$$hole to them because I could.I am officially apologizing for my hostility and rampant anger that is easily seen in my posts as time goes on on the discussion board. I'm also sorry for saying the devs are liars. Although the store page isn't entirely truthful as to what type of game this is overall.My attitude and tone was uncalled for and I should have approached it all with a different point of view, but after having fans simply repeat the same things over and over to me on the forums I eventually just had enough and blew up to end the discussion on my end. They of course kept going for a bit. Rabid dogs that they are. That said I've learned some things from my time with this games community, rather than the game itself.One thing I learned is that Game Devs on steam, cannot force steam to give your money back. The dev offered, because he didn't want my money and didn't want me as a customer. This was the entire purpose of my original post, i figured if I made a stink I could get my money back. I was wrong and my tone was over the top and I shouldn't have posted it.However, I'm still not recommending buying this game. Two things.1- The Dev that makes the replys for this page, Vince. Mainly seems to respond to negative reviews, with a list of links he has at the ready to provide you with information you cannot get from playing the game yourself and rather must exit the game and go to a website in order to learn to play the game ""the way its meant to be played "".Also from many of his responses on other reviews, it seems his main goal is to immediately discredit the reviewer by suggesting that you have missed the proper way to play the game entirely and are making a review without having full knowledge of the game. Unless your review is a thumbs up in that case he hardly seems to respond at all. This is something I noticed after reading some of the other reviews and seeing his replies there.2- My times with the fans of this game, The fans of this game are quick to defend it and I wont call them out for doing so, as we all defend things we like. Their harshness towards me is the standard dribble that I dealt to them eventually. The only thing I can say that was above and beyond on their part is that eventually one or two of them took it upon themselves to use my real name and insult me. I never used any of their real names, or even used Vinces' name. That type of behavior is stalker like. Be warned, if you choose to leave a review for this game, as the fans will attack you ferociously and the devs wont really stop them at all. In a way they seem to encourage this behavior.Now for the review.The graphics for this game are quite dated and if you find yourself, like me, becoming something of a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ as the ages pass you by then you may also have a issue with this.There is really no point in designing a character as that aspect of the game is almost not there at all. The camera angle further eliminates any need for customization. Armor, clothing and weapons are the main thing that will change the appearance of your character.The devs say that all of the quest lines are hand written along with all their encounters. And while I admit that's a good thing.. aren't all quest lines in most rpgs hand written? In that someone wrote them? I mean that's not really a game feature at all, until i see more and more rpgs using nothing but randomly/proceduraly generated quest and story lines I cannot call this a game feature, because it isn't. The game boasts a ""hard core"" choice based story line that branches into other story lines based on your choices. This is true but at the same time it isn't. From my time with the game, which is limited given I never made it past the 2nd town, all I saw was skill based choices. There are very few choices that are not skill based that I saw that had a effect on anything. The only time this became true was during a mission where I could betray my chosen guild. And even if you disagree with me on this point, the end game of these story lines ( which calling them branching story lines is a bit of a stretch honestly ) is often the same, only changing for some major plot points and disregarding the vast majority of your actions that lead up to that event.26 hours. That's how much time I put into the game, the fans often said to me that asking for a refund after 30 hours is stupid and that I was stupid for not playing the demo. Well as it turns out I never had a ragequit problem until I got to the 2nd town and basically got to the mid point for my guild questline. So no matter how many hours I played the demo for, I would have never gotten to that same point as it was not included in the demo. This is going off what the fans have said, that the demo is the entire game, just only the first town.Also I just cannot judge a rpg within 2 hours. I played it for as long as I did and then I had my judgment. It unfortunate that steam has a 2 hour policy and a auto review of those refund requests. Heck I still want my refund of Sid Meiers Pirates, because it wont run anymore.The straw that broke the camels back.I ran into a fight where the placement for my character for said fight was simply unforgivable. Normally this isn't really a issue as combat can be hard or very hard in some rpgs, but not in the same was as AoD. This game makes everything seem like a extra effort, I don't enjoy the way combat unfolds, the turn based system isn't the problem. I just don't like how you choose your combat actions. I feel that even with this GUI they could have gone with something that felt less restrictive. My view of combat is also tainted as I died so many times in the first town that I eventually made a min max character and was able to move forward, giving up any hopes I had of having a combat savvy, talker or some other combination that isn't just nothing but one type of combat.Anyway, in said combat I was forcibly placed into the center of a room with 3 or 4 enemy's. My character knows there are multiple people in the room, as is suggested by the text leading up to entering it. Even knowing this, you just enter it anyway, rather than allowing the player to opt for a ambush at the choke point. What is really funny about this being the combat that made me ragequit is that, up until that point I felt I finally had the game figured out ad least enough to allow me to explore and simply die over and over. While its true I always had the option to run away and abandon the quest, doing so basically makes your character a wanted man and prevents you from progressing your factions missions forward. While running away is always a option, and while my pride didn't at the time allow me to do so, I still felt like I was being railroaded into this situation and just hated it. Often times that is how the game feels. Some people may enjoy a game that provides no hand holding at all and practically forces you to exit the game and learn to play it by watching videos online and reading pages and pages of character build strategies. I'm not one of those people and if that aspect of the game had been made much clearer on the store page for the game I wouldn't have ever bought it to begin with.In short this game heavily reminds me of my original Dungeon master for 3.5 dnd. He was the kinda guy who says, the wall attacks you and also fondly enjoyed dropping bombs on players like, ""I'm sorry but you never specifically said you were getting that item, so even though without it your all about to die, I don't care."" This game and its choices all feel like I have no freedom at all.			"

								It's not often I regret a game purcahse, but for $25 I can't belive I paid for this game. The main issue is the core mechanics of gameplay- combat is so brutally difficutly that it is not at all enjoyable. I know a lot of people are writing reveiws saying this is a throw back to old school games. I dissagree- this is poor game design. Besides fighting your other option is to play a non combat character, which is the optimal choice, since combat is clunky, not intuitive, and not at all forgiving. I wish I could charge back for this game. Lesson learned. Do yourself a favor and play the demo if you are at all interested in backing this project.			"

												Downvoted because I don't like this design philosophy.It is essentially a 10 hour game that you can replay with other different types of characters and have some very different missions leading to essentially the same plot and ending.This is idiotic. In essence, to get your money's worth you're expected to play the same story over again with some changes in the specifics.Why not make a 50 hour RPG that gives you ALL of the content (at least as much as you want) in one playthrough?  What is the damn point of playing a story driven RPG 5 times if you ALREADY KNOW THE STORY. It's like, instead of buying a good long book for $10, you buy 1/5 of a book for $10 because the writer expects you to read it 5 times.It's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ design, so downvoted.			"

								I wish there was a neutral 'meh' option, I was fairly set to give this game a thumb's up due to it's neat Late Roman Empire post-apocalyptic feel and the obvious fact that a lot of work has been put in(credit where it is due), but realizing that a CRPG with a vestigial 'Trade' skill(sales aren't a magical independent ability, it's a combination of charisma and persuasion in real life) is being released in the year 2015 makes me cringe.This is very much a sendup to the late 90s-early 00s CRPG era. If you like *everything* about old isometric CRPGs like Fallout, including the chunky isometrics, the terrible merchant pricing balance, and the comical combat difficulty(not difficulty as in brutal or high skill cap, difficulty as in artificial) level that physically requires you to minmax the hell out of your stats to be remotely viable against the very common scenario that is 3+enemies attacking your lone character at once, then this is a game for you.The Devs had a chance to make a landmark CRPG and add another foundation block in the rebuilding of the genre into something modern. The lore and writing is on point, but they decided to snub casuals(read: people who don't like reloading ten times per battle) with really high dialogue skill checks and no middle ground in character creation. Your characters are either autistic savants that are good at three things and completely incapable or worse at everything else, or you're not going to be able to make it very far into the game. Throw in extremely nuanced, vestigial skills like Trading(should be either or a combination of Persuasion/Charisma modifiers), Etiquette/Streetwise(Not useful enough to represent individual skills, and Streetwise is just Street Etiquette), and Impersonate(I can think of two ways to represent disguise more naturally than it's own vestigial skill and I've only put a half minute of thought into it), middle of the road everyman characters with one or two interests or specialties are simply not a possibility.TL;DR: This game is a faithful throwback to the 'golden age' of CRPGs with an alluring atmosphere and competent writing, but it's gameplay is not an improvement over titles around two decades old. Age of Decadence suffers from the same playability/skillbloat issues as the classic games that it emulates, which is exaclty what a few but not most people are looking for, and exactly why the genre died.

												Started development in 2006. Plays like it was made in 2006.Linear dialog leaves little room for success unless you min/max the right skills.Started as a lockpicking thief, every door was locked, no options to open. Dex was highest stat... every dex attempt failed. Rolls aren't random, so there's no chance for luck just pre-determined scripts. There's really nothing to interact with in the environment. Had a few kinda-creative NPC encounters, but it's more like a choose-your-own-adventure than an RPG. Instead of being rewarded for what you build, you're penalized for what you don't.Ultimately, not worth 26.99... or even 6.99... or even free. I have too many other games I could be spending time on that are much more fun and engaging.			"

												If you like playing a game that seems pointless here it is.  The game has no difficulty setting, and is setup so that your a complete weakling.  I get the ""Realism""  but you can't even rest or heal, fights are near impossible even if you maximize your combat.  While real in some ways, it is a far cry from real as you can't rest between battles in a town, and every job seems to be fight, fail, or die. Not sure if the game actually gets going, but I got far enough to meet the bandits, and the guard guy actually thinks you would be stupid enough to fight 5 guys when 2 are nearly impossible.This is a lesson in patients, load, die, load, die, load die, load maybe, nope load again.You can't use tactics, or logic, run from everything.

												This game has the potential to be pretty cool, but unfortunately it's just not.  Ignore a lot of the fanboy reviews -- there are a lot -- and pay attention to common complaints in other reviews.  Basically, this game is very short.  You will spend the majority of your time metagaming and savescumming.  The loading screen is kinda cool looking, so it has that going for it.  Combat is simplistic and often boils down to trying to get 5 or 6 heads or tails coin tosses in a row.  If you don't, you need to reload.Characters are standard archetypes.  Don't bother trying to roleplay anything more than standard classes.  The developers should've probably just made Talker, Fighter, and Thief buttons during character creation and not bother with allowing players to allocate stats, since there's really only the illusion of choice.I was hesitant to get this game because of the negative reviews calling it little more than a choose your own adventure book (Talker), a silly RNG-fest (Fighter), or both (Thief).  You can try to make your own guy, but it just means you'll have to savescum more combats or metagame more skill checks and still risk getting essentially stuck.The developers and many of the fanboys will keep repeating 'this game is not for everyone'.  No, it's not.  No games are.  Unfortunately, that's not enough to excuse things like incredibly simplistic combat, a role-playing game that relies on metagaming (ferreal...) or a game that has none of what makes many CRPGs so fun -- exploration, story, character development, and engaging writing and lore to name a few.It had some potential, but there's way better stuff out there to bother with this.  For an RPG released in 2015 it feels more dated than stuff I got on PC Gamer demo disks over 20 years ago.			"

Early Access Review
								Just picked up the game played about an hour. In that hour experienced multiple crashes, when transitioning to combat or a new area. The game was not what i expected truthfully. One of the eight ‘vignette’ stories(drifter) starts out with your journey begining in some random town and there is a fight outside your inn room. Thats it.... you end up finding a treasure map on a dead inn keeper. From there you take that map to an antique collector who offers you some kind of amulet that is supossed to glow when you get close to the treasure. Terrible story but the writing isnt bad, in a tale about people who destroyed the world and no ancient evil i didnt expect a glowing amulet that seems akin to magic. Story woes aside you start in a small town that you can explore. I hope more effort was put towards the other 'vignette' stories. On a side note i found out from the developer i was conned by the amulet dealer so i should have stuck with my gut and thought something was off with a magical amulet. Honestly thats a pretty cool feature i guess but not enough to keep me playing however. The graphics and art design arent great but in this kind of game, gameplay and combat are more important. I just wanted to mention graphics quality is not on par with the likes of Pillars of Eternity or even Shadowrun. Obviously the budget of these titles is very different but i would like to draw attention to the prices. Shadowrun Hong Kong (19.99). Pillars of Eternity (44.99). Age of Decadence (29.99). Now isnt price and total gameplay (in terms of hours of course) the most important thing to consider? $10.00 more than shadowrun and $15.00 less than Pillars of Eternity is exspensive for an indie game with a shoestring budget compared to the former multi-million dollar games. The starting town feels empty. You cant talk to anyone but merchants and some quest givers/ quest completers. When you wish to travel to a new area you pull up your map and click on it, fast travel ensues. The game immediately made me think of a visual novel, which isnt a knock by itself as i have played and enjoyed quite a few visual novels. However this game has a steep pricetag for what it offers. Combat is turn based and in the few battles i was able to particpate in without crashing, tactics were to get up close to the enemy and swing until one of you is dead. Your character has the ability to select different attacks depending on the weapon he is weilding. For example an overhead strike with a broadsword. The different attacks do different levels of damage, consume different levels of AP, or have different chance to hit. There is also the ability to aim at places like your opponents legs to cripple mobility, or do some sort of whirlwind strike that hits multiple opponents. Other tidbits of action like sneaking and stealing are all calculated based on your skills. For example in one quest you can sneak into a ruin, to do so its all skill based you click sneak in the conversation window and sneak past the immediate guards. Than you click sneak again to get into the tunnel, if your sneak skill is high enough again you succeed. Gameplay really seems lackluster as i anticipate random skill checks for almost everything you want to do in this game. Character creation is pretty bland there are a few options to make your character look different maybe 5 hairstlyes and a  few hair colors and skin colors. Other than that there is a list of skills and attributes which arent sufficiently explained to a new player. There is your average attribute system and a list of combat skills and non combat skills. Investing in combat attributes unlocks combat skill points that you can distribute and so on. The character skill system seemed very deep to me on the surface but because of other parts of the game i was not able to delve into it and enjoy it. All in all i have played and enjoyed many cRPGs but i cant recommend this one. Many crashes, terrible combat and gameplay, not very good story and the graphics are very indie scene as well, though i would excuse the graphics if the game had anything else fun about it.I would also just like to note that while some fans of the game believe that in order for me to write a negative review i must slog through 5-10 more hours of boring gameplay that is not reasonable. In the first hour of gameplay after experiencing multiple crashes and encountering other issues i switched to a game i actually enjoyed again.			"

It being hard and you're having to act a bit sensibily is definate pluses, but the controls would need an overhaul for me to play it again.			"

								Well lets see I died at least 8 times before I got the idea I am supposed to be a coward.  The first quest I got lucky on the fourth or fifth time and killed him. Guarding the merchant got killed every time. Trying to check out the mining camp got me ganked four or five times before I gave up on that bs. The bandit camp 6 or 7 times. Went back and told the dude that they wanted a ransom and he asked if I could handle it....... well duh said no and he sent his own men and they got beat on and then he blamed me for the troops dying after I told him what was in the camp. Pretty much gave up after that. Don't mind hard but seriously this was useless as teats on a boar hog.			"

Early Access Review
								ok, so I got this game cause it wasn't to expensive and looked a bit interesting. I gotta say, I'm disapointed. No ""playable"" game should be this hard right off the bat, at least not without difficulty settings. I read a note from one of the developers that made me think they must be totally out of touch with how 90% of people play games. They said that the best way to play this game was to play till you get to a fight, and if you can't win regardless of tactic, simply start a new game. Really? No one should ever expect to make a decent amount of money if they make a game that can't be played all the way through without starting over. That is just crappy developement and a total failure to sympathize with the gamer.Starting from the first location in the game, as is standard, there are quests and things in this location. So you find a few, and quickly discover that there are several you simply can't complete without advancing your stats, some to LEVEL 4 or 5 for that one stat, at 10 points a level. And you only earn about 2 points per body, sometimes not even that. You VERY quickly run out of people to kill, so as far as I can tell, it's not possible to raise all the stats you need, to the level required, in order to complete all the quests you get in the first area. This, in my opinion, is just stupid sauce. Who makes games that require you to leave side quests unfinished?And who makes a game where, once combat starts, you have ZERO methods of gaining back any lost HP, until all combat is over? I think there might be some potions that you can make later on in the game that will do this, but with the standard healing salve either 11 AP isn't enough to use it, or the game simply won't let you use it in combat. Again, stupid sauce.I've played this for 2 or 3 days, logged several hours, completed every ""side quest"" possible in the first location. By ""possible"" I mean the side quests you could complete with the stat points you earn by finding every single hostile person in the town and killing them. I found the gang in shanty town, I found the merchant that leads you to an ambush, etc. At 40 HP with 11 AP the outpost is certain death even after you poison them with the poison you get from the assasins guild (better than rat poison). You can't bluff your way in without rasing 3 different stats to level 4, so that's a no go, no way to earn that many points. I didn't try the bandit camp yet but that's next. I thought I might get more points if I ask for more assassin contracts but the 3rd one advances the game so you are no longer in the first location when it's done, so any side quests that involve buildings in that town are gone, unless you can somehow go back later and the guard won't be hostile to you.No game should have it's own ""for dummies"" guide before it's even released, the fact that someone felt the need for one should be a big clue as to the games apeal.So, I gotta say, like I said at the beginning, I am dissapointed. This game needs MAJOR ""playability"" improvements before it's ready for prime time. From what I'm reading in the developers comments and their game philosophy, I predict that this game is going to be a massive failure. As it exists right now, it should fail.			"

												I would have loved to love this game. It's got everything I want in an RPG, except that it's too bloody difficult. The developers are selling me a game where I'm supposed to have multiple ways to beat quests, and I can get down with that. I chose to be a dude with a big two-handed sword who was street-wise and could talk without embarrassing himself. I wanted to live that character. But my dude both can't talk and can't fight past the first quest.So I re-rolled a better talker and gave him heavy armor and a tower shield. He's more survivable now, and he can talk even better. Still can't beat the first quest. The only way to beat the first quest is to do a bunch of talking and skulking, and so the game doesn't deliver on its promise. Maybe you don't want me to feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥dude, but I DO want to feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥dude. I even went out of my way to poison all of the guys in the first real encounter and they STILL kicked my♥♥♥♥♥despite being ""so feverish as to barely be able to stand up"".So, no, I don't recommend this game. I'll come back when I see a patch that addresses this and a sale for 50% off.			"

												Clunky. It might have a great story, but it hides behind a really clunky interface. A UI where doing the simplest things is a puzzle in itself.It's not that the game has massive complexity (it has some) most of the complexity comes from the bloody awful UI you have to fight with to do the simplest thing. To hear people call the effort to fight with a bad UI ""depth of gameplay"" has  raised a chuckle.A few years back I mastered Dwarf Fortress because I knew the game depth behind that godamawful interface was worth it. And it has been.In this case it's mostly story,  I'm not really into pre defined stories (prefer sandbox over theme park every time)I would give it a middle option ""level thumb"" if that was available, but if I have to choose from up or down, I choose down.But If story is everything for you? Then give this a go. It's probably ok.   "

								For the price of this game it was simply not worth it to me. I do enjoy several features of the game such as choice makeing a diff in the outcome of the way you play the game or the game plays you in such a fashion one could say. I think the dialog is verywell done and in-depth but the graphics are extremely sub par and, the simple fact that the camera when in free motion does not follow the character draws away from the experience of the game. Another thing that really botherd me was the board/map, they should have made the game a large ""expansive"" open world wich they clearly would have no problem doing with the amount of pollys displayed ^^. On that note it just seems to me as if they were lazy and did not feel like adding that depth to the game. Aswell I would be criminal if I did not mention the frequent crashes I exp on my journey and, Yes most regretable when there is no auto save. So 2/5 for me I would not reccomend you try this game untill the price comes down and they iron out the bugs.			"

								The game is good. However, the length of the game play is currently not worth the $25. After playing the game for ~2 hours, you come to the end of the game... The contents present in the early release sets up very a promising full version game. Hopefully the full release will have more contents to explore. The question is just when will the full release be available? I can already imagine myself playing this game for countless hours, trying to explore every inch of the game.			"

At first when i saw the sub-par graphics I had hoped that it might be a throw back to the games of yesteryear that I used to love so much....like Bards Tale, Arena, Daggerfall...but this just did not remotely live up to those memories. Clunky interface, boring story progression, you don't even get to move your character, you select from a menu what your next action is (enter a door, search a body, etc..) and the scene goes to a new screenshot. Don't be fooled by the screenshots. The pretty ones are not gameplay shots. The only positive note about this game was the synopsis.			"
