												-Large, sandy desert-Bandits and psychos everywhere-Redneck car dealers-Alien creatures out to kill you at all times-87 bazillion gunsMan, Texas sure is greatEDIT: 15/01/2015So, it's come to my attention that this review, which initially began as a joke, has become tremendously popular on the store page (huge thanks to all who voted so positively!) so I decided I should actually include something in this review to keep it helpful to newcomers or fans coming off of Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel.What is it that keeps Borderlands so good to come back to, and compulsively play on a consistent basis? If you were to ask me this question, there would be no way I would know how to respond simply. But, I can at least try to break it down.Gameplay-wise, Borderlands has all the fundamentals of an FPS, shooting feels good and there's a wide range of guns with a unique feel to all of them (more on that later) without sacrificing movement. FPS makes up the core gameplay and how you interact with the world and NPCs in terms of combat, and it feels fantastic. However, the RPG elements are what give this game that extra depth that stops it from being 'just another' shooter. Every character has unique perks and skill trees that can be customised in different ways to alter general combat and your unique action skill. It keeps combat fresh and skills balance across characters really well. You might not see trees as unique as Zer0 or Krieg from Borderlands 2 but you can expect deep customisation nonetheless. No one character defines a playstyle, any of the four can be decked out with the according loot to keep you tanky, but the action skills and trees prevent the protagonists from feeling same-y.Storyline wise don't expect a deep tale, or even a sweeping adventurous romp like Borderlands 2. Instead, Borderlands goes for a strong atmosphere communicated through mission structure and world design, and yet I have no complaints about this lack of story. Gearbox balanced innumerable quests with a consistent world to combine for a truly unique experience. This is a game that, thanks to an RPG quest system, lets you get out there in the game world and get lost in it doing missions for insane amounts of time but lets you stay immersed in the storyline and world at the same time.Now, the meat of Borderlands. Let's be honest, RPGs have had shooter elements before, but, in my opinion, never has an inventory system in an RPG felt this good. Borderlands has my favourite inventory/loot system because it cuts the crap and gets right to the stuff you care about: guns, guns, guns! Don't expect to be picking up some arbitrary ""Lord Generic's Gold Coin #74 with Blue Palette"" to sell later. Borderlands gives you gear you use practically, and can sell for money. Expect to pick up grenade modifications, shields, class modifications which power up your skill trees even further and of course, guns. Perhaps what keeps the loot so good in Borderlands 1 as compared to 2 and Pre-Sequel is how they function relative to your character's level. I love Borderlands 2 and Pre-Sequel, but I found myself selling guns a lot more than in BL1, because Gearbox opted for a more balanced weapon system. Borderlands 1 has a different experience to opening loot chests. You could open something and still have the same giddy eagerness as when you first opened one in your early hours with the game because genuinely powerful and versatile weapons can be found. This is due to levelling and some manufacturers having incredibly unique traits that set them far above other manufacturers. Take, for example, the fact I own a Hyperion shotgun with a level 15 requirement that I still use on my level 44 Mordecai and you get an incredible idea of what this game can offer you. Not to mention the amount of guns outnumbers Borderlands 2 by around 3 million (5 mil vs 8 mil) and this game keeps a lot to see in it. Like the other Borderlands games there's a lot to see in the way of second playthroughs, offering more quests, even better loot and more challenging enemies.I feel as though my review barely scratches the surface even after typing all of this, but overall, I highly recommend you purchase this game if you want to get lost and spend countless hours in one of the deepest shooters I've played this past decade.10/10, would fight Texans again and again and again.

												This game is not like any other Shooter, it mixes with RPG-like elements to create an ultimate gaming experience. I love the cartoon-like environment and the story about this planet of Pandora. Even if you beat the game, you can do it all again with harder enemies and better loot and I certainly did it because it was so fun. This game is one of my all-time favourites and for the sale price it was totally worth it.I would recommend it to any gamer.			"

												Let me start out by saying that I do not like shooters.  1st person, 3rd person, or whatever.  I have never liked shooters.  My son came to visit and brought his Xbox 360 and he said he had a game that if I would give it a chance, he was sure I would like it at least enough to play with him when he came to visit.  When he loaded up Borderlands, my first reaction was ""Oh God!  A Shooter.""  I reminded him that I didn't like this kind of game at all.  He talked me into trying.  He suggested that I play Mordecai.  To make a long story short, within an hour I was so hooked I lost all track of time.  Between the pop culture knods and puns from my era (the story writers have GOT to be close to my age... which we won't mention what is) and the shere enjoyment of the game itself, it felt like we had only played an hour or so and I looked at the clock and it was 7 hours later!  I went on to play the 2nd AND the presequel!  I am still not very big on shooters, but I am at least a little more open to them because of this game and my son's persistance.  Borderlands have you laughing hard one second and then wondering ""what the heck!?"" the next.  The story is extremely engrossing, and the characters very relatable in their actions and motivations.  When you get to the end (is there actually and end??)  You will feel like you have acomplished the unachievable.  If you are even looking at this game and wondering, I have only two words:  ""BUY IT!""  Whatever genre is your preference, you will fall in love with it!			"

												I loved this game, the mix with FPS and RPG is just fantastic, and the fact that you can level your character and spend points in your talents tree is awesome! The art is great as well, and there are lots and lots of different weapons that you can try, until you find one that you really like! Playing by yourself is great, but it's a lot more fun when you play it with friends, the enemies get tougher and the loot gets better. 100% recommended!			"

												I don't know why I love this game. It is so totally asocial that it's a little bit sick. But I guess there come times in everyone's life when the only thing that suits your mood is to melt the faces off some midgets with a gun that shoots acid, or set bandits on fire and listen to your character laugh her head off as your victims run around screaming ""Mommy, mommy!"" It shouldn't be funny, but it's as funny as hell. It has some absolutely classic characters, not only in the main players like the siren Lilith, who has a ghastly giggle every time she hurts someone REALLY badly and who will abuse you if you leave her on hold too long, but also Dr. Patricia Tannis, the insane archeologist whose only reflection when a colleague is devoured alive by one of the local animals is ""He always had the more comfortable chair....I took his chair,"" Scooter, who could so easily have become a simple hick parody but turns out a great deal more, and funnier; and General ""Doesn't Like Mondays"" Knoxx, who is condemned to the hell of being commanded by a six year old child who outranks him because of nepotism gone insane. Just don't expect redeeming social value, unless there's some redeeming social value in getting rid of your less healthy desires in a relatively harmless way.			"

												Growing up on games like Quake and Diablo really helped me to appreciate the greatness of Borderlands. There’s been a lot of games that have tried to pull off genre hybrids, but they either fail to deliver or just fail to program a game correctly. Borderlands is one of the few games that manages to feel like an RPG and a FPS at the same time.Coming from a shooter side, the game is a very fun classic style shooter, meaning that the realism has been replaced with you getting to unload a clip into someone before dropping them. Sniper head-shots can generally take a foe down with one shot, but most all other guns are going to require you to get dirty. It feels an awful lot like a classic Quake shooter too. It’s just action based. Your ‘cover’ system is generally using you strafe and jump at the right time. By all means, this a welcome to some older gamers since most of today’s games are just striving to hit a certain realistic feel.From an RPG point, the game does take a few tumbling points in certain areas. The biggest problem is the skill tree. It’s pretty bare and some of the skills just feel useless. There’s also not enough skills to pin you into one type of character. Are you a Hunter looking to just be the stay-back sniper? Well, you can max those skills out but you can’t invest only points into one branch. It would have been nice to borrow a few more of the Diablo elements, allowing you to create an amazingly unique character from branches. Instead, you’re left feeling a bit underwhelmed by the skills. The only other problem with the RPG element is the characters all feel about the same. My Hunter manages to be a jack-of-all-trades character instead of just a hunter. While I might technically do more damage with a sniper rifle, my dark-orange rare machine gun that does 4x fire damage is going to take down the enemies faster. While these two things are a bit critical, the rest of the action role-playing feels genuine. Looting is fun; leveling up is fun; and having a huge inventory is very nice.From a graphic standpoint, this might not be a masterpiece, and some may feel a little turned off by the cartoony look, but by all means, you can at least distinguish this title from the other 90% of shooters that look like Modern Warfare clones. The one problem with the game’s graphics is some unstable frame rates, mainly when there’s a lot of blood on screen, a lot of elemental damage, or just towards the end of the game. It’s not unplayable, but the slowdowns shouldn’t be happening at all. Aside from that, it’s a nice refreshing look and feels more like a video game than a simulator.There’s a story to the game, but even after playing through the game two times, I don’t think I could tell you what it’s about other than treasure hunting. Personally, I think the lack of story kept me more interested. I wasn’t worried about progressing to the end as much as I was trying to kill as many things as I could to find the next best weapon. While the story lacks in a big way, it would be nice to have a bit more of it in the next title release.Where most people are probably going to go wrong with this title is trying to play this game as a single player game. Don’t bother. This was meant to be a co-op game. It’s like playing Left 4 Dead alone. It’s possible, but you’re going to actually enjoy playing the game when you have friends around. A benefit of having more friends play with you is that the game rewards you with more rare items. Plus, if you want to break away from the typical gameplay, they’ve installed arenas around the area to help you test out your gear against other foes, or to just play a little smack down with a friend.And for you achievement/trophy treasure finders out there, this title is pretty easy to get 100% in. What’s more interesting is the Medals (or challenges) you can try for with each character. Trying to get 2,000 head-shots or get the max number of cash in the game is wildly fun. It actually feels more like an extra quest in the game, since each challenge gives you a nice pot of experience points.My final thoughts on the game: it’s a fantastic game, and for a new IP, it’s refreshing to see that there’s companies that still want to bring new or greatly tweaked genres to the table. While there’s some work to be done in some areas, the game had me fork over $60 and supplied me with $100 worth of entertainment.			"

												Do you like GUNS?! Do you like Loot?!Well boy do I have a game for you! Gearbox and 2K's Borderland game is essentially just that - game based around guns and loot, and yet as you play you're invited into the very believable and 'live' world of Pandora. It's not long at all before you realise that this is more than your basic FPS, sure it has the First-Person viewpoint, and you, er, shoot, but there's an adventure in here too. It's rare that a FPS shooter has characters and humor injected into as rich as Borderlands, and looking back from when I originally played this on the 360, I'm not sure I've really played a game like it since.It blends FPS and RPG elements together, and embraces our natural greed for better loot, to provide what I can only describe as a really fun time. It might have aged terribly since I last played, it and Borderlands 2 (and it's endless DLC) has been released since then too, but the first Borderlands game will always have a place in my games collection. It was one of the first fun Co-Op experiences I had, which in part was due to the 4 unique characters you could play as. Each character had their own traits and specialist role within a team, but could be equally as well-rounded if you played Solo. So you never really felt like you had 'picked the wrong class' when playing. Sure the game would change slightly depending on who you picked due to that character's 'natural' play style shaped by their traits and abilities, but nothing that would make the game less enjoyable.In essence you had the Soldier, The Sniper, The Tank & The Magic classes to choose from. Each class comes with a speciality ability, and there are 3 seperate talent trees to spend skill points in to allow you to customise your characters abilities somewhat. The way the Co-op System worked was interesting, and one I wish was used more often. Every game you had saved was YOUR game, and it was up to you if you wanted your friends to join in and help YOU out in YOUR game. So you could play Solo and progress, or you could call in your friends and progress. The game wouldn't progress without you being there, so there was no real need to worry about slowing down other people's progress due to other commitments. Sadly, the PC version of Borderlands seems to come with a really terrible gamespy client that is hard to navigate compared to the Xbox360 Party System, which can at times make finding a party difficult and irritating. As mentioned previously, the ship might have sailed on Borderlands due to Borderlands 2 being released, but I still enjoyed it and for those with an older PC unable to run Borderlands 2 this might still be worth checking out if you're looking to scratch an itch when it comes to collecting guns...

												Commonly described as Diablo with guns, Borderlands can't really be explained by comparing it to other games. The closest you could probably get is Hellgate: London (as long as you were playing one of the gun/first-person shooter classes), but even then there are some pretty major differences.If you haven't been paying attention to this game at all, Borderlands is a first-person shooter with action role-playing elements. You choose from four classes -- The Soldier, the Berserker, the Hunter, and the Siren. Each has a unique ""action skill,"" which is basically that classes special ability, and three different trees to drop skill points into. While every class can use every weapon in the game (the only limit on what you can equip is determined by your level), most characters have skills in their skill tree that enhance one or two particular types of weapons.The Soldier is best with rifles and shotguns, the Berserker with explosive weapons and his melee attack, the Hunter with sniper rifles and revolvers, and the Siren with any weapon that deals elemental damage. Luckily, there is enough flexibility that these don't feel like absolute restrictions. If you wanted to make a Hunter that mainly used rocket launchers, that's completely viable. Sure, it won't be the best build for the character, but you won't feel like you have no options other than to use the ""recommended weapons"" for each class.You may remember some minor controversy a while back when Gearbox announced that they had scrapped the game's initial design in favor of cel-shaded graphics. I'm happy to report that I believe Gearbox made the right choice in changing the graphical direction of the game. Not only does it make Borderlands look unique, but it's gorgeous on top of that. Looking back at older screenshots of the game, the original art style seemed so generic and bland -- I'm really glad they decided to take a chance and mix it up. Other than some minor texture pop that resolves almost immediately upon loading and some slight screen tearing (VSync option please!), I didn't really run into any other graphical issues.The game begins with you being tossed off a bus. You meet your first Claptrap who explains the basics of the game, and gives you a short mini-tutorial. After making your way to the first town, you're assigned your first quest and the game really begins.There's a massive number of quests in the game, and Gearbox has done a reasonable job of mixing them up. While every now and then you'll be assigned a ""Kill X enemies"" quest, they are few and far between. For the most part, you'll be exploring various locations and recovering different items, usually with a bunch of bad guys standing in the way. Even after completing the game, I was still going back and finding quests that I had missed before.One of the reasons it's been compared to Diablo is because of the emphasis on loot. The initial stories were right -- there are TONS of weapons in this game. There are seven main weapon types: pistols (this includes repeater pistols and revolvers), submachine guns, shotguns, combat rifles, sniper rifles, launchers, and a seventh that could be considered a minor spoiler. Every weapon has a variety of stats: accuracy rating, recoil, how much the weapon can zoom, how many bullets the weapon can hold, how fast the gun can fire, how many bullets fire at once, how fast the weapon reloads, and more. In addition, weapons have a chance to have one of four elemental properties: Explosion, Fire, Shock, and Corrosive. You also have slots for grenade mods, your shield, and a class mod that will boost your skills and provide some benefits, each with their own special aspects and variations.Combat in Borderlands is a ton of fun. While the game is a first-person shooter at its core, some strategy is needed. Each enemy has a ""weak point"" that you can attack for critical damage. For humans, its their heads. For Skags (the world's dog-like beasts), it's their mouths (but only when they're open, which is not often). While initially combat will seem relatively simple, once you progress the game will get reasonably difficult, and you'll find yourself very carefully having to manage your cover, your shield/health level, and your surroundings.Borderlands blends the regeneration aspect of many popular FPSs with health-pack grabbing. You have shields and life, and your shields regenerate, while your life doesn't. While this will give you some leeway to run into dangerous situations with guns blazing, you can't just stand still and blow everyone up. If you're going to make a rush, you'll have to take out your opponents quickly.One criticism I do have of the combat is the lack of variety of enemies. Skags, bandits, and spiderants make up the majority of what you'll be fighting throughout most of the game. A few zones have unique enemy types, and the flying Rakk are occasionally around to harass you. But for the most part you're going to be fighting the same enemies over and over again. One of the ways Borderlands differs from games like Diablo and Hellgate: London is that nothing is randomly generated aside from items themselves. The maps and locations are exactly the same every single time you play, and immediately upon entering an area you're given the entire map of the zone. Quest items will always be in the same spots, vendors will never move, and even the chests, safes, and weapon caches will always be in the same locations in every playthrough.Luckily, the repetitive feeling goes away quite a bit when you're playing with friends. Borderlands was designed as a co-op game, and co-op is where it really shines. Gearbox has done a good job of adjusting the difficulty in co-op games, in that you'll need to work together carefully with your friends to avoid dying. I actually found myself dying more when I was playing through the game with a friend than I did in single player, because we had to think a lot more strategically and be more careful. Since the enemies have significantly boosted health and damage, if even one or two get through your defenses you'll get taken down pretty quickly.The final thing I want to touch on is the story. While Borderlands starts out with a reasonably interesting story, it kind of takes a backseat to the action. This is somewhat understandable, since this is an FPS game at its core, but be prepared. The ending of the game is massively disappointing. Think Fallout 3, but worse. It's a shame, because the initial story has a lot of promise, and it's sad to see that potential squandered. This doesn't really affect the gameplay, but I found it to be the biggest disappointment I felt from my entire time with Borderlands.Luckily, even with these complaints, the first playthrough of Borderlands is an absolute blast, and will provide you at least 25+ hours of gameplay as long as you don't avoid all the sidequests. With tons of weapons to find, a great co-op system, fantastic art, and a whole bunch of exploding bodies, Borderlands is worth your money. Even when I feel that the game is starting to get repetitive, there's something about it that keeps me playing. Even my plans to jump into the game for five minutes to grab screenshots would suddenly turn into hour long play sessions without me even realizing it, and even having done most of the quests twice, I still want to head back and try again with a new character class. Despite a few imperfections, the game is simply fun -- and at the end of the day, that's what really matters.			"

												I will go as far to say that Borderlands is a perfect game. It took me a few half play throughs to get through, but this is not because the game is not enjoyable, I just loose track of where I am in a game if I put it down for a few weeks, this past week however, I blastered through the whole game, the full game with all of the side quests took me twenty hours to complete.  I am now starting ""playthrough #2"" which is essentially, the same, just with scaled up enemies. I love the looting system, the gun mechanics, the quests, the story, I just love this whole game. Yes I am a little bit late to the party, and yes most people will already have Borderlands sitting in their library, but play it, finish it, enjoy it, it's an absolutely joy to play. You get a real feel of success when you reach the final stages of the game, there is no better feeling than finding a phat gun, that you can rip through tons of enemies with, dropping your defense turret to shield yourself while you finish off another fifteen skags.I seriously cannot wait to get stuck into my second playthrough and jumping into some online games. One again, this for me, is a perfect game.			"

 Long Review  (short review at the bottom)This game is amazing, it's an FPS RPG that has a stunning art style and a lot of replay value.The main purpose of this game is basically leveling up and getting loot.The story isn't all that, there is little to no voice acting, so if that's the only thing you care about in video games, you'll probably not gonna like this game.Although the graphics are a bit old, especially the low resolution texture and shadows, the art style they used (cel-shaded) really holds up the game even for modern gaming.Some graphic problems can be fixed, like adjusting FOV, enabling Vsync and Anti Aliasing, but personally I haven't tried them because I didn't feel it was neccessary. Negative Points There are a few problems with the game, so I'm gonna list what mostly bothered *me*, maybe you won't care about these problems, and maybe you won't experience them, so it's just my opinion. Some glitches happen sometimes, the worst I got was in the Underdome DLC where enemies would spawn/fly off outside the arena and there's no way you could kill them, and you'd have to do it all over again (can take up to 3 hours) Some of the achievements are ridiculous, like the Claptrap's New Robot Revolution DLC where you have to collect a bunch of *VERY* rare drops  (like pizzas and bobbleheads)  and I haven't gotten all of these achievements yet, even though I've already put hours into drawn-out farming and grinding. The Underdome DLC has these ""larger challenges"" where you basically have to play 3 hours back-to-back, 3 times (so 9 hours in total, #Maths) and if you quit or disconnect (or get the above glitch) you'll have to do it all over again, which is just painful. The DLCs don't have any ""Fast Travel"", so you'll spend a *LOT* of time just running around from place to place, especially in ""The Secret Armory of General Knoxx"", which to be fair, has a lot of ""Catch A Ride"" stations (for cars), but it still takes too long to get somewhere. Positive Points And now my most favourite things this game has to offer The variety of weapons: which is what -I believe- makes this game standout. Replay value: when you finish the game, which is a quite linear mission flow with a bunch of side missions, you get to play it again in a second ""Playthrough"". you get to keep your weapons, keep your level, skills, and basically everything from the first playthrough, but you'll face stronger opponents and better loot. and this system works perfectly (apart from overleveling and making it too easy). The Multiplayer: in this game is what I would call ""Perfect"", the entire party gets experience from every single kill, and they all get cash from loot and doing missions, the only thing not shared is the loot itself, which I still prefer, especially since different classes require different weapons/gear. The DLC: is really good, it's almost the ideal DLC a gamer would want: it adds a lot of content, increases level cap, adds more weapons, interesting backstory, more achievements etc.. the game by itself is really good, but with the DLC it's even better.The game is not very long, but it takes a decent amount of time to 100%.And it is a LOT better to play with friends (more experience, more fun, and more co op achievements). TL;DR Game good.RPG very.Story not very.Friends invite.DLC buy.Collectibles bad.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Borderlands Original Release: 2009 Genre Tags: FPS; RPG; Cooperative; Lighthearted; Action  My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 20-65 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Multiplayer gamers  REVIEWBorderlands is a chef-d'oeuvre of gaming. It boasts a masterful blend of FPS and RPG elements with an elaborate loot system to make for truly delectable gameplay. Complementing the gameplay is the unique and self-identifying art style and graphics, the blithe and cartoonish atmosphere, and the lighthearted narrative and zany NPC characters. All of these factors working in concert generate one hell of a gaming experience that should be able to bring pleasure to nearly any gamer out there.The gameplay is designed to offer both the face-paced action of an FPS with the character progression elements and gameworld massiveness of an RPG. There is an XP system that awards level-ups and ability-boosts. There are scores of quests to complete; some ancillary and others pivotal to the core narrative. There is a crazy world to explore, filled with various interesting NPCs. Enemy spawns and combat occur in real-time, right in the midst of everything else that is going on in the gameworld. There is never a dull moment or a lack of something to be working towards.Borderlands also has an elaborate and semi-random loot drop system. In the style made popular by games like Diablo, loot spills out of chests, crates, and enemies to pile up on the floor for you to peruse. Much of it will be junk, but you must always keep an eye out for the rare high quality drops. Due to the nature of the stat-progression of the weapons and the sheer variety, you will find yourself experimenting with many more and various weapons than you would in a standard FPS.Another defining aspect of Borderlands is the self-identifying art style and graphics scheme. The graphics fit the theme of the game with perfection, as they expertly relay the feeling of zany, cartoonish raucousness that the game is striving to evoke. This atmosphere sets the tone for the burlesquing narrative which never wastes an opportunity to poke fun at the other, more serious games it relates to.  Finally, one of best aspects of the game is the multiplayer functionality. Also borrowing from the style made popular by games like Diablo, you are able to play with other people by either allowing them to join your session or by joining theirs. You bring your own characters and earn your own XP and loot, but the game will be progressed up to the point that the host has reached. Playing with friends, or even with random people, can make the experience exponentially more hilarious and fun.If you have yet to give this game a try, then I envy you. It is one of the hallmark games of its generation and will forever live on as a masterpiece of its time. So stop reading this and get on with it!Addendum: After the Gamespy shutdown, multiplayer functionality has been moved over to Steamworks in 2015, so it continues to work properly.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												The first question that comes to mind when most people see some screens from Borderlands or watch a trailer for the game is, ""Is Borderlands an RPG or a shooter?"" Well, that's not necessarily an easy question to answer. On the one hand, it's far more an RPG than a shooter with its classes, experience levels, skill trees, quests, and all of the usual trappings of an RPG. On the other hand, combat is not a slow-paced methodical affair, being neither turn-based nor a simple matter of selecting the attack button and letting the CPU roll the dice. You need to aim, move, strafe, and everything else that you need to do to survive in a first-person shooter. So what we have here may be one of the finest shooter-RPGs. A hardcore RPG gamer may not appreciate the twitch-based combat, and a hardcore shooter gamer may be a bit put off by the fact that there's some dice-rolling going on behind the scenes (what do you mean I'm too low level to hit that monster???), but everyone else should have a great time with the game.Borderlands takes place on the planet of Pandora, a backwater planet with a character that's a bit Mojave Desert and a lot Road Warrior. Pandora is the kind of planet that wouldn't garner a second thought from anyone anywhere else in the galaxy except that it's also home to The Vault. The Vault is an ancient structure left behind by some long-gone alien race, but it's rumored to contain treasure and artifacts of vast power. The presence of The Vault has attracted the attention of fortune seekers from all corners of the galaxy, in spite of all of the dangers on Pandora from the testy local fauna and aggressive bandit groups. You are one of those fortune seekers, and while it may seem that exploring The Vault would form the bulk of your adventure most of your efforts will be directed at just getting there - but that's alright because Pandora is a pretty interesting place in its own right.Borderlands gives you the choice of one of four different characters, and unlike a full RPG there's not really much available in the way of character customization. There are four classes available, a soldier who uses all variety of weapons, a berserker who's basically a tank and can cause some serious damage with his fists, a hunter who specializes in sniper rifles and has control of an attack bird, and a siren who's a stealth-based character with the ability to turn invisible for short stretches of time. Each character provides a different experience, and that experience can be further tweaked by specializing in one of the three skills trees available to each character. While you can certainly complete the game as any of these four classes, it's when you play the game in co-op mode - either split-screen or on Xbox Live - that you'll realize how well-balanced a team these four characters make. And when you do play online, the story progress will be set to that on the host's machine but the level of the enemies will be adjusted to reflect the mix of levels of the characters taking part in the game.One of the great things about Borderlands is that there is always plenty to do. In addition to the story missions there are always a number of other missions available, either from characters that you meet in the game or from job boards in the friendly settlements. Even after you finish with The Vault, you can return to the wastelands of Pandora and continue taking on side quests.The developers of Borderlands must have spent at least a little time playing World of Warcraft, because they understand how much fun (and how addicting) it is to find a huge variety of loot. There are an amazing number of weapons in the game to be scavenged from defeated enemies, discovered in foot lockers, or pulled from corpses discovered in the wastelands. There are several classes of weapons such as pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles, and they come in standard and rarer varieties. Each is rated on damage dealt, range, and ammo capacity, but some of the better ones will include the ability to use special ammunition like incendiary rounds, fire grenades, or even come with blade attachments to increase melee damage. You'll spend a fare amount of time in your inventory screen, deciding which combination of weapons to have equipped, which to save for later or to sell, and which to drop to make room for something else, but it's more a labor of love than a chore. The game is even kind enough to mark loot in the area with a small beam of light, and you'll more often than not decide it's worth the risk to fight through a group of enemies just to see what's sitting under that little beam of light in the distance.Borderlands has a great look to it - it's not quite a fully cel-shaded game, but it has a distinct comic book look to it. The violence also tends toward a comic book style, and although it would be pretty graphic in a game with realistic graphics it comes across as slightly humorous in Borderlands and fits the game's dark, subtle, and subversive sense of humor perfectly. Pandora certainly has its own unique look and feel to it, and it stands out from the myriad of alien worlds that you've visited in countless other games before. And it's not just the look of planet that makes Pandora, Pandora - everything from your chipper robot guide to the colorful locals to the mysterious woman who appears to you in brief visions, makes exploring Pandora a very interesting experience.Highly Recommended!

												Borderlands is simply one of the best games ever made.  They blended RPG and FPS elements and the result is wonderful.  Coupled with a great underlying game engine and terrific storyline/atmosphere, this game shines amongst the game choices out today.  Throughout the game, you're consitently challenged without the RPG elements becoming too repetitious.  Overall, Borderlands is a wonderful game that will have you coming back to it over and over again.			"

												Borderlands! what a great title for a game. I've never heard of it 'till I saw it on sale this summer and I bought it thinking ""look at this guy (-psycho-) on the game's art.. he's a proper lunatic this one definitely must have story"" sadly he hasn't much. All he wants is to throw his machete and blow things up including himself, kinda like mad max movie scene -witness me! anyway...The story is about an ancient Vault in a planet called Pandora, rumors say that inside that vault there is Chuck Norri's priceless loot -who knows! and guess what; you're the one badass Vault Hunter that will open it.  My heart started pounding crazy at that point of the story and then... my journey began.---info---here some pros/cons that I've experienced playin'+beautiful environment+faded cartoon color graphics+realistic enemy foes in foreign planet+four characters to choose +Smoothly 4 player co-op +Great story that made me feel like I want to visit this planet +Open world and quests flow at your own pace. +tons of loot $ (guns/armor upgrades/bomb upgrades/skill upgrades..TAKE IT ALL!+Character Level system and skills tree to choose one per level+Fast teleport system+Halo vehicles! (jeeps)+psycho fellas+funny dialogues and xp challedges-Lack of a codex/journal (lore background)-Unfulfilled ending -Overall easy AI if you play solo (AI gets harder in co-op)-Lack of a storage chest to put my badass gun collection (edit: added in Mad Moxxi's DLC)....It would be grand if I could play solo and the rest of the characters join in like an offline co-op9/10 ***TK Baha would need more braaaaaaaaaaaaaains! though.

												Borderlands was one of the first games I ever played, and coming back to it today, I still love the damn thing to bits.I got this game a couple of years ago via a USB that was circulating around the classroom at school, and instantly fell in love with those trademark, cartoony-realistic graphics the game is famous for. Having beaten the game on that presumably illegally downloaded copy, I jumped at the chance to buy it on sale (Humble Bundle is OP :D), hence my low playtime.This game has so much to offer the player, whether you be an experienced FPS player or an absolute n00b like I was on my first playthrough. This accessibility is primarily due to the RPG-like experience point system, that allowed me to level up and eventually defeat bosses despite my lack of skill.The story in this game is above and beyond what you would expect from your average FPS game. I guess you can't really consider Borderlands a shooter more than it is an RPG, and this is one of the things that is so attractive about it. I would say that the game excels in many areas where other RPG's do not, namely the openess of the world and the fairly sizeable ammount of free choice you have when completing quests (I'm looking at you, Far Cry 3). The humor in the game is also brilliantly executed, and had me cracking up at many points throughout the story.So is the game worth your hard earned money, even if it was realeased almost 6 years ago?HELL YES.

""If RPG and FPS made a baby it would be Borderlands"" The first part of the Borderlands series was a marvelous breakthrough. Some Diablo fan developers of Gearbox reinvented the way of co-op fighting and looting in a post apocalyptic world named ""Pandora"". Containing 4 different iconic characters which you can levelup by XP gained from kills or solving quests is still today (6 years after release) a highly addictive game concept. The other thing is the random weapon looting generator which produces practically an infinite variation of all kind of weapons (with elemental damage, multipliers, rarities, weapon classes, character class mods, grenade mods and shields). You can buy weapons from vendor machines but mostly they are hidden in weapon cases, lockers or stashes all over the landscape or they drop from killed enemies. So you cleanout an area in action loaded sequences (the AI is great) and after that you compare stats of dropped and looted weapons.You better play together with your friends. The game is up to 4 players co-op which is a great experience. Even if there are sometimes loot conflicts or quest solving / achievements asynchronities. Whatever is the reason it still makes fun.Very innovative was the unique cell-shade graphics at that time which gave the game the perfect comic look. Mixed-up with FoV and depth sharpness effects it felt quite modern and fresh. Today it feels a bit blurry but still nice to watch. Shooting at enemies let drop several damage numbers and criticals hits out of their bodies which is quite funny. The Bossfights are totally epic. Everything seems very story driven. Other things like quests of collecting things are rather repetive. If you finished the main story you will reach lvl36 but on a second playthrough you can farm enough XP to levelup to lvl50 and lateron with DLCs to lvl69 (max level).   The 4 DLCs content is quite extensive storytelling and new epic bossfights. You cannot miss all the DLCs in the GOTY version which is totally recommended and worth to buy.			"

												Borderlands is a first person shooter with strong role playing elements set on a distant and hostile planet.You play as one of four mercenaries who have come to the planet of Pandora seeking the legendary “Vault” and its many promised treasures.There are four different characters to choose from in Borderlands, each with their own set of skill and abilities. The four characters include Lilith ""The Siren"", Mordecai ""The Hunter"", Brick ""The Berserker"" and Roland ""The Soldier"". The missions and side quests can be quite rewarding in Borderlands and allows characters to score all sorts of loot and weapons to help them accomplish the game's main objective.In the multiplayer co-op mode up to four players can choose any one of the characters and play through the same single player campaign.Borderlands is an excellent mix of RPG elements without sacrificing FPS game play. It is a perfect choice to play with your friends, definitely worth to buy.Sounds 8/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Borderlands was a new project by Gearbox Software back in 2009. The game had a lot of unique features and settings. A first-person shooter set on a sci-fi planet - Pandora, with a lot of focus on RPG elements. The game was very well reviewed and recieved a various amount awards, including several Game of the Year's. Visually the game is beautiful and covered in cel shading, giving it a very comic book / hand-drawn look. The game took cel shading so far, that people often associate the game with that specific art-style. Thanks to the cel shading, the game could hide behind pretty simple textures without appearing low-res, as the game does not have to look realistic.Pandora is a very hostile planet, as you quickly get to experience with the regular human bad-guys and also a selection of aliens and mutations. You get to choose between 4 characters to play, each with it's unique ability and weapons. There is a leveling system where you gain experience and level up specific perks for your character and set-up. When you level up, so does your enemies, and occasionally you encounter a 'Badass' (stronger and more dangerous than the regular), as well as a bunch of unique variants and bosses. This game rewards you with more loot than your grannies wrinkles. You will drown in a sea of a billion different weapons, with different ammo types, reload speeds, firing speeds, scope zooms, damage etc. IT NEVER ENDS! There are 4 types of bonus damage; fire, explosion, shock and corrosion, all with an advantage and disadvantage to specific enemies. Luckily, you don't wear or find any armor in the game, only a shield and health augmentation, that has about as many billion combinations as the weapons.A lot of people compare Borderlands with Fallout 3. They are in reality very different from one another. Borderlands is very humoristic and bright, while still being twisted and deteriorated. This game is not set in a post-apocalyptic world that has been beautiful. Pandora itself never was a peaceful place, and the name should hint it's secrets within. Borderlands never really focus on a good story either, it's just about the loot, man, the LOOT!This game shows it qualities when played in Co-op, where 4 people can do all this nonsense together. It really starts feeling like an MMO RPG when fighting the harder bosses in co-op, grinding everywhere - and then then rewarded with loot. There even is PVP arenas for fighting over the loot too. If co-op is not an option you can still enjoy it in Single-Player.Pick this up if you are interested in a unique experience, with friends - or without - with a ton of loot and silly things to shoot.Note: Borderlands is the prequel to Borderlands 2, you might be looking into that game too.

												Updated review.Borderlands has to be one of the best RPG's that utilises guns out there. It's up my list with STALKER and Fallout, though the settings here are completely different!9/10 art style and personality; very original all around and it sticks with you; funny and relaxed; the only game that has a better personality is I think Portal 8/10 sound effects, music, voice; it all blends in to form this captivating world8/10 game mechanics; leveling like the classic RPG's have, meaning getting imba in just a few levels and also grinding IS part of the game, guns are fun to customize, combat is visceral with varied enemies and missions, quests are a little boring they look  more like MMO quests but there is a multiplayer option which is the best way to play with a few friendsNot that different from Borderlands 2. You're getting the same experience if you play BL1Not very immersive, but extremely fun to play. Great multiplayer. It can really drain hours from your life without you noticing at all.			"

												+Great introduction to the world of Borderlands+Best shooter rpg ever (+Great comedy) +Many Guns and loot!+One of the best CO-OP experiences ever for 4 people+Graphics seem unique and the game doesn't feel that older because of that also+All characters (Hunter, Sireen, Berserker and Soldier) seem unique and are awesome in the own way, and yet they keep it simple at the same time - Wanna go with your fists and guns blazing? Go with Brick.. Want to Snipe and have the best bird pal? Go Mordecai.. Want to be the best pal for your teammates and be good with every gun? Go with Roland.. Last but definetly not the least (imo the best) want to go with elemental SMG and destroy everything? Go Lilith, she's the boss!+NPCs are interesting and a hell of fun - for example Athena, TK, Tannis, Claptrap, General Knoxx, Scooter +Boss fights are fun and challenging+So many references and jokes+DLCs are top notch! Except ""The Underdome"" - IMO it goes like this: Zombie Island of Dr.Ned>The Secret Armory of General Knoxx>Claptra's Robot Revolution>Moxxi's underdome- Story may not be the best thing in the game, seems rushed some parts of the game- Respawning mechanism seem broken at times, when you've just killed the enemies, and then you leave the area, comeback, and baam here they are again- The Underdome DLC it's just awful, so much grinding for so little reward, and repetitive as hell- Way too much walking and no teleports in DLCs Overall - 9.1/10 "

												After having owned this game for about six years, I finally got around to playing it in its entirety.  It's a great take from the early stages of the RPG/FPS hybrids that are outrageously popular these days.  The gameplay is a blast and stands up to the test of time and the randomly generated loot is always exciting to pick up.  One gun could be entirely different from the next even if they're of the same category and you never know what kind of crazy weapon you'll be adding to your arsenal next.My only real complaints are that long range sniping could be improved and that by the time of the final DLC, if you're playing through all of them consecutively, the game starts to drag a bit.  Sniping seems to snap to a grid for particularly long ranged shots without a great scope which is unfortunate for those of us who have a sniper rifle preference.  The DLC is fun, though it's mostly more of the same.  There are new enemy types but the quest format is unchanged and they often feel like very well done skin swaps.All in all, I highly recommend the game if you have a friend or three to play with and consider it a worthy purchase even if you don't.Just make sure to have your volume control nearby for when Claptrap decides that he wants to start talking.

Borderlands Review - Rating: 8.6/10General ImpressionBorderlands is a great combination of the FPS and RPG genres, which mixed up would get a RPS (Role-Play Shooter). I had a lot of fun with this game. Off to the features: The graphics and the textures are pretty nice, they are 3D cartoonish, and well-designed. The atmosphere is huge, there are many maps to explore and to complete their quests. Many of them are side quests, which are not mandatory, but you need to complete some of them, in order to level up with the quests’ level requirements. You can kill enemies around the maps, doing the quests, or simply riding with your car. The audio, the voice acting and the music are fine. The gameplay is nice, there are a ton of missions, and they differ a lot, which is a good thing. You can kill a lot of diversified enemies, you can explore areas, you can ride your car and do stunts, you can buy from machine vendors whatever you want, and many others. The story is interesting, you can play with up to 4 different characters (Ronald, Mordecai, Lilith and Brick). I won’t spoil what’s happening in it, but 1 thing is sure: if you are going to play with all of them, you would basically spend a ton of hours (more than 200). Without the DLCs. I haven’t tried out the DLCs, but from what I saw on YouTube, they are pretty great. I recommend that you buy the GOTY edition of the game. This game also has a CO-OP option, where you can play with up to 3 friends (4 in the game). The user-interface is pretty nice, with additional designs and well-synthetized information. The controls are well-chosen. The engines are alright, I haven’t found any haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. The mechanics are pretty sophisticated, except with one thing: from time to time, you will get stuck in random objects, but it isn’t hard to get out of them. Overall, Borderlands is a nice combination of the FPS and RPG genres, which mixed up would get a RPS (Role-Play Shooter). A fun game! Made with love!Positive PointsPretty nice graphics and texturesHuge atmosphere, many mapsPretty nice audio and nice musicAwesome, fun and challenging gameplayMany main and side quests availableGood humorMany guns, types of enemies, types of environments, types of missions, etc.A well-designed user-interfaceWell-chosen controlsSome pretty stable enginesSome pretty nice mechanicsMany Steam achievementsNeutral PointsTrading nice and Steam items would be some nice featuresNegative PointsSometimes you will get stuck in random objects Some missions are not very interestingIf you level up too fast, the game becomes pretty easy "

												I finished every Borderlands game multiple times on launch. This time, however, I decided to replay all of them right after each other. Just keep in mind that while reviewing this game, I might compare some aspects to other Borderlands games.Borderlands lets you play the story of a vault hunter, while shooting your way through thousands of enemy's and looting everything they drop. And you will be looting. A lot. Borderlands has tons of loot, and millions of different guns, shields, grenades and more. Loot comes from killing enemy's, completing missions and opening thousands of chests, containers etc.  One downside to the loot system in this Borderlands is, after a while you've seen about everything since weapons start playing the same. In future Borderlands games, weapons have a lot more weird effects and abilities. This causes the loot to be even more interesting and random, since you keep finding new and unique weapons. Future Borderlands games also have even more loot, so more chances for awesome guns! Nevertheless there's still plenty of awesome loot in this Borderlands! Before the game starts, you have the ability to choose from one of the hero's to play with. Each hero has unique skills and abilities to level up and use. Although some skills you can unlock feel kind a useless.Borderlands is the most fun with friends. Comparing your weapons, deciding who gets the loot etc. The game has some really great humor to enjoy with friends as well. A lot of funny characters, dialog and enemy voice lines. Especially Claptrap is great. He's this funny little robot that helps you through the game by giving information and providing missions. Speaking about missions, there's a ton. Main missions will take you about 20-25 hours, but that's just the start. There's a lot of side missions and when finished, you can start the whole game over with higher levels, better loot, stronger enemy's and more skills to unlock! Keep in mind,  if you don't do sidequest, the game can get a bit harder at times due to high level enemy's. When switching to a sidequest, be sure to remember what the current main mission is. There's no indicator that shows what type of mission it is.Borderlands has cartoon-style graphics, which are a bit more grittier/darker than future Borderlands games. This is a great choice on the one hand, as it gives you more of a feeling you're in a wasteland with bandits. On the other hand, Since all locations have the same color pallet, they can feel a bit repetitive at times, even though they're not. Gunplay can require some getting used to, as they feel a bit clunky if you're used to other shooters, but after a while it plays great!The main game has an ""okay"" story, it's nothing special and can feel a bit empty/unsatisfying at times. Especially towards the ending. Now, does this really matter al that much? No. Yea, of course the game would be even more fun if the main story was a bit better and had a bit more content. But there's some funny sidequests which makes up for it a bit, and the game is aimed more towards looting and having a blast killing everyone you see anyway! DLC's are fun, and add some new locations,enemy's, missions and loot. If you can't get enough of the main game, DLC's are recommended for sure!Would I recommend Borderlands? Yea! All of the Borderlands games are amazing, and so is this one! Even many years and playthroughs later I still enjoy every minute of it! Great locations, funny characters, different enemy's and a TON of loot make this an excellent game.			"

 “If it took more than one shot, you weren't using a Jakobs.” Borderlands is a science fiction first-person shooter (fps) game with role-playing elements developed by the company Gearbox Software. It represents the first game in the Borderland series.  Atmosphere & gameplay: + It features a grim and unclean cel-shading-look in combination with strong contrasts, which results in a cartoonish graphical style.+ The unusual, humoristic events and cinematic moments contribute to the game’s atmosphere.  + Elaborate loot system creates a broad spectrum of weapons and items that support different play styles. + Four classes with various skill trees and weapon priorities offer sufficient customization options. + Well done online collaborative campaign gameplay allows for a flexible and fluent multiplayer experience. o Each of the four DLCs introduces a challenging mini-campaign.  o Solid sound design.- Repetitive side missions offer little variety. Ranging from go-get-it-boy-and-bring-it-back, over collect-all-the-stuff-I-dropped to kill-a-bazillion-of-those. They are tedious.      Characters & story: + Selected illustration of stereotypical side characters with a cynical attitude and wry sense of humour.o Solid voice acting.   - Simple storyline. As if a lobotomized zombie has been given a pen to smear down a one-liner.    Summary: Borderlands is a challenging and entertaining fps experience with (over-the-top) humoristic moments, and the right amount of loot collecting aspects. However, the paper-thin story remains uninteresting and most of the monotonous side quests lack long-term motivation.

												Borderlands is the first game in the Borderlands Series, originally released in 2009. It is a mixture of RPG and FPS where you can play as one of four characters, a Soldier, Hunter, Berserker, and Siren, and complete missions for various NPC's. You start on the planet of Pandora, where you are sent by the Dahl Corporation to locate a vault containing alien technology, which is believed to exist on the planet. The planet had previously been abandoned by several large corporations due to their inability to find any alien tech, so it is a broken wasteland of desert and scattered settlements, with wild creatures and raiders a plenty. There is more to the plot, but I don't want to spoil the surprises for anyone.  The graphics look a bit cartoonish, almost a comic book feel to them; However, there are settings and even Mods available to make the game less cartoonish. Borderlands has a Single Player mode, Multiplayer, and Co-operative mode.Each character that you can choose from has a different play style. There are mulitple DLC's available for Borderlands such as; The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, Claptrap's New Robot Revolution, The Secret Armory of General Knoxx, and Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot. The game also spawned a Sequel, Borderlands 2, and a pre-sequel, Tales from the Borderlands: The Pre-sequel. Even though I don't personally like the cartoonish way the graphics look, there are workarounds for that and the game is still fun to play. It has a pretty good tutorial and very little learning curve, so anyone new to the series should be able to jump right in and learn from the playable tutorial. the NPC's are amusing, voice acting is pretty good and the game has decent music. Borderlands is worth purchasing, for those who like RPG-FPS games.			"

												Precursor to the legendary Borderlands 2, the original holds up very well alongside its more popular sibling. The best comparison I can offer if you've played the second but not the first is to expect a little more vanilla as far as gameplay and graphics as well as a number of small issues that were ironed out in the second game. These include some leveling issues with enemies, forgettable boss fights, vehicle problems, useless fall damage, falling through parts of the map to your death, too much money, random bugs, etc... However, all the strong points of the second game are present in the combat, humor, leveling system, and overall aesthetics making the original a great experience. All in all, it's a lot of fun and especially so if have the ability to co-op with someone. A definite recommendation.			"

												The game that started it all. Without a doubt the first game to start putting out ""shooters with RPG elements"", but at heart Borderlands is truly half shooter and half RPG. This can be either a downside or an upside to you. I find it amazingly enjoyable to run around interacting with the world, but if you're looking to just shoot things it can get slow. If you're considering buying this after playing BL2, you should definitely do it. But there are several differences between the games. BL1 is less arcade feeling than BL2 but in return you get more of a questing and exploring experience. The world is less colorful than BL2 but it's also more human. The guns are less flashy, but you'll find more of them to be more useful. The legendary guns are more plentiful, but less unique and gimmicky. The playable characters are more generic and dull, but less polarizing than BL2's (there's several skills in BL2 that do just.....nothing)Personally, I find the dry wit of BL1 to be a huge step above BL2's more...pie-in-the-face humor. You can see this in characters like Patricia Tannis and Claptrap. In BL1 they're fleshed out and have a degree of sad charm to their quirks, but in BL2 they sort of become walking charicatures. It's a matter of personal taste, and I'll always love BL1 for kicking off my favorite franchise of all time.			"

												If you've never played Borderlands 2 and want to play this for the story or just to expeirence the series origins, definitely play this first because the second game blows it out of the water and you won't be able to come back to this and have as much fun as you once did.It's a decent game and had a lot of promise which they fully flushed out in #2 and it's worth a playthrough or two.

												I've been running this through wine - specifically playonlinux using 1.7.53-steam_crossoverhack.  It works well although the FPS is not great but definitely playable.  Increasing/decreasing graphics options does not change the FPS so you can max everything out without worrying about performance.  The game itself is really fun.  I'm coming from BL2 and TPS so it is definitely a step backwards but remains a great game.  Like all the borderlands games it is built on loot and skills which are plentiful.  Really the most frustrating part is not have a mini-map which makes me keep opening up the map for directions.  I really like the Borderlands universe and it is fun exploring this planet again.  The opening is set in Fyrestone which is also playable in BL2, only in BL2 it ceased to be an abandoned Dahl village and was instead turned into a post apocalyptic environmental disaster by Hyperion.  The game also gives insight to many of the characters you run into in the later games.Overall, highly recommend it to Borderlands fans and if you are a Linux user it works fine with wine.  If you are new to Borderlands it is probably best to start with Borderlands 2.			"

												This is a great game, an old classic, this is probably my current favourite RPG, it's great fun and challenging with many fights and bosses, it gets harder to level up as you go on as do your enemies to balance the game very well. It is beautiful, once you get in to it it really is fun, the graphics are a shock at the start but you adjust to them quite quickly. It is long and it keeps you interested throughout, the storyline is amazing. I've really enjoyed playing so far and it is very fun. It is diverse and at the start the boss enemies are a couple of levels higher than you so it is very challenging. With cartoony graphics it is very unique and interesting to play.I'd rate this game 88/100			"

REASONS !!!! i was surprised at how the mechanics were and how this game progresses throughout playing it. it's a solid buy, runs pretty well and looks good for it's time.i would recommend you buying the GOTY version if you do though to get the full understading out of it.EXPLOSIONS/10 !

Welcome to Pandora___Disclaimer___I put only 43 hours into this game and i finished the whole base game and the DLC but the only reason i have this many hours and not like 500 hours, is because i played this game back on the Xbox 360 and i played Borderlands sooooo many times back then, i might of have put like 600 something hours back on the Xbox so the only reason i have 43 hours on the Steam version is because i played this game so much that im burned out at this point. ___---------____Borderlands is my all time favorite game or may i say. Series. I played this game so much that even though im burned out with this game, i still love it to death. And to show how much i love this game we have to start from the beginning. Back in 2010 i was planning to get a new game, all of my friends from school were playing the brand new Call Of Duty games and i was not interested in it, i wanted something else, so i started watching this series on YouTube from this one YouTuber and it was Borderlands, i was bored and was interested in it so frankly i watched it. I loved the look of it from first sight and i knew i had to buy it.So the next day i brought it and fired it up on my Xbox 360. It was a very confusing game at first, it is an RPG game and i never played one before so frankly it took me a while to get used to it, do note that i was also a bit young back then so it was a bit more confusing for me. After some days of watching videos and reading a bit i got the hang of it and ho boy, did i love it. I played through the whole game, i explored every little bit of area, i finished all of the DLC's and after that i still wanted more. So i played through the game the next 4 times with each of the characters and through my time of playing i never got bored. I played as all four of the characters and finished the game 4 times before after moving up to the next game. But whenever i felt like playing something i played Borderlands, When i made a new self account, Borderlands was the first thing i played. I even played this game soo much that the disc one day broke, i won't lie, i was super heartbroken back then, so i had to buy a new copy because i loved this game to death at that point, 2 years later the disc broke again and then i was kind of burned out that i did not feel like buying it again, but later on after 2 years i had an urge to play it again, so i went to the Game Shop and i brought the game yet again and this time it did not break, i still have it on my game collection and even though i don't play it on the Xbox 360 anymore this game does remind me of how much i went through with this game and how much i love it. If you have friends to play this game with then buy it by all means, you will enjoy yourself and if this is your first time playing this game then you will put many hours into it. You have many enemies to fight and many guns to grab, the loot in this game is total madness, with other a bazillion guns for you to find and collect and use. You will never run out of fun playing this game unless you get burned out with it like i did. The performance on Borderlands is fantastic. Running it on a rarther medium to high end PC and i was playing it on high settings and did not drop a single frame, it runs like a wonder and i can tell that you shall have the same performance unless by any chance you have a 9 year old PC with a Intel Cerelon and a GT 240.I recommend this game or may i say game series to everyone out there who wishes to try out a good game to either play singleplayer or CO-OP. As a big fan of Borderlands i recommend this to everyone.You can buy it on sale when its cheap or buy it on other sites such as did when i brought this game on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Full game + GOTY for only £2.50.			"

												Insta bought this game back in the day for console and played an estimated time of 200+ hours.I think everything had already been said about this game and since i played it before Borderlands 2, I'd liketo address the one issue that Borderlands did so much better in than its follow-up.And that is definitely the lootpool.While i couldn't care less about Blue- or even Purplegear in Boderlands 2,i sometimes found myself drooling over Green- and Whiteequipment.The reason behind it is that when i find a gun in BL2 i can already tell or estimate the usual min. and max. numbers of every stat.But in this game i often times had to check every gun and every stat because there was a small percentage chance that a gun that was seemingly an ordanary weapon, had one of its stats way over the top and i would love to have this back in the upcoming series.So i suggest to play this game especially for people who came for the loot factor.

												Guilty pleasure. Don't get me wrong, the first 20 lvls or so are a great satisfying experience, but after that the stereotype comes rather quickly. Even though the ratings are quite high, I think it is overrated. The gameplay is fueled by MMO-style questing and a complex random stats weapons and loot system. What I liked was the cel shaded graphics, brilliant music by Jesper Kyd et al. and the addictivity of it all. The game is suitably challenging and entertaining. Being quite long it will take you about 45hrs to get through most of the content of the main game. The DLCs, especially the Zombie one, are well-done, however the car one has way too long transitions between quests and the arena one is a complete nonsense. There are many bad design decisions throughout the game that will make you wanna rip your hair out. But it isn't insurmountable. The game attempts at being humorous, using memorable characters like Claptrap, Dr. Ned, T.K. Baha or Scooter. Overall impression is good though, buy it, a must-have for achievement hunters.			"

Oldie but goodie.Borderlands realizes exactly what it promised - a great shooter and a pretty good ARPG. Farming of items is as in any decent game of this type, addictive. Hours run away quickly when we move smoothly from one task to another all the time killing hundreds of inhabitants of Pandora. Lacked a little bit to perfection. Failure to include a sharing mechanism of items between players, effectively deterred from playing with strangers, and friends are not always online. The script presented here is so vague that it is difficult to be drawn into the story of the search for treasure. What is important is not the goal, but the road itself, and that better overcome with buddies. However, if you have a group to which you can always count on a lot of free time and like to shoot with a gazillion of guns, that Borderlands is a game for you.			"

												Do not for any reason buy the normal version. I'd recommend the GOTY edition, because the normal game + DLC would be around $60, while the GOTY which has all 4 of the DLC included is half the price.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now that that's out of the way, now the review.Pros:EverythingCons:NothingDO NOT HESITATE TO BUY IT, ITS GREAT.

												Borderlands is an action-RPG / first person shooter. It features cooperative-play, phat loot(tm), and vehicles. This is a game designed to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. In this regard, it's a success.But what do I think of it? Well... eh. I mean, I like Borderlands well enough... I guess. When it comes to this game, the best statements I can muster come off as half-hearted and wishy-washy. I've always been a fan of loot-driven games, but there has to be some sort of hook beyond the basic qualities. It doesn't have to be something particularly clever, but it has to make the game stand out. I think Borderlands lacks this quality, but it's still an alright way to spend a weekend of four. Oh wait. You're probably expecting an explanation of what this ""quality"" is supposed to be aren't you? When it comes to videogames, originality can only go so far. Oft-times, we just have to accept the fact that not every game we play is going to be completely unique and excellent. Sometimes we end up buying games because they look interesting, are in a genre we enjoy, or our friends are playing them. Borderlands is a perfect example.To me, the words perfect and mediocre, are two sides of the same coin. Today's perfection is tomorrow's mediocrity. What was once the gold-standard, has now become the base-line. Borderlands has everything it needs to accomplish its goal of being a competent FPS Lootemup, and nothing more. The shooting mechanics aren't anything brilliant, the controls are acceptable, and the story/writing serve their purpose. The skill-tree system is neat, but only in a ""that makes sense"" sort of way. The build you create isn't really important, because the same two or three abilities tend to dominate every encounter.The guns, the aspect that should set this game apart from the pack, are merely okay. One commonality among loot-based games (especially more recent ones), is that very few character-builds actually use their weapon. By that I mean the sword, polearm, or otherwise is merely a stat-boosting piece of equipment. Usually, the player just uses their skills in order to kill enemies, instead of swinging a large piece of metal around. Practically the sole method of killing in Borderlands is through the usage of guns. Unfortunately, 98% of them are useless. This is especially true of the ""gimmick"" guns dropped by bosses. More often than not, you're going with the standard weapons, just because they're actually effective. In other words, instead of swinging the boring swords, you have to fire the boring guns. The inability to create an identity through play-style is the #1 reason why this game fails to stand out. A game like Borderlands could have really benefitted from more intricate level-designs, as well as a greater level of depth in terms of controls. I'm thinking that the developers could have come up with all sorts of crazy manuevers to pull off. Sliding, air-dashes, back-flips, shoulder-charges, some parkour stunts, you get the idea. Not all of these moves would have to be in the game, but even a couple of them would have lended more dynamism to the combat. This would also make the maps more fun to explore, well... if there was more to them besides wide-open spaces to catch a ride(tm) through, or the bog-standard ""rooms filled of cover"" that's in every other FPS. The RPG elements, while appreciated, sometimes make the game feel too much like an MMO. I know it's just a guideline, but when everything has a level suggestion next to it, the atmosphere is lost. While I always enjoy the immediate pleasures of leveling up and finding better gear, the world-building gets pushed away. Didn't TellTale make a Borderlands game that addresses this very concern? Hm... Perhaps I should look into it.When a game makes an attempt to stand out, it can instead become flawed. The developer tried something different, and either it was a bad idea to begin with, or they didn't quite get it right. Borderlands doesn't take these risks. It's a perfectly mediocre product that delivers enough incentivization to keep gamers playing, it doesn't strive to do any more than that. I don't think that makes this game worthy of praise, but I still enjoyed it well enough... I guess.			"

												Borderlands leaves me with mixed feelings. I had a great time playing it – when I wasn't bored by endless fetch-quests, easy combat and (in the DLC) re-used bosses.I enjoyed the weapons the most. They feel and fire great, with a lot of variety. There's a finite amount of cash, so most of your weapons will be found via looting. And there is a TON of stuff to loot. Any fallen enemy drops loot, from bandits to wild animals. And if you find a stash, well, you just might land yourself a rare. Sniper rifles have a fixed zoom, though. The game world is huge and drab; a real wasteland. The visual style is still unique (even with Telltale using a similar hand-drawn, cell-shaded look for most of their games). It was a little jarring at first, but after a few hours I found the graphics very appealing. And light on system resources. I am able to run Borderlands at max settings @1440p on an R7 260X! Borderlands is just not that demanding.Getting around the huge world isn't a problem; Scooter's vehicle terminals are everywhere, making it very easy to “Git you one!” But why are we traversing the gameworld? Fetch-quests, mostly. “Bring me 20 fish!” “Destroy 3 fuel tanks!” “Find 20 parts!” They're not all fetch-quests, of course, but there's quite a bit of padding. The attraction was supposed to lie in the combat (and looting) while completing the quests. Which is fine, except the combat is easy. If you do a few side-quests and suddenly find yourself 2 or more levels higher than recommended, you'll breeze through the missions. Co-op play is supposed to mean harder enemies and better loot; I found co-op even easier.I'd heard so much about how good the characters of Borderlands are, and they're there, but barely; the characters are the start- and end-points of the missions, but that's it. You'll barely even see a cut-scene with them (except in some of the DLC). Claptraps are everywhere, and they're obviously designed to be cute. What about the story? Well, you're looking for a vault; think of it as a box. You're on a planet named “Pandora”. Put the two together, and hopefully you won't be too disappointed when you finally get to the vault after an endless level of “guardians”. So, I have mixed feelings about Borderlands. I found it tremendously fun in co-op, though, so if you have a few friends who want to run around together shooting and looting, grab it by all means. If you're planning to solo most of it, it will be a solitary, easy grind for loot. Not a bad thing if that's what you're looking for; if you were hoping for more, though, you'll be disappointed.""Wait, you forgot about your reference to 'recycled bosses'!""Read on.On DLC:There are four DLC, all of them substantial additions to the main game; campaigns are large (as are the rewards) and well worth the purchase – especially if you're buying the game for its co-op.Some problems with the DLC, though:- No fast travel. Wait, wtf? That's right. You fast travel to the start of the DLC campaign, but within the DLC, there is no fast-travel, meaning you'll spend a lot of time running (or driving). If you pass a save-point deep within a level, and quit your game, the next time you load your save, you'll be back at the beginning of the DLC, and have to run / drive all the way back to where you were when you saved. - RECYCLED BOSSES. You'll re-fight the boss from the main campaign, and in the Claptrap Robot Revolution DLC, you'll also re-fight the bosses from The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned and The Secret Armory of General Knoxx – sometimes even multiple times! Borderlands tries to be self-deprecating as it does this, but it doesn't change the fact that they're re-using assets. It reeks of being cheap. Did the devs seriously think we would swallow the EXACT same boss three times without complaining? Come on.Get the GOTY edition. When on sale, it's only a few dollars more, and it includes everything.			"

												Borderlands retains its value through intricate skill trees for the time of release, mounds of loot, and its crude, dark humor. We're talking psychotic bandit lords with spiked nipples.In comparison, Borderlands 2 is more colorful, it has dedicated focus on a villain, and the skill trees have extra variety. However, the first game rewards useful weapons more often, bolstering the arcade experience. As for the setting, you might even find the desolateness of Borderlands to be more fitting for the vault hunters.Grab the GOTY on sale, for the DLCs introduce more guns and class modifications, as well as environments with new enemies. Don't look for a memorable story, but instead enjoy the spirited action present in all Borderlands games.			"

												I guess that since I now have over 340 hours on Borderlands, I ought to write a review for it.  As you can guess, yes, I recommend it.  It's a really good First Person Shooter and plays well even today (2016).  If you're wondering whether you should play this before Bordlerlands 2, I'd say yes.  It's not mandatory.  But, with what happens here, it will make the story in Borderlands 2 even better.  There are some quirks (i.e., small bugs) with the game though.  But, since it's long out of maintenance, we just have to live with them.  Probably the biggest I ran across was in the multiplayer area:  the microphone doesn't work well.  We worked around this by turning the microphone off in the game and using Steam's Friend voice chat instead.As to whether or not it's a good deal, well, I see that it currently lists for about $20 barebones and about $30 as a GOTY edition.  That's crazy talk.  Wait for a sale or buy a Steam code for it somewhere else.  I picked up a GOTY edition for a bit less than $9.  Of course, given that I've played over 340 hours so far, it really doesn't matter how much it cost:  it was worth it.BTW:  the last playthrough of just the base game took me about 55 hours.			"

												Lets put it this way. What do we want from an RPG game ?  A massive world with hundreds of quest, a detailed power / stats system with unique character classes. Nice bossfights ,fun leveling system, lots of loot and long-term replayability. This game offers all of these things PLUS ITS MULTIPLAYER. And while in voice chat with your friends you can play this game for 1000 hours with awesome DLC's and Playtrough system. It's one of my favourite RPG's even though its kinda old. Pros:- Massive world- Around 250 fun quests- Bazillion weapons / gear- Unique artstyle and designs (For characters and enviroment)- 4 Very fun and unique classes - Very impressive gameplay and fun shooting- Great leveling system with multiple playtroughs- Lots of content and endless playtime- Nice and satisfying sound effects and voice acting- Great presentation- MULTIPLAYER ! Cons: - Weak story- Lack of music- No mini-map (is a lot frustrating then you might think of)- Lots of bugs and stupid game mistakes- Some missions are repitive and boring- Unfair situations (f.e : flying bosses when you are playing melee berserker)- Second wind system should be a bit less forgiving.Overall Score:  8.5 / 10			"

												Probably the 2nd oldest game I still play on a regular basis. Borderlands is a game about 4 ""Vault Hunters"" who traveled to the planet ""Pandora"" to find an alien treasure known as ""The Vault"". Each character has a certain ""special"" skill and 3 different skill trees. Each skill tree supports a different playstyle depending on the character you're playing as (EG: Stealth, Medic, Tanking, Pistols). PROS: Each character is fun to play with several diverse ways to play Countless guns Funny side characters DLC adds a lot of content to the game Great soundtrack Lots of questsCONS: Once you've beaten the 2nd playthrough, you can't start a 3rd playthrough on that same character (you can complete side quests where all enemies, DLC quests, and weapon drops scale with your level, but the rewards from quests don't scale with your level.) A bit outdated by Borderlands standards, but still very fun to play If you're using a mic on Multiplayer it's either always on or always off, no ""press to speak""Overall, I'd give it a 8.5/10. "

												In nerdy terms, it's pretty hopeless. The bosses are a pushover, the guns are all over the place; some useless, others ridiculously powerful. It's a team coop game, but you have to stick with the same team all the way through, thanks to the rubbish levelling system and mission flags. Baddies are initially rather difficult but after a few missions way to easy to defeat for the rest of the game. There are no field of view settings so on widescreen it looks like you are viewing the world through binoculars....the list goes on.......so it's no wonder that Borderlands didn't get rave reviews.  But despite all the problems, it's a brilliant game! The music, atmosphere and sheer playability are second to none. The comic book style graphics are fantastic. And get the Game Of The Year too, because the DLC are great. The Underdome is so much fun it’s absolute must have.			"

												Borderlands is a pretty great game; an even better co-op game. Amazingly good for the brain-dead gaming sessions whilst listening to music or podcasts. The story of borderlands isn't anything spectacular, it's not something I cared about whilst playing, however there are some charming characters to be found within. Aesthetically the game sports stylistic comic book-esque graphic that not only look great, but is a nice change from graphically realistic games. Soundtrack is stronger at some points than at others, overall it's generally decent. As far as being a first-person shooter goes, borderlands does most if not everything right, and let me say this now; reloading whilst sprinting is a godsend. Not only did I enjoy the combat but the loot system is great, always nice to find a better gun, and well guns are pretty much Borderlands' thing. I highly recommend buying if you have the friends to play it with.Those interested in buying the GOTY edition can see individual DLC reviews below;The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned - The Secret Armory of General KnoxxMad Moxxi's Underdome Riot - Claptrap’s New Robot Revolution "

The world is so atmospheric with a clear inspiration from Mad Max.Yes, it will take some patience as playing this game may seem almost depressing knowing that Borderlands 2 is available to you.

												Borderlands is a FPS Action RPG game set in a planet called Pandora.You're a Vault Hunter, a mercenary that arrived on the planet seeking a place called The Vault. During your journey to riches beyond imagination, you'll have to stop and help the locals with their silly and insignificant problems, it's not like it takes much of your time and in exchange, they do help you get closer to your goal. Like in most RPG (and actually not many FPS) you have classes, skill trees, levels and more guns than you can carry... Or count.

												This is one of the most addictive games I've played. The first couple of hours, I was thinking ""Wow, this game really doesn't have much plot."" After that, though, I was thinking ""Wow, this game really doesn't have much plot, and I don't care.""It's a great shooter. It's a great RPG. The ""87  Bazillion Guns"" promised in the trailer are fantastic. I love the variety. A big part of what makes you want to keep playing is the desire to see what kind of weapon you find next.The ending was... an ending. Not much more to say there.Bottom Line: If you're only into really story-rich games, maybe this isn't for you.

												Guns, more guns, and yet more guns... if you have an insatiable need to shoot things and sift through hundreds upon hundreds of dropped items, in the hopes of finding that one rare gun that's marginally better than the one you already have, then this is most definitely the game for you. Oh, and it's pretty dang fun too. Borderlands is a sci-fi loot-fest shooter set on an alien planet. You play as one of 4 ""Vault Hunters"", on a quest to find and open a mythical vault that may or may not hold untold riches. Each of the characters has one unique special skill, plus a set of strengths and weaknesses (better in one weapon type versus another, etc). Unfortunately you can only pick one character at the start of the game, so if you want to try different characters out, you'll have to start multiple games. That kind of sucks, but it's not too big of a deal ultimately, and adds incentive for multiple playthroughs (if you are into making that kind of time investment). The shooting mechanics are pretty good and it's cool how many different types of weapons there are. It allows for tons of experimentation and variety. Gameplay basically consists of discovering a new area, collecting a bunch of quests that need to be fulfilled (though many are optional), completing said quests, getting more loot, leveling up, and proceeding to the next area. Rinse and repeat. Even though that might sound slightly boring on the surface, I assure you it is not. The game mostly stays fresh throughout and the writing is pretty good, bordering on laugh-out-loud funny at times (the game doesn't take itself too seriously). And oh yeah, there's a cute little robot named Claptrap... 'nuff said.There are a number of DLC campaign add-ons available as well. I believe all of them come with the GOTY edition, but if you don't have that version, I'd say it's worth picking them up after completing the main story (except maybe the Underdome DLC, which I haven't played), assuming you enjoyed the base game. In summary, if you like games with a cool sense of humor that involve first-person shooting things and/or lots of loot drops and weaponry, pick this up. It has a great style, good mechanics, and enough content to keep you occupied for many, many hours. A-			"

-Quick Review-Borderlands is a First Person Shooter, which has very witty humor, a great story, and at times a very challenging level system. Because this game is now rather “old” (seeing as it’s 2014) a lot of the mechanics and quest-style will reflect that age. But if you can overlook that, you will undoubtedly enjoy this game.-Long Winded Review-Hail Vault Hunters!  I will try to organize my review into sections, if you want a short review, look at my conclusion, if you’re interested about a certain part of the game look up the specific section, hopefully this will be useful instead of annoying. I hope my review will be useful to you.Introduction: (you can skip if you don’t care)I'm a firm believer in “gamer loyalty”, so I wanted to play borderlands so that I got the bonus stuff in borderlands 2. So I came into the borderlands backwards, started with the second, then played the first.So naturally there’s a risk doing something like that… you’re basically playing the higher quality game first, then moving on to an older one. It’s like if you played Mario Galaxy and then went back to the N64 Mario games. Analogy aside, you need to appreciate a game for how it plays to play a game in that way, and I do.Story-Review: (spoiler free)Something I have always liked about the borderland games is its story, and weather you’ve played the first or second borderlands, trust me, the story is excellent, the second expands on what has been done in the first, but you don’t need to play the first to understand it! (That is good game design if I’ve ever seen it.)The story has humor, drama, and twists and turns. Not only that but if you get the DLC you can to continue the fun with some side stories of your favorite (or new) characters in the borderlands!One final comment about the story, after playing through borderlands, I understood things a whole lot better in the second game, just because you have a foundation, and it give that whole “coming back” nostalgia feeling too it in the second game.Combat: (pew pew pew)I played at least a little bit of each class in this game, but I ended up leveling Mordecai, (Because I tend to prefer the sniper play style), although I played as Mordecai, I found myself testing out many different types of weapons. The initial thing that attracted me to borderlands was the concept of having guns that had different stats and abilities. (And believe me, they have many.)Choose between a high attack weapon, with terrible accuracy, or high accuracy + low damage + burst fire while zoomed. There really is unlimited potential to the types of weapons out there, the best is when you get weapons with unique abilities like bullet ricochet.Achievements: (I like achieesements, if you don’t – skip this)I know not everyone cares about this in a game, but for those that do, I have soloed most of the achievements in this game however there are plenty that you will need a friend to get. I intend to finish them out, but most of the ones left require some heavy grinding. It’s a very fun game that you get most achievements for just playing through.Anyone who’s spent much time going after achievements there’s just that point in the game where you’ve gotten all the easy achievements and everything else require grinding out the work or farming until you get those last few achievements. I still recommend this game even if getting several of the achievements is a headache.Final thoughts:Whether you get this game for the shooting, the story, the multiplayer feature, the classes, or the achievements, I recommend this game for anyone who is wanting to play a FPS in a more “quest” oriented story, even if you started out playing the first, it’s not that rough at you to go backwards into the borderlands, you’ll be glad you did. Fair warning, when you start out it does require a bit of work to get the hand of (or it did for me) but you can do it once you catch up in levels and gear.Best of luck, see you in the Borderlands Vault hunters!------Edits and updates------Borderlands 1Edit/Update September 18, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for  Borderlands 2Here's the URL to see my review for  The Zombie Island of Dr. NedHere's the URL to see my review for  Mad Moxxi's Underdome RiotHere's the URL to see my review for  The Secret Armory of General KnoxxHere's the URL to see my review for  Claptrap’s New Robot Revolution "

												This is one of the most addictive games I've played. The first couple of hours, I was thinking ""Wow, this game really doesn't have much plot."" After that, though, I was thinking ""Wow, this game really doesn't have much plot, and I don't care.""It's a great shooter. It's a great RPG. The ""87  Bazillion Guns"" promised in the trailer are fantastic. I love the variety. A big part of what makes you want to keep playing is the desire to see what kind of weapon you find next.The ending was... an ending. Not much more to say there.Bottom Line: If you're only into really story-rich games, maybe this isn't for you. Everyone else should play it.EDIT: I've now played the DLCs, and I don't love them.The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned features irritating undead enemies, including birds (so grab your shotgun), but I did like the ambience.Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot seems to be all about arena combat.

												Borderlands is a really (really) good action game with rpg elements.In my opinion it would be best if you explored the game treating it as a rpg and not really an action game like other action fps(like counter-strike or even call of duty games).Can't wait to purchase the dlc's as well in order to completely explore the entire game.Pros : 1)Extremely fun storyline(jesus christ so much craziness),2)Easy to use customization,skill-trees,skills,3)Rpg elements that motivate you to build steadily your own character,4)Action elements so that even when you finish the game you can easily fight alongside with your friends,creat incredible strategies and have tons of fun,5)Incredible cel-shaded like toonish visuals,awesome musical effects,voice actors andCons: I didn't really find and serious con that would make me stop playing the game.Only thing that makes me a bit disappointed is the overpriced dlc's.P.S There ain't no rest for the wicked ;)			"

Die Kampagne lohnt es sich sogar 2 mal durchzuspielen, da man mit dem erreichten Level, diese nochmals gegen angepasste Gegnerlevel bewältigen kann.Die Add-ons versprechen auch eine Menge Spaß, doch rate ich allen auf ein runtergesetztes Gesamtpaket zu warten, da mit diesen nur nochmal richtig Geld gescheffelt werden will (siehe Borderlands 2...)

Great...For Its TimeConsidering the release date (2009), I imagine this game was top-tier for its time. Borderlands is unique, it's funny, it's got balanced classes, and a great new mix of FPS-RPG. It was fresh...in 2009-2011. However, I can't recommend this game to players who are used to the streamlined gameplay mechanics and witty dialogue that its successors possess. I tried picking this up three times. It's very hard to get into after playing Borderlands 2. Unless you're a masochist...or a really dedicated fan of the series and wanna finish it just to say you did.There are a lot of flaws in this installment that was addressed in the latter games. For instance, you're given quests to do only to run all the way back to turn in and fetch another quest—and tedious sidequests are mandatory if you don't wanna insta-die to mobs three levels higher than you. But if the mobs are one level higher, they're suddenly no match for you (doesn't make sense). For a game that's supposed to be open world, it plays very linear. Many quests are hard in the worst possible way: mobs are difficult—not because they have challenging mechanics—but because they come in swarms and they have massive health pools. That gets boring really fast. There is no ammo sharing, you have to manually pick up eeeeverything, no mini-map (you have an incomprehensibly broken compass), and there are rarely any voice-overs. The world feels as bland and lifeless as its sidequests—don't expect the vibrancy of Pandora that we see in Borderlands 2 to be here. It ain't there.For its time, it was brilliant and fresh. For now, where quests no longer feel like chores, it's deeply flawed. I see why some fans of this game don't like Borderlands 2—it's sillier and full of memes and pop culture references (which I enjoy). It's rough around the edges but I'm glad I played this because I appreciate the sequels that much more.If I played it first, 8/10. But I didn't so—4/10 (I'm sorry ;~;).			"

												Like any RPG, there are quests galore to complete for items, cash and experience, and the more of these you complete, more areas of the game will unlock. All quests can be completed in single player, although two players on the same system works just as well, as does three or four people playing together via the internet. All quests offer a set number of experience points, but experience gained through monster kills depends upon the level of the character and the level of the monster he is slaying - more experience for tougher monsters, and little or no experience for very weak monsters when your character is far more powerful.The art style is amazing, I know a few people who were put off by the cell shading look but once you're in game it all makes sense and the game wouldn't look right any other way, the characters are varied enough and some of the enemies are downright hilarious, shotgun toting midgets who fly back from the recoil when they fire at you are just one of the neat animations that this game is filled with.The storyline is a bit faint, your dropped into the game with the overall target been to find 'the vault' but there are hundreds of missions to do as you go through each area, most areas finish with a boss and some of the boss fights are pretty interesting (Boss's tend to drop their weapons after you fight them which is nice).

												Gosh I haven’t done a review in a while. Like others say and how obvious it is with the intro and trailers, Borderlands is a game about 4 ""Vault Hunters"" who traveled to the planet ""Pandora"" to find an alien treasure known as ""The Vault” With the hours played I have finished the whole game with a friend and I really don’t know what to say. It has an MMo feel to it (skills unlock and many quests to get with a massive world), personally I find the art style of the game very attractive and unique and very glad I have this game within my library. I feel it has become a “classic game” for its originality and style as well as creating a vast universe within their games. Borderlands as a series is a game that I feel is even more fun with friends and should be at least experienced by all. The enemies, the quirky characters, the weapons and the story give this…feel from a game that I can’t just explain in words. I hope this helps and good hunting Vault hunters!!A solid 9/10!!			"

												This is the third time I've finished Borderlands, recently I've purchased the second game and so I wanted to go back, way back. Also not to long ago I've finished Tales from the Borderlands which became one of my favorite games and got me more interested in the series.Borderlands is a great first-person shooter with role-playing character progression, it can be played solo or up to 4 player co-op online. The original title used GameSpy servers for multiplayer modes. As a result of GameSpy's shutdown in 2013, 2K Games patched the game and moved the servers to Steam, as well as providing Steam-versions of the game for those that purchased the title through retail channels.The art style still looks good: #1, #2, #3. Also the soundtrack is great, just listen for a while.Next up for me is the DLC from the first game, somehow I never played any of them.			"

												Borderland's biggest problem is that it's a loot game that actually OVERWHELMS you with loot, then gives you a pitifully disorganized mess of an inventory system to deal with it all.It's easy to fall into the familiar grind of stopping every few minutes to check the gun you just found against the guns you already possess to see if you've happened upon a small incremental upgrade. While this type of gameplay is inherent to many loot games, Borderlands' poor systems slow this whole experience to an insufferable crawl.It's a shame, because Borderlands is the type of world I could easily get immersed in, were it not for its constant need to scream LOOOOOOOT in your face all the time. There isn't a single corner of the vast open world that isn't stuffed with some variety of loot box, and each one has a bright shiny GREEN LIGHT that sticks out like a sore thumb in the brown and yellow tones of the world. This is intentional, because Borderlands really really wants you to care about loot. It wants you to loot everything, and you will spend more than half of your time in the game opening boxes for weapons, ammo, and cash, really for no other reason besides the fact that it's just so ♥♥♥♥ing GREEN and IN YOUR FACE ALL THE TIME. You could easily get through the game by looting 20% of what you find, and yet you will have your psyche exploited by the mechanic as you run around everywhere and loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot loot lootIf it were a well-designed mechanic, it might be a perversely enjoyable activity, the way it sort of is in better loot games like Diablo. But like I said, the game's biggest sin is its inability to let you manage the loot in an efficient way. It can't be overstated how cumbersome and unhelpful the whole loot system is. You can see a gun's specs hovering in front of you before you pick it up, but it will only represent whether its stats are better or worse than the gun you are currently holding, and only as vague up or down arrows signifying better or worse. The problem with this is that comparing a rocket launcher you've found to the pistol you're holding is strategically useless. Even if you ARE holding a launcher, HOW MUCH better or worse the stats are isn't visible, since your equipped gun's stats are hidden. What this works out to in practice is picking up every gun you see and going through your entire backpack every 5-10 minutes to slowly figure out what's worth keeping. Alternatively, you can ignore many loot drops, but since the game's common-uncommon-legendary-exotic-whatever classifications are pretty arbitrary, a relatively common green drop might outperform your rare yellow drop, so it's advantageous to always, always check. This becomes very, very dull.This might seem like a minor inconvenience, but it affects you constantly. Even the inventory menus themselves make no sense at all, and figuring out how to compare and even equip weapons is dumbfoundingly illogical to new players.It seems like it would have been so easy to design a system wherein the SMG you just found is instantly compared to the best SMGs in your backpack, all displayed visually next to one another in the game world. It's as if the devs knew that most of the loot you find is garbage and weren't really expecting you to think too hard about it, which undermines the entire point of the game.The bottom line is that Borderlands makes the whole process of finding better guns and becoming stronger a tedious pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ It's just not fun. And it's a shame because the variety of Borderlands' weapons are what makes it so special compared to other shooters.Mechanically, as a shooter, Borderlands is just okay. I found precision weapons to be a chore to use, since your screen ""flinches"" too often to get steady beads when you get shot at, and the RPG nature of accuracy means your shots will often miss even when the reticle is lined up correctly. There are too many charging-type enemies (read: zero AI) that require you to jump backwards while shooting as the only effective strategy. Each class' special skill feels very underpowered and aren't that fun to use. And on a whole, animation is stiff and jerky which makes predicting enemy movement pretty hard. The guns do look, feel, and sound good though, which helps a lot.Challenge-wise, it's a purely mathematical level-based RPG, where missions over your level are hard as nails, and missions underneath you are cake walks. There is so much XP to earn though, especially with the DLC included, that it's very easy to only focus on missions that are at or below your level, which makes the entirety of the game very easy. I was vastly overlevelled for the last third of the game, which wound up being a good thing since I was so bored of it by that point.The story is barebones, interesting NPCs are sparse with practically no recorded dialogue, the enemy variety is lacking, the missions are mostly stale fetch quests, the vehicles are garbage, and there is a lot of backtracking required through areas you just cleared to go turn in said quests.It's actually a pretty miserable experience the more I think about it.Fortunately, a boring, lonely game like Borderlands is much less boring and lonely with friends. Kind of the way I imagine working an assembly line would also be less boring and lonely with friends.UNfortunately, I wound up completing the campaign solo since I couldn't find anybody to play with. (I can safely say that my Borderlands 2 co-op experience was superior.)Borderlands doesn't hide its multiplayer focus, with certain cutscenes referring to you as a group even when you're playing alone, and class-specific items dropping that you can't use, and better loot only accessible when you're with other people.I invested 48 hours into this product, giving up in the DLC playthroughs when I realized certain achievements required either heavy grinding for lucky drops or a second playthrough to finish. Also, I was bored senseless. It's hard to explain how someone can choose to not recommend a game they put that much of their life into....but just because I wasted my time doesn't mean I suggest that YOU waste YOUR time.Why didn't I stop? The answer is that while Borderlands is mostly a pretty below average game, it taps into gaming compulsions very successfully. It includes literally hundreds of quests to check off, one of which is ALWAYS displayed on your screen. No single quest takes particularly long, and there are always multiple quests to do in your area, so bouncing around from one to the next ""just to get them out of the way"" is an easy loop to get trapped in.Borderlands also features the operant RNG schedules inherent to the genre (read up on behavioral psychology in gaming), which means that every loot crate opened is a wild card chance at something good. I don't think it's designed maliciously, and one could argue that it's a generous game with its loot, but it's the type of system that will hook gamers no matter how bored they feel with the actual core gameplay.In conclusion, as this has been an intensely negative and long review, there are a few good things I want to mention.:D GOOD THINGS! :DSome of the voice acting feels really natural.The writing can be clever sometimes.It's relentlessly depraved.The arid atmosphere can be immersive.The art style is gorgeous and highly detailed, especially manmade constructions and signage.The whole game has lots of personality, from NPCs and bosses to cutscene direction and dialogue.You can shoot crazy midgets sometimes.

												Best FPS/RPG game ever.Not that hard to play, you just need to understand how the game works, pretty big map exploration, 2 gameplays, a lot of tricks including easter eggs.Definetly the game I enjoy yhe most to play.DLC's are amazing, at least 3 of them, Moxxi's Underdome is just an arena, not some bonus content, and it takes a lot of time to finish all 6 of them. But would recommend them all definetly.100/100!			"

												Some aspects are better than in the second game. The weapons look less like toy guns and more like actual guns. The random loot is more useful. The main story is way weaker, but I enjoy the DLCs more. Overall, if you want the ""hardcore"" loot-grinding-FPS gameplay, there is no reason to pick this over the second game, since it is superior regarding the core gameplay. But if you just wanna do some casual shooting n' looting on Pandora, this one is just as good, sometimes even better.If you have a weaker computer, or a lesser budget, yet still want the ""borderlands vibe"", then this game is for all intents and purposes, the same as the second.

I strongly recommend to play every character, so you can add replay value to an awesome and epic game. And wait until you begin a second playthrough  with any character. The game will feel new.

												This game is a diamond in the rough among shooters not only does it mix two completely different geners it manages to hook you into the game from the start. Borderlands has a large amount of replayability due to the amount of characters to try, multiplayer, and endless amounts of dlc. If you are a fan of action packed shoot 'em ups and comedy this is the game for you!			"

Classic shooter with the most guns EVEREven after all these years, the original Borderlands feels like a true classic, playing it like coming home - even for a short time - to a well-known spot. The story is more than decent, although a bit drawn-out: you're a vault-hunter, lookng for the ultimate prize on a most inhostible planet, Pandora. You make progress through the vast landscapes of the planet, fighting lots and lots of monsters, bad-guys, and some VERY badass bossess (they're even labelled as such!). The actual fighting and shooting is extremely well done: every gun, every type of weapon has a great ""feeling"" to it and firing it is very satisying.But there is more, much more to Borderlands. First of all, there are literally thousands, nay, hundreds of thousands of guns waiting to be looted. The game makes use of a random-generated drop-system, with ligher level enemies dropping more interesting and more unique loot. These are devided into several colours, with white being the most common ones, and going right up to purple and very rare green items. This system just works perfectly for me: it's so satisfying to keep on fighting, just hoping for that even better gun to drop.But Borderlands is not only a very well crafted first-person shooter, it's also a RPG up to a certain extent. There is some sort of levelling-system which gives you action points, to be invested in better skills. You can also choose from four quite different classes at the beginning of the game, and having played each of them, I can say that all four have a unique feel to them. This really augments the singleplayer experience! As for multiplayer, it's almost - but not quite! - dead by now, but you really want this game for the immersive, action-packed singleplayer. Highly recommended!Gameplay: 25/30Graphics: 16/20 (shell-shaded and very atmospheric, but sometimes a tad dull, brown and grey)Sound: 7/10 (I like the totally different gun-sounds, but ambietent sounds could have been better)Replayability/longelivety: 14/20 singleplayer has really tons of gameplay, potentially you could play four times as each class)Technical/stability: 18/20 (very smooth experience, tons of options to scale according to your rig)Overall: 80/100Played on a Intel Core2 Duo @2,66 GHz; Radeon HD 5850 & 4GB RAM			"

												Game Time as of this review: about 114 Hours Achievements: 80 / 80 — Some good humor in some spots in the game, especially in the Knoxx DLC. Wacky characters and some funny references. — It feels pretty satisfying to melt enemies and bosses with insane amounts of bullets. Ammo is abundant in the world, especially when you can cheat the RNG making it so you always get bullets for the weapon types you want. After a while, bullets become unnecessary if you use an Ammo Regeneration mod, making it less annoying since you don’t have to keep looting it. — Looting is this game’s major annoyance. Press a button to loot an item, and then repeat the process for each other item scattered on the ground. Certain enemies, like bosses, drop a ton of stuff, making it so you’ll spend most of your time in Pandora looking at the ground and looting. You can hold the loot button to execute an area loot, but the range is extremely short and you inventory is very small, meaning you’ll stop being able to loot items after half a dozen of these, at best. — The loot/weapon system is a mess. Weapons have a huge array of variable stats, including shooting speed, magazine ammo capacity, inventory ammo capacity, damage per bullet, bullet accuracy, bullet lag (I’ll come back to this one later) and elemental damage. The first time you play through the game, you obviously won’t have any idea of which elements are effective against each type of enemy. Making things worse, you can only equip four weapons at once (late game, 2 weapons early game), meaning you will also spend a lot of time swapping guns every time you enter a different area. No, you don’t get to use your favorite gun all of the time. It just doesn’t work. Also, seeing as your inventory is very small even after fully upgraded (by saving Claptraps) most of it will be filled with guns of various types and elements that you will need, making it so you have close to zero inventory space for loot and have to keep running back to vending machines to sell your crap. Loot rarity is also mostly non-functional, since, thanks to randomly assigned bonuses, it is possible for the crappiest low level weapon be stupidly good until 20 levels later, due to RNG. — Bullet lag. That’s right. Some genius at Gearbox thought it was a good idea to make each type of gun have a different bullet lag. If you shoot a medium distance object with a rifle, it will take way longer that it’s supposed to for the bullet to reach it. Even with a sniper, it’s near impossible to hit a non-stationary enemy at long distance. And forget about hitting moving targets with SMGs, unless you’re literally on their faces. What were they thinking, honestly. — Quick Travel is a blessing, but it’s not present in the Knoxx DLC, which by coincidence, has Kilometers of highways and makes you travel for a long time every time a mission asks you to go somewhere (very often). Also the missions tend to be repetitive and sometimes you have to kill every boss in an enemy base every time you get a mission to do anything in said base. Also, having to go through the base game twice and then going through all the DLCs to reach the level cap. Also, weird level sync where monsters are always 2-3 levels above you making them excessively hard to kill…… — Heavy Texture popping, especially after loadings, collision detection problems, where a small rock or piece of metal on the floor will bring you to a grinding halt, which means certain death against most bosses. — Most achievements involve hours of mindless grinding and some are virtually impossible unless you use exploits or design flaws. And even then the Coliseum achievements take several hours of uninterrupted play. — Multiplayer scaling is weird, making every enemy have several times more health, meaning that unless you and the other players are always focusing fire, each individual enemy becomes near-impossible to kill, unless you have infinite ammo or an ammo regen mod. So there you have it. There’s no doubt the game has a lot of problems. I haven’t found time to start on Borderlands 2 yet, but I trust many of these issues are no longer present in the sequel. That being said it was a fairly poor first attempt taking into account that we’re talking about Gearbox. Complete Review @ http://blurbarians.blogspot.pt/2015/05/borderlands.html#more "

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | *2* 3] = ~62% (50%-75%)A pure shoot-and-loot game. Even though this review is mostly for Borderlands 1, it applies to all three, so I copied it to all three. Since the games have been out for quite a while, there are convenient bundles with two or all three of them etc., make sure you check them out before purchasing.At first, I didn't get ""it"" and thought that the game sucks. I thought it was just a generic shooter (and once again with failed FOV - *sigh*) with gimmicky cartoon shader, very generic loot containers, guns with somewhat randomized values, and the super obvious fetch quest cliché.But then, a year later, I tried again - and I got ""it"". It's a well done generic shooter (whose FOV can be edited in a file) with an interesting fun-depressing otherworldly feel, cartoon shader, reliably balanced generic loot containers, a surprisingly powerful procedural weapons system, and simple quests that make you deal with all these things in various places and that give you some story background. What makes all this work is the whole that emerges from it. It's like acid music of the 1990s. The Roland TB-303 alone sounds boring, but if you use it right and let it play together with other stuff, it's a very powerful driver, and music history might remember you for it.I ended up buying and playing through BL1, BL2, BL The Pre-Sequel (which came out after 1&2 but whose story plays between 1&2), and almost all DLC. No regrets. It was not a perfect experience, but there's a reason I bought and played all three games, and the story didn't contribute much to this reason. It's just the mix of all the gameplay ingredients and - excuse me - the mindlessness of it. A simple but sufficiently deep shoot&loot trip that goes on for tens of hours. (According to howlongtobeat.com, roughly: BL1 20-60, BL2 30-80, BLps: 20-40)The quests become available over time, and you can choose freely which of the ones you soaked up into your quest management screen you tackle at which time. There's an indicator expressing how hard they will be for your current character level.I thought the procedural weapons approach would probably be stupid, that it would be e.g. just a bit more power or range. But no! There are many changing variables, even the weapon designs (and visual effects) change, fitting the weapon's character. Hunting / comparing for the best weapon and learning about where you'll probably find those and where rather not turns into a passion.WHAT'S WRONG?Too bad the inventory interface is not half as good as it should be. Well, at least you can mark weapons as garbage so that you can bulk-sell them once back at a vendor or machine, and you can even do a buyback for the identical price. But what complete idiot thought it would be a good idea to have the inventory interface move around incessantly? And you need to realize: You'll spend several hours with this interface, because comparing your guns is a core element of the game.Then there's the fact that the game will just forget where you have already killed people - they'll just be back on your next visit and loot containers will be refilled, you don't even have to die or reload/restart the game for this. This has upsides, of course, which would be why they decided for this, e.g. now you can keep grinding, and you can enjoy your new toys and your leveled-up character against old foes. It's rather important for balancing that you can't just wipe the world clean. But even though hypothetically, people would repopulate fortresses in reality, you will have to make yourself blind to the feeling that all you're doing is in vain, your actions leave almost no lasting consequence in the world. Just like in real life, right? Except in real life, you don't constantly whip the lands with powerful guns.What also sucks (but again makes sense, of course) is that you lose a lot of money whenever you die. There will be deaths, though, that are just unnecessary or unfair, or you might even get caught in a loop of dying, which maximizes frustration. This happened to me when I fought Wilhelm and didn't realize that I could just travel away via the obvious terminal. Why didn't I realize? I was mostly blinded by the fact that the arena is a place you can only reach by dropping in from a height that you can't jump, so you can't get out again. This clear message and the fact that I was still relatively new to Borderlands made me blind to the fact that there was an electronic exit right there.You can't save your game. At least it's not a classic campaign shooter quicksave that bakes every relevant world state detail into a nice file. Instead, you have your character profile which will change as you progress (e.g. incl. money loss from deaths; hint: If you Alt+F4 while you're still dying, nothing is lost.), and it's rather one of those ""general player state"" and ""checkpoint"" saves. On the one hand, this very character of savegame is a good thing: Checkpoints have the clear upside of getting you more involved and making the reality more real because you can't beat it into obedience by saving/loading at your leisure. The downside is: The game completely forgets everything but you. While fortresses have been repopulated when you revisit them even without loading, there are a few aspects of the world that stick - until you exit to main menu or out of the game and then continue playing, that is. It all couldn't revolve more obviously just around you. And there are the quite hard boss fights. Personally, I don't like boss fights, so ignore this paragraph as an actual negative, but I just find them stressful, and what others might misinterpret to be a sense of achievement in me is really just the relief that I managed to overcome this obstacle between me and more of the satisfying gameplay I want to enjoy. You know, like 1990s Eurobeat ""music"" (That I never liked.) where the painful hectic rap was the desert you had to endure before reaching the next fountain, making the refrain ever so slightly better than it actually was. The game does not have a whole lot of boss fights, but I had to throw everything into them and was often very frustrated when I didn't manage, because dying cost me a bunch of cash, and I had to start the fight completely from scratch.But Borderlands is fun. A well done shoot&loot world to forget yourself in.Not all Borderlands games have FOV settings, but with some config file editing, you'll always get what you want.			"

TL;DRAn interesting mix of an Action RPG and an FPS.+ Loads of side-quests+ Well-balanced for both SP and MP+ Setting and atmosphere ('MURICA!)+ Memorable characters+ Humour+ Art style+ Loot (some items are viable for a very long time)+ Skill trees+ Replay value+ Soundtrack- Picking up multiple items is a chore- DLC achievements- Relatively weak story- It requires an external program to change the FOV- No manual saveREVIEWBorderlands is a FPS game with some RPG elements. A wise man once said: ""if Diablo and Battlefield had a baby, it would be Borderlands""*. This game combines the FPP and gunplay with level progression, skill trees, and tons of randomly generated loot.The action takes place on a distant planet called Pandora in the future. There are rumours of some treasure being hidden in a Vault. The player can play as one of the four Vault Hunters: Lilith (specialises in deception and elemental weapons), Roland (soldier), Mordecai (sniper and gunslinger), and Brick (brute, specialises in melee and explosives). Each of them is memorable and adds to the game's replay value. Nevertheless, the story is quite weak, especially when compared to Borderlands 2. Pandora is modelled after a post-apocalyptic world, with a number of futuristic elements. Its ambience is enhanced by the unique cell-shaded graphics, marvellous soundtrack, hilarious (in a good sense) voice acting, and sense of humour. 'MURICA!The gameplay revolves around shooting the bad guys in the face, getting their loot, and completing quests. There is a myriad of side-quests and even more weapons. Albeit the gunplay has been heavily consolised, it is fun to use all the guns. Apart from shooting, every character has a unique active skill and a skill tree. For instance, Roland can deploy a turret, which can be further upgraded to provide ammo and health to everyone nearby. Moreover, there are weapon proficiencies (bonuses for using each weapon type) and challenges to complete (e.g. scoring a certain amount of critical hits, collecting dollars, etc.). Apart from getting the loot from chests and enemies, one can also visit a few types of vendor machines. There are numerous open areas which the players can explore on foot or by car. There also is a fast travel system to navigate through them.There are a few nuisances. Firstly, picking up mutliple items at once has a very short radius, making it somewhat tedious to gather all the loot. Secondly, in order to change the FOV, one has to use an external program. The default FOV may work fine on consoles but it is not suited for PCs. And lastly, the DLC achievements require a huge amount of grinding and some of them are purely luck-based.In summary, Borderlands is a great game that can be enjoyed while playing solo or with friends. Its ambience and mechanics make it an outstanding title even now. I strongly recommend it.*Or something along those lines.P.S.

												Although offering considerably lesser amounts of content than its successor Borderlands 2, and having a couple of both technical and design flaws, Borderlands 1 still offers a great amount of content for a fair price. The best way of playing this game is with a full 4-man-squad - it does get kinda repetitive after a while when playing alone. My personal rating: 7.5/10, rising to 8.5 when playing in CoOp. Everyone who was too young for it when it first was released in 2009: Check it out! It's a classic.			"

												I've recently started playing Borderlands again after taking a short break, and in that short time it's made it's way in to my list of favorite games. It can be challenging, yet easy at the same time. But no matter what difficulty the mission is, it's rewarding and fun. With the exceptions of some of the DLC missions. A few of them are very annoying, such as Ned's Zombie Island's TK is alive! Brains series of missions, or the Clap Trap revolution DLC where you have to collect Clap Trap components. Other than that, Borderlands is amazing, and still holds up well with games today, and is easily one of my favorite games.			"

												Borderlands was a new project by Gearbox Software back in 2009. An excellent FPS is more like sci-fi FPS, that occur on world called - Pandora - and counts with a few RPG elements, since loot, to level up system. Is great! Graphically speaking could be a bit weired for some of you, i still remember the first time i saw a trailer and i was meh.. but i started liking the details, textures. Thanks to the cell shading, the game could hide behind pretty simple textures without appearing low-res, as the game does not have to look realistic.Before we enter Pandora we have 4 characters to choose - The Hunter, Soldier, Siren e Berserker - that are all great and in case you play COOP, is better each of you use a different class. then you have the lvl up system, you will gain XP when you the main, secondary quest, also doing the challenges the game offer is great way to rank up.  After you get your character, you are now good to enter in Pandora, and i must say is not a pretty place to be - laughs - lot of bad guys to kill and some weird dudes too. about the game difficulty, well is not too hard perhaps if you play solo some parts could be a little tricky but you will do it for sure. After beating the main boss you can do a new playthrough, there enemies/boss will be a bit tough, is like doing transition from normal to hard. If you are someone like me, who love loot you will love this game, loot everywhere. There are a lot of ways to get the better loot, farming boss, chase the safe etc.. Like in normal games loot has many categories - green, blue, purple, orange e pearlescent - and of course everyone wants that orange one! Also Borderlands has a huge variety of guns to choose, so you won't get bored of it. That's it, i totally recommend you play this game, solo or in COOP and enjoy your journey in Pandora. ~ 8,5/10			"

												Like Fallout 4 but feel like it's ""meh"" due to it using Skyrim's engine/ just being boring at times? Have you played Destiny but absolutely hated its looting system engrams and want a better version of its loot system? Do you like goofy over the top jokes with crazy characters? This game is for you! Well... maybe. Borderlands is a great game and it takes time to get through, it doesn't feel like a game I could take bite sizes of and play here and there, it feels like a sit down and play whole title. This game leans heavily on its writing and characters, and without them, it would have utterly failed imo. This was a single player play through, so this is a review written by a lone experience. Here's some pros 'n cons!Pros:- Interesting cast of characters that are rememberable and unique.- The game will break the 4th wall but tastely and not rip you from the immersion. Great writing, and plenty of jokes that will actually make you laugh out loud, no lie. LOL- Looting weapons is great and it's nice to find some badass epic or legendary weapons not given by bosses.- Unique skill tree building will allow you to build your unique vault hunter the way you want to play them.- Does a great job making sure you feel like you're in a trashed planet with a bunch of scum bag bandits who can't write nor barely speak proper English. - Fun unique DLC that came w/ the bundle I got was fun and fairly more entertaining than the original game.Cons:- Long treks back 'n forth from quest boards to waypoints on the map.- Game is not fully optimized for controller support. All interactions will specify pc UI/button usage, and unless you've figured out the buttons and usage through the menu, you'll have a bad time. - This same Wasteland is nice, but also bad? It would have been nice for a change of scenery to be honest. Most of the game makes you feel like you're stuck wading through trash piles and barren, lifeless and dry/dead plains just to hope that the quest you've been treking across the map to get to will be fun and exciting.- by the 3rd quarter of the game weapons are unique in nature and have some cool effects, but the weapons you may have looted hours upon hours back are better than legendary loot? Kind of makes it feel like you're stuck with the same  ♥♥♥♥ for the rest of the game's experience. (Even the DLC)- Claptrap never SHUTS THE  ♥♥♥♥ UP ABOUT HAVING NEW QUESTS AT QUEST BOARDS OR PERSONNEL! More than half of these extra tagged on quests are lame, agrivating, and annoying to do. Mainly the ones where you have to build weapons from scattered parts only to cash the quest and get a  ♥♥♥♥   ♥♥♥ gun you'll vendor 2 minutes after cashing.- Menu for quests sucks in its organization and is hard to use since it doesn't work hand in hand with your map to figure out where you have to go. - No mini map.- Vehicle gets stuck one every little  ♥♥♥♥ing rock you accidently run over (or guard rail) and you are forced to get out, blow that stupid  ♥♥♥♥ing piece of  ♥♥♥♥ up and run your  ♥♥♥ the rest of the GOD DAMN WAY TO THE QUEST MARKER. UGH.Anyways, yes, this review had many faults to pros, but I honestly enjoyed this game. I'm currently still playing some of the DLC before continuing my venture in BL2 which imo is far better than the first in almost every way. If you start w/ BL2 I don't blame you, the first can seem boring, but not uninspired. The game lacks much, but if you play the second, trust me, you'll love the characters so much you'll want to play homage to the first game. On a scale one 1- 10, I'd give this sucker a 7/10. Good game, even great at times, but not without its set of issues. Good luck out there Future Vault Hunter! :D			"

												Slower than the second game, the first incarnation is still eminently fun. Indeed, if you're looking for a good time with friends, you really can't beat the levity and wit of the Borderlands franchise. This first game has only very minor issues (and I'm nitpicking): co-op can be unbalanced with different rewards and disparate leveling at times (depending on what your build is, you can level up much more quickly than your mates). Besides that, rare gun drops are few and far between. Make sure you get the DLC as nearly all add to the fun, with the exception of the tedious Moxxi's Underdome.  "

												I enter a big world, where i had a lot to explore and show the enimies who has the biggest gun. At the beginning, the game is really easy, maybe a little bit difficult, since I  recognize which enemies i can take on und which not. After i cleared of the first and second area, i thought the game would now be very boring but lucky for me i was wrong.  Why? Because on the next step of the story, i met a lot of interesting new buildings, new characters and i had a lot of fun to explore the region also to compare the new weapons i found.Normally, a very good game and i enjoyed playing it, really, but there are more than one areas, where the enemies are fully overpowered and its very difficult to beat them. Fortunately it is more in the middle of the game and at the end. But even at the end i did not recognize what i had to do to beat the last big enemy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For you germans guys :Ich hatte sehr viel Spass mit dem Spiel, startete in einer großen Umgebung, wurde sehr gut mit der Steuerung des  Spiel vertraut gemacht und konnte völlig entspannt starten. Etwas schwierig fand ich es herauszufinden mit welchen Gegnern ich mich anlegen kann und mit welchen nicht. Naja, nachdem ich dann die ersten Karten erkundet habe, hatte ich schon die Befürchtung das es nun sehr langweillig werden wird und sich alles wiederholt.Glücklicherweise lag ich hier vollkommen falsch, da ich in den neuen Bereichen, die ich nach und nach freischaltete absolut beeindruckende Charaktäre, und auch Landschaften kennenlernte, die mich offen und sprachlos erscheinen ließen.Nicht weil es so ungewöhnlich ist, sondern weil das Spiel nun schon fast 10 Jahre alt ist und ich es beeindruckend finde was damals schon möglich war.Da könnten sich viele Spielehersteller eine ordentliche Scheibe von abschneiden. Jedenfalls hat mir das Spiel auf lange Sicht gesehen sehr viel Spass gemacht, einzig an einigen Stellen droschen die Gegnermassen derart auf mich ein, das es mir sehr schwer gefallen ist zu erkennen, auf welche Art und Weise ich dieser Gegnerübermacht Herr werden kann.Ganz besonders hat mir auch die Hintergrundmusik gefallen. Da macht es mir wesentlich mehr Spass Gebiete erneut zu erkunden, da es oftmals vorkommt, das in eigentlich abgeschlossenen Gebieten neue Aufträge freigeschaltet werden.			"

												I remember reading about Borderlands. It sounded cool. Procedurally generated guns? A neat-looking world? Awesome. Then they made it cell-shaded, which was... well, weird, but fun. The resulting game? Pretty fun too. It's seared into my memory as nothing less than pleasant awesomeness. I can't even begin to tell you how much fun I had pretending to be someone's hat by riding around on top of their car in my own.I was the best hat.Finding a loot chest felt good. Spending time jumping around the maps felt right. The enemies were neat, the guns inventive, the bosses kinda fun. It took me a long while to kill the final boss--where a friend killed it in less than half a second. Okay, so I didn't get the best loot on the planet, but I still had a blast. The game was funny, too. While the actual plot could have been better, the story told in logs and lore was amusing, and the character barks were great.Where Borderlands really excelled, however, was the DLC. Doctor Zed was a minor disappointment, not because it wasn't funny (it was hilarious), and not because it didn't have a lot of content (it had a lot of content), but because some of the content was an awful lot of ""hey, go there, kill a thousand of that, bring me back some brains."" This got a bit old after a while. Moxxi's arena DLC was, well, an arena DLC. Not all that fun. But then, like a spark of inspiration from the gods, we got The Secret Army of General Knoxx, which had like twelve to fifteen hours of content, cost $10, was fun, well-written, smart, and excellent. It is still the gold standard for DLC. After that we got Claptrap's Robot Revolution, which was not quite as excellent, but we're talking Jaws to Jurassic Park here--still greats, regardless of which one you value more.Borderlands is still, years after its release, a game worth playing. I still know most of the maps by heart, still have memories of some of my finest battles ingrained in my mind. Still feel a bit odd when playing the sequel and not having Bloodwing by my side. You definitely don't want to just skip it and head straight for Borderlands 2.Only complaints? It wasn't a great PC port, so it had no FOV slider and used Gamespy for its online multiplayer component, meaning it was really hard to play with certain people.			"

												Fantastic shooter with some light class-based RPG elements. Game was designed with cooperative play in mind and this was done very well. Humor is well written into the story and can be quite snappy at times which keeps the story entertaining. Tons of replay value with the 4 different classes and multiple playthrough mechanics. Lots of loot too. Game is a very stylized shooter-looter where the player is constantly battling foes to aquire better gear and weapons as they progress through the story. 87 Bazillion guns! What more is there to say.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played. This is the game that starts one of the best series of video games. And though this game isn't the series' pinnacle, it is definitely one of the best in there.Pros:Amazing humorCreative gameplayTONS of randomly generated gunsUnique characters with skill treesFun multiplayerAwesome DLC'sChallenging bossesInteresting plotCons:2009 graphics (which is expected since it's a 2009 game)Quite a few fetch quests (though not always plot quests)Repetitive dialogue (I know, the rakks got Jess)But I definitely recommend this game. The negative reviews were mainly from people going from Borderlands 2 to Borderlands 1, so you can assume that going from a new game to an older game would make you feel that the older one stinks, right? And if you buy the game, you should try to wait until Game of the Year edition goes on sale, because the DLC missions are really fun and usually adjust to your character level. Happy Vault hunting!

A game that sparked its own franchise - the craziness is addictive, exciting, funny... everything you need!Boasting solid co-op and single player action, it's not hard to see why Borderlands is (or was) a favourite for so many. While Borderlands 2 is often liked even more by the vast majority who have played it, this title still has a special place in my heart of heroism.The story is simple enough. You are a Vault Hunter - a title of some import in the game'ss lore - and you are hunting for a Vault on Pandora. Pandora is a world full of wild animals and bandits (and the occasional semi-sane person offering quests and the like) all intent on getting in your way and making life rough for you. As for the Vault... I think the hype for what's inside it has inflated the locals' expectations a bit. The promise of godly weapons, abilities, etc. You get the picture. Every bandit and his meat bicycle wants in, even though it only opens once every 200 years.Getting the Vault Key fragments is about what you'd expect - shoot lots of guns to kill lots of things. The descent into combat is made simple by convenient colour-coding, ranging from throw-away white-grade items to beautiful yellow and orange rare treasures (and even ultra-rare pearlescents if you have the General Knoxx DLC) that often have hidden abilities on top of their already impressive abilities, such as improved rate of fire, clip size or even the addition of elemental damage.The graphics style is cartoon-like, with black outlines around most every object. This is a good thing as it meshes well with the gameplay style and humour. It's even possible to change the field of view, if you are willing to invest a little time on the internet. Controls are not hard to get used to - as you progress you'll eventually be able to equip four weapons at once for quick switching, allowing you to focus more on combat and less on micro-management. Of course, with the game engine's random gun generator allowing for thousands of different weapons to spawn, choosing just four to equip poses its own problems! Even grenade mods can vary wildly - from rubber grenades that bounce around with no fuse, to cluster bombs, health stealing grenades and even teleporting grenades! Other equips include relics, shields and even class-specific mods that alter your specific character's skill set and abilities.The classes themselves number just four, but they each have their own special ability in combat that makes each of them unique and fun to play. Brick, Mordecai, Lilith and Roland each have Berserking fists, a pet bird Bloodwing, Phasing magic and turrets respectively, and with a grand total level cap of 69 the builds can get very powerful indeed. New Game + games will make it seem like you aren't powerful though, as everything scales to just a bit over what your current level is. It's still entirely doable.I've mentioned the humour briefly. There may not be much when compared to the sequel, but it's there. Some great dialogue includes:""Smokin' Jesus ♥♥♥♥♥ cinnamon! That is a monster!""""Never look at my fist, ♥♥♥♥♥!""""I uh, I hate to send you away, you're great company and all... but I, I gotta go take a dump. I gotta take a dump something awful! Something real awful! Oh.. never mind... it's gone now.""""That's the beauty of the undead - if you kill them they're just dead again, and I just fire up the mojo, and make them re-undead and they're back...""Brick's laughter and insane hooting noises during his special ability are a personal favourite.I probably haven't covered everything. If you love a good FPS (this game is more like a role-playing shooter) you'll give it a go and discover the rest of it for yourself anyway. Which I urge you to do. It's a game I'll definitely be coming back to.			"

												Borderlands is the cult classic loot shooter, where the main goal is to kill stuff and collect guns and guns and even more guns.Borderlands takes place on a planet of Pandora where danger lurks around every corner, we play as the vault hunters who came to Pandora seeking a vault, a place that contains fortunes. You can pick from four different characters Brick, Roland, Lilith and Mordecai The game is an RPG infused FPS. You run around killing stuff and looting chest for better equipment. The game is very fun and getting better equipment is also incredibly fun. The four characters you choose from have different abilities. Brick has berserk mode where he punches stuff and in rage mode regains health, Mordecai releases his pet Bloodwing which is a one hit kill on a random enemy in the battlefield or damages bosses, Roland puts down a turret which kills anything it sees and Lilith goes into phaselock mode where she goes invisible and after that releases a shockwave which kills or damages anyone around them. Each character is awesome but it's best to use the one to suit your play style the best.Graphics are awesome. The cell shaded look is awesome and even though some of the textures are mediocre this game is very appealing. The environments are very bland since all of them are deserts. I'm still very glad that the change from realistic to cell shaded happened.Audio is mediocre, I like some of the soundtrack but overall it's very bland. The gun sounds are awesome and everything but a lot of it is re used and some of the sound effects are quite bad.  Overall very mediocre sound design The game can get quite tough at certain points, some of the enemies are higher levels than you and will kill you in seconds. Your best option is to do every side quest to level so the later sections in the game aren't as tough.Level design is alright for the most part but some of the maps in the later sections of the game get really confusing. Overall it's okay for the most part.The main game itself took me 18 hours to complete everything with every side quest, with all the dlc it took me around 30 hours. The game also has tons of replay value, you can play Ultimate Vault Hunter and True Hunter which are more difficult versions of the game and you can also try the different characters and not to mention you can always play the game with friends which is a lot of fun.The game has one big problem. It's incredibly buggy. I've had many problems playing the game and DLC and constantly look for solutions to the problems I was having. Some of the issues were quests not showing up, I couldn't turn in quests. get stuck in the environments and fall through the levels. Overall there's nothing too game breaking and with enough time you could find a fix for the problems.Borderlands is a must play for everyone. To date this is one of my favorite games of all time. This game is incredibly fun and funny too. This is incredibly fun game and even despite the issues this is a must play for everyone. My suggestion is get the main game and skip the DLC's cause they're not very good but if you want more then sure go ahead and buy it but I suggest saving your money for Borderlands 2. This is a must play for everyone. I give Borderlands a 9/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Borderlands is a humorous, top-notch, first-person shooter. With a gorgeous art style, very well written text and a permanent feeling that the game does not takes itself too seriously, your first adventure in Pandora is bound to be a blast!Although the game is ""old"" by today's standards, it's visuals have aged nicely, mostly because of the art style. The gameplay is tight, controls are responsive, and the world itself is very interesting, albeit it is a bit too shallow for all it's ""openess"". The ending seens a little rushed, but other than that, this game is a good purchase.I recommend Borderlands and all it's DLC, with the notable exception of the Moxxi's Underdome, which is a terrible chore (seriously, avoid it).

												Borderlands is truly a classic. It brings in an innovative plotline, with twists, turns, and everything around. It also adds 87 BAZILLIONONDIEREST GUNS, allowing players to really shoot 'n' loot, and kicks a** in general.Plot:Borderlands isn't linear. You can choose your way through Pandora, and do whatever the crap you want. It has approx. 30hrs. of Singleplayer gameplay for ONE PLAYTHROUGH, and countless more for the 2nd playthrough, four characters and DLC maps. In addition, there are progressive enemies, scaling up so you're never bored!Graphics/Performance:Borderlands is widely regarded as gray, grey, brown and grey. While I agree, it does have some beautiful art, and amazing guns. It can run on the modest of computers (mine is 2GB RAM, and it worked well on low settings), but is also a monster on those 16GB Alienware computers. Lag is non-existent, and the stuttering you get from COD: Whatevercrap doesn't exist.RPG/Skills:Borderlands adds a plethora of things to the shooting genre; customize your character with skill points, and morph them into whatever builds you want! In addition, players can swap out elemental relics to customize action skils, and that decisions in-game result into different out-guns, largely allowing customization. The guns in-game truly allow personality, with four elements, and 8 different manufacturers.Really, Borderlands is a great game. While it isn't Borderlands 2, it's great for those on a budget or Borderlands fans. GET THIS GAME NOW! "

												Without a doubt, one of the best ""Shopping Simulator"" games ever made.    Do you enjoy killing a bunch of things, picking up lots of ""loot"", then going to a shop to sell and buy approximately 4,678 times in the course of a 50+ hour gaming experience? Then this is the game for you.    If, like myself, you would prefer to only kill one type of enemy about, oh, 800 times over, rather than 8,000 times over, the preposterously lengthy and repetitive game-play might wear a little thin after a while. Personally, I enjoyed about the first 30 hours, and only kept going all the way to the end out of principle (having reached the point of no return).    And the best part of all? If killing the final boss isn't enough for you, the designers have kindly offered the opportunity for you to KEEP PLAYING, even though the plot is finished and the credits have rolled. But hey, you still have MILLIONS more enemies to kill and BILLIONS more things to pick up and sell. So why stop. EVER..?Think I'll give myself a slight rest before Borderlands 2. Don't get me wrong...this game has tonnes of personality, fantastic graphics, a great world, amusing characters, and enough good ideas for a good many games. But you really, really, REALLY can have too much of a good thing. And whatever you do, don't even HUMOUR the notion of tackling it single player. If ever a game needed friends with headsets, this'd be it. WAY too much brainless ""fun"" for one person to endure alone.Verdict: 7.5/10.			"

												Borderlands is truly a classic. It brings in an innovative plotline, with twists, turns, and everything around. It also adds 87 BAZILLIONONDIEREST GUNS, allowing players to really shoot 'n' loot, and kicks a** in general.Plot:Borderlands isn't linear. You can choose your way through Pandora, and do whatever the crap you want. It has approx. 30hrs. of Singleplayer gameplay for ONE PLAYTHROUGH, and countless more for the 2nd playthrough, four characters and DLC maps. In addition, there are progressive enemies, scaling up so you're never bored!Graphics/Performance:Borderlands is widely regarded as gray, grey, brown and grey. While I agree, it does have some beautiful art, and amazing guns. It can run on the modest of computers (mine is 2GB RAM, and it worked well on low settings), but is also a monster on those 16GB Alienware computers. Lag is non-existent, and the stuttering you get from COD: Whatevercrap doesn't exist.RPG/Skills:Borderlands adds a plethora of things to the shooting genre; customize your character with skill points, and morph them into whatever builds you want! In addition, players can swap out elemental relics to customize action skils, and that decisions in-game result into different out-guns, largely allowing customization. The guns in-game truly allow personality, with four elements, and 8 different manufacturers.Really, Borderlands is a great game. While it isn't Borderlands 2, it's great for those on a budget or Borderlands fans. GET THIS GAME NOW! "

												For anyone coming from Borderlands 2 wanting to see where it all started here are a few pros and cons in comparison with BL2:Pros:- Much better loot system. Anyone who has clocked in enough time in Borderlands 2 will know that finding anything better than Green is fairly uncommon, but in this you will be find 10 times better and more varied loot and twice as often.- Fairer Scaling. The scaling in this game is Linear instead of Borderlands 2's Exponential, meaning that when you find a powerful weapon, it will be useful for much longer before having to replace it with a more powerful weapon.- Easier to run. Granted this is just due to it being older but even still, it's something I guess.- Cheaper. Again this is just due to it's age, but still, the GOTY is cheaper than the bsae game of Borderlands 2.- Backstory to Borderlands 2.- Able to play as Brick, Roland, Lilith and Mordecai. Awesome NPCs, Awesomer Playable characters.- Modding ability. This game can actually have modded content, although it's not officially supported by the devs.Personal Opinion:- Different feel. This game has a more dark and serious feel than the second Borderlands game. Some people may like it, some may not.- All the Areas have the same look to them. Every area is either a desert-like area, run-down buildings or Atlas buildings, with the Zombie DLC and the final area being the only exceptions. Again this can be a matter of opinion.Cons:- Skill Trees. The characters skill trees aren't as fleshed out as in Borderlands 2, with the major gamechanger 1 point skills not being there. While i'm not in any way saying the skill trees are bad, they're just lacking something that Borderlands 2 has.- Voice acting. The voice acting in this game can feel very hit or miss at times, with some characters sounding cool, while others feel very flat and last-minute.- Animations. Same as above, some animations are good, while others feel robotic and basic.OverallWorth getting if you want to see where it all started, although as a first purchase in the Borderlands franchise, it's better going with number 2. Get if on sale and definitely get the GOTY.8/10			"

												There's only one way I can describe this game so far.... and that is GUNS. Tons and tons of guns! This game is honestly just perfect. There's plenty of enemy variety and guns that your character specializes in that makes combat diverse and entertaining. The world of Pandora is yours to loot as you constantly keep searching for that better gun, and trust me, that itself is very addicting. I often find myself just running around looking for a new gun to blast some bandit's head off with. And the Eridian Weapons.... my god, the Eridian weapons. Ever wanted to snipe a Badass enemy with a bolt of lighting? Maybe you want to kill some Psychos with exploding energy balls? You can do all that and much more here. Many different elemental weapons provide an entertaining and brutal kill. If you like ANYTHING I just mentioned above, you need this game. It's mandatory. (And this is just the tip of the iceburg, there's much more to enjoy)EDIT: Now that I have more experience with the game I can safely say that eridian weapons are garbage. But they're fun to use in playthrough 1. I just got a bit overhyped about them when I first started out :P			"

												Without a doubt, one of the best ""Shopping Simulator"" games ever made.    Do you enjoy killing a bunch of things, picking up lots of ""loot"", then going to a shop to sell and buy approximately 4,678 times in the course of a 50+ hour gaming experience? Then this is the game for you.    If, like myself, you would prefer to only kill one type of enemy about, oh, 800 times over, rather than 8,000 times over, the preposterously lengthy and repetitive game-play might wear a little thin after a while. Personally, I enjoyed about the first 30 hours, and only kept going all the way to the end out of principle (having reached the point of no return).    And the best part of all? If killing the final boss isn't enough for you, the designers have kindly offered the opportunity for you to KEEP PLAYING, even though the plot is finished and the credits have rolled. But hey, you still have MILLIONS more enemies to kill and BILLIONS more things to pick up and sell. So why stop. EVER..?Think I'll give myself a slight rest before Borderlands 2. Don't get me wrong...this game has tonnes of personality, fantastic graphics, a great world, amusing characters, and enough good ideas for a good many games. But you really, really, REALLY can have too much of a good thing. And whatever you do, don't even HUMOUR the notion of tackling it single player. If ever a game needed friends with headsets, this'd be it. WAY too much brainless ""fun"" for one person to endure alone.Verdict: 7.5/10.			"

												I think I've started and restarted Borderlands about a dozen times since I first played it. I keep coming back to it because it's a solid game, but after a certain point it's so tedious that I don't want to play any longer. I'd first played it back before the first DLC came out, and I still haven't finished it.Borderlands is a good FPS. The art style is unique, the shooting is great, the weapon types are varied, and the randomly generated enemies and weapons keep it (somewhat) fresh. There are many missions (ranging from ""kill this"", ""survive them"" to ""push this button and kill something else""). The HUD and UI are laid out well. The four characters and their upgrade paths play differently enough that you can get a lot of replayability. But...Pandora is interesting and exciting. You get a backstory as you go along, if you're listening close enough. And you wonder what's being left out. Was it always such a s***hole? Or was it because the Dahl corporation released its convict labour when they pulled out? Because it looks like it's been falling apart for a very long time, and we're just the latest bad thing to happen to it.But...The characters are interesting. Their random banter fills in the void, and the mission text adds to the character of the world. The human enemies are varied, and so are the creatures. There's no one strategy that will get you through the game, you have to work at it, and see what works. Getting killed has a penalty (just money, really), but it doesn't slow down the game, and it is possible (at times) to get through an area by sheer attrition (though not in arenas and not against boss creatures).But at some point, it gets tedious.I hesitate to call it ""backtracking"" because it's a pretty open world (with a definite direction as you move from area to area), but enemies respawn when you travel back through an area that you've visited before. And I'm sure it's okay for folks wanting to ground out a few more levels, but it leaves me without a sense of accomplishment, because as soon as I move on, the bad guys will be back. I'll rush through areas and then rush back because I don't want to fight the same fight so soon after. In spite of that, I still come back to Borderlands, because it is a good game, and I keep wanting to see if I can find that next gun or shield, and if they'll be better than what I have now.Would I recommend it? Yes, I would. Borderlands is a solid shooter, and I expect it's a lot more fun for those who enjoy co-op (unlike me). And it's good fun even when you're on your own.			"

												First off let me say, you do not want to play this alone. It's a much better time if you play it with at least one other person. Getting past that, this game is an odd gem. Released around 2009, this is a first person shooter/open world/rpg game with quite a bit of weapon variety across the 4 classes you can play as. You have (as I just mentioned) 4 choices, Lilith the support character, Roland the most black support gunner in gaming, Mordacai, the sniper with a cool bird that kills things, and my personal favorite, Brick, a bulky hamfisted guy with a bad temper. Each of these classes have ""action skills"" which are unlocked at level 5. Brick being able to go beserk and punch things, doing very heavy damage and recovering health. Mordacai being able to use bloodwing, a bird that homes in on enemies and does damage  no♥♥♥♥♥♥. Lilith, being able to phasewalk (don't ask me how that works, I don't play much of the siren). And Roland has his turret, which is very useful if you do decide to play alone. Moving on, the game itself is quite large, but the locations are level locked with the foes. So if you're level 20, going back to the start you will still fight the level 1 enemies there. Grinding is also a debatable issue, but it's not terrible in this case as there are plenty of side and main quests that will fetch you decent XP. The gunplay is what you would find in any other fps, exept this has more of a Halo feel to it due to the slight moon jumping and grenade physics. Another big part of this game is the driving, which feels amazing once you get used to the mouse sensitivity on the steering  unless your a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who uses a controller, then your sensitivty should be fine from the start.  Again, the driving goes to the Halo style of control, floaty yet tight turns where the camera controls the car. Now on to the gun variety. I think that the marketing strategy they pulled for this game (and the ones after it) of having billions of guns, is a lie. You may have quite a few guns, by quite a number of in-game gunsmiths, but they are mostly the same gun with slighty different stats and maybe a longer name or a model change. Guns also have elemental effects, as do your action skills, going from explosive to corrosion, they make fighting some enemies go from hard to easy, or the other way around. Moving away from that, the controls are tight and the keybinds are set just fine. Maybe it was just my game or my pc, but voice chat is a little iffy on my reciving end. All in all, is this a good game and worth the $20? Maybe. If you're looking to have a good time with a couple of your friends, then yes, by all means get this. In my opinion, this is the best game out of the current three. I also advise getting the DLC along with it, at least the one that increases your level cap.			"

												Well, it's not as good as BL2. So I highly recommend to play this game before its sequel. It has almost everything that it's sequel has, just not as good. If you play those two games in chronological order, you won't notice how BL falls behind BL2 almost in every aspect, except for the loot system, perhaps. I finished BL and all of it's DLCs and then I finished the BL2 main story and then I switched back to BL again to play it with my friend, but it just didn't feel that great anymore. The character development and the story felt slow and only after we reached the middle of the game did things start to happen and it was the fun fast-paced action-filled post-apocalyptic experience everyone is looking for!Don't get me wrong! It's a great game. One of the best FPS CoOps out there. It's just that you need to get pass level 10 to see its true glory.PROS:- beautiful, immersing and vast deserted world (similar to that of Rage or Fallout)- tons of various weapons (even more than in BL2 and without the limitations of what the combinations might be)- cool upgradable characters (although, IMO, the Soldier's skill tree makes him by far the best, and that's a shame, if you want to replay the game with another character)- cool unplayable characters- interesting story; funny jokes- lot's of easter eggs and secrets to explore- DLCs worth of purchasing (I would even say that they're better than the main game)NEUTRAL: less enemies to shoot, which means less action, but also more time for calm explorationCONS:- Moxxi's Underdome DLC is too hard, IMO- It's not possible to complete one of the side mission's in the Secret Armory of General Knoxx, because you can't access the location, in which it's located, although you could before- 3rd party account/software is required for CoOp- Level caps and it's not possible to unlock all the skills- Picking up loot and ammo just by running over it was introduced in BL2; here you have to do it manuallyOverall rating: 8.5/10			"

												Bite Size Review - BorderlandsThe Good:+The gameplay is solid, the process of getting new guns with cool attributes is addicting+Art style still holds up, even if the animations can be a bit stiff+Plenty of stuff to do, a lot of quests and enemies to shoot+Different classes to play and try out+High QualityThe Bad:-Quests can sometimes be ""get 100 items from fallen enemies"", can be a bit tedious, but they are not the main story quests which is good-Other than the main story quests, most other quests are not that interesting (no spoken lines)-Enemies fall into two types - those that are numerous and pop easy, and those that are bullet sponges, not that interestingThe Verdict:By now most people should know what Borderlands is. This game is really good, it's rough in some spots but the good really does out way the bad with this game. If you are looking for a better game though, Borderlands 2 is technically better in every way, but this game started it all, so I highly recommend it. It's fun, there is a tone to do, and you can't go wrong with this game. "

												This game is fun. This game is fun with three friends.As Left 4 Dead made Co-Op in this from popular, this piece of software nearly perfected it. The only big issue is the lack of a good story. Like in all Action RPGs (one part of this game) the missions are either about killing someone or about finding something. But how the game presented this is amazing! But you have to love such type of optic.So for all who have at least three good friends on Steam, who like the ""Just-One-More-Mission""-gameplay should really buy this game. And also all DLCs (beside the Moxxi-DLC, as this DLC offers no real story, just shooting in an arena).			"

												When something is called Pandora, you can bet your marbles something bad is going down.For those of you who are not so well versed on the subject of Greek mythology, Pandora was the name of woman who was sent to earth by the gods as punishment for their disrespectful actions. Pandora was moulded by the smithgod and endowed with all the desireable traits anyone would want in a person. Lastly they gave her boundless curiosity. She was then given a box (or an urn depending on your textbook) and sent to earth with the simple message to never open the box. What was in the box you ask? Well...despair, terror, disgust, disease, death, pain, agony, greed, lust and lastly: hope. Pandora opened her box and the world was made miserable and the only respite was the tiny bit of hope at the bottom. Now that we have a context, can you image what is hidden on a planet called Pandora? Há! Wrong! It's guns! Guns and bullets and rockets and bullets and bullets. There are so many bullets on Pandora you'll be wondering why people are still paying with cash when you can get bullets and guns from everywhere. The whole point of the game is to open a mythological vault (Pandora's Vault. See where this is going?) On your way you'll be beset by all manner of horrors and fiends. So it is nice that you can pick up guns everywhere and share your bullets with everyone. Obviously I meant: shoot at everyone. Stuff gets a bit blurry after a while cause the game is so vast, so huge, you'll be dragging yourself from one end of the planet to the other over and over again, and everything looks the same. This is my chief complaint with this game: It is huge, but doesn't offer much in the way of streamlining. There is some fast travel possible, but only from certain places. You can also rent cars, but arbitrary barriers stop you from driving them all over the place. So if walking is not your thing, steer clear. However, if hearing the screams of bandits, as they dissolve into a sloppy pile of green goop after you shot them with a round filled with acid then you are in for a delicious treat. Borderlands drops a lot of weapons. You can compare and contrast to find what suits your class best and go to town on people's face with it. Zap 'em. Burn 'em. Melt'em or Blast them into tiny bits. All off course accentuated by delicious screams of pain and horror. What do you mean ""thats grim?"" That isn't grim at all. That's life on Pandora man. You better get used to it, cause you'll be doing it a lot. A funny thing about how the game presents itself is its classification system. A normal wolf-like enemy would be a normal wolf. A big one would be an Alpha Wolf, and a giant, burning and barking monstrosity would be a Badass Wolf. This trend developes, and it makes it easy to gauge what you can deal with, and what will certainly kill you. Dying then triggers a short moment where you can save youself by killing anything on the screen to prevent a hefty ressurection fine. Of course, you can mitigate all of that with the help of some friends. You can play the game with up to three friends at the same time. Everyone helps both eachother and themselves when completing quests. However, don't think it is weird to have all out brawls over who gets the good loot. It is a veritable melee of conficting interests that will inevtitably result in the death of many enemies who simply stood in you and your friends way of riches and glory. Unfortunately, the game is connected with an archaic netcode, to actually getting together might be a pain. However, there are workarounds, but it would have been nicer if it would have worked straight out of the box....Pandora's Box! I am ashamed for making this cheap pun.			"

												Story: The story takes a back seat in this game to guns and more guns. But really gameplay and coop was the main focus, with the story there to provide entertaining situations. To be honest I don't have a great recollection of what the plot was... it never really stuck with me but it didn't bother me or seem out of place. That being said they could really get away with whatever they want because the game doesn't take itself seriously at all. I'd say some of the missions have memorable bosses like slege and krom, who I enjoyed facing off with. Other than that, you're a vault hunter hunting a vault. On your way you kill lots of things. Plot summed up.Gameplay: I like it! But don't love it. The gun-play is pretty satisfying with headshots looking sick. Your player moves nice and fast but seems sluggish when jumping or changing directions, not terribly though. The gun options and types are pretty vast and I liked most of the damage categories. I just wound up using the same op weapon for 10 levels until I found another. Not until the end game did I actually have multiple viable guns. The main way you interact with game world is talking to npcs and receiving missions. Now the missions are very mixed bag... lots of them are fetchy to death. Sometimes I'd look at my missions log and see fetch quest after fetch quest. They really feel insignificant to, with no plot or interesting reward. It just looks like these items were scatter-shot across the map, just so you would explore the whole map. On the other side of things, some missions have more plot significance and have you walking up to the front door of a bosses stronghold and blasting your way through. This straight forward action was good fun and could be challenging.DLC: I can't recommend any of the DLC's outside of the armory. The others look and feel under-developed, with boring mission after boring plot points in uninteresting areas. And the map design seems horrible here! I found myself running doing nothing for hours in these maps.The armory on the other-hand has vehicles! Thank goodness! Also you get a ♥♥♥♥-ton of great weapons. I feel like this DLC focused on the good aspects of the original game, while the others amplified the annoying aspects.Overall: I'm pretty neutral on this game. I'll recommend it for coop play and for those you can easily skip stupid missions and achievements without it bothering you. Expect fun gun-play and some goofy, outlandish settings and characters that you'll hopefully not get sick of too fast.			"

												My Borderlands 1 ReviewSUMMARYBorderlands 1 is an awesome mix of FPS and RPG; Taking a procedural weapon system like Diablo then adding in a tactical FPS system like Stalker. After having played Borderlands 2 then going back to Borderlands 1 out of nostalgia, I can say this game feels much less polished. While still a pinnacle gem of its time, Borderlands 1 now feels more like a beta engine containing the prologue to Borderlands 2. This prologue still has much to offer, but read on for details on my opinions of some of the game's features.TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIESFirst issue I had coming back to Borderlands 1 is the FOV [Field of View] on my 1080p monitor. The FOV defaults to 70, which long ago I didn't notice was so bad on my 1440x900 16:10 monitor I used way back when. On my new HD 16:9 1080p monitor it looks like I have training goggles on that are creating tunnel vision. I had to search the web to find workarounds for this issue, but could only come up with a quick key binding as a solution. Unfortunately, my FOV continues to reset to 70 every time I mount a vehicle or gun placement. Borderlands 2 doesn't have this issue and allows FOV adjustments in the main menu settings.PROCEDURAL WEAPONSWhile innovative at the time with plenty of stat variation, weapon brand names were not as distinctive in Borderlands 1 as they are in Borderlands 2. Most of the weapon models felt reused constantly no matter what the brand was. The weapon mechanics and procedural system mostly made brand name a stat adjustment. So going back to Borderlands 1 with some brand loyalty didn't lead to any feeling of distinction or difference in tactics. The lack of brand distinction made Borderlands 1 weapons rather shallow with no lore behind them.Finding new weapons in Borderlands 1 was a rather odd ball inconsistent process of trial and farming. I didn't realize this at the time, but it appears that even a level 21 bandit can drop a level 4 standard weapon. At least in Borderlands 2, the loot drops were very close to the enemy's level rather than so far away. The feeling of reward vs. difficulty in Borderlands 1 is not as good as Borderlands 2. There is a slight bug that causes weapons to appear lower in level when equipped. Looking into it further it seems to be related to the proficiency of the weapon type. From what I hear, this is residual left over code from a feature that was canceled at launch that allowed players to equip higher level weapons as if they are lower level. The change has nothing to do with the weapon's function, which concerned me at first when I started noticing it.STORY AND QUESTSIn a lot of ways, the content of the story and the way quests are handled felt very much like Stalker-lite, but without the immersive element.  Voice acting was limited and the way quests were logged was a bit too simplistic. The compass tracking system was almost useless to me along with feeling clunky. Navigating the map in the menu was also clunky due to how it handled the current active quest. In Borderlands 2 this was considerably fixed up and even optimized. The plot was all over-the-top brutal humor with a ton of awkward fun. But was only skin deep, consisting of some villain monologue [which was always hilarious], but mostly instructional dialog by various characters you meet. The characters you meet didn't offer much beyond their initial introduction. There's really no emotional attachments to be had with any of the NPCs. The lack of NPC interaction beyond getting some transmission chatter kind of made Borderlands 1 feel lifeless, which was an issue that was addressed with Borderlands 2. COMBAT AND AIMy first impression before Borderlands 2 was actually quite good [and still is], but I've played a lot of games before coming back to Borderlands 1. I notice things now... things I didn't see before that are important to me. I've always been annoyed by horribly inaccurate weapons that give me that ""Naked Gun 2 1/2 - Gun Fight"" feeling.  I am especially annoyed when an enemy that is dead center on my scope takes a missed shot to the point of emptying my ""sniper"" rifle.  It doesn't help when you stagger from every single hit you take even if it's a distant glazing blow impacting upon a fully charged shield. Much like Stalker, weapons in Borderlands 1 can be weird and misleading when it comes to accuracy through aiming. This issue was fixed in Borderlands 2 since you can see the crosshair shrink for a moment as you focus in allowing for a more precise experience with an aimed weapon.Enemies in Borderlands 1 can also feel a bit awkward, but they still have that signature hilarious dialog that leaves you giggling hysterically while trying to shoot straight with an already inaccurate weapon.  AI navigation is a bit more problematic as midgets have a much harder time moving up ramps or even around corners to charge at you. If the navigation was any worse, you would think that you were playing with Doom 1 AI programming. Even AI vs. AI interaction was sketchy at best as the AI would prioritize the player at random intervals without ever checking line-of-sight. Some modest improvements were done to the AI in Borderlands 2.The enemy spawn rate is very aggressive in Borderlands 1, giving players no real opportunity to truly clear an area before another wave of enemies hit the field. This was a double edged sword as leveling and finding loot was easier to do in Borderlands 1 because of the aggressive spawn rate. On the other hand, if you were struggling in a large area while trying to escape back to the fast travel station, you would be in for a constant wave of ambushing on the return trip. Borderlands 2 toned that spawn rate down quite a bit.There is one big problem that has not been address in Borderlands 2. There are a ton of bad navigation issues that involve getting stuck on terrain and being blocked by invisible walls on ramps. On several occasions, I'll get stuck on a hill of loose debris or the corner of a small ramp while attempting to kite an enemy.  I really wish Gearbox took the time to smooth out their levels before launch.CUSTOMIZATIONYou get to pick a different color for your character and vehicle. That's it. You don't even get to view your real model when you do the customization - just a 2d portrait is used.  Thus another thing that was totally fixed in Borderlands 2.OVERALLStill addictive and still playing despite its flaws, but will likely be logging more hours into Borderlands 2 here soon.			"

												Pretty much a must-have game for any open world shooter/RPG/Diablo fan.It's an extremely fun open world romp that can be played as casual or hardcore as you want, with DLC's that just add extra flavorings to an already solid and complete base game.The only downside to this game is how much life this game can suck out of you as you joyfully tear though this immersive world shooting and loot-whxxing.

												My first impression, a shooter with RPG - nah, this will not work, after launching the game, and this cartoony graphic, meh, how people can like something like this.... after many, many months of playing... WOW ..what a game :) The game feels perfect, the difficulty is going up with you, the looting is fun and surprisingly is working with the guns and additional gear like shields. I'm playing as Hunter, although I tried Lilith for a bit, but I just don't feel complete without my upgraded ""bloodwing"". There is also quite a lot of dark humour in here, the car fights are nice as well. My only small nudge would be the world itself. I know it's unique but in some way the one big garbage dump is a bit depressing...			"

RATING6/10GOODDon't get me wrong from the rating perspective, this game does not deserve more than that. (I will explain why in the BAD section) I've spent around 30 hours into this game so far, and I must admit that this is one of the best CO-OP games to have fun, I finished it with my girlfriend and we are still having fun getting all possible achievements and finishing the rest of the ""story"" on DLC content. This is the game for those who have 1-2 hours per day to spend on something and have fun with someone (in this case girlfriend, boyfriend, friends etc...doesn't really matter) since it's an awesome experience. I highly recommend you gettings this game, altho I can't recommend DLC content because it's simply not worth the money, well it is if you're buying full package (in the end you finish spending only 10€ on all 4 DLCs instead od 8€ on each).BADOky doky now bad things, where do I start? This game has some pretty bad issues with performance, whole game was running on 60FPS (since it's locked at 60) and once I got into DLC areas it simply drops to 30FPS sometimes and gets locked down, no matter where you look it's 30FPS no matter what. I don't know why, is it because DLC content wasn't optimzied but just ported to PC or something? There are some connection issues also, party members not able to joinn the game once you start it, not being able to rejoin from the invite section, some items doesn't display correctly for people in party, and loads of problems with invincible and disappearing enemies, now you see them, now you don't. I hope that second game in the series doesn't have the same issues, since I'm planing to play Borderlands 2 also. One more thing to note...seems like developers spent more time working on DLC content than the actual game, which is a shame, they simply put every second into polishing and finishing the DLC content in every single detail, it's much more rich content wise than the actual game (more things to disconer in one area of the DLC map than you will find in the 40% of the actual game), the only problem with DLC content is performance.

It was a great choice, I've made a team of 3 people and we're playing in COOP mode. Game brings me joy and altough a bit old it still has a stunning graphics. I have heard that the B2 is much better, but to truly appreciate it you should play B1 first. That's what we're doing. Game costs pennies now, so if you're thinking dear Player, about buying it - don't wait and just do it. You won't regret this decission.			"

												10 out of 10!!! I played this game for at least 200+ hours on Xbox 360 like 2 years ago and decided to buy it on Steam and have currently put in another 100+ hours and I'm still playing it. Borderlands is a truly amazing game, however, this is based on my opinion and style of gameplay. This game is not meant to be realistic in any way!!! It is a humurous RPG, FPS game not meant to be taken too seriously. With thousands of different guns and and a ton of things to shoot, this is still one of my favorite games to this day. I do recommend getting the DLCs for this game because it adds so much more to it!!!			"

												This is definitely a classic and I still enjoy playing it. I have been a fan of the game since day one. Borderlands is about – finding weapons and shooting things with them! It’s all about the guns: combat rifles, machine guns, sub-machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, revolvers, pistols, rocket launchers, and many that can’t be categorized! Seriously, there are a lot of guns! The gory Mad-Max feel of the desolate planet and the people you meet on your way is the bulk of the story! It goes like A) Go somewhere B) Kill some♥♥♥♥♥♥C) Flip a switch or something D) Kill some more♥♥♥♥♥♥E) Success! The game is fun! Its like Diablo loot with guns! The NPC characters are hilarious - yammering some schizophrenic one liners every now and then. Choosing what weapons to keep and what to toss is the most difficult decision in the game. Discovering a quality weapon stash is a very satisfying feeling! The four-player coop is the games shining moment! Going on a rampage in the hostile wasteland with 3 friends can be a lot of fun. It just feels good to level up, get new skills, new more powerful weapons! Bottom line is that everyone should have played this game by now!			"

												At first I thought this game was pretty bad, I started it with a few friends but in honesty we were useless at it, we didn’t get very far and were playing it in completely the wrong order. I wrote the game off as bad and I was convinced I would never finish it.  I restarted with someone else and I was actually very surprised what an impact the people you play with can make. This time it was played properly (no offence, guys) and the game grew on me very quickly.Admittedly it’s slow when it comes to storyline, it took a little while for me to feel like there was actually a purpose to the game and I wasn’t just doing the same stuff over and over. When I look at it that way, you pretty much are doing the same thing over and over, but as the storyline unfolds I didn’t even really notice that anymore. There is a lot in this game to keep you distracted, one key part of that being the weapon system. It’s the first game I had played where “loot” was a big thing and it being a first person shooter only made that even better. There’s a massive range of weapons with different stats and abilities for you to find, in all kinds of shapes, sizes and rarities.That being said, I would never play this game solo. The co-op in this game is what makes it for me. That is very likely to be different for a lot of other people, so most people should just ignore that part, for me it just wasn’t something I would do on my own. I know for a fact I would get bored long before the end if I was on my own. So if you are like me, make sure you bring someone along you enjoy spending your time with.It’s a fairly lengthy game, and there’s a number of classes you can complete it with. The characters all have certain charms about them, they are all completely different from each other and with the whole RPG like elements in this game it’s a good reason to come back and play again. Which is always good, replay-ability in a game is never a problem.As well as this being the first first-person shooter RPG-like looting game I had ever played, this was also the first game I had ever played that used cell-shading in the graphics, and I have to say that I loved it. I think it’s a great style. I would say that I hoped more games used it, but I’m pretty sure that after this franchise released it rubbed off on a number of other game makers as well.All in all, I ended up really enjoying this game.(Not as much as I did Borderlands 2, but that’s another review all together)I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a great game to play with friends.

												The original Borderlands, while it might not have as shiny a package as its descendents, it's still a fantastic game. It set the bar only to be exceeded by Borderlands 2. Really, this game series is one of the finest I've ever laid hands on. The hours, days, weeks, months, years of entertainment these games have brought me have bore me no regret.The story in this game sets up the second story, which leads into the pre-sequel's story. This game's also great to run back to although nowhere near as much as Borderlands 2.			"

												The game that started it all...I can't say enough good about this title and series. I've poured so many hours into these games and love them uncondiotionally as my favourite game series ever.Obviously this game isn't for everyone. You either love it or hate it. But if you give it a chance it is sure to win you over with it's fantastic Art style, Soundtrack, Storyline, Characters, Mechanics and over the top badass Hilarity. Great price for a whole lot of fun. Grab a few friends and have a blast!			"

												I guess it's ok if you have someone to play with. The driving part of this game makes it a whole lot better, and funnier :P The graphics are alright, very different from other games I play. I just don't care for running around the same places and doing quests, but I'll give this a yes recommendation for those who can pick it up for cheap.			"

												OG Borderlands is still a huge hit for me and many others. Originally this game was a test run on Gearbox's end on its Gun Generator, and it does it very effectively. There are SO MANY weapons to use in the battlefield, some better than others, but all able to do the job nicely. What I like about this game than Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel is that your weapons do not become obsolete as fast, and an example would be in Borderlands 2 when I was level 55, the level 50 legendaries that I was using were weaker than the COMMON rarity level 55 guns that were dropping, whereas in Borderlands 1, I used a level 15 legendary to kill the level 30 final boss. The weapons all have slightly different stats (recoil, reload speed, damage) but otherwise look and function the same, something Borderlands 2 and TPS fixed. The story in the game is admittedly low compared to its sequels, but is still a high driving function in the game, with tons of sidequests avaliable before, during, and after the main quest is completed, giving this game a high replayability without the DLC alone.Speaking of DLC, this games DLC is INCREDIBLE. All 4 DLC maps are incredibly fun, lengthy, and add SO MUCH replayability to this game and the extra price for the 4 DLC is great to the point buying the game without it is a waste. While Mad Moxxi's Underdome is different than the other 3, all of them are great.tl;dr This game has a lot of guns, decently driven story with high replayability, and great DLC.I'd recommend getting this game even if you didn't play for it during a sale, it truly is worth the experience.

												So… Borderlands… Or how the vault cult began…Short review: If you love loot, then your loot senses should be tingling!I started playing, because I fell in love with BL2 and at some point I felt like I want more of it, but already had it all (if that even makes sense!).I already knew what to expect from the game, but I was curious how it all began, I wanted to know how BL2 was better than its predecessor, so I got into it. The typical storyline, character story, dialogues and missions I knew from BL2 were already present in Borderlands and as expected I loved them all.While playing the whole game and its DLCs, I felt like Borderlands is way slower to play than the second game.I think that if you’re used to playing co-op and you play Borderlands on your own, this will most likely result in boredom. I mean… How can you laugh at a duel when if you’re not playing co-op?

Contras:Depending on your graphic card, you may not have Steam Overlay.I’d say that Borderlands could become quite boring if you play by yourself. Didn’t happen for me, but I generally prefer coop games, so I seldom play any game solo. I’d recommend playing Borderlands with friends though – sharing the experience is always more fun.Pros:I had a lot of laughs and Borderlands is generally funny, but humour is highly individual, so this varies with the player. As already said – I love the dialogues and the playable character’s lines (Brick’s simple desire for ‘MORE!!!!’ made me laugh more than once).Ragdolls can be sooo funny! (and yes! That’s definitely a pro point :D)

DLCs:The available DLCs are a good addition to the main game in general and of course if you’re an achievement hunter, then the DLCs are a must have.If you don’t care about the achievements, then you shouldn’t buy and play Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot. This DLC is basically waves of enemies and killing them not only doesn’t give you any XP, but also doesn’t count for any of the challenges.The other DLCs (The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned; The Secret Armory of General Knoxx and Claptrap's Robot Revolution) are quite fun until the point you decide to go for achievements. Trust me when I say getting all Claptrap's Robot Revolution will take some serious farming.What I felt like really unnecessary was the looooong driving in The Secret Armory of General Knoxx. I know the DLC introduced new vehicles, which is great, but the decision about the amount of driving should have been left with the player. What I try to say is – more fast travel stations would have been better.Conclusion:If you look for logic, then look somewhere else. Why? Because BORDERLANDS!!!!!			"

												This game brought in a lot of old ideas, added some new ones, and threw in coop. If there is one thing that I love, its coop. The story line is original but does not play a big part in the actual game. The biggest aspect of this game is the coop and the mass amount of guns. Oh there are so many guns. Add the DLC on top of that with even more guns included, and by the end you have closer friends and an arsena.			"

												The original loot n' shooter from Gearbox Software, Borderlands is a game guilty only of spawning vastly superior sequels. While far from a bad game, Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel simply eclipse the original in every single aspect. The environments are mostly just the same desert terrain throughout the entire adventure; the scenarios are nowhere near as memorable; the characters, although still entertaining, are represented much better in the later games, and the gameplay feels more monotonous and slow. I don't really hold this against Borderlands, as it clearly feels like Gearbox was trying to find its niche with this first entry. Again, this game is not incompetently made. It still can be some good fun, especially with some friends. It just happens to be the first game in its series, with the sequels improving every single aspect of the groundwork. I would recommend playing this game, particularly if you've never played a Borderlands game before. But only to be able to understand and appreciate what the original did and all of the improvements that were later brought to the table.			"

												I was playing this game with my friend. He was playing Mordecai and I was playing Lilith. While playing I found a shotgun with a scope that rivals many sniper rifles. Jokingly I said ""Hey, watch me snipe that guy on the bridge"" and the bridge itself was far away. So I aim my gun through the scope and fire. It was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ headshot. The moral of the story is that shotguns with scopes can be lethal at long range.Borderlands is a great game especially with friends and I highly recommend getting the GotY edition because the game is much more enjoyable with all the DLC.

												A great game to play through with friends, but if playing solo then it gets repetitive quite quickly.

All in all, good if you playing with friends, samey if you playing alone.			"

												Borderlands. Great intro vid rare in games today the vid intro is what I would say one of the best parts for my experience with the 2009 hit from Cage The Elephant ""Ain't No Rest For The Wicked"" first time I watch it a year ago I am like ""Oh yeah I used to hate this song but now I am digging it and it's fits so perfectly with the game's settings and all"" etc. Anyways the intro vid is what grappled my attention so well but asides a video the game itself is just......MARVELOUS. This is not like Bioshock for those who have played that form 2KGames. This is Borderlands it's own game. Very originnal and you can get endlesss hours of fun and gameplay either by yourself or with others. THis game is one of those few games that asides great comic effects and visuals the MP is actually worth every cent the game is. The MP is where it's at the SP is good too but the MP is what makes this game epic. This game is like a much more graphic version of Serious Sam and less serious than Mad Max series. I would reccomend this game to anyone literally especially those looking for challenge, in depth gameplay, lots to do and MP based gaming. The Game should run decently on almost any pc for my HP G56 laptop it works like a charm on lowest settings but the game is best on a real gaming pc etc. Game itself is a 9.5/10 in my book only lacking a few settings and optimization options. But this is amongst my favorites and is not overhyped like many other games. THis game is a lot like the films: Mad Max, Titan A.E., Heavy Metal 2000, Heavy Metal (1980), I am Legend, Escape From NY, Treasure Planet and other post-apocalyptic films. This game is centered on one of four characters/classes, a Siren, Soldier, Hunter, and Brick. Each one has it's perks and downfalls, but the game is mostly the same experience just certain things easier and others not. Anyways amongst the four whichever you choose gets a random vision/message from a mysteirous girl/woman, to instructions to getting to the mythical but real vault treasure of the planet Pandora which is filled with wonders, and Loot. The point of the game is to be alive, kill bandits, and to get as much loot as possible and of course get the mythic treasure for yourself. The game is a lot like Fallout 3/New Vegas, Serious Sam kind of themed but it's truly a full on original fun experience with a lot of comical relief compared to the any of the examples mentioned beforehand I mean this game is filled with humour and it's good in general. One of the few FPS's I have respect for since it's not a COD or anything of the sort all in all the game is a hit, Fresh, and just a truly amazing game in general the sequel is even better on almost every aspect must have game for everyone!

												Borderlands is an RPG FPS hybrid that is primarily based on gaining loot, which is most commonly in the form of more guns. The single player is decent enough to get through on your own, but its much more enjoyable with a full co-op cast. The story isn't bad either, and there are tons of collectables that attribute to both the story and gameplay. This game would be a good choice for anyone looking for a primarily co-op centered RPG/FPS.			"

BL1 starts slow, it takes time for your class skills to kick in, before that you don't really feel special.   but once you get to lvl 20 or so, you really get rolling.If you find the game of the year edition on sale, and you have coop buddies, it's a romp.   Get BL2 if you have to pick only one, but they are cheap nowaways, wait for a sale and get both. "

The games mechanis are solid, and the various weapons you get throughout the game are hilarious to use. Some turn into a gernade on reload, etc. The story is great, and the sequel is great as well, so this is a series worth playing.			"

												- Claptraps- Good jokes- Weird looking enemies- Sh.itloads of guns- Lots of grenades- Good DLCs- Cartoon graphics- LOOT!!!!This game is truly a gem. You can spend tons of hours in it just looking for new/ better weapons or just play through the game again. It wont get booring as long as you follow the story or go to hunt some achievements. But not only in the singleplayer it's great. The part which is the most fun is the co-op. It combines teamwork and teamkilling. You'll love each other for reviving each other because dying due to enemies that are much weaker but got you down and you can't get a second wind because you're in any dumb corner isn't much fun at all. But you'll also hate your teammates because they sometimes get a better weapon than you or just steal your weapons. And then there are duels, duels are great to aquire satisfaction and honor for defeating your truly as.shole mates <3 Even if the graphics might be bad (If you look at recent FPSs), it's not the only thing that matters. This game is fun in any way and I'd definitly recommend it to all my friends, which I already did.			"

												This is a very fun game to play together with friends. I highly recommend choosing 3 other people and sticking with them throughout the adventure, as playing with strangers can be frustrating, a la Left 4 Dead & Left 4 Dead 2. Playing solo is pretty boring, and I recommend against playing with strangers, for they will likely do things that go counter to your personal interests, such as keeping all the loot for themselves.If you can get a team of 4 friends together and schedule your games, you will have a great, great time with this game, if you like anything at all about FPS or RPG games. One thing of note, for example, is the immense variety of ways that enemies die screaming, which is very entertaining. The visuals are quite unique and of course the bajillions of guns provide an  endless upgrade path. All in all, lots of fun, 9/10.			"

												I played through Borderlands 2 before I played Borderlands 1 GOTY edition. If you've already played BL2 but not BL1, then all you need to know is that the gameplay mechanics are the same. The story in BL2 picks up from BL1 and the environments are similar since you are on Pandora. BL2 feels more refined than BL1 but if you really enjoyed BL2 and haven't played BL1, then I'd recommend picking up the first game for at least one playthrough. If you've not played any of the Borderlands games and want to get into them, then I'd suggest starting with the first game. I currently have 52 hours on BL1 and that's going through the game and most of the DLC.			"

												A good combination of loot-collection based rpg and first person shooter. Borderlands is full of pop culture references, bizarre looking enemies and diverse guns. Go for the Game of the Year Edition, the 4 DLC packs add a lot to this game. Unfortunately there's no proper trading or loot sharing system, so I recommend only playing this with friends or alone, though you might run into some nice people in public matches. Now that the multiplayer is handled by Steamworks online co-op has become a much smoother experience.			"

												The goal of this segment is not to review the game it is  to organize information that can optimize your Borderlands 1 settings to make the game run correctly.I like this game a lot. I played it on the Playstation Triple and it ran much better than on Steam. It has been a few years since I had played the first Borderlands game and initially on Steam it ran so poorly that I didn't want to play one of my favorite games on last-gen consoles.Until I used these tweaks in the .ini files to make the game run perfectly. By that I mean without the horrible screen tearing and without what I would like to call ""the buttery mousepad effect"". There are also some other quality of life changes that are available to fine-tune your Borderlands to your own personal preferences.1. The screen tearing issue is caused by a setting in the .ini files that makes the game cap itself at 62 fps instead of 60. This is the most important change that you should make to your Borderlands 1 files. You will want to go to this link and follow the directions to correct this issue.http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=10924562. Several fixes can be found at this next link but the most notable ones are removing the unskippable intro movies (NVIDIA, 2k, etc), removing mouse smoothing (the buttery mousepad effect), enabling vsync, and changing ""hold-to-aim"" to a ""toggle-to-aim"". Many of the changes here are personal preference.http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1463861These changes will optimize the game and make it far more enjoyable.Overall good game but poorly optimized for the PC platform without tampering with the flux capacitor.

												Borderlands was a very fun game that I have now completed three times. I really like looters, and this game did a great job with tons of interesting guns to use. The story is interesting but is missing something to make you care more. The side quests are mostly just tons of fetch quests that get boring quick. Occasionally there will be one fun side quest that is quite memorable, but most are just rehashed version of go there, kill this, come back.     My biggest complaint is with enemy variety. After the first 15 minutes of playing, you will see the things you will be fighting for the rest of the game. The bandits and rakks just level scale and become more challenging. If you can get past this problem and the dull ""fetch"" quests, this game is really fun. For an FPS, this game moves fluent and leveling is great. Multi-player is where this game shines. Those dull fetch quests and same mobs don't bother you near as much when you are playing with a friend. The boss fights are also fun, but nothing too special. You will also find the characters you meet are not very memorable. Finally money is near useless. You will get money everywhere but never really need it.     My first run through, I had no complaints. The game is often fun, but never really so compelling that you can't turn away. You will even get a few laughs out of it. I myself really liked The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned. Generally by the end of Borderlands, I had fun, but I had no urge to keep going. Here is my take away in a pro con chart.ProsLots of guns with lots of effectsTons of looting, making it worth checking around for hidden chestsMulti-player is really funStory line is fairly interestingFluid game playLots of little goals to accomplish (such as 1,000 SMG kills, ect.)Good for some laughsConsVery boring side questsAlmost no mob variety Very little voiced lines, meaning you will be reading a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton.Money is almost completly useless All in all, this game is worth your time to play it. So if you are wondering where in the series to start, I would recommend here if you got a friend or two to run it through with. I'd give the game an 8/10.			"

												I played this game AFTER Borderlands 2, so, obviously, if you compare it to that, it's NOT as good. That said, it's still pretty amazing, and you can see why they MADE another game (and made that game better, oh, so much better). On the other hand, I also played it after the Pre-sequel (yes, in terms of story I played the games BACKWARDS), and it was certainly better than that overall (being longer - with the dlc - and less glitchy, and certainly cheaper).      The levelling and story are not as good as Borderlands 2, but it's still fun, still funny and still pretty damn violent. It's shorter than Borderlands 2, and without the dlc (this is the only one of the three that I got the full edition of, with all four dlc), it's probably shorter, or equal to, the pre-sequel. This makes it clear to me that these games were made to have the dlc - and, amazingly, that I got NINETY hours out of Borderlands 2 WITHOUT the dlc, which is impressive, and just goes to show that games just aren't long enough anymore. The idea that you don't get the complete game without paying EXTRA for dlc now is one of the things that annoys a lot of people in the gaming world today, but this game is fairly old now and very cheap on sale, so the full edition is worth getting (especially as without Moxxi's Underdome there isn't even a bank to store your stuff).       I played the zombie dlc with my eyes shut, but, other than that, 8/10			"

												Borderlands is a very unique game with a very funny and well thought out storyline. The characters are memorable and the landscape across Pandora has its own special feeling.Driving the runners feels great how smooth it glides across the terrain and the infinite guns gives it a diablo feeling of loot progression. One of my favorite aspects of this game is the New Game + system where you can play the game a second time with renamed enemies who are much tougher than before, which turns what used to be easy missions into a nightmare.The DLC is fun and rewarding even though Mad Moxxi TD can be very tedious. As a game I own three copies for and have beat over a dozen times I have to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fps/rpg elements with a funny and progressive storyline.I give it an 8.5 out of ten for replability, story, and great gameplay that will keep you playing for hours.

												 It's a solid game. The story isn't anything special: you're looking for the Vault, like some other people. On your way you kill a lot of enemies, like bandits. That's basically it. The mechanics are satisfying and easy. The shooting is good. The loot is pretty nice and has actually a lot of variaty. The skill system isn't that interesting. It just gives you more health, you do more damage. Some upgrades are pretty neat, for example the special move upgrades, but these are unlocked after a long time. The enemies do miss some variaty. There are some pretty great ones and pretty creative too, but it feels like they use the same enemies to much. The multiple caracters you can choose and the different ways they play and the ways you can play the game, makes for a pretty replayable game. The game still looks good. Didn't have any performance issues either.The DLC really tries to pander out the gameplay: it takes way too long to get to some parts and it's repetetive. It just tries to make the game longer, but the gameplay and the enjoyment suffer under it.			"

												Funnny...l missed this when it first came out. Don't know how but l guess l was busy with family and other games that took my interest. Many years on and l freakin love this game and the 'hook' it has. l am an old school Diablo player and the grinding to level up is awesome and it has humour. If it was not funny l would not play this. Games are meant to not take themselves to seriously. Anyway l have all the Borderslands, 2 and the prequel but l want to beat this one first. Tales of the Borderlands by Telltale is also an awesome game and 'Scooter' is in it. Love the lore and the style. Graphics on my nividia970 are maxed out and runs so smooth with an xbox controller even though it has no support for it. Great game. l recommend play this one first if you are new to the series. Even though this is a great game it might not suit to everyones FPS style. If you like the Diablo mechanic you will love this but if you love the COD corridor movie production you might not enjoy this. I enjoy both but Borderland has the hook and charcters that l will remember years from now.			"

												If Mad Max was a comic book hero with mutant powers.. she'd be a sirenBrilliant. Highly original comic-FPS with RPG factors and comedy. Heaps of content with the GOTY version, this is a large game. The gun stats will sharpen your math. If your no number cruncher, keep a calculator handy if you want the best possible loadout, it can get technical.Add me if you want to play.. I have a siren & hunter, levels 40+ "

												Best game in the series IMO. Yes everyone rides borderlands 2 but I loved how you can literally find a gun at level 15 and keep using that♥♥♥♥♥♥into playthrough 2 not like in borderlands 2 where you constantly swap equipment out every 1-2 levels. Pumped many hours on ps3 hope to do the same here. Getting the mujltiplayer to work can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥but when you finally get it. Its awesome as ♥♥♥♥. Bloodwing forever.			"

												You emerge in the stylised landscape of Pandora, a barren wasteland filled with excitement and hostile alien creatures. Whilst all this would amount to a pretty good game already, Borderlands ups the ante with it's Diablo-like gameplay. All pickups and drops are randomised, including the guns you get. Because of the almost limitless amount of weapons, class builds and strategies that follow. Borderlands still remains replayable just throughout singleplayer.Multiplayer however is pretty lackluster, especially if your playing with random players. It comes highly recommended to play multiplayer with a few friends rather then just game surfing.			"

												The start of one of the greatest franchises to ever exist. Borderlands throws you into a fps/rpg combo with four playable characers with thier own abilities and strengths and throws you onto Pandora filled with millions of guns ad thousands of enemies. An immense ammount of content can be found around the game and fill endless hours of enjoyment. 11/10			"

												This is a very fun game to play together with friends. I highly recommend choosing 3 other people and sticking with them throughout the adventure, as playing with strangers can be frustrating, a la Left 4 Dead & Left 4 Dead 2. Playing solo is pretty boring, and I recommend against playing with strangers, for they will likely do things that go counter to your personal interests, such as keeping all the loot for themselves.If you can get a team of 4 friends together and schedule your games, you will have a great, great time with this game, if you like anything at all about FPS or RPG games. One thing of note, for example, is the immense variety of ways that enemies die screaming, which is very entertaining. The visuals are quite unique and of course the bajillions of guns provide an  endless upgrade path. All in all, lots of fun, 9/10.			"

												I played through Borderlands 2 before I played Borderlands 1 GOTY edition. If you've already played BL2 but not BL1, then all you need to know is that the gameplay mechanics are the same. The story in BL2 picks up from BL1 and the environments are similar since you are on Pandora. BL2 feels more refined than BL1 but if you really enjoyed BL2 and haven't played BL1, then I'd recommend picking up the first game for at least one playthrough. If you've not played any of the Borderlands games and want to get into them, then I'd suggest starting with the first game. I currently have 52 hours on BL1 and that's going through the game and most of the DLC.			"

												One of the best FPS of this kind, pretty awesome in cooperation or alone, there's a possibility to play it up to 4 and make all missions together. By the way, the best DLC is Mad Moxxi's Underdome, according to me.A lot of final boss and a story very interessting (even if you I don't like the ending, but Borderlands 2 is there for that). If you love mix FPS/RPG, go on !			"

The sense of humor in this game more than makes up for the admittedly dated graphics, but if you can look past that, you're in for a FPS treat.			"

												The goal of this segment is not to review the game it is  to organize information that can optimize your Borderlands 1 settings to make the game run correctly.I like this game a lot. I played it on the Playstation Triple and it ran much better than on Steam. It has been a few years since I had played the first Borderlands game and initially on Steam it ran so poorly that I didn't want to play one of my favorite games on last-gen consoles.Until I used these tweaks in the .ini files to make the game run perfectly. By that I mean without the horrible screen tearing and without what I would like to call ""the buttery mousepad effect"". There are also some other quality of life changes that are available to fine-tune your Borderlands to your own personal preferences.1. The screen tearing issue is caused by a setting in the .ini files that makes the game cap itself at 62 fps instead of 60. This is the most important change that you should make to your Borderlands 1 files. You will want to go to this link and follow the directions to correct this issue.http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=10924562. Several fixes can be found at this next link but the most notable ones are removing the unskippable intro movies (NVIDIA, 2k, etc), removing mouse smoothing (the buttery mousepad effect), enabling vsync, and changing ""hold-to-aim"" to a ""toggle-to-aim"". Many of the changes here are personal preference.http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1463861These changes will optimize the game and make it far more enjoyable.Overall good game but poorly optimized for the PC platform without tampering with the flux capacitor.

In terms of the DLC I'd rate it: Claptrap > Secret Armory > Zombie Island >>>>>>>> Moxxie's Underome. The Moxxie dome is absolute garbage, I only played it for the achievements. The other 3 are good.If you like diablo 2, buy this game. Its diablo 2 in a FPS			"

												Upon first seeing this game, I wrote it off. It looked like a mindless, generic shooter with crude humor and an overabundance of gore.It mostly is, but it is very well done.The crowning achievement of this series, in my opinion, is the weapon and loot system. You will likely never get the same gun as your friends, as there are thousands of stat and effect combinations.The story is kind of dry and flat. The enemies get redundant. The characters are pretty funny, making the quests and story tollerable.If you're looking for a shooter with good gameplay, this series is for you. If you're looking for a deep, insightful story, stay away.			"

												This is probably one of the most fun games you will ever playEDIT: Almost 4 years later.......http://imgur.com/tYFNQrKThe first Borderlands I think is still the best out of the Borderlands series/ Why?I first played this with my brother when I was only 12 years old, and him and I shared his account just so we can play this together. -One online and one offline, thus allowing a LAN server. This was possible in 2010 because Borderlands ran on Gamespy servers, and not steam servers. Got into the original Borderlands again because the Pre-Sequal is just a cash grabber. The second installment of Borderlands is fun, but it's just missing some side missions, I.e. In Borderlajds 2 there isn't a side mission where you have to help a charater, such as Cl4p-, give the character something they need. When you give that item or objective to that character you get loot.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I would reconmend this game for anyone who loves RPGs or First Person Shooters. *If you like Destiny then please play Borderlands, becauuse Borderlands is the ""superior"" game compared to Destiny. Eventhough the pre-Sequal was the worst borderlands game, it's still more fun than Destiny. Destiny requires you to have people play with you, and those people have to be on your friends list.			"

												Borderlands is a pretty fun game, spent a while in it and enjoyed the hell out of the missions in co-op and singleplayer. The story is about as thin as a wet tissue paper, but that isn't too much of a concern because you are a treasure hunter looking for treasure. what else do you want? I highly reccomend Borderlands, because it is one of the last games Gearbox has made before their games overrall quality started taking a sharp nose dive.			"

Borderlandsis original FPS/RPG game for co-op expierience. This game is unique idea of mixing FPS with RPG elements, adding some replayability after finishing the game. It's great fun to play with friends and smash some midgets or skags. The game offers us 4 characters with 3 skill trees, which u are free to add as u like. Because of high level cap(50 without dlc) u can easy master even 2 of 3 skill trees. Game have specific for this series dark humour, which is funny and entertaining. I need to say I've played borderlands after playing Borderlands 2 so I can now clearly compare them and see the pros and cons between them, and choose which one i would like to recommend u more, but for sure both are worth of playing if u want to get into the Borderlands story/universum.Pros:+Funny story+Great gameplay+Best fun with friends+Many items/upgrades for character+Graphics still looks cool because of it's unique style+Many hours of funCons: (u will notice them after playing Borderlands 2)-Lack of music/soundtracks-Walkthrough 2 is too easy.-Not many party bosses to farm-Low replayability (it was boring for me after 1-st walktrough)-Maps are way too similar to each otherOverall: 7,5/10. I think it's fair comparing to series. Ofc it was first game so we can't blame that it has lack of some aspects, but still it's really decent and i would recommend it for you. Play with friends for best expierience and fun <3.About DLC's:Zombie Island of dr's Ned is typical smash'em zombie. It adds some hours to play and kill tons of zombies with decent plot about undeads. Anyway it's not giving much improvent to your character after walkthrough, so i would recommend only for people who likes zombies.Overall:7/10MadMoxxi's Underdome Is DLC's with 3 different arenas on which u take challenge to survive waves. To be honest it's the worst dlc and I won't recommend it to anyone. I was trying to like it, i did beat 1 of 3 arena's and i must say: After 1-2 hours of playing it's so boring. Drops are craps, and u can't save beetween rounds u need to finish whole arena at once.If u get it with GOTY edition, enjoy ur bank store,otherwise don't buy it.Overall:4/10Secret armory of general Knoxx Is probably the best of all DLC's for Borderlands. Its decent lenght story for several hours, with good expierience gain, many quests, and new different enemies. What is more when u finish it u gain acces to place with tons of loot chests, so this DLC is for sure the best improvement for ur character after ending main story walkthrough. Moreover DLC is increasing ur level cap by 11 levels so it's a lot. At last i must say, in this DLC u have the hardest boss in the game which is Crawmerax The invicible, so it's great opportunity to try urself out with friends or alone, and get some additional loot. Only con is there is no fast travel in this DLC, so it may be kinda annoying.Overall:9/10I would recommend this game to u for story and fun with friends, but if i would choose between Borderlands and Borderlands 2, pick the 2nd one. It got a lot of improvements comparing to 1st game, and have more replayability which gives u an opportunity to play hundred of hours. Anyway BOTH games are really good, so play both if possible ;) "

												Borderlands is a sci-fi action game that combines the best elements of first-person action with player customization and massive arsenal of weaponry.Play as one of four mercenaries in this amazing experience as the player adventures himself in the lawless planet of Pandora, focused on finding powerful alien technology, also known as The Vault.This game also features an amazing cooperative experience, allowing up to 4 players to play the campaign simultaneously and the game's content provides an near-endless variety in missions, environments, enemies, weapons and character customization.Fun is guaranteed with Borderlands and it's definitely one of the best games I've ever played.I highly recommend Borderlands aswell as all of the content released.

												From the small bit of this game that I have played, it is marvellous. The art style works a lot better than I thought it would. The combat and controls are very fluid. I personally changed melee to Q, but that is just my preference. I'd describe this game as a good mix of Fallout and Bioshock.Pros:Good gameplayPretty worldSatisfying combatCons:Textures take a second or two to load when going from area to area.I would rate this game 9/10 from what I have played of it. That could change up or down depending on the rest of the game.I recieved this key from the Steam Group: Accidentally Reviewed. I thank them very much and encourage all to join.			"

												I ain’t gonna bite, pro’lyI was concerned that I might not like BORDERLANDS, as I’ve played games with stylised graphics before and have found this type of design can reduce the immersive qualities that I love about gaming. I need not have worried. Borderlands is one of the best games I’ve played. The visuals are very impressive and suck you right in. This is open-world gaming at it’s best, with many large maps to explore as you complete the numerous missions. There are hundreds of weapons to collect and use, or sell along the way (gathering loot quickly becomes addictive). A wide variety of enemies will take you on as you progress up the levels. The combat is varied and the AI is good if not exceptional. Although there’s little story to speak of there’s enough humour to just about make up for this. It’s possible that some might find the missions a tad repetitive but I was so engrossed in the game that I didn’t tire of them and completed every one, including the 3 DLCs available. As for multi-player, well co-op is great fun but best played with people who you can rely on to share the loot.4/5			"

												Let me start this review by saying this: Borderlands 2 is, so far, the best one in the series in my opinion, but only because the core game it was build on was pretty solid. That core game was the first Borderlands.The first Borderlands is a bit raw: the skill trees are pretty basic, the inventory layout can be pretty confusing at first, there is very little dialogue in this game (unlike in its successor), and so on... For some this may be a letdown, for some a charm.But the game already has everything what a good Borderlands should offer: lots of action, tons of different guns to try out, challenging at times especially at later playthroughs (don't let my hours fool you: I've played this game on console before. I never played the DLC, and then saw GOTY for 7.5 bucks, so I didn't hesitate for a single moment to get it), and the many different ways to kill your enemies can be really satisfying (a headshot with a sniper makes heads explode in red mist, and I'll never grow tired of it).Old, but very cheap when it's on sale, and fun with friends, so definitely give it a try if you like shooters. It's a good introduction in the Borderlands series.			"

It looked like a mindless, generic shooter with crude humor and an overabundance of gore.It mostly is, but it is very well done.The crowning achievement of this series, in my opinion, is the weapon and loot system. You will likely never get the same gun as your friends, as there are thousands of stat and effect combinations.The story is kind of dry and flat. The enemies get redundant. The characters are pretty funny, making the quests and story tollerable.If you're looking for a shooter with good gameplay, this series is for you.

												This game will definitely make my list of top gaming experiences, because it not only treats us with fantastic gameplay and a unique graphic outlook, it piles on a 4 person co-op of the singleplayer. Now I have a game that left me begging for more content (other than Fallout). I think i'm going to buy the DLCs for this very soon. Oh and not to mention, this game supposedly pales in comparison to Borderlands 2, which is head and shoulders above the previous... I bet i'll just have to get the second to find out.

												 It's a solid game. The story isn't anything special: you're looking for the Vault, like some other people. On your way you kill a lot of enemies, like bandits. That's basically it. The mechanics are satisfying and easy. The shooting is good. The loot is pretty nice and has actually a lot of variaty. The skill system isn't that interesting. It just gives you more health, you do more damage. Some upgrades are pretty neat, for example the special move upgrades, but these are unlocked after a long time. The enemies do miss some variaty. There are some pretty great ones and pretty creative too, but it feels like they use the same enemies to much. The multiple caracters you can choose and the different ways they play and the ways you can play the game, makes for a pretty replayable game. The game still looks good. Didn't have any performance issues either.The DLC really tries to pander out the gameplay: it takes way too long to get to some parts and it's repetetive. It just tries to make the game longer, but the gameplay and the enjoyment suffer under it.			"

												Funnny...l missed this when it first came out. Don't know how but l guess l was busy with family and other games that took my interest. Many years on and l freakin love this game and the 'hook' it has. l am an old school Diablo player and the grinding to level up is awesome and it has humour. If it was not funny l would not play this. Games are meant to not take themselves to seriously. Anyway l have all the Borderslands, 2 and the prequel but l want to beat this one first. Tales of the Borderlands by Telltale is also an awesome game and 'Scooter' is in it. Love the lore and the style. Graphics on my nividia970 are maxed out and runs so smooth with an xbox controller even though it has no support for it. Great game. l recommend play this one first if you are new to the series. Even though this is a great game it might not suit to everyones FPS style. If you like the Diablo mechanic you will love this but if you love the COD corridor movie production you might not enjoy this. I enjoy both but Borderland has the hook and charcters that l will remember years from now.			"

												A crazy action-adventure RPG where you play a vault hunter - a mercenary who desperately tries to find the vault to claim its hidden treasures. There are 4 different characters (classes) you can choose from that offer 4 different play-styles. There is an enormous amount of items found in this game - really, the amount of weapons you can find is just amazing. Colours indicate their extra features - this is similar to Diablo. The rarer weapons you find the stronger it is. There are tons of missions to complete and many conversations to listen to. It is a sin to skip even one single side mission as the dialogue is very, very entertaining and funny. In addition to this, the game has 4 DLCs that take you to different areas and continue the already silly story by telling you further adventures.I guess the only difference between this and its sequel is that the first episode lacks a proper antagonist. There's no main villain here which is a bit of a let down once you complete the game and encounter the final boss. Still, this one small flaw cannot ruin the experience for you as your walkthrough will be entertaining all the way.Also, the sequel has a bit more vivid colours that was a nice change compared to this episode where everything is grey or brown. Anyway, Borderlands is a great game and best played with friends (you need them for some of the boss battles). Playing the first one to understand the sequel's story is not mandatory. If it is discounted, though, picking up the game of the year edition can be one of the best gifts on Steam. "

Plenty of weaopns, a RPG system (abliet easily corruptable, only if you choose to of course) and the health collection of shooting the faces of whatever moves, with upto 4 people i may add.Story: You are looking for a Vault, guided by a stranger. Thats somewhat it. No deep storyline but don't worry, the RPG aspects help you love your character were the story doesnt.Graphics: Less said the better. Well lets say this. ♥♥♥♥ Cel Shader graphics, 1/10 for graphicsGameplay: Classic, mean, fun and overkill. Four words i love to say about games. Finding that epic gun that beats your other guns by miles is just a nice warm feeling.Pro's:- Great large levels- Epic guns- Plenty of♥♥♥♥♥♥to shootCon's:- Diabolical graphics- Maybe the maps are a tad too big at times8.5/10 - Get it			"

												Borderlands, is a good game.Ya know, the game can't take the blame.Be a man, play this game.I'm stoppin doug, gonna play this game.(game, game...)This game isn't expensive and it will be alot better than you see in the screenshots. The screenshots are a joke, the game itself really shines. But if you want humour, buy Borderlands 2. Let's move on with the pro's and con's.Let's get the con's out of the way, shall we?- Travelling to another place/location takes some of your time.- Inventory space is ok, but not the best. Although I like the fact that it makes these games more challenging.- Some missions are impossible, even if your level is recommended.And now... *drum music* the pro's!+ Made in Unreal Engine 3, one of the best engine's in my opinion.+ You don't need a gaming pc to run this stuff, my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pc handles this game with Medium-High settings on 40+ FPS. If you can run Team Fortress 2/XCOM: Enemy Unknown, your pc will probably handle this game.+ Loot, loot and... Omg! More loot! :'D And alot of weapons!+ Great characters like Claptrap.+ Good story.+ Scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me when I saw my first Psycho in the game.+ Many missions, open world. It's an official RPS (Role-Playing-Shooter) game.TL;DR: This game isn't the average Shilectronic Farts game, it's a great open world shooter. Try the experience for yourself.I rate this game 10/10, it kept me playin' ;)			"

Borderlands.Published in 2009, this game belongs in the ""lifetime"" category, being always replayable no matter the advance on technology. People will come back for this game. Not necessarily for its geeky, retro, cartoony graphics (which can be a downside for some gamers), but rather for its never-ceasing ability to incite laughter and challenge at the same time.It runs on a modified Unreal Engine 3. While they indeed implemented cartoony graphics instead of polished ""realistic"" graphics, this approach allowed the developers to highly detail the surroundings in a way no other devs managed to pull off before using cartoony graphics.The general atmosphere of the game could be defined as a mixture between Fallout, Diablo and dozen of other FPS / RPG's.Critics and reviewers rarely give this game a lower score than 80/100 and with good reasons.If I had to critize something concerning Borderlands, I'd probably point at the considerable weak AI and the rather weak storyline. A gamer interested in a deep, attractive and emotional storyline shouldn't invest his money in Borderlands. The boss fights are intense and satisfying when won, something some developers fail at achieving.Summary:Pro's:Favoured amongst seasoned reviewers and critics;Intense and satisfying boss fights;Amazing weapon variety;Enjoyable co-op multiplayer;Astereotypical characters in an original setting with an abundance of dark humor;Very entertaining DLC-packs;Contra's:Rather weak AI;Weak storyline;Not many players online anymore for co-op;PvP, while available, almost nonexistent;Neutral:Cartoony graphics;Overal, I'd agree with most curators by stating that this game is an absolute masterpiece. It might not be for you due to the rather rare approach concerning graphics and setting, but I'd definitely recommend this to anyone. "

												Do You looking for shooter designated for co-op strictly? If You say ,,Yes!"", thenk think about buy this game. Solo campaign is not bad, but with the pack of Your 3 friends it will turn into massive festival of loot, enemies, and of course - fun! :D. I know, it's a 5-years old game, and doesn't look good compared with newest one, but if people are returning to play this again, again, and again, then it's must have something making them to do that, right? Latest migration form GameSpy to steamworks are a smart choice, most people, who buy this game earlier (just like me), can still play without worrying about it. (thanks to The Borderlands granting tool!) If You want to get this one, buy the GOTY wersion, these 4 DLC's are worth well it.			"

												I played this game a long time ago.  I was I think 10 when I got this on sale at my local Half-Price Books.  The game was fun, I loved playing the multiplayer and the people were so nice.  Then I got an OP weapon and shield where I could kill things in one hit as well as survive everything.  I finished the game at level 7...  Other than that, the game was fun and hilarious.  I didn't buy the DLC, so I was missing out on a lot.  Now that I have it on Steam, Im pretty happy I can play through the entire game as well as the DLC.  I would recommend BL 1 for the people who want more of the story behind the original Vault Hunters since this shows what they were like before they become leaders of the crimson raiders.  BL 1 doesn't exactly have the greatest maps like in BL 2, but its really fun especially co-op.  I would rate BL 1 am 8/10.			"

												I was a bit late to the Borderlands game. To be honest, I didn't enjoy this as much as BL2. Advice to anyone getting into Borderlands, don't think that you need to play BL1 to appreciate BL2. The second game is much more fun, and stands well on it's own legs. If you're aching for more after finishing BL2 and have checked off ""be disappointed by BL:TPS"" on your To-Do list, come back and play this game.			"

But also the game won't spoon-feed you and I strongly reccomend you, loser, to get friends to play it.			"

												The game is good but it does have its issues. When thinking about the gameplay the weapon handling feels clunky, but it feel that its actually a good thing, its feels like you really have to control them rather than just point and shoot.The story and world is really interesting, whether it be the main game or the expansions. However the gameplay never really changes, and is very hard to keep you interested.Its worth giving a go, but if you have yet to play a Borderlands game I would say that 2 is a better place to start.

												This game is just a helluva fun put together, it has lots of elements seen in other games: Call of Duty, Fallout, Halo... etc., yet the gameplay still feels unique and fresh.The sequel, Borderlands 2, has made a lot of improvements, and in general is a better game, but it was the original Borderlands that set the humorous tone and established a successful formula: explosions, loot and addictive fun.The ""loot"" part is arguably the best part of the game, I've finished the campaign years ago, yet I always come back for more.Now that Gearbox has released the Steamworks patch for Borderlands to restore its multiplayer, would you kindly pick up this timeless classic, and share the fun with your friends?

As a Vault Hunter on open world Pandora, you need to favour your way through the right people and fight your way to your destiny. Collect more powerful weapons and sell your loot for cash.

												If you have never played Borderlands before and you want to know if you should before playing the sequal the answer is yes and no. No because story wise it dosent tell you anything the 2nd game wont clarify. Yes because it will get you invested in the characters and give you a better feel of why Jack is badguy. All of that aside there really aint no rest for the wicked and i can back that claim up. Iv spent so many hours with this amazing FPSRPG that iv lost count. What it lacks in a deep intresting story it makes up for in fun 4-way co-op. The random gun generation means that no play through will be quit the same. The art style blends well with the gameplay and the game itself doesn't try so hard to be funny (like with the sequal). The gameplay can get a little repetative (it is an FPS after all) so its best not to play for very long at a time. The only real glaring issue with Borderlands are its legendary guns; the weapons that are ment to be top tier. Many of them have been codded incorrectly and dont behave as intended. This is a very minor oversight and really does nothing to take away from the game. It just messes with my OCD. Also hellfire is OP.			"

												The cartoonish style of Borderlands might be a minus for some, but Gearbox uses that to implement a particular gore style and a buttload of humour. Best Features:  - Loot, loot again and some more loot there. - Leveling. Even though it is a FPS, the leveling system let you play four different characters with each three different talent trees.  - Humour. The humour in this game is genius. Shooting to death a bandit at point blank with a sniper and stumbling across his arm a few feet farther is always nice in that kind of game. Plus the CL4P-TP robot makes me think of the hyperactive child GLADOS would have had if she could have one. - It plays well in solo and great in co-op. The game stays the same and you have many hours of gameplay. Took me around 40 hours my first time with a little try of every character and some fooling around. Minus : - It is kind of an open world but you can't really venture off to the high level zone if you're not yourself high level. The trash mobs will kill you pretty fast.  - Community is greedy. If you play in a quick match online, you might have to fight for the loot.  - PvP is not really insane in Borderlands. Though I had my fun on PS3 killing those hacked-shield wielder in the small arena in the first zone.			"

												I beat Borderlands on PS3 back when it first launched, and more recently beat it again on Steam. Sure, Gearbox helped push giants gobs of DLC into mainstream, and one could argue that the series has gone a bit stale recently, but for the time, Borderlands was an awesome experience. I have mixed feelings about the DLC, and especially about their weird little ""key"" giveaways, but that doesn't change the original Borderlands being a fun experience.It's not the most varied game, and by the end of the 20-30 hours of your first playthrough, some parts have gotten a tough tedious. But grab a friend or three, and blast through the hunt for bigger and better weapons. The original is still very much worth a try, but be warned that it's a fraction as enjoyable solo.			"

												FIrst it's about the level then it's about the loot. This game is really fun and is similar to a fallout co op. There are heaps of missions to do for hours and hours of gameplay but most of those are a little grindy. The main missions are great and it's something really worth playing with a friend or even a group. Solo it's not as fun as this game was designed for co op and is honestly one of the best modern co op games today. For a game made in 2009 there are some things that are annoying such as having to constantly pick up ammo and walk/drive back and forth between places without insta fast travel. The storyline is pretty good and dlc adds pretty much double the game play and is worth the extra cash you paid. It's not useless DLC just get the goty edition on sale and have a blast. Don't compare this to the second one because the second one is just amazing. FPS Diablo 8.5/10			"

And yet, there's CL4P-TP?! INTERPLANETARY NINJA ASSASSIN. This Stuff is Gold!!			"

												The original Borderlands was big and ambitions FPS, giving players a Diablo-ish loot system with ""billions"" of guns (composed of parts under the hood), loosely RPG-ish mission system, vehicles, AND 4-player co-op that scales difficulty and rewards to the number of players. The inventory system isn't perfect, the NPCs are essentially static billboards, the story falls flat, and some regions and enemies are more fun than others. But overall it's a good-looking game full of challege, humor, wacky characters, a ridiculous number of guns, and many, many hours of entertainment. The bang for the buck is incredible. Don't forget the Secret Armory of General Knoxx DLC, which increases the level cap and adds some great new missions. The other DLC is probably skippable.			"

												I love this game to bits. The humour is fantastic and the graphics, though simple and comic like, are nice and well drawn/designed. I can play for hours dipping in and out to complete a few missions here and there or have a mad day long Borderlands spree only remembering to sleep when I drop the controller. It does have its floors in that a lot of the questing is very repetative and having to go from place to place then back again then to somewhere else the other side of the world and then back to the place you started can be annoying. I believe these are the only down sides I have to this game. Buy it and enjoy people :-)p.s. I must add that almost all mof my game play, 500+, was on the xbox version.			"

												Been playing this game on multiple platforms since 2009, This game may not be perfect, but it sure is addicting and fun as hell to play through alone or with friends. Just trying to get the very best equipment is fun and addicting. I still have yet to find an Pearls across my 10 characters, but the search for one is one of the many aspects that this game has me coming back to play again and again! I highly recommend this game over the sequel if you prefer more challenge and more mechanics to loot. If you do get this game, I BEG OF YOU, to look at the mods and engine configurations because this game is abysmal for us PC elitists, but it can be made playable with some minor tweaks.If you have friends, this is a must have to play.

												Borderlands is a classic, timeless FPS game.  The graphics areCo-op muitiplayer games, up to  four players, are a fun & welcome challenge.  The storyline is entertaining, engaging & comical.   All of the DLC's have a story arc that I found engaging.  The Secret Armory of Knoxx DLC is probably the roughtest part of this series.  There is no fast travel option which makes it difficult for players who play in shorter sessions.  Each time you load into the Knoxx DLC region, you start at T-Bone Junction & have to fight, walk & drive to your questing area.  Sometimes this push to the questing area would take 45 minutes.  The Armory was also dissapointing as you only have a limited amount of time to scour for weapon upgrades before you are booted from the safe, never to see this treasure trove again.			"

												While the story, charecters (bar a few), and vehicle driving may not be flawless, this game more than makes up for it with guns, guns, guns, and more guns. Oh and 4-player coop is a big plus. The game is a loot based FPS with RPG elements (not very extensive, but it works well with this type of game). the game never seems to get old and due to the aforementioned slighty lacking story has a lot of replayability (I've finished with one character, almost done with another, and working on a 3rd and a 4th). At the price (20$) and with it going on sale a lot, this game is well worth your money.			"

												Right off the bat, don't play this if you're looking for a single player game with lots of story or you don't have any friends.  Without at least one co-op partner, Borderlands will seem very, very lonely.  Assuming you do have a gaming partner (my wife is mine), this game can be a lot of fun.  You can choose one of four characters to play: Roland, Lilith, Mordecai and Brick.  All of them can wield the same weapons and do melee attacks as well, but some characters are better utilized with some weapons than others.The basic premise is paper-thin as you're a bounty hunter/mercenary/treasure hunter (and whatever else) looking for fame and fortune by finding something called ""the vault.""  On the way, you'll discover numerous towns, meet lots of unusual people, and fight tons of psychos and monsters.You can play offline, LAN or online.  You can use the same character offline or online, but beware: if you level up too far beyond your teammates, the game will hassle you about it.			"

												This game (and all the DLC's in the GOTY version) is reletivley inexpensive today... and is a great buy for anyone who is a fan of FPS in general. While not quiet as polished as BL2, you can easily pick up and play if you are at all familiar with the second. Many many hours of fragging bandits, skags, rakks and others... lots of fun and extreme collecting abounds!. Just when you thing you're done, the DLS's add three new stories to play through, two designed as interresting 'mods' of the main game, and one all new charecters and story (General Knoxx - introduces the mechs). All in all well worth the price i paid for 50hrs of fun :)			"

												Not as wild and crazy and actionpacked as BL2 but still a awesome great game!BL1 feels more like a strategic shooter than BL2's wild blazing non-stop action; and I liked that alot. If you started with BL2, like I did, you will NOT be dissapointed of BL1. Not one bit!			"

												While the story, charecters (bar a few), and vehicle driving may not be flawless, this game more than makes up for it with guns, guns, guns, and more guns. Oh and 4-player coop is a big plus. The game is a loot based FPS with RPG elements (not very extensive, but it works well with this type of game). the game never seems to get old and due to the aforementioned slighty lacking story has a lot of replayability (I've finished with one character, almost done with another, and working on a 3rd and a 4th). At the price (20$) and with it going on sale a lot, this game is well worth your money.			"

There are a lot of things to keep track of, which is why I love it.  Give it a shot.			"

												GUN FARMING SIMULATORPlayed the heck out of this game back when it was released. I found it tad difficult to get used to again after playing BL2 so much, but I must admit it's still quite good.If you're looking for a ""complete"" Borderlands experience, I'd recommend going for the second game (GOTY edition is good). First Borderlands felt like a beta for Gearbox to test new grounds, before they fixed everything and released BL2.I found Pre-Sequel disappointing as it was pretty much the same BL again for a full price and another crapton of DLC... also the writing was weaker than in BL2.I'd recommend getting BL if you can catch it on sale sometimes/somewhere f you've already played the newer games. It's fun for what it is. For newcomers to the franchise, go for BL2.			"

												Borderlands is the first in a groundbreaking series of games that changed the face of shoot n loots forever. Borderlands 1 by itself is a great game, but with community mods, multiplayer, and dlcs, the game turns into something amazing. I played it on my ps3 for a little bit when it first came out, but it got boring on console due to the lack of friends that would want to play Borderlands, but now, its amazing. If you are looking for a shoot n loot/rpg game that is easy to run on your pc, this is it. If you can't run it right away try right clicking in in your steam library and going to startup options ad putting in ""-dx9"" without the """"s.

												Borderlands is a fantastic game. Whether you play alone or with three of your buddies, youre definately going to add on hours fast. The story is that youre basically looking for a vault filled with treasure from a long told legend, ""The Legend of The Vault."" You can choose to play as one of four characters, all with unique traits and special abilities. The gameplay is very solid and super fun. You begin at level one and progress earning experience points by killing things, completing quests, and finishing challenges. One more thing, LOOT!! Loot plays a huge role in this game. There are rarity levels(White - Green - Blue - Purple - Orange) of loot and many types of equipment ranging from shields and grenades to rifles and rocket launchers. The game also generates thousands of weapons at all rarity types so the probability of finding the same weapon is near to impossible.8.8 out of 10			"

												Although I am biased in the fact that it was the first game I played that did not involve racing or mindless zombie shooting, Borderlands is the number one game in my heart. I love everything about it, from its rough-around-the-edges visual style to its witty and often nonsensical dialogue to its killer soundtrack. The playable characters are so carefully constructed that you forgo class for personality and their particular background and skills provide a completely different experience on each playthrough. The NPCs grow on you like weeds and you find yourself hesitating to shoot enemies just because they look so cool. The gameplay is very straightforward and the RPG elements not at all off-putting for those averse to the genre. More importantly, despite making for an amazing single player experience, it’s co-op that really takes the cake. I cannot possibly express how fun the Borderlands game series are when played with your best friend so I can only urge you to try it. Now.			"

												Good humour and doesn't take itself too seriously which is part of its charm. The art is a little bland and there's not much endgame but it's addictive and a great multiplayer blast that doesn't suffer from the bloody stupid difficulty setting problem of the sequel.It's a loot based game where you are a vault hunter who is looking for said vault. Legend has it that it's filled with loot. There are four classes to choose from that feel distinctly different. As you level up you choose (mostly passive) new skills. Each class has a unique skill they can activate that really helps them out of a tight spot. For example Brick (the tank class) goes berserk and gains super powerful punches, health regen and damage resistance.The weapons are wacky and nonsensical but loads and loads of fun. Rocket launchers that fire five rockets at once, shotguns that fire pellets in a wave formation, corrosive assault rifles, rocket firing shotguns. So many different guns its just silly, a good silly.Sadly there is an ugly side to the weapons. Modded weapons are rife in Borderlands, either with sensible stats or those that are just over the top (capable of one-shotting Crawmerax). If you hate modded weapons in your game being polite and asking for them not to be used is usually met with rudeness or plain defiance. Also be aware of the idiots that don't get you might be new to the game and don't realize that you are unaware that the gun you have is modded (modders like to hand them out). You try and explain you didn't realize and their tiny little minds still go into rage overdrive, unable to process that little bit of information. I'm sorry internet tough guy!Anyway aside from the human race occasionally buggering things up (again) you can also join plenty of random games without that nonsense.			"

												tl;dr It's good but a terrible single player game, unless your into that kinda stuff like me~ 8/10Edit: The Multiplayer is now supported through steam so if you wanna play it with friends, do it! I've beaten the main story so I feel like it's time to post a review. I enjoyed this game a lot more than I thought I would. A friend recommmended this game to me. At first, I wasn't sure, but I decided to buy the GOTY edition during the summer sales. I've always loved RPG games. This game has a lot of aspects I like in a RPG game but with guns. Granted, I'm not a huge fan of FPS games but that wasn't a factor with my opinion of the game. It doesn't take itself seriously and I love it. When I finished building my PC, this was the first game I played on it. It will be special to me in that way as well though I hope that doesn't make my opinion bais. I recommend this game a lot. The only things that would make me say otherwise are if you enjoy single player games only, you don't like having constant side missions, and/or if you want to play with your friends RIGHT NOW. I played through this game all on my own because that's how I like to play, but with this game, that's harder to do mostly because it gets boring easily. The multiplayer is down temporarily due to the mulitplayer being intergrated with gamespy's site. Since gamespy closed down, playing multiplayer has been almost impossible. I say almost because there is a LAN option, but for most people I know at least, they would only be able to play through the multiplayer. Steam is in the process of changing this so the multiplayer is through their servers like Borderlands 2 but I have no idea when this will be finished. If those reasons don't effect you, get the game. If you want to play multiplayer on the first Borderlands, you'll be able to at some point so I wouldn't say that's a huge deal breaker, with me at least.			"

												This game is alot of get guns kill things get bigger guns kill bigger things, but it truly is loads of fun to play. It has a great sense of humor, it has tons of enemies, way more guns then there are in every COD game combined, lots of side stuff to keep you interested, and the cartoony art style is a nice break from all the gritty next gen super realistic stuff. There's also alot of strategy involved because you can only carry so many guns/items at one time.			"

												GUN FARMING SIMULATORPlayed the heck out of this game back when it was released. I found it tad difficult to get used to again after playing BL2 so much, but I must admit it's still quite good.If you're looking for a ""complete"" Borderlands experience, I'd recommend going for the second game (GOTY edition is good). First Borderlands felt like a beta for Gearbox to test new grounds, before they fixed everything and released BL2.I found Pre-Sequel disappointing as it was pretty much the same BL again for a full price and another crapton of DLC... also the writing was weaker than in BL2.I'd recommend getting BL if you can catch it on sale sometimes/somewhere f you've already played the newer games. It's fun for what it is. For newcomers to the franchise, go for BL2.			"

												This is one of the most fun co-op campaign FPS games I've played in ages.  I've gone through it countless times on console, and find it quite serviceble on PC.  While it is balanced favoring the Siren due to the commonality of better suited drops for her, it's entirely fun and playable as all of the classes and an excellent way to spend an afternoon with friends.  It's a nice blend of modern MMORPG equipment collection with casual shoot 'em up action and a taste of snarky comedy writing.			"

												Extremely hilarious and fun game.  There are some minor issues with the game, but the overall story and massive amounts of loot make up for the issues.  Co-Op is very fun, but you can play the game completely solo through multiple playthroughs.  Try out different classes to find out your playstyle.  I found that Roland was the best for me since he can regenerate ammo non-stop.  Since that is the case, I was able to hold down my fire button and never let go.  There are many possibilites in the game and it's worth the purchase just to see what guns you get at random!  Highly recommend!			"

Borderlands is a series and franchise that has taken my gamer heart from the first badass Each borderlands has its pros over the other, the orgininal sets the foundation of pandora, and introduces you to the bare basic mechanics that will become very familiar in the other games such as the ability to set up your skilltree to suit your playstyle.Borderlands develops the characters you learn to love and adore in the next two games in the series, and is a must for the loot loving explorer i know you are. I recommend you start here if youre new to the series. Then progress through the series in - kinda - reverse order. BL1 BL2 BLPS then Tales from the Borderlands.			"

It would probably be a lot more fun with friends, but since you all have to play at the same time and if anyone starts playing without the others, they'll quickly become overpowered in comparison to the rest of the team due to how quickly you advance in this game.

												Borderlands is the first game of the Borderlands trilogy and it's an ok start to the series. This FPS with RPG elements a is stupid and violent looter shooter, so if that's your thing, grab yourself a friend (or 3) and fight your way through the deserted, eponymous, cel shaded Borderlands of Pandora, quite honestly a♥♥♥♥♥♥hole of a planet, as one of four classes.Pros:-One playthrough (with all DLC except the arenas) can last up to 60 hours depending on how thorough you complete quests-Playable in coop with up to 3 friends-4 different classes with unique skills, each with 3 skill trees you can combine after your hearts content-Effectively an endless amount of weapons with some juicy abilities-Big and diverse world-Action packed fights-Graphics-HumourCons:-Some bugs and glitches-Some quests may be repetitive-Depending on your equipment there can be segments which are full of bullet sponges and tough to get through-Story is pretty much non-interactive-Quite some DLC-Graphics-HumourPersonal opinion:Borderlands is an ok game as far as I'm concerned. If you're a diehard fan of the Borderlands series, then why don't you have it already? If you are looking for a good entry into the series, I'd recommend to start with Borderlands 2. Sure, there are some characters in Borderlands 2 that you would know a little bit more about if you played the first one, and some areas would be cool to go back to, but the second part is just way better rounded out and honestly, the narrative is not what makes you want to play a Borderlands game. Borderlands hasn't aged all that well, and it's not even all that old. If you can get it cheap, grab yourself a friend and play it, otherwise, there's not much harm in skipping this one. It's not bad, but it's not too great either, especially when there are two newer Borderlands games to choose from.			"

												This game has multiple classes, special graphic style and many secondary quests with pretty good main story.1. StoryIt is not complicated one but it keeps you going. It will definitely take you some time to get to the end of it. The big finale was pretty insteresting eventhough the last fight was very easy, although the boss looked cool. The main story has some twists, but nothing that surprising. It also had some awesome voiceovers, especially the robots :)2. GraphicBorderlands has definitely its own graphic style and even I played this game many years late, I still had no problems with the graphic quality. I had to get used to the style, but never had some major issues.3. GameplayAlright. This one gets a little bit tricky. Some guns on some enemies acted weird and eventhough I hit 100% headshot, I didn't kill the enemy. The guns are pretty fun and it's nice that you have many options and can hold up to 4 guns at the same time. Also some other gears to put on later stage. Eventhough there is the car system and port system, there is going to be a lot of running. You can't go everywhere in your cart and shoot everything easy with it which I really liked because that would be just dumb. The gameplay itself could get sometimes repetetive and even intense because even with really good weapons and headshots it took a lot to kill the enemy and if there was more of them, well, then it was not pleasant. You get respawn though, but it cost you money. The money it cost is calculated on how much money you own at the moment which was nice. Also if you die you actually don't die right away and you get a chance to kill enemy which pops ""second wind"", basicly resurecting you on spot which was very handy. Although there was some weird things with some guns I enjoyed the gun play and the special class skill was also pretty cool.4. Final wordsFinishing this game took some time and I got sometimes a little bit bored, but it kept me going. Only thing what bothered me was that I had to clear some areas over and over again and a lot of running didn't help either. Nice touch is that you some enemies have different weak spots so you just dont go headshot everything. Story was decent and gameplay was enjoyable enough.7/10 - Good game			"

												A great co-op game to play with friends with addictive Diablo-style questing and looting and a ""wacky"" sense of humor that was more funny at the time than it is now. A story that's so light it's hardly there and some clunky console-focused mechanics are annoying, but the core gameplay is good enough to mostly overcome that.Running around and shooting stuff until it dies and loot pops out has never been so fun.Oh, the guns in BL1 are a million times better than in BL2.

However, I don't really have any gaming friends and I think no one is playing it anymore since this is a 2008 game and I'm only playing it in 2014, so the lobby right now is empty.

It's a fun and entertaining game, alone or with friends, and should be given an oportunity for it's great story, clever humor and countless hours of slaugther and loot party. Give it a go when in sale, the GOTY often goes 5 bucks and it's a cheap grab for many many hours of fun, laughs and murdering.			"

												Great game, love every hour I spent playing it. Gameplay is great, feels very rewarding, and the story is entertaining but Borderlands is not mostly based on the storyline. For those of you that have not played Borderlands, its a ""comicbook-like"" shooter. the graphics are bold and in your face, but it makes the game creative and unique. It's very entertaining, and theres always something for you to do. ias you can see, I have over 30 hours in it, and I have not beat the game yet. Although I do have to say, I recommend Borderlands 2 a bit more, everything they lacked in Borderlands One, they made up for in the second game. If Borderlands two had not been created, would rate this game a 9/10 (no games are perfect) Definitely worth the buy!			"

												This game is pretty much perfect. You can spend so much time playing through the main storyline (twice with the same character as a result of Hardcore mode) and completing every sidequest available, just to doo it all over again with a new character. Add some friends, and it's a party. If I could make a few suggestions if you're someone who would be interested in buying this game, buy the GotY edition. I bought it for 15 bucks during the christmas sale, and it was money well spent. Each of the DLCs for this game can add another 10 hours of play time. Second, start off as Brick if you're completely new to the game, his muscle mass and hilarious look of him wielding a tiny SMG are things you can't forget about. If you're squeamish, good luck trying to bleach your brain of Borderlands, but this game is incredible in a special way, in that it's a game you can have endless amounts of fun playing. "

I think I've put in about 900 hours on the xbox 360 and still keep coming back to it. If you're going to start the Borderlans series, definitely don't skip this game, or better yet start with it (especially since there's no handsome Jack). There's so much to do in the game and you can play it melee, mid-range or from far awat. The DLC are really good in this game too.			"

												There are few games that I would ever give the title of ""Epic"". Mostly because that terms is sadly applied to every mediocre title or franchise that comes down the pike, that it's really lost all clout. However, Borderlands is a title, if not a franchise, that deserves such a monicker.Right from the opening movie, the game immerses you into the world of Pandora as seen through the eyes of four ""Vault Hunters"" seeking a legend told to them in youth. But Pandora isn't your usual Sci Fi planet filled with green skinned women and chest bursting aliens. Rather, it's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of a massive scrap yard and the movie 'Deliverance', as mountains of discarded trash make up the scenery and most of the inhabitance would rather fornicate with your corpse rather than talk to you. Laden with the blackest of humor, characters that are both hilarious and creepy, Borderlands is an experience that should be a part of every game collection. Mechanical speaking, you will find few titles as sound as this. Playable on both high power PCs and even strip down models, the FPS mechanics are impeccably done, merging gun and run with special abilities and traits that make each hunter an experience in themselves to play. This title is a must for co-op players who are looking for a game that they will play over and over again. DLC is solid, and gives a great in between for players that still want to experience Borderlands without playing the main title, or sinking to play the horribly sub-par sequel. This game will give you it's worth, even at full price. I've owned it for a few years now, and I still go back with my friends and play it through again, still finding new guns and items not found in previous playthroughs.			"

												1st person, post-apocalyptic shooter with sci-fi, RPG elements and a lot of silliness.You play as one of 4 vault hunters, so called ""wanna be heroes"" guided by the mysterious entity in promise of unworldly riches and fame. Everything happens on Pandora, a fictional post-apocalyptic looking planet, with a lot of alien monsters, bandits and random ""friendly and unfriendly"" characters who want to earn money off of your talents, and exploit you any chance they get.Game has ""cartoony"" look about it, and even though it looks a bit outdated and doesn't shine in terms of texture quality, you don't really notice it much while playing. Environments are large open areas divided by loading checkpoints for transition. This being post-apocalyptic game, landscape is a bit boring, with not much color in it, and mostly wasteland. You can use few vehicles in the game for faster travel between areas, or simply to kill and drive over enemies. Fast travel option is also in the game, which is handy, but it's not available in some of the DLC areas, thus require you to drive through the same ""levels"" multiple times.In the game you kill enemies, complete missions to gain XP and advance in levels. Maximum level is 69, and to reach that you probably will have to do couple playthroughs of the game. Yes you can replay the game with your character as many times as you want, or join your friend to help him / her out with missions or hard boss fights. Depending on how many players are in the game, you get higher chance to get rare and more powerful items, but be mindful, more players means stronger enemies.Every vault hunter has their own talents, uses as well as their strong and weak sides. All of them can use any weapon in the game, yet some are more skillful with specific type of weapon or no weapon at all. There are pistols, revolvers, SMGs, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, alien weapons and grenades. Every hunter has their own special activated skill and melee attack that can be influenced by 3 talent trees on every hunter you can spec in.Game supports 4 player co-op, yet you share your loot with other 3 players, so my advice is to play with friends or people you know, or just agree before hand to share the loot drops. Apart from story, humor and outrageous amounts of silliness, next strong aspect of the game is item variety. It's similar to the Diablo 2 system, where you get random stats on items, but in this case random stats and effects on weapons, shield generators, grenade module and skill / talent enhance module.There are different types of ""gear manufacturers"" in game, and their items focus on specific attributes. Some manufacturers have higher reload or clip size in their weapons, others have higher damage or accuracy. So you can find pistol that has 2 bullet magazine, but outrageous damage. Some weapons have elemental effects, that add electric, explosive, burning or acidic damage to enemies.Main currency in game is money, you get it by completing missions, from selling items or simply looting from environment and defeated enemies. If you die, you're charged some percentage of your total amount of money for reintegration into the world. Basically they clone you back into the game, don't ask me how, they just can.When this game first came out, it was a unique experience, being similar to Diablo 2 but with guns in 1st person mode. Even now, this game is favorite of many players, it's a simple yet enjoyable shooter with loads of loot, freaky enemies and silliness. Played around 30 hours of it, completed the story and some DLCs, but no ability to fast travel in them, bored me really fast. Money well spent considering the GOTY is very cheap, but I don't recommend buying DLCs separately, some of them aren't that good.Enjoy.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. Get quest. Go to point on map. Kill big monster. Get rewarded better gun. Use it to kill even bigger monster and get even bigger gun! Get another quest. Repeat. And it's the first RPG First Person Shooter: for that it deserves our respect. It has a fun sense of humor (depending on your taste in humor)  a fun story, and fun mechanics. It's just fun.I got a lot of play out of it, the main story and every side quest was over in maybe 30 hours, and then playing through all the DLC took me about another 30 hours. All of the DLC are worth it, with the exception of Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot, which is just waves of enemies forever and ever. But if you buy it, you're going to buy the GOTY version, anyways.I love this game and I don't regret any of the 67 hours I spent playing it. So should you buy it? Actually, no. You shouldn't buy it.Why?Because Borderlands 2 exists. Borderlands 2 is just a better version of everything good from this game, and you're better off spending your time in that game. Unless your computer is 10 years old and can't run it. Then by all means, get Borderlands 1 and have a great time. :)			"

												Pandora, a world full of bandits, mayhem, and thousands upon thousands of different guns that you can use the rip apart any resistance you encounter as you make your way to the mysterious Vault in hopes of unlocking it's alien treasure. Play solo or in up to a four member team on an adventure that will chance the way you look at FPS games with light and asscessable RPG elements. With a vast and exciting main story and the addition of three stunning DLCs packed with adrenaline fuled action, you would be a fool not to become a Vault Hunter yourself.			"

												Shotgun revolvers, shotguns that fire rocket launchers, rocket launchers that fire several rockets at the same time. Man, this game has got all the guns!It's the sheer variety of guns that drives the gameplay in Borderlands, that's 50% FPS and 50% inventory management simulator. The quests, whilst delivered with some humorous fluff, are standard-fare MMORPG types of ""Go here, kill X amount of the thing"" or ""Bring me back Y amount of animal tails"" that generally exist to faciliate in you shooting things. Unfortunately, this doesn't really change throughout the game, apart from the infrequent ""Go kill this boss"" missions which have you rampaging through a linear environment, but as you move through the world of Pandora, a plot does eventually begin to form and will drive you through the final few areas that are a little more interesting than the earlier ones.The world will probably make or break your enjoyment of the game as the variety of ridiculous guns you amass along your way are all very satisfying to use and apart from the odd combination and those of lesser qualities, are generally all useful. The problem, if you see it that way, is that the world is one giant dust bowl. For me, I liked that it had this one, constant, drowning feeling of being on this crappy planet, where the greatest resources are dust, sand and rocks. Whilst the environments remain similar for the majority of the game, they're different enough that it prevents me from getting bored and quick teleportations and a speedy vehicle do help to get you to where you want to fairly easily. While enjoyable solo too, especially as a heavier damage dealing class, there's extra fun to be found in co-op, as different classes lend each other assistance and you can move together through the empowered enemies.If you can survive the world and possibly some bad luck with random weapon drops, if you like shooting, random loot games and getting powerful, Borderlands is there for you.DLC:General note - once you finish the main story, you have the option to commit to a NG+. It can be easy to out-level the early stages of NG+ by playing through the DLC, making both the NG+ and the DLC very easy and with little chance of upgrading. The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned - Whilst the AI in the stock game is generally pretty simple, it's literally brainless here. There are few enemy varieties, but the new areas to fight in are mostly different and it can be completed in a time-frame that feels just right.Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot - Arenas! Solo, it can be pretty challenging and perhaps a bit dull especially as item rewards are pretty pitiful, but it can be fun for a few runs. It particularly shines in co-op, but other than for saying that you've completed a certain stage, there isn't really too much to it.The Secret Armoury of General Knoxx - Possibly the best content in the entire game, this DLC package offers some fun questing, vehicles and weapons to amasss in environments that are fresh and great to explore in.Claptrap's New Robot Revolution - Whilst adding new areas like Knoxx before it, this DLC has you fundamentally refighting a lot of the same enemies under some thin premises, especially in certain cases. Its plot may be crazier than Knoxx's, but it's also less engaging. Overall enjoyable, but a let down after Knoxx. "

												Very Addicting game! Unique weapons throughout the game. Fun story! I have beaten the game 5 times. Make sure to get the program WillowTree if you get stuck on a frusterating mission and dont want to take the time to do it all. The online portion of the game is alot of fun and is great to have help beating missions together with someone else. The DLC is really good, some are longer then others. The graphics are great. Gameplay addicting. Get this game if you get a chance on sale. Great game one of my favorites to play with others!!			"

												I played Borderlands 2 before I played Borderlands, and now I see where Gearbox got all their momentum.  There are many mechanics that are taken out of it when it transitioned to BL2, though I think the level of customization is slightly better in the original.  There are a lot of things to keep track of, which is why I love it.  Give it a shot.			"

												My first Steam recommendation... yes, it's that good.I'm not into post-apocalyptic settings (e.g. Mad Max-esque), but Borderlands' charm and style far outweigh that personal preference.Its remarkable cel-shading and hand-drawn textures are insanely beautiful. It feels like you're living inside a graphic novel. Also, the style of the characters' personalities is perfect, and with great voice-acting to boot.If you don't own this game, you're doing yourself a great injustice. Get the GOTY and come shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥with us!			"

												The one and only original multiplayer coop post-apocaliptic slaughterfest. Huge with the DLCs, it provides a massive playground to go up to level 69 ;). So far I would recommend playing as the Siren, she's well balanced and her speed stealth phase ability lets you run through the levels in no time. There are some awesome bosses and settings, and facing a wide variety of hordes of enemies can be a good challenge (specially from the Crimson Lance) . The soundtrack provides a good blood pumping tempo for the endless waves of opposition and the plot can be quite cruel and overall less cartoony than the sequel. Nice and gritty, the game provides endless hours of fun even specially now that the multiplayer is back up thanks to steam!			"

												I rushed through this game with friends when it came out, had fun, but most of the time I didn't know what was going on. They were always in such a rush. Borderlands 2 came out and history repeated itself, only this time everyone else got bored by the time we reached level 11.I started on my own and finished the whole thing, then all the DLC, then a second playthrough. Then I decided to go back to the original Borderlands. This game was where it all started. The DLC is great too, Zombie Island and Captraps Robolution in particular.Do yourself a favour, if you remotely enjoyed Borderlands 2 and you haven't tried this one, get it, especially if it's on sale. You'll either love this more than the second, or get more Borderlands out of it. There's plenty of story and fun to be had.			"

												This is a great shooter, that's for sure. You get a good and often hilarious story along with lots of sidequests, different kinds of loot and intensive gameplay. Not to mention the special graphics that only this game has. However, as I said this game is sort of hilarious, and to some this may be a downside since the game rarely takes the story seriously, so if you're looking for a ""serious"" game then this might not be what you're looking for, besides that, get it now!

												BorderlandsThere is so much I can say about this game good and bad, though mostly good. Like for example: The Gun-play in this game is very very good, it is very fun, it can be challenging (especially if you havn't played many FPS's before, like me), you'd think looking for loot would be boring but it isn't, it is always a treat to find a new gun or shield or a grenade mod that you feel suit you better than the last one. Another very good thing in this game is the dialogue and the writing, it is absolutly hilarious, if you don't burst out laughing at how fun the dialogue is then I do senserly feel bad for you. It took a few mintues for the game with it writing alone to hook me right on for the rest of the experience. And the RPG elements in form of skill progression is appreciated, especially for one such as me (a.k.a RPG lover).Unfortunetly there is a part of that game that is severly lacking, and that is the story. What story is there is very basic but  I found that the writing that was there still made it enjoyable. And all the boss battles you'll have along the way are fun. But to give a basic introduction to the story of Borderlands (No Story Spoilers): 'You play as one of four different Vault Hunters who arrive on the planet Pandora (no not that one) to seek out the treasured Vault said to contained riches beyond imagination and you are being lead to it by your ""Guardian Angel"".'However the ending isn't anything so write home about, it is disappointing and it does bring down the score and as unfortunate as it is it does take away a little from what the game tried to do.One last thing I should mention before I give my score is the co-op, I highly recommend playing with friends who also own the game. I did this I cannot even describe how much fun it was in the end, but to tell of the co-op. The way it works is that the more players there are in the game the harder the enemies will be, BUT and this is a big but (hence why I wrote it in caps) they also drop better loot. So it will become more of a challenge, more fun and more rewards.My verdict for Borderlands is a Good game and I highly recommend it to just about everyone as long as you don't mind FPS's or doesn't like playing with others.Score: Good!Thought the review was over? No not quite I want to tell you about the DLC's for this game as well. Three of them I would recommend and the fourth only if you like Arena Challenges. The four campaign dlcs are as follows (and the order you should play them in, after the main game).Dr. Ned's Zombie Island: This is a zombie DLC, but it isn't at all boring, quite the opposite in fact. It is mostly very fun, there is 1 quest that is very grindy and takes a lot of time to complete but overall I recommend it. And even as weird as it sounds a little but more story starts to come forward in this.Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot: This is a Arena DLC and a very annoying one at that, it was fun for the first couple of hours and the first Arena Challenge ""Prove Yourself"" was genuninly fun. But then the larger challenges was also fun when I started it up but it became boring and grindy a while in. And it never felt like it was worth doing since you gain no exp or weapon skill or anything, the reward for completing the quests didn't feel worth it either. I would only recommend it if you are really into Arena fighting.General Knoxx Secret Armory: This is what a DLC should be like, adds more to the story, feels relevant and deals with the consequences of the Main Storys ending. It is hilarious as always and as I played through I felt more and more drawn into the world of Pandora (no not that one). Highly Recommended.Claptrap's New Robot Revolution: The best DLC of them all and part of the reason you should play the other dlcs as well, since the DLC continues to build on the endings of the Main Story, Dr. Ned's Zombie Island and General Knoxx Secret Armory. This DLC truly captures the best that the rest original Borderlands and its other DLC has already created and does it all very well. Highly Recommended.And finally if you've made it this far down (which I doubt), then I just have one final thing to say: ""Buy the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game already!""			"

												Just finished Borderlands. And it is safe to say I'm definately going to move on to the sequel. I was rather apprehensive about playing this with a gamepad on my 360 / PS3. And I have to say I'm glad I waited to play it on PC. The controls are pretty nailed and solid on start up. Only thing I changed was putting my Melee on Mouse-3. Personal preference. The Narrative in Borderlands (In my opinion) Isn't extremely important to have a good time. I usually dislike RPG's with quite a passion. However, The RPG elements in Borderlands work absolutely perfectly. I played through with a Soldier, And mainly maxed out my 1st skill tree, Which definately worked for my single player walkthrough. My university lecturer reccomended this game to play with friends, However, If you do want to play solo, It Isn't broken in the slightest. But destroying things with 4 people would have been a great blast. The loot system in this game is incredible. Never once did I feel like looking at all of the loot was a waste of time, And I was very excited to see what I would find every time something dropped. Even when Half of it actually turned out to be useless. The solo campaign took me about 17 Hours, and theres 100's more hours of sidequests which you can do. So its safe to say this game definately isn't lacking in content. My only gripe about this game is I'm a massive soundtrack nerd. And the soundtrack in the game is rather bland and samey, Which for me kinda sucked, But thats nothing when you put it next to the awesome gameplay and comedy. Would reccomend to at least play through once. 8/10 Claptraps.			"

												Not a bad game at all. Exploits allot of hidden potential in the Unreal Engine on a graphical level previously unseen in games utilizing the Unreal Gaming technology.Pretty loose fit for the genre as it is interactive more than RPG although it sports the mission style game play mechanics of the lot with intermediary free roam slaughter-house fun.It's a good game for a first installment and does its part to raise the bar where others have  met status quo on a good day. The installment gets better as the eccentric details surface through the incorporation of DLC.Ultimately, 29 USD for the GoTY Edition with all available DLC was a good buy even though the P.C. version seems a bit much for the NT Kernel at times as does Fallout 3.

												Borderlands, Borderlands, Borderlands. You're such an odd game. On the one hand, it's fun exploring your vast world and collecting weapons along the way, the combat and guns are fun too. However your quests get grindy and repetitive, your story is non existant which would have made the quests more bearable if there was a more fleshed out story and your ending is seriously one of the worst i've played. But I feel that the pros outway the cons so I recommend it if you're a fan of action RPG's, just don't expect anything really great though.			"

												Been playing this game on multiple platforms since 2009, This game may not be perfect, but it sure is addicting and fun as hell to play through alone or with friends. Just trying to get the very best equipment is fun and addicting. I still have yet to find an Pearls across my 10 characters, but the search for one is one of the many aspects that this game has me coming back to play again and again! I highly recommend this game over the sequel if you prefer more challenge and more mechanics to loot. If you do get this game, I BEG OF YOU, to look at the mods and engine configurations because this game is abysmal for us PC elitists, but it can be made playable with some minor tweaks.If you have friends, this is a must have to play.

												Borderlands is a classic, timeless FPS game.  The graphics areCo-op muitiplayer games, up to  four players, are a fun & welcome challenge.  The storyline is entertaining, engaging & comical.   All of the DLC's have a story arc that I found engaging.  The Secret Armory of Knoxx DLC is probably the roughtest part of this series.  There is no fast travel option which makes it difficult for players who play in shorter sessions.  Each time you load into the Knoxx DLC region, you start at T-Bone Junction & have to fight, walk & drive to your questing area.  Sometimes this push to the questing area would take 45 minutes.  The Armory was also dissapointing as you only have a limited amount of time to scour for weapon upgrades before you are booted from the safe, never to see this treasure trove again.			"

												I love this game so much.  I've played through it at least a dozen times, and I still go back to it again and again.  It's a great FPS with RPG elements and tonnes of unique guns.  Some of them are hilariously good, like the double anarchy.  All the DLCs are fantastic too, except for the Mad Moxxi one.  Well worth the money.			"

												Lots of guns. Those are probably the most accurate three words to desribe Borderlands. The game has a long story (about 30 hours if you do all the missions) and a large variety of enemies to shoot. Classes have a lot of upgrade paths, and there is a big payoff for searching everywhere for hidden items. A lot of them kick serious♥♥♥♥♥ Unfortunately, the bosses are a total joke, and the storyline is very generic and boring. This is not the kind of game for someone looking for engaging characters and plot twists. Despite its faults, this is truly a great game.			"

												Extremely hilarious and fun game.  There are some minor issues with the game, but the overall story and massive amounts of loot make up for the issues.  Co-Op is very fun, but you can play the game completely solo through multiple playthroughs.  Try out different classes to find out your playstyle.  I found that Roland was the best for me since he can regenerate ammo non-stop.  Since that is the case, I was able to hold down my fire button and never let go.  There are many possibilites in the game and it's worth the purchase just to see what guns you get at random!  Highly recommend!			"

The 17,750,000 types of guns that can drop gives this game heaps of replayability. Top that off with multiplayer and co-op modes which scale to team size, share cash drops and loot properly and so forth, and this is a no-brainer. Runs like butter on my 3 yr old PC. Those that want 120+ hrs of gameplay, will want to snag the GOTY edition which includes the four DLCs.			"

												tl;dr It's good but a terrible single player game, unless your into that kinda stuff like me~ 8/10Edit: The Multiplayer is now supported through steam so if you wanna play it with friends, do it! I've beaten the main story so I feel like it's time to post a review. I enjoyed this game a lot more than I thought I would. A friend recommmended this game to me. At first, I wasn't sure, but I decided to buy the GOTY edition during the summer sales. I've always loved RPG games. This game has a lot of aspects I like in a RPG game but with guns. Granted, I'm not a huge fan of FPS games but that wasn't a factor with my opinion of the game. It doesn't take itself seriously and I love it. When I finished building my PC, this was the first game I played on it. It will be special to me in that way as well though I hope that doesn't make my opinion bais. I recommend this game a lot. The only things that would make me say otherwise are if you enjoy single player games only, you don't like having constant side missions, and/or if you want to play with your friends RIGHT NOW. I played through this game all on my own because that's how I like to play, but with this game, that's harder to do mostly because it gets boring easily. The multiplayer is down temporarily due to the mulitplayer being intergrated with gamespy's site. Since gamespy closed down, playing multiplayer has been almost impossible. I say almost because there is a LAN option, but for most people I know at least, they would only be able to play through the multiplayer. Steam is in the process of changing this so the multiplayer is through their servers like Borderlands 2 but I have no idea when this will be finished. If those reasons don't effect you, get the game. If you want to play multiplayer on the first Borderlands, you'll be able to at some point so I wouldn't say that's a huge deal breaker, with me at least.			"

												The one and only original multiplayer coop post-apocaliptic slaughterfest. Huge with the DLCs, it provides a massive playground to go up to level 69 ;). So far I would recommend playing as the Siren, she's well balanced and her speed stealth phase ability lets you run through the levels in no time. There are some awesome bosses and settings, and facing a wide variety of hordes of enemies can be a good challenge (specially from the Crimson Lance) . The soundtrack provides a good blood pumping tempo for the endless waves of opposition and the plot can be quite cruel and overall less cartoony than the sequel. Nice and gritty, the game provides endless hours of fun even specially now that the multiplayer is back up thanks to steam!			"

												Borderlands is the first in a groundbreaking series of games that changed the face of shoot n loots forever. Borderlands 1 by itself is a great game, but with community mods, multiplayer, and dlcs, the game turns into something amazing. I played it on my ps3 for a little bit when it first came out, but it got boring on console due to the lack of friends that would want to play Borderlands, but now, its amazing. If you are looking for a shoot n loot/rpg game that is easy to run on your pc, this is it. If you can't run it right away try right clicking in in your steam library and going to startup options ad putting in ""-dx9"" without the """"s.

												Good humour and doesn't take itself too seriously which is part of its charm. The art is a little bland and there's not much endgame but it's addictive and a great multiplayer blast that doesn't suffer from the bloody stupid difficulty setting problem of the sequel.It's a loot based game where you are a vault hunter who is looking for said vault. Legend has it that it's filled with loot. There are four classes to choose from that feel distinctly different. As you level up you choose (mostly passive) new skills. Each class has a unique skill they can activate that really helps them out of a tight spot. For example Brick (the tank class) goes berserk and gains super powerful punches, health regen and damage resistance.The weapons are wacky and nonsensical but loads and loads of fun. Rocket launchers that fire five rockets at once, shotguns that fire pellets in a wave formation, corrosive assault rifles, rocket firing shotguns. So many different guns its just silly, a good silly.Sadly there is an ugly side to the weapons. Modded weapons are rife in Borderlands, either with sensible stats or those that are just over the top (capable of one-shotting Crawmerax). If you hate modded weapons in your game being polite and asking for them not to be used is usually met with rudeness or plain defiance. Also be aware of the idiots that don't get you might be new to the game and don't realize that you are unaware that the gun you have is modded (modders like to hand them out). You try and explain you didn't realize and their tiny little minds still go into rage overdrive, unable to process that little bit of information. I'm sorry internet tough guy!Anyway aside from the human race occasionally buggering things up (again) you can also join plenty of random games without that nonsense.			"

												Borderlands is an absolute buy. It's a little slow going in the beginning, because money is hard to come by. Once you get a good weapon set, and learn the general areas to look for items to sell, it gets a lot easier. I have completed the first play through, and most of the DLC. If not for Borderlands 2 waiting in my library, I would be starting a second play through as soon as I get finished with the DLC. If you like FPS and/or RPG, you should check out Borderlands.Since the multiplayer was tied to GameSpy, I didn't get to play with anyone. For your first playthrough, I recommend Roland. His turret is pretty close to having someone there helping to take down your enemies. In fact, by the end of the game, I could let my turret kill bosses without assistance. Ammo was never a problem, because the turret can replenish ammo and health.			"

For those of you that have not played Borderlands, its a ""comicbook-like"" shooter. the graphics are bold and in your face, but it makes the game creative and unique. It's very entertaining, and theres always something for you to do. ias you can see, I have over 30 hours in it, and I have not beat the game yet. Although I do have to say, I recommend Borderlands 2 a bit more, everything they lacked in Borderlands One, they made up for in the second game. If Borderlands two had not been created, would rate this game a 9/10 (no games are perfect) Definitely worth the buy!			"

												Borderlands definitely gets my reccomendation, I would say that in short the game is a rather fun FPS with a good chunk of Rpg'ing, The landscape and oppenents can get quite repetitive after a while however the game attempts to make up with this by the sheer amount of guns. When i say sheer amount i mean that there are literally hundreds of different guns, some may feel much like a copy, however this is countered by the level system meaning that as you progress you will begin to see more and more types/combinations of guns and gun parts. Now the main problem with this game is the repetivity, this comes in the form of both landscapes and enemys, though a few different types of enemys are added occaisonally it stays mostly the same throughout the story, (this could be a problem fixed in the DLC, i'm not aware if it is or not) however the game trys to make up for this with several various jokes and or references that make the game entertaining at points. To wrap up i would like to say that what really makes this game worth playing are these two things. One is that you can literally jump into the game and have no idea whats going on and still just have a good time shooting things. Two is the multiplayer, You and four of your friends can jump in at any time to play together, which can lead to some interesting competitions, forced teamwork, hilarity and sometimes fights over guns, So overall i'd say if your going to get borderlands i'd reccomend you have a friend that plays it as well.

												The original Borderlands was big and ambitions FPS, giving players a Diablo-ish loot system with ""billions"" of guns (composed of parts under the hood), loosely RPG-ish mission system, vehicles, AND 4-player co-op that scales difficulty and rewards to the number of players. The inventory system isn't perfect, the NPCs are essentially static billboards, the story falls flat, and some regions and enemies are more fun than others. But overall it's a good-looking game full of challege, humor, wacky characters, a ridiculous number of guns, and many, many hours of entertainment. The bang for the buck is incredible. Don't forget the Secret Armory of General Knoxx DLC, which increases the level cap and adds some great new missions. The other DLC is probably skippable.			"

												This is nothing less than sheer enjoyment. The setting is a perfect combination of wild west frontier and off-world alien planet. It sets the scene for a myriad of goal based missions that though essentially based on the same mold you never get tired of going for. There is a point when the missions do get repetitive, around the mid-point of my second play through, but the drop-in-drop-out save by location mechanism means you can play as much as you want and leave it, till your ready for the next time.Where Borderlands really excels though is the unique character types available and their diverging skill sets. This means you can choose a character that suits your particular play style and further customize it, to your preferred killing style - NICE!Singleplayer is great, but multiplayer is even better...  increasing the amount of fun to be had ten-fold! It also works seemlessly so you can switch between the two types with different characters.  Weapons-wise though the range is there, the best weapon you can get hold of is essentially the one you like best. This was perhaps the biggest disappointment for me. The range is there but the differences are so slight I didnt bother changing loadout too often.Finally the DLC are all worth getting. Ive completed ZED Island and that was significant compared to the cost. Cant wait to try the others out. All in all worth the money and then some! Can't recommend this enough.			"

												The first game in a very good series, Borderlands is an incredibly fun game for those who are into co-op RPGs. The original featured, in my opinion, some of the best characters, notably Brick. To give you an idea of how seriously this game takes itself, selecting Brick and leveling up allows you to pull out your fists every 30 seconds and imbue them with the power of corrosion or fire. Yeah.Since it's 2016 and both Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel have come out, the game's mechanics can feel a bit outdated, but if you're looking to buy Borderlands 2 I definitely recommend purchasing this first to get some backstory. Full of humor, drama, and exciting gameplay, Borderlands ranks as one of the best modern-day RPGs. Play this if you enjoyed Dead Island or Skyrim.			"

												The cartoonish style of Borderlands might be a minus for some, but Gearbox uses that to implement a particular gore style and a buttload of humour. Best Features:  - Loot, loot again and some more loot there. - Leveling. Even though it is a FPS, the leveling system let you play four different characters with each three different talent trees.  - Humour. The humour in this game is genius. Shooting to death a bandit at point blank with a sniper and stumbling across his arm a few feet farther is always nice in that kind of game. Plus the CL4P-TP robot makes me think of the hyperactive child GLADOS would have had if she could have one. - It plays well in solo and great in co-op. The game stays the same and you have many hours of gameplay. Took me around 40 hours my first time with a little try of every character and some fooling around. Minus : - It is kind of an open world but you can't really venture off to the high level zone if you're not yourself high level. The trash mobs will kill you pretty fast.  - Community is greedy. If you play in a quick match online, you might have to fight for the loot.  - PvP is not really insane in Borderlands. Though I had my fun on PS3 killing those hacked-shield wielder in the small arena in the first zone.			"

												If you have never played Borderlands before and you want to know if you should before playing the sequal the answer is yes and no. No because story wise it dosent tell you anything the 2nd game wont clarify. Yes because it will get you invested in the characters and give you a better feel of why Jack is badguy. All of that aside there really aint no rest for the wicked and i can back that claim up. Iv spent so many hours with this amazing FPSRPG that iv lost count. What it lacks in a deep intresting story it makes up for in fun 4-way co-op. The random gun generation means that no play through will be quit the same. The art style blends well with the gameplay and the game itself doesn't try so hard to be funny (like with the sequal). The gameplay can get a little repetative (it is an FPS after all) so its best not to play for very long at a time. The only real glaring issue with Borderlands are its legendary guns; the weapons that are ment to be top tier. Many of them have been codded incorrectly and dont behave as intended. This is a very minor oversight and really does nothing to take away from the game. It just messes with my OCD. Also hellfire is OP.			"

												Quick Summary – A First Person Shooter in an open world with a random loot drop system so you can grind for awesome weapons. Multiplayer co-op is built into the game so you can play with your friends, but you may want to go through it the first time by yourself so you can take your time and absorb the story. Overall a great game that will take you a long time to complete, especially if you play the game in “hard mode” after beating the story.You take on the role of one of 4 “vault hunters” recently arrived on the planet Pandora, searching for a mythical alien Vault, supposedly filled with treasure and advanced technology. While each of the playable characters has their own backstory, the real flavor of the game comes from the colorful characters that you meet during your journey. Not only are you up against the huge bandit population, but Pandora is stocked up on alien wildlife, and the powerful Crimson Lance army is here to claim the Vault for themselves.The game is played in the first person perspective, and most of the combat is with the various guns and grenades that you find all over the place. Borderlands was advertised as having millions of different guns, and this is technically true. There’s a behind-the-scenes weapon “component” system that randomly determines the attributes of every gun you can find (even the unique quest rewards and legendary weapons). 2 guns can have almost the exact same specs but one has slightly higher damage, meaning these are 2 different guns. For gameplay purposes though, just find the most powerful weapons you can get with a nice variety of “elemental damage” (fire, lightning, corrosive) so that you can do bonus damage to any different types.It’s not all about shooting though, the game also has an RPG-like skill system. When you level up you get a skill point to put into one of your passive skills, most of which are built around your character’s unique special ability. Depending on how you allocate your skills, your gameplay style will change drastically. Note that buying a skill respec is easy and inexpensive in this game, so feel free to try out various styles. Roland the soldier is good for beginners and Brick the berserker is good for experienced players in my opinion. Pros:+”Drop in” co-op multiplayer where you can just join a friend’s game and play along with them. The biggest difference between multiplayer and singleplayer is that if you’re with a friend, they can rescue you if you go down. If you’re by yourself and get taken down, you need to get a “second wind” by killing an enemy in about 5 seconds or you die.+There’s a huge number of side quests, and if you do them all you may find yourself a bit overlevelled. It’s worth it though, to experience the story and background of Pandora. Something I wasn’t initially aware of, is that you do reduced damage to enemies that are higher level than you. If you’re having trouble in an area, go do some side quests and when you level up, the enemies will be easier even though you’re using the same weapons.+As mentioned before, there are a lot of characters to talk to and work with during the game. Even the enemies can be funny (right before you kill them). Cons:-I really only noticed this after playing Borderlands 2, but in this first game it’s easy to miss the “flavor text” when starting a quest. It’s not read to you aloud, you actually have to scroll/read through it even though it’s presented as someone “talking to you.” Just a minor hindrance and it’s only a problem when you’re accepting a bunch of quests at the same time (you might miss out on why you’re doing a particular quest).-Playing the DLC missions can be a real grind fest. Especially the brain collecting missions in the Zombie Island of Dr. Ned, and the arena matches in the Underdome. The DLC are definitely fun and worth playing through, but some of the collection quests take forever (just skip them if you want).If you’re going to try playing the game to its completion with all the DLCs, expect to spend at least 30-40 hours. There are a bunch of Steam achievements and many of them are easily obtainable if you don’t mind spending the time (there are no “beat the game on super hard difficulty” type achievements. The ones that may give you trouble are the DLC tournament missions which you may give up on out of boredom, and the collectible achievements in the DLC New Robot Revolution.			"

												What Borderlands does better than anything is establish something deep and compelling quickly and with very little material. Though it might be more accurate to say that Borderlands is just very good at standing on the shoulders of giants. With clever use of archetypes, characters feel fully developed from the word go. The same can be said about the world of Pandora in which description is supplanted by an evocative soundtrack. There is no exposition detailing any of this depth, but the game still manages to imply it. Part of the reason this does nothing to disrupt the suspension of disbelief is that story is not at the game's center. Borderlands is about running around, killing varied enemies with varied weakpoints, and sorting through an infinite selection of weapons for the best one; anything else is secondary. None of that is terribly original, but every part of it is just so competently executed that it's a joy all the same. The little details the game does add, mostly through skippable mission dialogues, serve best as the context that leaves old, tedious actions feeling new and exciting. The RPG elements, namely the character skills, do much to relieve that tedium as well while also doing more to explain who the player characters are than any biography could. The four DLC packs do attempt to fill in some of the blanks left behind by the game's 'on-the-go' design philosophy, each with surprising extensive additions, Mad Moxxi's Underdome excluded. That pack does include a needed banking system, but unless you love the shooting aspect of Borderlands so much that you're aching to do it in one of three small arenas for hordes on hordes of the same enemies, it would be better to skip that one. The other three, however, add and flesh out new characters along with developing old ones, all clocking in at around three to five hours each. While they do stand as worthy expansions of the main game's content, they just can't match the amount of flavor and enjoyment the main game has to offer. It's a bit of a shame then that this 7-year-old game isn't going to be getting anymore plot-hole filling expansions at this point, but that disappointment only goes to show how well it's aged and how much it still has to offer.

												If you plan on playing the Borderlands series for the very first time, I definitely suggest starting with the first game. You may think that this is customary, and 'of course i'll start with the first game!"" but i'm warning you that if you start with BL2 and go back to play the first game, you may get bored. The first game is not as story heavy and the characters you meet don't quite feel as important or connected as they do in the second game. But the first is still definitely worth playing and is a good introduction to the world of Pandora!			"

												It's an awesome game. Lots of good fun to be had. It's more than a bit like Diablo but with asplodey guns that go bang bang in first person and make the baddies heads pop! There's a good deal of originality and flavor to be had, though not the deepest main story. Bit rough around the edges too, but it's too much fun to get overly annoyed at that. The visual style is something you'll either enjoy or not, but it is great to not see gritty realism for once. Pro tip, probably best to stick either with multiplayer with friends or go single player on any one playthrough, as grouping while in different bits of the game was kind of (extremely) poorly implemented. 4/5			"

												As someone who has played games since the age of 8 (that's 18 years on the trott now), I can safely say this is one of the most addictive games I've ever played. The amount of things you can do in the game is staggering. You choose how want to progress through the missions, either you stick to the plot ones to the storyline, or you can choose to do all the other missions and side missions first and come back to the main ones.There are 4 playable characters, each with their own special skill and focus regarding weaponry. The game uses a experience based progression system helping the player level up. After each level the player gains a skill point that they can choose to apply in 3 different branches for their character, thereby choosing the attributes they want. In terms of the graphics, the game uses a almost cartoon like style. Some of the maps really are huge with a generous amount of detail within. There are a couple of glitches and bugs, but not enough to detract from the wonderful game experience. If you haven't played any of the games in the Borderlands series, do yourself a favour and pick this first one up. It is the most streamlined of all the games, but in no way lacking in quality. "

												If you want a co-op, open world shooter with RPG elements, then Borderlands has you covered.Good: Borderlands is great to play with friends. You can create a unique characters with your friends, having different abilities and weapon proficiencies. You can run and gun through hordes of enemies, and laugh at the ridiculous stunts you’ll inevitably perform.Not-so-good: Borderlands can become repetitive, especially if you move through the game slowly. This is compounded if you play the game alone. By the time you complete the last quest, and get into the DLC, even with your friends, it will feel quite grindy.There is a story, but that’s mostly to provide arbitrary motivation to move around and shoot stuff. The characters are funny when you listen to them, but they don’t stay with you after you put the game down.			"

I recommend you start here if youre new to the series. Then progress through the series in - kinda - reverse order. BL1 BL2 BLPS then Tales from the Borderlands.			"

												There are few games that I would ever give the title of ""Epic"". Mostly because that terms is sadly applied to every mediocre title or franchise that comes down the pike, that it's really lost all clout. However, Borderlands is a title, if not a franchise, that deserves such a monicker.Right from the opening movie, the game immerses you into the world of Pandora as seen through the eyes of four ""Vault Hunters"" seeking a legend told to them in youth. But Pandora isn't your usual Sci Fi planet filled with green skinned women and chest bursting aliens. Rather, it's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of a massive scrap yard and the movie 'Deliverance', as mountains of discarded trash make up the scenery and most of the inhabitance would rather fornicate with your corpse rather than talk to you. Laden with the blackest of humor, characters that are both hilarious and creepy, Borderlands is an experience that should be a part of every game collection. Mechanical speaking, you will find few titles as sound as this. Playable on both high power PCs and even strip down models, the FPS mechanics are impeccably done, merging gun and run with special abilities and traits that make each hunter an experience in themselves to play. This title is a must for co-op players who are looking for a game that they will play over and over again. DLC is solid, and gives a great in between for players that still want to experience Borderlands without playing the main title, or sinking to play the horribly sub-par sequel. This game will give you it's worth, even at full price. I've owned it for a few years now, and I still go back with my friends and play it through again, still finding new guns and items not found in previous playthroughs.			"

												Fun game, AI is stupid as♥♥♥♥♥♥likes to rush you often,but when they have you covered at all angles get ready for a fight for your life. I like the game which is saying a lot cuz I am not a heavy fps fan. Has 4 different classes,a decent amount of guns,open world (Mad Max Style) environment, and chuck full of replay based on how you play with the chars you pick. Even though the AI is dense as fog, its still fun to hunt them ,snipe them,rocket launch them,etc and they are and not dumb enough that the game is pointless to play.. The game is just right,not to great,not crappy. Out of 100 I give BL1 GOTY about 75. If you want it,pick it up when it on sale for %75 off. Wont be a waste of your funds at all.			"

												Very fun RPG. I came in not expecting much after playing it (and not enjoying it) previously on console, but it felt way better on PC and was actually a great game. Some side quests were annoying and repetitive, and the main story felt way too short and kind of disappointing, but the gameplay itself was extremely fun and finding weapons was enjoyable. I'd give it a 7 or 8/10 because the gameplay was extremely enjoyable, and that's really what matters in a game.			"

												A great co-op game to play with friends with addictive Diablo-style questing and looting and a ""wacky"" sense of humor that was more funny at the time than it is now. A story that's so light it's hardly there and some clunky console-focused mechanics are annoying, but the core gameplay is good enough to mostly overcome that.Running around and shooting stuff until it dies and loot pops out has never been so fun.Oh, the guns in BL1 are a million times better than in BL2.

												FPS, aRPG, Co-op, AWESOME.The latter is the best description to this game.A perfect combination of Perk-based aRPG and Shooter (sans the aim twitching that a lot of shooters require, which makes this game far more ""approachable"") put in a blender with less than relevant NPCs, shallow and non-intrusive story and freaky enemies trying to skin your face to wear as a mask, added with some gore and ten tons of blood. That's Borderlands for you.And it's multiplayer mode is the best thing since sliced bread, to the point that some people claim this is one of those games that can't be fully enjoyed by yourself, playing solo. Well I say these people should be hung in a rope of Skag guts and left to rot under the scorching sun of Pandora, then respawned at a New-U station and beat to death with a Midget Psycho's arm - only to be revived yet another time and thrown again into the pit-fight/rat-race madness that is the planet's looming backdrop. Alone or with friends, this game is awesome.			"

												Just finished Borderlands. And it is safe to say I'm definately going to move on to the sequel. I was rather apprehensive about playing this with a gamepad on my 360 / PS3. And I have to say I'm glad I waited to play it on PC. The controls are pretty nailed and solid on start up. Only thing I changed was putting my Melee on Mouse-3. Personal preference. The Narrative in Borderlands (In my opinion) Isn't extremely important to have a good time. I usually dislike RPG's with quite a passion. However, The RPG elements in Borderlands work absolutely perfectly. I played through with a Soldier, And mainly maxed out my 1st skill tree, Which definately worked for my single player walkthrough. My university lecturer reccomended this game to play with friends, However, If you do want to play solo, It Isn't broken in the slightest. But destroying things with 4 people would have been a great blast. The loot system in this game is incredible. Never once did I feel like looking at all of the loot was a waste of time, And I was very excited to see what I would find every time something dropped. Even when Half of it actually turned out to be useless. The solo campaign took me about 17 Hours, and theres 100's more hours of sidequests which you can do. So its safe to say this game definately isn't lacking in content. My only gripe about this game is I'm a massive soundtrack nerd. And the soundtrack in the game is rather bland and samey, Which for me kinda sucked, But thats nothing when you put it next to the awesome gameplay and comedy. Would reccomend to at least play through once. 8/10 Claptraps.			"

												Gee, I don't even know where to start with this game. So, where should I start?First of all, the story of Borderlands. It has no flaws in it at all (unless you're a♥♥♥♥♥♥and you hate Borderlands) and there are soooooo many bosses to fight.The classes themselves each have their own strengths and weaknesses. The hunter is great with long-ranged weapons and loves picking off enemies with his Bloodwing, but isn't great at close combat or melee. The soldier is a great assault and defence class with his Sabre turret, but not really a sniper of any sorts. The berserker loves getting close up with both shotguns, rocket launchers and his fists (going berserk), and he's a tank, but he does need to get close up to do damage, thus taking lots of damage in the proccess. The siren can surprise enemies with phasewalking and can do well with elemental weapons, and - uhhh, what's the weakness with the siren?With these classes, there are great skills they can unlock. Headshotting and gaining health; lunging forward and dealing heavy damage; appearing and causing a massive shockwave full of fire, electricity and corrosion - they really have thought of everything to make people happy.But don't buy Borderlands 2 before you buy this. You need to play this one first to understand the storyline of Borderlands 2, with the vault hunters and Marcus and stuff. Overall, this game is greatcellentasticilliantulous!			"

												Borderlands is an addicting mix of FPS and RPG with very motivating gameplay. It features a large cast of loveable and funny characters, tons of loot and a relatively solid story, despite the terribly sudden and disappointing ending. However, everything up to that point is a joy to play. The game has been designed with co-op in mind and many people claim it's the only way to play it. I think that is nonsense. Playing with other people is almost always fun and yes, many quests in Borderlands are MORE fun cooperatively, but even if you play alone, the game is highly enjoyable, so I would definitely recommend picking this title up, regardless of having anyone to share the experience with or not.

												Это шутер от первого лица. Действие разворачивается на малонаселенной и пустынной планете Пандора. Почти все злодеи и персонажи здесь карикатурные. Оружие делится на классы: дробовики, пистолеты, снайперские винтовки, пистолеты-пулеметы, штурмовые винтовки, гранатометы, есть даже образцы инопланетной технологии. Новые уровни дают очки развития, на которые улучшаются навыки. В игре есть кооперативное прохождение. Все сюжетные квесты остаются в силе, просто вознаграждение теперь дается каждому члену команды. Моя оценка 10/10.			"

												It was great until the last update broke it with no way to fix it with compatibility mode or fiddling with the game files. If you get it to work its amazing. Run around. Collect all the stuff. Slaughter everything. Get your friends copies. Purge everything that moves. Its got a good story and the it scales nicely. You cant just rush the story to get to the end. You have to work for ait a bit but its not overwhelming. It makes you experience the story but the story is good. And theres also the joy of slaughtering everything you encounter.			"

												If you want a co-op, open world shooter with RPG elements, then Borderlands has you covered.Good: Borderlands is great to play with friends. You can create a unique characters with your friends, having different abilities and weapon proficiencies. You can run and gun through hordes of enemies, and laugh at the ridiculous stunts you’ll inevitably perform.Not-so-good: Borderlands can become repetitive, especially if you move through the game slowly. This is compounded if you play the game alone. By the time you complete the last quest, and get into the DLC, even with your friends, it will feel quite grindy.There is a story, but that’s mostly to provide arbitrary motivation to move around and shoot stuff. The characters are funny when you listen to them, but they don’t stay with you after you put the game down.			"

												tl;dr THIS. GAME. IS. JUST. AWESOME.I can finally say that I finished the game in 100%. Played on every class, wasted lots of hours to master this :PSo, in the game you're so called "" Vault Hunter "" which equals a guy who wants to steal some goodies from the old vault. You can pick one of three classes, every of them is uniqie and very fun to play. Roland can be both support and killing machine, Scorpio Turret makes everything easier to do.Mordecai is that type of guy, who is afraid of real warfare and shoots snipers and revolvers only, on long distances. Lilith is the run and gun type, loves every elemental weapon you can find. You can also act like you're a ghost with her skill PhasewalkBrick is another run and gun type, but he just LOVES explosions, rockets and shotguns. He can be played as typical Brick, which means total tank, he can be boxer ( oh yeah, forgot his ability, you're changing to a boxer for a couple of seconds.. ), or rocketeer. IMHO, the best charcter both for solo and co-op is Roland, mostly because of his abilities that make him all-rounder. Can play every weapon, resupply ammo, health.. Well, he's a one-man band. The whole game looks like this - you take quest, another quest.. oh, another quest! You do them, kill lots of enemies, lvl up, get back to guy who gave you the quest, he gives you some items ( most of them are bad, sadly ) and exp. OH, another lvl up.This is grinding type of game, someone who likes Diablo will probably like this too, especially due to procedurally generated weapons :P Many people say that it's the first Borderlands is the best Borderlands.. well, I can't agree. It feels very weird after playing 2 newer versions, the game feel is completly different. It's good, even very, but it's not the best Borderlands. At least in my opinion. OH, ALMOST FORGOT. DLCs are awesome, nothing more to say! :D			"

												I beat Borderlands on PS3 back when it first launched, and more recently beat it again on Steam. Sure, Gearbox helped push giants gobs of DLC into mainstream, and one could argue that the series has gone a bit stale recently, but for the time, Borderlands was an awesome experience. I have mixed feelings about the DLC, and especially about their weird little ""key"" giveaways, but that doesn't change the original Borderlands being a fun experience.It's not the most varied game, and by the end of the 20-30 hours of your first playthrough, some parts have gotten a tough tedious. But grab a friend or three, and blast through the hunt for bigger and better weapons. The original is still very much worth a try, but be warned that it's a fraction as enjoyable solo.			"

												FIrst it's about the level then it's about the loot. This game is really fun and is similar to a fallout co op. There are heaps of missions to do for hours and hours of gameplay but most of those are a little grindy. The main missions are great and it's something really worth playing with a friend or even a group. Solo it's not as fun as this game was designed for co op and is honestly one of the best modern co op games today. For a game made in 2009 there are some things that are annoying such as having to constantly pick up ammo and walk/drive back and forth between places without insta fast travel. The storyline is pretty good and dlc adds pretty much double the game play and is worth the extra cash you paid. It's not useless DLC just get the goty edition on sale and have a blast. Don't compare this to the second one because the second one is just amazing. FPS Diablo 8.5/10			"

												If you are looking for a action filled shooting games, with friends or solo, this game is it! Borderlands is by no means a cartoon game, and is filled with quite the amount of blood, spilled guts and limps. The game is level based, which makes it much more handy to play, so you can't just one shot an enemy and kill them, at least not in the higher levels. The main quest is filled with surprises, action, violence, comedy, thrills and much more. It is packed with hours of gaming, aside from the countless side quests and DEL quests, the vanilla game itself is amazing. You are even able to customize your own character, name and abilities. Whether or not you attack from a distance or face the enemies head on, both play styles are ""supported"" with the different characters. The game has a variety of weapons, how many I do not know, however there are more than I could ever count.. Some weapons are very unique, and will display different shooting animations, which is nice. However, back to the game. If you have played a lot of FPS games, than you will not be disappointed with this game, it has everything. The Game of the Year edition, has everything included, and you will not be bored at all. To summarize. Borderlands is an action filled FPS game, that never gets boring. Once you finish the game, the game has a special treat for you in store and makes it worth the while. The DLC's are also packed with action, which is a nice addition to the vanilla game, however, even the vanilla game is amazing by itself.			"

												Well, not much to say, game is awesome, just shot everything that lives, bcuz everything wants to kill u. Easy, just aim, and pull trigger, and dont stop, kill all, take loot, finish mission, take another, and repeat. After nearly 150 hours at time im writting it, im sure that ill spend another 150 farming achievements, and trying to get better gear. So if u r bored, and dont mind shoting and going from place to place just to finish mission then go ahead get BL. It will give u fun, especially weapons, so maaaaaaaaaaaaany, cant hold them all :c			"

												As someone who has played games since the age of 8 (that's 18 years on the trott now), I can safely say this is one of the most addictive games I've ever played. The amount of things you can do in the game is staggering. You choose how want to progress through the missions, either you stick to the plot ones to the storyline, or you can choose to do all the other missions and side missions first and come back to the main ones.There are 4 playable characters, each with their own special skill and focus regarding weaponry. The game uses a experience based progression system helping the player level up. After each level the player gains a skill point that they can choose to apply in 3 different branches for their character, thereby choosing the attributes they want. In terms of the graphics, the game uses a almost cartoon like style. Some of the maps really are huge with a generous amount of detail within. There are a couple of glitches and bugs, but not enough to detract from the wonderful game experience. If you haven't played any of the games in the Borderlands series, do yourself a favour and pick this first one up. It is the most streamlined of all the games, but in no way lacking in quality. "

												Borderlands is an amazing First Person Role Playing Shooter in a sense. It has a great leveling system, tons of loot to make your character stronger, and a very neat and organized skilltree. The story could have been better but its still acceptable due to the DLC and the amazing gameplay mechanics. There are some glitches that you can access and odd things happening, but its nothing game breaking. The soundtrack is also pretty good but it needed a lot more for how big the game truly is. So far even on a low end pc the graphics are decent and the gameplay is smooth. I didnt excpect it to be good on my pc. I am not saying every pc can play it but keep in mind I do not have a graphics card to run on its own. I currently have a processer with a built in graphics card.All in all this game is a solid 9 in my honest opinion (on a scale of 10). I love practically everything about it and Ive been playing it for many many years. Pretty much since it came out. I definetally recommend this and all the DLC to everyone who has yet to buy and or play it.			"

												Extremely hilarious and fun game.  There are some minor issues with the game, but the overall story and massive amounts of loot make up for the issues.  Co-Op is very fun, but you can play the game completely solo through multiple playthroughs.  Try out different classes to find out your playstyle.  I found that Roland was the best for me since he can regenerate ammo non-stop.  Since that is the case, I was able to hold down my fire button and never let go.  There are many possibilites in the game and it's worth the purchase just to see what guns you get at random!  Highly recommend!			"

Posted: August 17, 2014
												This game is awesome. Although many people will say that this games sequel ""Borderlands 2"" is the better game, I feel as though both games are equally good, though for their own different reasons. In the original Borderlands, you are thrown into the world of Pandora without knowing anything about it as a player. As you explore the planet, you learn more about the people who live there, as well as grow accustomed to the kind of wildlife that lives there. And you blow it all the hell up. Good times.You play as one of four people: Mordecai: The hunter, Lilith: The siren, Roland: The soldier, and Brick: The Berserker.Mordecai is an expert of long range combat, specializing in sniper rifles. His pet bird Bloodwing assists him in combat by swooping down and attacking enemies with it's claws.Lilith is a Siren Warrior come to Pandora to learn more about her kind. As you progress with her she will enhance her Phase Walking ability in addition to making use of various elemental damage types.Roland is a former Crimson Lance soldier who is now going his own way. He has a special turret he can deploy that guns down enemies for him and restores ally health.Brick is a monsterous wall with legs. Although he is definitly not dumb, he is very simple minded with his approach: Punch everything in the face until it dies. As simple as he thinks however, he is very effective at what he does. If he is ever surrounded by enemies in a locked room, he is not trapped in the room with them, they are trapped in the room with him. He specializes in explosive weapons and anything that packs a punch.Each of these characters is a vault hunter, searching for the mythical Vault on Pandora. The Vault is said to contain countless ritches, enough money to grant it's owner fame, political power, and women (Or in a womans case, men). Guided by a mysterious being called ""The Guardian Angel"" or just Angel for short, they travel across Pandora collecting pieces of the Vault Key to find and open the vault before time runs out and it seals for another 200 years.With your character of choice, you will gradually grow in level as each enemy you kill grants you EXP. As you gain levels, you will gain SP to spend on character specific skills and perks. These skills could be anything from giving your melee attack an elemental effect to increasing how fast you shoot bullets. Each character has 3 trees to choose from, and each tree has different possibilities for different builds. Even two people playing as the same character will be different in capabilities.What's really important though, is the guns. Guns are all over the place on this planet, and they are all yours for the looting. As you travel across the planet, you will occasionally find chests containing guns in them. You can also upgrade your grenades with Grenade mods, allowing you to change them in different ways like leeching enemy health to give to you to setting them on fire. Guns can also drop from things you kill, and you will sometimes find gun loot rooms filled to the brim with chests. Don't expect to find these rooms without earning them though, whether it be by completing a long quest chain or beating a powerful boss. If you aren't having luck with finding a good gun, you could always try buying one from one of Marcus's vending machines. You can also buy Ammo if you aren't finding enough on your journey.The music in this game is fantastic. It's hard to describe, but I guess a try would be that it's a kind of orchastral environmental music. It's beautiful while you are exploring and dramatic while you are in combat. It fits perfectly with the theme of the game, and is definitly worth a listen.The visuals are fantastic too. Everything uses a cartoony cell-shaded look that makes the game look rather timeless. Originally, the game was going to be very realistic in appearence, but they decided on this look instead. Although the original concept video showing these realistic graphics was impressive looking and visually stunning, I am glad they went with this look, not only because it still looks great and will for a much longer time but also because the humorious theme that the borderlands franchise has taken on fits with this visual style much better.The story is simple but well written. The characters you meet are interesting and likable, while the enemies you kill are satisfying to overcome. It doesn't just feel like you are shooting things all the time, you are immersed in the experience, you are a vault hunter overcoming challenges and proving yourself to the world as you search for the vault. You go from being just some stranger to everyone that is going to get yourself killed to a great hero that most everyone respects or fears.Back to my earlier comparison to Borderlands 2, the sequal to the original game that started it all does bring many improvements to the gameplay, such as improved visuals, greater exploration over a larger area, an even better story, etc. But for what it is, Borderlands the original is still a fantastic experience that I can easily recommend to anyone who likes first person shooters. If I had to give any advice, I would say play Borderlands 2 first, If you like Borderlands 2, then give the original a try. This way you will not judge Borderlands 2 by what you experienced in Borderlands 1 in the event that it's not your thing.			"

												GUN FARMING SIMULATORPlayed the heck out of this game back when it was released. I found it tad difficult to get used to again after playing BL2 so much, but I must admit it's still quite good.If you're looking for a ""complete"" Borderlands experience, I'd recommend going for the second game (GOTY edition is good). First Borderlands felt like a beta for Gearbox to test new grounds, before they fixed everything and released BL2.I found Pre-Sequel disappointing as it was pretty much the same BL again for a full price and another crapton of DLC... also the writing was weaker than in BL2.I'd recommend getting BL if you can catch it on sale sometimes/somewhere f you've already played the newer games. It's fun for what it is. For newcomers to the franchise, go for BL2.			"

												This is one of the most fun co-op campaign FPS games I've played in ages.  I've gone through it countless times on console, and find it quite serviceble on PC.  While it is balanced favoring the Siren due to the commonality of better suited drops for her, it's entirely fun and playable as all of the classes and an excellent way to spend an afternoon with friends.  It's a nice blend of modern MMORPG equipment collection with casual shoot 'em up action and a taste of snarky comedy writing.			"

												What can you say about Borderlands? The game has hours on gameplay and fun tactics with plenty of different weapons and variety of different quests. When I played the game, I played as Roland and his turret was really good to fight with and I felt like a could stand a chance even when I was doing a mission that was above my level. The only downside i would give the game is the lack of intense story constantly reminding you to do stuff but the fact that there is a wide variety of colorful characters going along with your journey makes it that much more interesting. The world is very expansive and has plenty of missions to do so over all i would give it an 8/10 because it has a really nice charm and really fun and addicting gameplay.			"

												Borderlands,what a great 2 part series, and this is where it begins.The first borderlands is in my opinion more difficult than Borderlands 2.Especially when it comes to achievements, which can be real hour-long grindfests.Graphic wise it looks good, may find it dated, but it does the job and gets you into the mood of a wasteland feel.Gameplay is pretty good, you can play each character in different ways, but one downside may be that you have to play the game again and again and again so the story may lose a bit of it's feeling, it gets worse in Borderlands 2, but I guess this is just a minor complaint.Story is good, DLC are rock solid best one is in my oppinion General Knoxx, because of what it adds and how much loot you become in comparison.Numeric Scores: Graphics: 3/5 Gameplay: 4/5 Story: 4/5 Result: 11/15 pointsEnding Comment:A fun shooter, which is fun alone and with friends, Min-Maxing aside you'll have fun using the Legendary weapons with cool effects.

												This game is one of a kind, bringing RPG and Shooter together with its great art style and crude humor. You can choose between 4 different characters, all with different stats and abilities, and then you go on an epic adventure of loot and battles which will blow your mind and keep you busy for hours.I would like to go over some problems the game has, though.No FOV slider- If you want to change your FOV, you have to go into the files and add your own hotkey for changing it. This problem was resolved in Borderlands 2 +No fast travelling to DLC areas- You can only fast travel to the starting area of a DLC, so if you are really far into the DLC you can't fast travel to your current quests are, you have to walk all the way there. This doesn't seem like a huge deal but when you are trying to farm bosses or something it gets super ♥♥♥♥♥♥. This problem was resolved in Borderlands 2 +No official mod support- This is a problem with all Borderlands games, they are almost un modable. Borderlands 1 is probably the most modable of the 3, but even thats pretty eh. Hopefully the next game has official mod support.Story- Most people complain that this game doesn't really have a story. I don't care since I don't spend the hundreds of hours I've spent in Borderlands for the story. But even then, it does have a story behind, the problem being that it tells most of it is told through text whenever you accept or hand in a quest. This problem is resolved in Borderlands 2 + though.The challenges- This is another problem fixed within the new Borderlands. Borderlands has a challenge system, which is much better in Borderlands 2 + with its badass ranks and stuff. In borderlands 1 its only really used to earn extra xp, but some of the challenges are ridiculous to complete. Like, for example, Winning 1000 duels. This means that you have to sit there for hours, winning duels with another player over and over and over again just to complete it. Luckily there is no achievement to complete every challenge in this game.Being someone who has played Borderlands since it first came out in 2009 (On Xbox), I think its fair to say that I am a pretty hardcore Borderlands fan. I would highly recommend every single Borderlands game to anyone interested in shooters or RPGs.			"

With the most cutting edge graphic capabilities, this game can constantly render up to 450 shades of brown, including Autumn, Rust, Sienna, and few more!

												Borderlands,what a great 2 part series, and this is where it begins.The first borderlands is in my opinion more difficult than Borderlands 2.Especially when it comes to achievements, which can be real hour-long grindfests.Graphic wise it looks good, may find it dated, but it does the job and gets you into the mood of a wasteland feel.Gameplay is pretty good, you can play each character in different ways, but one downside may be that you have to play the game again and again and again so the story may lose a bit of it's feeling, it gets worse in Borderlands 2, but I guess this is just a minor complaint.Story is good, DLC are rock solid best one is in my oppinion General Knoxx, because of what it adds and how much loot you become in comparison.Numeric Scores: Graphics: 3/5 Gameplay: 4/5 Story: 4/5 Result: 11/15 pointsEnding Comment:A fun shooter, which is fun alone and with friends, Min-Maxing aside you'll have fun using the Legendary weapons with cool effects.

Beat the game and be slightly dissapointed8. Play it 5 more times for the lols and reach lvl 69 (party)9. Do the dlc and cry at the amount of loot10. Finish all the dlc11. Play it again for safe measures12. Wait for paycheck to come13. Buy Borderlands 2 (GOTY of course)14. Buy all of the other dlc that isn't included in the GOTY (Mainly the second level cap w/ digistruct peak)15. Play the game (get your friend/friends to play with you and make sure one of you is a siren (and don't choose Zer0 he's trash))16. Meet the storys protagonist Jack (yes I know what a protagonist is)17. Get told sweet sweet lies from Roland and Lilith (dirty bandits)18. Start believing Jack is the antagonist even though I said he's the protagonist19. Kill Jack's daughter (realise Jack is pretty f***ed up)20. Watch as Jack goes insane21. Kill the corrupted hero and the thing that could restore peace to this wasteland22. Cry as the credits roll23. Borderlands 3 ideas?!? (Gearbox hurry tf up)24. Play the best batch of dlc's ever made25. Get more friends so you don't get wrecked by the savage raid bosses26. Farm the raid bosses until you get to lvl 72 and have epic loot27. Become OP!!!!!!! (IT'S A THING)28. Cry because your friends have families by this point and can't play with you (filthy bandits)29. Make new friends30. Buy the Pre-Sequel (GOTY isn't really worth it but who cares you're obsessed with these games by now)31. Learn why Jack is the true hero32. Be happy you didn't play as a filthy bandit back when you played Borderlands 1 (yes I know Brick is a legitimate bandit king, he's nice on the inside)33. Bring the totally not corrupt hero to power34. Learn that everything is Liliths fault35. Realise you're the antagonist in Borderlands 236. Watch as Jack fades into madness (All Lilith and Moxie's fault)37. Finish the game37. Get more hot Borderlands 3 hints38. Play all of the games again with your new-found knowledge39. Look up Borderlands 340. Cry41. Build a cryogenic sleep chamber and wait (they can't see you cry if your tears freeze before they can fully form)42. Wake up in a hospital because you tried to sleep in a freezer43. Play the games again44. And again (try out every possible character (with a frown the entire time you're playing as Lilith))45.

I quickly lost tack counting all the puns, references and inside-jokes.  Besides fast-packed action, development tree, insanely huge arsenal (about every gun you ancounter has different properties) and a twisted storyline with characters tending to cling to the verge of insanity (mostly from the wrong side), this game also includes a complete Nerd-o-Game cultural reference chart.""

The 17,750,000 types of guns that can drop gives this game heaps of replayability. Top that off with multiplayer and co-op modes which scale to team size, share cash drops and loot properly and so forth, and this is a no-brainer. Runs like butter on my 3 yr old PC. Those that want 120+ hrs of gameplay, will want to snag the GOTY edition which includes the four DLCs.			"

It has 4 classes each with unique abilities and different skill trees. The bosses and mini bosses are fun to fight and once you beat the game you get to do playtrough 2 with your same character,same guns and same skills but the game becomes even harder. 15/10 this is an epic game.

												I really enjoyed this game. I played through it one time using the soldier. I haven't gone back to try the other classes/characters, yet.The look of the game is appealing, and the overall feel (tone, story, etc.) is very nice. It has a feel similar to Rage, but with a an actual complete story to follow. The keyboard controls follow the basic FPS setup (WASD+Mouse), which makes the learning curve very easy. The driving element is pretty easy, as well, since you steer simply by looking around with the mouse and use the keyboard for forward, backward, and boost. The story is good enough to drive most of the action in the game (and is picked up and further explained in Borderlands 2). There is a lot of humor written into the plot that fits seemlessly with the graphic feel.One nice thing about the Game of the Year edition that I bought on Steam: it comes with all the available DLC on Steam. You won't find yourself being further prodded to spend $2 here and $5 there like with Borderlands 2. If you can get this one on sale, and you like post-apocalyptic/sci-fi/western shooters, this could be a great addition to your library.			"

												Think of it as a beautiful blend of Fallout's post-apocalyptic/alien story, Quake's FPS fun, and Diablo's loot, level and mission system.The story is long enough to be fun to play but not feel never-ending. It is nice, interesting and quite funny.The side missions can be a bit annoying, since they are focused mostly on harvesting items or kills around huge maps.The maps can be gigantic if you don't have a car. And trust me, you will lose the car eventually. Somehow, it manages to explode after running over enough enemies.It is, however, 100 times better than RAGE. And trust me, I am huge id Software fan. But that game is very badly made. It felt like a product that was released at the deadline rather than 100% completion and testing. Borderlands doesn't, even though there are a few bugs here and there, especially with places you can get stuck in or invisible mini-walls you can crash into.Very funny to play multiplayer, but be sure to turn off the voice streaming if you'll be using Skype (or similar), for it is automatically turned on and you'll be as mad as a cow before you realise where the extra voice is coming from.Make sure to test all classes for 10 levels so you know which one feels best for you as well as whose unique superpower you like best.9/10 - definitely would reccommend.

												Highly Recommended! This is one Badass-Maniac of a game, with an ironic twinkle in the eye. Everything cool about shooters, Fantasy and RPG, brought to the edge and then given a kick. I quickly lost tack counting all the puns, references and inside-jokes.  Besides fast-packed action, development tree, insanely huge arsenal (about every gun you ancounter has different properties) and a twisted storyline with characters tending to cling to the verge of insanity (mostly from the wrong side), this game also includes a complete Nerd-o-Game cultural reference chart."" You scared?? - You should be!!""			"

												Borderlands is a fantastic game. Whether you play alone or with three of your buddies, youre definately going to add on hours fast. The story is that youre basically looking for a vault filled with treasure from a long told legend, ""The Legend of The Vault."" You can choose to play as one of four characters, all with unique traits and special abilities. The gameplay is very solid and super fun. You begin at level one and progress earning experience points by killing things, completing quests, and finishing challenges. One more thing, LOOT!! Loot plays a huge role in this game. There are rarity levels(White - Green - Blue - Purple - Orange) of loot and many types of equipment ranging from shields and grenades to rifles and rocket launchers. The game also generates thousands of weapons at all rarity types so the probability of finding the same weapon is near to impossible.8.8 out of 10			"

												While this version of the game is nothing but a shoddy console port gimpled with the obsolete service that is Gamespy, this game still has its merits as a dignified multiplayer co-op experience.  Good for multiple playthroughs, enriched with rather-decent DLC, this game may disapoint PC users for its lack of an FOV slider and it's non-mouse friendly User Interface, but it can still please anyone.

												This is a fantastic blend of questing, outfitting, and shooting that will keep you entertained for the hours where you're actually doing something. Between missions, the land is dull and uncaptivating, the story is mediocre, and the sounds are monotonously mind-numbing. During missions, enemies of varying styles and levels, procedurally generated weapons, and an intriguing art style makes for a pretty good game.Pros:Had this game on xbox360, beat it with brother.

 Does it have a premise? As the Vault Hunters, you (and your friends) are looking for The Vault, a place that opens every 200 years, which, according to rumours, houses treasures not of this world. While it is a Pandoran legend, that's not going to stop you. How does it play? Borderlands is an open-world looter shooter with RPG elements. The enemies are usually bullet sponges, and while I'm of the philosophy that bullets shouldn't respect how far in the game you are, it's unavoidable. Weapons and other items are color-coded by rarity, and generally, by their overall quality. It goes as follows: White >> Green >> Blue >> Purple >> Orange, white being the most common, orange being the rarest. On another note entirely, vehicles drive like total♥♥♥♥♥ Fin.You can choose one of four characters, each boasting a unique set of skills and a specific role in a well-balanced team. Roland - the Soldier has a sentry turret which he can deploy, which, with some upgrades allows it to heal and replenish ammunition of teammates, filling a defensive and supportive role. The character is suited to shotguns and combat rifles.Lilith - the Siren can phase out of reality as we perceive it, turning invisible to enemies and moving far faster than normal. With this, Lilith's elemental proficiency and her damage and crit skills in mind, the class is well-suited for a hit and run DPS role. The character is suited to SMGs and repeater pistols, preferably with the capability for elemental damage.Mordecai - the Hunter can use his pet, Bloodwing to swoop in and attack enemies, dealing massive damage and negating cover. With his skills geared towards sniping and long-range combat, he fills in the much needed long-range role. The character is suited to revolvers and sniper rifles.Brick - the Beserker can do just that, berserk his enemies, beating them into piles of bloody goop with his fists. His skills are geared towards tanking damage, kicking♥♥♥♥♥and taking names. The character is suited to explosives and melee combat. Does it have music? The music is there, however, it's woefully average. There are a handful of memorable pieces, but it's mostly ambience and generic combat music. How is the port? This is a new addition to my typical reviews, but I've ought to mention this, the game is locked at a 55 degree field of view, which can understandably be troublesome for a lot of players. This can be remedied with some .ini tweaking which I won't go into detail with in this review, but that doesn't smoothly fix the issue. The game's determined to have the FOV at 55. However, the performance is solid, which is a given since the game is approaching eight years of age. Who should buy this? If you enjoy RPGs, open worlds, shooting or looting, then this game is for you. While its sequel, Borderlands 2, overshadows it in every regard, I can't help but carry a certain degree of nostalgia towards the original. I have to say, that in my opinion, this is one of the finest looter shooters around, which isn't surprising when you consider that the market isn't crowded.			"

												This is a fast paced, over the top shooter. You choose from one of four classes: Soldier, Beserker, Siren and Hunter. They all have unique skill trees and special skills. You then go on a quest to find the Vault, an ancient cave that only opens once a millenium. You are guided by a vision and along the way you meet crazy characters, mostly people who want to kill you. You will go against different bosses and mini bosses which keeps the game fresh. The gameplay is mostly first person shooting with a side element of exploring. The main selling point of this game is the amount of guns there are. How many you ask? Well, I roughly worked it out to be within 5000 and 20,000 guns. The graphics are very good and have a cartoonish look about them but you will need a decent graphics card to run the game. There is multiplayer which let's you and up to 3 other players share in the experience which adds to the replay factor. The only down side to it is the ending (no spoilers other than it sucks) 9/10			"

It's a lovely RPG\FPS that takes place in Pandora, a very interesting and stylized world.the characters are interesting and the quests and maps are memorable. It's a good experience to have and it's even better with 3 other friends in co-op multiplayer.What makes it unique it's the guns system. There are millions and millions of guns and it's very unlikely to find the same gun twice... ever. They are all randomized and quite unique.That being said the game relies a bit too much on bullet sponges, that makes the experience a bit boring and frustrating every now and then.But even with that I still recommend this game. It's stylized, it's fun and it's AWESOME.Go shoot some bandits!			"

												Borderlands was a good game for its time. It was unique, it introduced great characters, a new genre and a new franchise. But playing it in 2017 definitely shows its flaws.First negative was FOV. The game is just way too zoomed in and you have a very narrow viewing angle, but this can be very easily fixed with any of the guides on Steam (make sure to do that before playing). The inventory system was absolutely horrendous. Comparing and selling items could have been done so much better. I also did not like the way enemies received damage. For example if I am shooting at somebody in the distance, I would only know that I hit them if their health bar dropped, there was no other visual que to show that I hit them which was frustrating at times. Also the game still to this day has some bugs and glitches.But overall the game was good introduction to the series. For anyone that played Borderlands 2 first, this game is a nice addition to the story. Or for anyone that is interested in the franchise, it a good place to start.			"

												Borderlands is a FPS RPG with Diablo-esque twist to it. Though it may not have been the very first to start the genre, it definitely gave the genre the boost into mainstream spotlight that really put it into the light.I've held off writing a review until I completed the game, which I had no incentive to since I wanted to play this game with my friends when it initially came out and just recently got to playing with them again. Gameplay wise, it's to be expected that it's much less detailed and fun than Borderlands 2, but it's to be expected as the streamliner for the series. You play as one of 4 different characters with different ability sets and unique abilities, pushing for your character to play in a certain style but not forcing it onto you. It's an FPS, but you also get scrolling combat dmg and experience to level as well as a loot grade system much like Diablo. As to be expected of one of the very first in the genre and as a game from 2009, it's got much to polish up on, but if you like to see the roots of the genre and still have fun, I'd definitely try it.Pros:+ Lots of guns and different uses for them, electric guns are much more effective against shields, corrosive is effective against armor, etc.+ Get to shoot disabled midgets and crazy giants in the face with rocket launchers+ FPS RPGCons:- Quest doesn't allow you to see multiple objectives at a time, forcing you to backtrack in some cases- Unclear with Fast Travel locations- Eventually becomes very tedious- Needs polishing up on a lot of things in the game- Clap-TrapTL;DR:Borderlands is a FPS RPG with Diablo-esque twist to it. One of the first in the genre, has a dire need of polishing up which Borderlands 2 takes care of, but it's still a great game.			"

												tl;dr down thereHey, It feels a bit dated now, but so does Bioshock now and they're both great games. But don't let great sequels overshadow some awesome games. All the stuff you love from BL2 came from somewhere but for those don't know, ONWARD TO VICTORY! So, the game's a shooter with a bunch of RPG elements and an addictive loot system. See, each gun has about 5 different RNG'd peices, each with the chance to have different quality materials. I'm no math major, but the result is you'll probably never see the same gun twice. So, that sniper you tear through the enemy and loved for the last 5 levels? Sorry but you just found an UPGRADE and you love it so much MORE AHAHAHHHAHAHAH.... Oh yeah, classes. So you've got four distinct classes, each who kick♥♥♥♥♥in their own badass way and each one has three skill trees with awesome perks to help you dominate the beasts, bandits, and aliens that want to eat/shoot and eat/what do aliens do to people? you to death. And hey, if all of that isn't enough for you, YOU CAN DO IT ALL WITH FRIENDS! [laughing like Brick] (and just realized I can keep typing too) Multiplayer is a must for this game. Period. Pandora feels a bit lonely at times, since most of the people you meet are crazy and trying to murder your face, and friends are always good, so PLAY WITH FRIENDS! CAPITALS!! And each of the DLC are pretty good, but if you're gonna get one, it has to be Knoxx. Also, the four classes add replay value too.Game's not perfect though: Time for me to calm down. So, game is a bit old, and it kinda shows too. Overall, the story is non-existent (basically), but other stuffLOOT outweighs itLOOTLOOTLOOT. Can get lonely at times, helped with multiplayer.tl;dr- Good game, feels a bit dated and can get lonely soloplay. Cool stuff? LOOT, classes and powers, awesome multiplayer (get 3 friends and have a ball), general badassery. DLC? All are good and worth the price, but get Knoxx at minimum, it's great.Edit: YO, it didn't take me long to realize that this game isn't pure gold (they lied and I fell for it). Looking at this, I know I'm biased. So look up there ^ and click on the ""Negative Reviews Only"". Dem fools who didn't like the game still have souls, AND VALID POINTS. Check 'em out. I still love this game tho. Oh, and check out SHSD's review. Short, concise, to the point.			"

												Best played in co-op with a friend or three, but probably fun alone. It's a FPS that plays like an RPG. Or is it the other way around? Get loot, build your character up, and enjoy the cell-shaded art style. Every major DLC release is worth getting (do yourself a favor and get the GOTY edition). The cost-to-fun ratio makes this buy a no-brainer, as you'll spend countless hours playing this - with DLC, you're looking at 50+ hours per playthrough, and trust me, you'll likely be playing through again to level further. Yes, there are moments of tedious grinding, but all-in-all, you can't go wrong with this game.10/10			"

												Retrospect is a strange thing, especially considering the sequel and the mess that is the pre-sequel. Borderlands is a game that built its atmosphere above its story, along with its main premise of randomly generated guns. Guns were reused and mostly reskinned, fine enough, but at least guns didn't noticeably clip through each other (like the sequel with hyperion's guns, that shiz was ridiculous).Storyline is fairly minimal, it may not be as engaging as the sequel due to characters' conversations be mostly text, but this game is pretty decent, it's not great, it's grindy at times, and padded in the DLC, but it's fun.The two reasons that I would say the original did better than its sequel #1. it has brick, #2. It has more guns.what madness is this?! how could an inferior prequel have more guns than its sequels?! Let's deconstruct the gun counts based on brand per game based off the types of guns **not** made by certain brands.:**''Borderlands''**Jakobs - SMG, Pistols, Rocket Launcher, Assault RifleDahl - NoneHyperion - Revolver(?)Torgue -  Revolver(?)Tediore - NoneMaliwan - Assault Rifle(?)Vladof -  Revolver, SMG(?)S&S - Revolver, Rocket Launcher(?)Atlas - None (not completely sure)**''Borderlands  2''**Bandit- Sniper Rifle, revolverJakobs - Rocket LauncherDahl - Rocket Launcher, ShotgunHyperion - Assault Rifle, Rocket LauncherTorgue - Sniper RIfle,SMGTediore - Sniper RIfleMaliwan - Shotgun, Assault RifleVladof -  Shotgun, SMGthe gun type difference may be 2 to the estimated 13 of the sequel compared to the original's 11,  sounds small? well when you take the context of ""gorillions of guns"" and then note that burst fire, corkscrew shot, split shot, and gyrojets were not brand-limited features in classic borderlands, well little things add up fast. Less is more? hardly.if you want mindless shooty fun, go for borderlands!			"

												Borderlands can be played alone or as a co-op game with up to 4 people.One of the main parts of the game is grinding levels and collecting better loot. weapons with better stats and so on in order to defeat enemies in the later game that are pretty much the same as in the beginning only with a higher ammount of health points and damage output.Basicly it's a fun game if you want to play it with your friends, but I would not recommend it if you are looking into playing it as a singleplayer shooter.In terms of technical aspects:Even low end systems today should be able to handle the game just fine.However it does lack a lot of the PC-Features such as a field of view slider and such. you'll have to download a external fix in order to increase the fov which is pretty narrow by default. Also the sensitivity slider doesn't go very far, so you may have to adjust the dpi of your mouse if you want to use a low sensitivity.So if you care about PC-exclusive features, such as the before mentioned and don't care about the story (which doesn't seem like anything ground breaking to me so far), you may want to skip borderlands 1 entirely and go straight to borderlands 2, which does have such features as a FoV slider.So do I reccomend it?The answer is no, if you are looking for a singleplayer game.And yes if you are looking for a co-op game to play with your friends and can get past its flaws I mentioned earlier.

												The singleplayer of this game is good. You know, it's a first person shooter. Pretty chill, the developers obviously wanted to put the actual fun back in gaming, rather than the typical Call Of The Battlefield Of Honour And Duty franchises which just focus on ""Realism"" (Jumping out a plane, shooting a pilot in another one and landing in it to fly it, yeah okay.) and have focused on a game being FUN, not super cool and slick.The multiplayer of this game... ♥♥♥♥ me, absolutely outstanding. Playing with your friends is hilarious and frustrating at the same time, so much fun. Just grab a few beers, chill, get a bit of Borderlands smashed out, then wifeswap or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you guys do after you've been playing some vidya.Or do what I do and get the missus playing with you.

												Borderlands is FPS/RPG with a unique art style set in a world filled with chaos and danger. You have a choice of 4 classes each with their own ability and weapon specialty. You’re on a mission to find the Vault. What’s inside? Well some believe fame, money, power, or maybe even women. There’s plenty of missions along the way to finding the vault with some funny ester eggs sprinkled though out.I've played and beaten Borderlands on the Xbox 360, but decided to pick it up for PC because the game is that good. Playing the game solo it’s very enjoyable; however, get a few friends to join you and this game become incredibly fun. Ultimately the game comes down to collecting guns to go kill small and large creatures and/or people.  "

Originally posted by The TL,DR Genie:Join the Vault Hunters, visit exotic Pandora, meet strange psychos, then shoot them. Borderlands is one of those rare treats that managed to be wonderfully fun for me, no matter with how many people I was playing with or what we were doing. It's not perfect but it's damn close.Spiderants, Rakks and Skags, oh my!The story of Borderlands is in no way new. There's treasure! Treasure so large and so old that there are stories about it. These stories attract treasure hunters. And then there's the uncountable number of enemies and inhabitants between the treasure hunters and the treasure. Do the treasure hunters give up? Naaah, they use guns. Lots and lots of guns. And one little annoying robot that somehow manages to survive and make it to the sequel. The characters of Borderlands manage to stay fun and interesting and very much unique which is actually surprising considering that at the end of the day they could all be using the exact same type of gun.The main HUD is minimal and even blended in to the start of the story. The other menus aren't that fortunate though and until the user gets used them they will feel very clunky and unintuitive. This is to be expected with console ports but a menu overhaul or revamp would've been hugely appreciated. The feel of the controls is however very reliable and satisfying. Itemization focuses mainly around offense as there are no actual pieces of clothing or armor that can be found and worn. The amount of randomized weapons and the absolutely ridiculous number of enemies are what makes Borderlands feel like a hack-and-slash. The experience gain, skill trees, quest progression, open world and legendary items are what makes it feel like an action-role-playing-game. The fact that all those weapons are guns, that a lot of bosses have guns and that even the vehicles have guns are what make it a first-person-shooter. And all of these elements make it very fun.The graphic style is one my favorites and as such, I can find no fault in it, although others might. The protagonists, the other characters, the world, the weapons are all very well made and blend in. There is no element that actually stands out. The music always fits the setting flawlessly, the sound effects are crystal clear and nothing users wouldn't expect and the voice acting is spot on as well. The protagonists do not really seem to interact that much with each other and that's a shame.For a first-person-shooter all the controls are spot on as well and the integration with the protagonists' unique skills has no drawbacks. The options menus are not at all surprising considering that Borderlands is coming from a console port and the only main issue I found is the lack of an integrated Field of Vision option. There are a lot of Achievements but many of them will be reached by completionists without any issues. The others however, may take a little bit of work, depending on skill and luck.Finally, all I can say is: join the Vault Hunters, visit exotic Pandora, meet strange psychos, then shoot them. Borderlands is one of those rare treats that managed to be wonderfully fun for me, no matter with how many people I was playing with or what we were doing. It's not perfect but it's damn close.			"

												Best played in co-op with a friend or three, but probably fun alone. It's a FPS that plays like an RPG. Or is it the other way around? Get loot, build your character up, and enjoy the cell-shaded art style. Every major DLC release is worth getting (do yourself a favor and get the GOTY edition). The cost-to-fun ratio makes this buy a no-brainer, as you'll spend countless hours playing this - with DLC, you're looking at 50+ hours per playthrough, and trust me, you'll likely be playing through again to level further. Yes, there are moments of tedious grinding, but all-in-all, you can't go wrong with this game.10/10			"

												I actually enjoyed playing this game a lot. I loved jokes, graphics, story, characters, etc. But the only thing that ruined the whole picture is ending. I was very dissapointed in it. The feeling of rush and hurry in the last story mission was such a good thing. When you know that the vault could be in hands of bad dudes and you are trying to be the one who stops them and takes the treasure of the vault. The boss which is looking like he is worth killing for the treasure. And in the end he dies and gives you NOTHING. The vault just closes and you are without treasure. Neither a good weapon is dropped, neither a player is happy.I played the T-Bone Junction DLC after completing the Zombie Island of Dr. Ned which where both very good, but as usual the T-Bone Junction had such a dissapointing ending as I couldn't even imagine.But even though the ending is not that good, the game still became one of my favourite.9/10 Psychoes Totally worth buying.

												Play this with friends, its a fun game, got it on launch day and had a lot of fun with it, at the time it was original. if you are a newcomer to borderlands this is a good place to start, however playing it solo is boring.with mates the challenge and the fun factor ramp upthe DLCs are fun to play through too, The armoury of general Knoxx has a tonne of extra content. Mad Moxxis underdome was a bit of a let down tbh.so if you havent played borderlands 2 or the pre sequel yet, play this, play it with mates and you will enjoy			"

												Borderlands is FPS/RPG with a unique art style set in a world filled with chaos and danger. You have a choice of 4 classes each with their own ability and weapon specialty. You’re on a mission to find the Vault. What’s inside? Well some believe fame, money, power, or maybe even women. There’s plenty of missions along the way to finding the vault with some funny ester eggs sprinkled though out.I've played and beaten Borderlands on the Xbox 360, but decided to pick it up for PC because the game is that good. Playing the game solo it’s very enjoyable; however, get a few friends to join you and this game become incredibly fun. Ultimately the game comes down to collecting guns to go kill small and large creatures and/or people.  "

												This game is very addictive. I've spent more time playing this on xbox360 and PC then more then any other game. The story is funny. Characters are great, well planned, over all 10/10 in my book. Almost a uncountable amount of guns, shields, relics, ect. You are able to playing this game so many times over, because playing with a new character will change they way you play. The game is full of hidden chests and Eggs, that will surely make you go nuts finding.PROS:-Fun-Story Full-Guns, Guns, and more Guns-Bosses-easy modding-side quests, lots of them-Fun enemiesCONS:-Quite a long time to completely for newbies-LTP is a little weird "

												Even when being almost 8 years old this game is plenty of fun and got almost no problems at all. I have played over 40 200 hours as of this writing and not done with my first second playthrough character yet so there is plenty of content and you can even play it with your friends and the game will adjust the difficulty when it detects more players. A solid buy if you are thinking of starting the Borderlands series, I will definitely play Borderlands 2 after I'm done with this.			"

												Best Borderlands game so far, I own this game for both the Xbox 360 and PC (most time spent on the Xbox tough). Unlike Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel, this Borderlands offers proper ""modding"" support. Variating from 3PDLC maps, guns, items to whatever.I myself am one of the ""modders"" <-(hate that word); let's just say ""creative individuals"" that do their best to keep this game going for years to come.http://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/tdw-custom-weapons-items-latest-revisions-30-06-2015/10007 "

												If you've been living under a rock, you'd not hear of Borderlands. A four-player co-operative game that has since received four expansions and turns into one of the most enjoyable friend-oriented games released in the past few years.The open environment in combination with random diablo-esqe drops provides for repeating runs and with the release of the expansions that really double the size of the campaign to include the likes of General Knoxx and Claptrap's Robot Revenge, and you've got a fairly long campaign that will keep you busy.There are minor problems with the PC build in that Gamespy is a terrible provider, LAN and Hamachi would most definitely prove to work better than Gamespy itself, but once you manage to get people together it's an absolute blast to chip away at Pandora.

												The singleplayer of this game is good. You know, it's a first person shooter. Pretty chill, the developers obviously wanted to put the actual fun back in gaming, rather than the typical Call Of The Battlefield Of Honour And Duty franchises which just focus on ""Realism"" (Jumping out a plane, shooting a pilot in another one and landing in it to fly it, yeah okay.) and have focused on a game being FUN, not super cool and slick.The multiplayer of this game... ♥♥♥♥ me, absolutely outstanding. Playing with your friends is hilarious and frustrating at the same time, so much fun. Just grab a few beers, chill, get a bit of Borderlands smashed out, then wifeswap or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you guys do after you've been playing some vidya.Or do what I do and get the missus playing with you.

												Borderlands can be played alone or as a co-op game with up to 4 people.One of the main parts of the game is grinding levels and collecting better loot. weapons with better stats and so on in order to defeat enemies in the later game that are pretty much the same as in the beginning only with a higher ammount of health points and damage output.Basicly it's a fun game if you want to play it with your friends, but I would not recommend it if you are looking into playing it as a singleplayer shooter.In terms of technical aspects:Even low end systems today should be able to handle the game just fine.However it does lack a lot of the PC-Features such as a field of view slider and such. you'll have to download a external fix in order to increase the fov which is pretty narrow by default. Also the sensitivity slider doesn't go very far, so you may have to adjust the dpi of your mouse if you want to use a low sensitivity.So if you care about PC-exclusive features, such as the before mentioned and don't care about the story (which doesn't seem like anything ground breaking to me so far), you may want to skip borderlands 1 entirely and go straight to borderlands 2, which does have such features as a FoV slider.So do I reccomend it?The answer is no, if you are looking for a singleplayer game.And yes if you are looking for a co-op game to play with your friends and can get past its flaws I mentioned earlier.

												I actually enjoyed playing this game a lot. I loved jokes, graphics, story, characters, etc. But the only thing that ruined the whole picture is ending. I was very dissapointed in it. The feeling of rush and hurry in the last story mission was such a good thing. When you know that the vault could be in hands of bad dudes and you are trying to be the one who stops them and takes the treasure of the vault. The boss which is looking like he is worth killing for the treasure. And in the end he dies and gives you NOTHING. The vault just closes and you are without treasure. Neither a good weapon is dropped, neither a player is happy.I played the T-Bone Junction DLC after completing the Zombie Island of Dr. Ned which where both very good, but as usual the T-Bone Junction had such a dissapointing ending as I couldn't even imagine.But even though the ending is not that good, the game still became one of my favourite.9/10 Psychoes Totally worth buying.

												Yeah nah. I had high hopes for this game. The 'shoot at the enemy until it dies' philosophy is more prevalent here than most any other game I've seen.It's the perfect storm of: No real need to seek cover, all enemies are bullet sponges, most abilities amount to ""+% extra damage or accuracy or health or willy size"", all the weapons are pretty generic and boring (despite being randomly generated), no real character customization (in terms of appearance or ability (builds usually amount to 'punching guy' or 'shooting guy')), boring and repititive locations, bland narrative, annoying attempts at humor.The graphics style is kind of cool, and the idea of putting in a diablo-esque loot system into a FPS is also kind of cool (even if it doesn't work too well). But not even co-op could make this game interesting.Bland bland bland. Just bland. Bland as ♥♥♥♥.			"

												I'd like to preface this review by reccomending the Borderlands Advanced Configuration Tool, this allows you to tweak the settings to make the game look even better than it does, as well as allowing for FOV tweaks, command console, etc.This is the game that started it all, something about all the loot you can pick up just tantalized an entire group of gamers who felt like Pandora was a second home. This game isn't as story rich as Borderlands 2, and is a little rough around the edges in some spots, but it is still such a great game that everyone needs to play.The little bit of story there is is that Pandora is home to the Atlas corporation, who make the crap planet even crappier, and there are legends of ""Vaults"" around the planet, and this draws in Vault Hunters looking for them. You essentially compete with the corporations to open the Vault, you get all the pieces of the key and open it, that's as spoiler free as I can make it. This game's claim to fame was the absolutely obscene amount of guns it has, I've heard this game talked about as more of a experiment to put this many guns into a functioning game, and as such is why the story is as lightweight as it is, and Borderlands 2 was a more proper game utilizing the technology. You have a choice of 4 heros, a Berserker, a Siren, a Soldier, and the Hunter, each of these classes have their own traits that make them unique, but no class is restrained to a certain weapon type.When I said the game can be rough around the edges, I mean that in that there are some bits of the game that are poorly executed and pretty frustrating, they are mainly little things, like the lack of checkpoints in some areas, forcing you to run back through the empty area to get back to the boss, and the game forcing you to kill bunches of enemies before you can pass through an obstacle you could have passed through easily. One last annoying bit is how Claptrap seems to infinitely remind you that there are new jobs available on x Bounty Board.One of this games strongsuits is the humor, most every character has some sort of thing about them that makes them unique and funny. My personal favorite is Scooter the car guy.All in all, out of the 3 main series Borderlands games, this is the second best. Better than the dumpster fire that is the Pre Sequel, but not as good as the masterpiece that is Borderlands 2, overall I give it a 9/10, do yourself a favor and play it now.			"

												The shoot-n-loot that started it all. This one's grounded in realism and/or Mad Max a little more solidly than its successors, but still one hell of a good time. For the best experience, play through with three friends, one of each class. Not as much can be said for the longevity of this game, which is why the other three (and soon four) exist. But it's one hell of a ride. Think of this one as the training and setup for the next two, then once you get there, throw it all out the window and wing the hell out of it. No matter how you do it, it's a good time.			"

												Nearly 48 hours in, only done with the main game and 2 of the DLC's.If you like run n' gun shooting, or old style no press x to get into cover shooting then this game is for you. Its fun and can be funny at points.My only complaints is late game on your first playthorugh, there will be near zero good guns, but that's because you already have pretty much the best stuff for your first time through. Also, there only one fast travel points for DLC's which really makes the DLC's only good and not really good.8.5/10 - Would shoot everything again.			"

												Where do I start, the game keeps you interested, even after many hours of gameplay. Sure it is repetitive, but with how this feature is woven into the gameplay, you never notice it. That game is mind-blowingly madness and great with a friend, playing co-op, and is definatively worth $30 for the GOTY edition. I highly recommend it.			"

Only problem with this was the at the end in my opinion the story fell flat and I guess you end up playing Borderlands 2 to see if that continues this. *I did not by any of the DLC for this maybe that has some to add to main story idk*			"

So big, so angry, so dead.― Mordecai; and probably the best way to describe this game ;)What is the strangest thing - when I first played non-Steam Borderlands, it didn't make big impression on me. I fell in love in this world until the sequel...After 82h (Mordecai GOTY + Mordecai TVHM basic [Playthrough 2 here] + Roland/Lilith some mullti):PROS+ world's crazy vision+ character classes+ amazing crazy NPC's+ specific graphics and effects+ Second Wind+ music+ CL4P-TP <3CONS- sometimes very unbalanced- sometimes very weak loot in relation to opponent's weight- omg wtf the weakest after final boss o0- sometimes too fast mobs respawn, especially in large and extensive maps- sometimes problems with money- Bloodwing's AISubjective rate: A-/B+ (still I can't decide :P but Hey, check me out everybody, I'm dancin', I'm dancin! <3 <3)			"

												No memes or childish jokes, humor is unobtrusive and is not annoying after playing many times, characters actually feel cool and dont try to shove their originality up your throat. Some levels can be monotonous with desert and badlands and rust and trash coast but i view it as non-intrusive and chill. There is no need to farm bosses for hours because good equipment can be bought in shops if you have enough money. Playing revolver mordecai and trying to go only for headshots, while moving yourself, is very good aiming practice. Unfortunately to get crisp gameplay a person must use external sites and dig in the config files to remove smooth framerate, mouse smoothing, oneFrameThreadLag and set their sensitivity/Fov bind (Borderlands2 fixed SOME of those but i wasnt able to change configs in bl2 to fix the rest)			"

												It's fun whether playing solo or going as a group. I like the whole power building aspects of it. I had two playthroughs. One as Mordicai (the sniper) and one as Lillith (the siren). it's a lot easier and more entertaining to be Lillith. Sniping is alright, but when you get stuck in enclosed areas you can't do so well. Plus in co-op your bullets get blocked by your friends (who are always between you and the enemy) so sniping isn't all it's cracked up to be.Siren rocks. You can use any weapon with total efficiency making her awesome in any situation. Plus she has the power to poof invisable and be super fast so she can run away if she gets overwhelmed by enemies. Just run away/behind cover, heal, return. She's OP, but fun.			"

												A Review Mostly for me so I know I’ve completed the story, as well as feedback on the game. My Thoughts:-  GUNS! GUNS! GUNS! Loads of em good game for a FPS RPG type game, up to 4 player co-op.Achievements:- 80 of 80 (100%) Achievements EarnedGraphics:- Bit cartoonish but alright you can see the console graphics in this game tho.Story:- you’re on a bus after a vault and are contacted by Angel that helps you find and open the vault but the treasure in the vault aint what the vault hunters expect.Replayability:- with 4 characters and 2 play troughs for each can be quite repayable. What Could Be Added: better Pc graphic optionsRating:- 8 / 10 "

												Absolutely incredible game. Love it. Easy controls, great gameplay, graphically superb. The game content itself will keep you glued for hours, it's not another '20hrs and finish' generic FPS. Artistically very akin to Tank Girl, and very clever with it's pop culture references/easter eggs. The boss 'Mad Mel' for example. I actually prefer to this Borderlands 2; the humour in this game is a bit more subtle and not just juvenile fart jokes made for dumb American stoner kids. There are some, I'm not saying there aren't, but this game tones it down a little and makes for a better experience imo.			"

												As with all FPS, I'm in favor of being able to adjust the control scheme to a universal system; Borderlands allowed me to do just that. Good keymapping options. Granted, it's not Skyrim. Gee, what a surprise. So invisible walls and shooting chumps who wander past an invisible fence are common. That and impassable mountains. No seamless transitions between zones but I guess it hearkens back to the arcadey style of old school insert-quarter-for-continue.Which brings me to the art. It's a lovely combination - smooth graphics with a cartoony bent, adding to the bizarre, the strange, the zaniness that is the story and its characters. And the opening music? Brilliant. It all sums up to: ""When there's no good people, what can you do but chuckle ruefully at yourself and it all and do the best you can?""			"

												tl;dr down thereHey, It feels a bit dated now, but so does Bioshock now and they're both great games. But don't let great sequels overshadow some awesome games. All the stuff you love from BL2 came from somewhere but for those don't know, ONWARD TO VICTORY! So, the game's a shooter with a bunch of RPG elements and an addictive loot system. See, each gun has about 5 different RNG'd peices, each with the chance to have different quality materials. I'm no math major, but the result is you'll probably never see the same gun twice. So, that sniper you tear through the enemy and loved for the last 5 levels? Sorry but you just found an UPGRADE and you love it so much MORE AHAHAHHHAHAHAH.... Oh yeah, classes. So you've got four distinct classes, each who kick♥♥♥♥♥in their own badass way and each one has three skill trees with awesome perks to help you dominate the beasts, bandits, and aliens that want to eat/shoot and eat/what do aliens do to people? you to death. And hey, if all of that isn't enough for you, YOU CAN DO IT ALL WITH FRIENDS! [laughing like Brick] (and just realized I can keep typing too) Multiplayer is a must for this game. Period. Pandora feels a bit lonely at times, since most of the people you meet are crazy and trying to murder your face, and friends are always good, so PLAY WITH FRIENDS! CAPITALS!! And each of the DLC are pretty good, but if you're gonna get one, it has to be Knoxx. Also, the four classes add replay value too.Game's not perfect though: Time for me to calm down. So, game is a bit old, and it kinda shows too. Overall, the story is non-existent (basically), but other stuffLOOT outweighs itLOOTLOOTLOOT. Can get lonely at times, helped with multiplayer.tl;dr- Good game, feels a bit dated and can get lonely soloplay. Cool stuff? LOOT, classes and powers, awesome multiplayer (get 3 friends and have a ball), general badassery. DLC? All are good and worth the price, but get Knoxx at minimum, it's great.Edit: YO, it didn't take me long to realize that this game isn't pure gold (they lied and I fell for it). Looking at this, I know I'm biased. So look up there ^ and click on the ""Negative Reviews Only"". Dem fools who didn't like the game still have souls, AND VALID POINTS. Check 'em out. I still love this game tho. Oh, and check out SHSD's review. Short, concise, to the point.			"

												Absolutely incredible game. Love it. Easy controls, great gameplay, graphically superb. The game content itself will keep you glued for hours, it's not another '20hrs and finish' generic FPS. Artistically very akin to Tank Girl, and very clever with it's pop culture references/easter eggs. The boss 'Mad Mel' for example. I actually prefer to this Borderlands 2; the humour in this game is a bit more subtle and not just juvenile fart jokes made for dumb American stoner kids. There are some, I'm not saying there aren't, but this game tones it down a little and makes for a better experience imo.			"

												As with all FPS, I'm in favor of being able to adjust the control scheme to a universal system; Borderlands allowed me to do just that. Good keymapping options. Granted, it's not Skyrim. Gee, what a surprise. So invisible walls and shooting chumps who wander past an invisible fence are common. That and impassable mountains. No seamless transitions between zones but I guess it hearkens back to the arcadey style of old school insert-quarter-for-continue.Which brings me to the art. It's a lovely combination - smooth graphics with a cartoony bent, adding to the bizarre, the strange, the zaniness that is the story and its characters. And the opening music? Brilliant. It all sums up to: ""When there's no good people, what can you do but chuckle ruefully at yourself and it all and do the best you can?""			"

												My thoughs about Borderlands 1:- If you like FPS and Diablo, this is perfect game for you- If you need good story, buy Borderlands 2, cuz the story in Borderlands 1 is not very well builded- After playing Borderlands 2, you propably can have feelings that B1 is Alpha version of Borderlands 2- Graphics: Fine- Music/Sound: Very Good- Gameplay: Good- Great for Co-op (max.4)- PvP only 1vs1 and 2vs2(?)- Ending is really bad in my opinion- Don't buy Moxxi Arena DLC is just boobie trap!!!It's still worth to buy and play.

												It's fun whether playing solo or going as a group. I like the whole power building aspects of it. I had two playthroughs. One as Mordicai (the sniper) and one as Lillith (the siren). it's a lot easier and more entertaining to be Lillith. Sniping is alright, but when you get stuck in enclosed areas you can't do so well. Plus in co-op your bullets get blocked by your friends (who are always between you and the enemy) so sniping isn't all it's cracked up to be.Siren rocks. You can use any weapon with total efficiency making her awesome in any situation. Plus she has the power to poof invisable and be super fast so she can run away if she gets overwhelmed by enemies. Just run away/behind cover, heal, return. She's OP, but fun.			"

So big, so angry, so dead.― Mordecai; and probably the best way to describe this game ;)What is the strangest thing - when I first played non-Steam Borderlands, it didn't make big impression on me. I fell in love in this world until the sequel...After 82h (Mordecai GOTY + Mordecai TVHM basic [Playthrough 2 here] + Roland/Lilith some mullti):PROS+ world's crazy vision+ character classes+ amazing crazy NPC's+ specific graphics and effects+ Second Wind+ music+ CL4P-TP <3CONS- sometimes very unbalanced- sometimes very weak loot in relation to opponent's weight- omg wtf the weakest after final boss o0- sometimes too fast mobs respawn, especially in large and extensive maps- sometimes problems with money- Bloodwing's AISubjective rate: A-/B+ (still I can't decide :P but Hey, check me out everybody, I'm dancin', I'm dancin! <3 <3)			"

												No memes or childish jokes, humor is unobtrusive and is not annoying after playing many times, characters actually feel cool and dont try to shove their originality up your throat. Some levels can be monotonous with desert and badlands and rust and trash coast but i view it as non-intrusive and chill. There is no need to farm bosses for hours because good equipment can be bought in shops if you have enough money. Playing revolver mordecai and trying to go only for headshots, while moving yourself, is very good aiming practice. Unfortunately to get crisp gameplay a person must use external sites and dig in the config files to remove smooth framerate, mouse smoothing, oneFrameThreadLag and set their sensitivity/Fov bind (Borderlands2 fixed SOME of those but i wasnt able to change configs in bl2 to fix the rest)			"

 Does it have a premise? As the Vault Hunters, you (and your friends) are looking for The Vault, a place that opens every 200 years, which, according to rumours, houses treasures not of this world. While it is a Pandoran legend, that's not going to stop you. How does it play? Borderlands is an open-world looter shooter with RPG elements. The enemies are usually bullet sponges, and while I'm of the philosophy that bullets shouldn't respect how far in the game you are, it's unavoidable. Weapons and other items are color-coded by rarity, and generally, by their overall quality. It goes as follows: White >> Green >> Blue >> Purple >> Orange, white being the most common, orange being the rarest. On another note entirely, vehicles drive like total♥♥♥♥♥ Fin.You can choose one of four characters, each boasting a unique set of skills and a specific role in a well-balanced team. Roland - the Soldier has a sentry turret which he can deploy, which, with some upgrades allows it to heal and replenish ammunition of teammates, filling a defensive and supportive role. The character is suited to shotguns and combat rifles.Lilith - the Siren can phase out of reality as we perceive it, turning invisible to enemies and moving far faster than normal. With this, Lilith's elemental proficiency and her damage and crit skills in mind, the class is well-suited for a hit and run DPS role. The character is suited to SMGs and repeater pistols, preferably with the capability for elemental damage.Mordecai - the Hunter can use his pet, Bloodwing to swoop in and attack enemies, dealing massive damage and negating cover. With his skills geared towards sniping and long-range combat, he fills in the much needed long-range role. The character is suited to revolvers and sniper rifles.Brick - the Beserker can do just that, berserk his enemies, beating them into piles of bloody goop with his fists. His skills are geared towards tanking damage, kicking♥♥♥♥♥and taking names. The character is suited to explosives and melee combat. Does it have music? The music is there, however, it's woefully average. There are a handful of memorable pieces, but it's mostly ambience and generic combat music. How is the port? This is a new addition to my typical reviews, but I've ought to mention this, the game is locked at a 55 degree field of view, which can understandably be troublesome for a lot of players. This can be remedied with some .ini tweaking which I won't go into detail with in this review, but that doesn't smoothly fix the issue. The game's determined to have the FOV at 55. However, the performance is solid, which is a given since the game is approaching eight years of age. Who should buy this? If you enjoy RPGs, open worlds, shooting or looting, then this game is for you. While its sequel, Borderlands 2, overshadows it in every regard, I can't help but carry a certain degree of nostalgia towards the original. I have to say, that in my opinion, this is one of the finest looter shooters around, which isn't surprising when you consider that the market isn't crowded.			"

												I have mixed feelings about Borderlands. The game is okay, I'd dare to say fun. However it can be fustratingly hard to play alone, and it's hard to find people who are willing to play through a co-op campaign (everybody plays Borderlands 2 now). My saves were bugged so I've lost around 12hours of progress and I just couldn't make myself to start again. The first few hours are really boring and tedious. I recommend it nevertheless, because If you can find three people to play a co-op it's really fun. I also like the artwork and  humourous style of the game.			"

												Borderlands personally is a fascinating video game introducing a different world than any other game with unique elements. I will just write down the points what makes it so great.- A wonderful, competitive, funny and unique FPS. - Various weapons, shields, elements give diversity to the loadoat. - Every coin counts if you want to have all the great stuff (In Bordelands 2 I just use guns I get from bosses, I rarely purchase weapons or other stuff from vending machines).- The story impacted me more than the sequel.- Coop is always so much fun with friends.-Always an opportunity to find a challenge.Despite my subjectivity, I rate it 10/10 because of its uniqueness and success making a colorful and hilarious shooter.MUST TO GET			"

												If you plan on playing the Borderlands series for the very first time, I definitely suggest starting with the first game. You may think that this is customary, and 'of course i'll start with the first game!"" but i'm warning you that if you start with BL2 and go back to play the first game, you may get bored. The first game is not as story heavy and the characters you meet don't quite feel as important or connected as they do in the second game. But the first is still definitely worth playing and is a good introduction to the world of Pandora!			"

This game is definitely not perfect, but is still very fun and can be highly addicting as well. The game doesn't seem to have aged a bit, and I would recommend this game to almost anybody, as the Borderlands franchise as a whole is phenomenal.			"

												This is a fantastic blend of questing, outfitting, and shooting that will keep you entertained for the hours where you're actually doing something. Between missions, the land is dull and uncaptivating, the story is mediocre, and the sounds are monotonously mind-numbing. During missions, enemies of varying styles and levels, procedurally generated weapons, and an intriguing art style makes for a pretty good game.Pros:Had this game on xbox360, beat it with brother.

												If you haven't played this game yet, do yourself a favour and pick it up. I'm playing this on an i3 with 8 gb of RAM and a GT 330m graphics card. The game runs wonderfully, no lag, no framedrop, no problem.Story is decent.Combat mechanics are interesting and varied. Having a diverse arsenal will help you , but choosing to specialise in 2, maybe 3,weapon classes will also benefit you, due to the fact that the more you use a weapon the more exp you get for it and the stronger it becomes.There are multiple ways to fast travel, one of which comes up after a few missions.My suggestion is wait for a steam sale and pick it up along with the DLC.Bonus: you can play with a friend!!! :D			"

												Before, I made a review about this when I was in the 6th grade. To this day, the game still holds up as one of my favorite to play, after what I would say is a decently long time, since I graduated since then and have played many games with story aspects that would rival this (like skyrim). I'd say however, that if you want to get this dont expect to do multiplayer since it was powered by gamespy at the time, which is now down. I havent bothered to look into a fix for multiplayer since I mostly played offline. All in all the game is a structurally sound masterpiece (comparing to more recent titles) and I would say that the more recent borderlands games have lost the challenge and excitement that the earlier 2 games had, that ESPECIALLY this game had.

When that was ruined(my PS3) I seen it on here so I decided to buy it. Man I forgot what I was missing, i'm glad I bought it again and played it. Anyway, Borderlands is one of those games that are great for passing time or just wanting to kill a lot of things with a variety of weapons. Now I hope to get the other two in the future. It's a great game and I recommend everyone give it a SHOT. Get it? HA!(corny joke). "

												I bought it, because Borderlands 2 is one of the best games I have ever played. This is a good game, but it is lightyears away from the second one. Nevertheless it is worth a try. I like the weapon masteries.			"

												Borderlands personally is a fascinating video game introducing a different world than any other game with unique elements. I will just write down the points what makes it so great.- A wonderful, competitive, funny and unique FPS. - Various weapons, shields, elements give diversity to the loadoat. - Every coin counts if you want to have all the great stuff (In Bordelands 2 I just use guns I get from bosses, I rarely purchase weapons or other stuff from vending machines).- The story impacted me more than the sequel.- Coop is always so much fun with friends.-Always an opportunity to find a challenge.Despite my subjectivity, I rate it 10/10 because of its uniqueness and success making a colorful and hilarious shooter.MUST TO GET			"

												This is a very good classic shooter. It's fun in singleplayer, even funnier in multiplayer. You will encounter a bazillion of guns, lots of cheesy jokes and enough enemies to kill to make it fun.Let's maybe take a look at DLCs available:- The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned - nice plot and overall esthetics, but has a lot of backtracking and may be boring after a while- Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot - if you play singleplayer - forget about it. If you plat multi - go for it, it's fun- The Secret Armory of General Knoxx - quite big DLC where you'll travel by car a lot. I think that this is the most boring DLC of all, because you basically go here and there riding quite slow vehicle with little exploration of stages in which you walk by feet- Claptrap's Robot Revolution - not that big DLC where you need to uncover why Claptrap Robots revolved. Quite short and funOverall this game is a really classic game that started all of the Borderlands franchise. It's really fun if you like cartoony shooters with randomly generated weapons. Just beware that it doesn't have any meaningful plot - there is some really basic storyline about trying to uncover some alien vault but this is only a background for shooting all of the bad guys and aliens.

												Open World RPG slash FPS is a good summary for Borderlands but the game is so much more then that. You are a Vault Hunter on the barren wastelands of planet Pandora. Do a few good deeds, kill the occasional Skag and many Thugs encountered along the way in your pursuit of some mythical treasure called The Vault.Common with roguelikes and dungeon crawlers is Borderlands progressive and randomized loot system in which defeated enemies will drop newer weaponry and equipment. With 4 different character classes each with a unique special ability and 3 seperate skill trees provides gives a flexible gameplay system with lots of replay value for different character builds.I'm not a big First Person Shooter fan but I definitely recommend Borderlands.

												I have mixed feelings about Borderlands. The game is okay, I'd dare to say fun. However it can be fustratingly hard to play alone, and it's hard to find people who are willing to play through a co-op campaign (everybody plays Borderlands 2 now). My saves were bugged so I've lost around 12hours of progress and I just couldn't make myself to start again. The first few hours are really boring and tedious. I recommend it nevertheless, because If you can find three people to play a co-op it's really fun. I also like the artwork and  humourous style of the game.			"

												This is in my opinion the best FPS/RPG game, that I have ever tried. I bought a 4-pack with some friends when it first came out, and played through ""Playthrough  1"", and reached the max level. Together with 2 friends, we had a lot of fun during this game, and we have even recorded some good moments.Each class has it's own specific skills and personality, which is also a part of the great gameplay.From Brick, who can storm the front with bare hands or a heavy gun, to Mordecai, who can stand back, snipe the enemies from a safe distance and send Bloodwing to fight.Besides the normal gameplay, this game has got a few DLCs, which are mostly great aswell.I like the whole graphic part cel shading, which also brings a different style to the game, and makes this game special. I will highly recommend buying this great game. It is a great game, especially if you have some friends, who are all ready for a great FPS/RPG co-op experience.  "

												First of all, I played this game to find out the backstory of Borderlands 2. (Which is 10x better than this game)I rate this game a  6/10I was not 100% satisfied with the game... Espically the ending.But.. The game has its pros and cons.Pros:  -Great DLC          -Great co-op         -Good Weapons, Characters and Bosses,          -The loot that you get after battle         -The Skill PointsCons: -Same map style throughout the whole game          -WAY too repetitive, it's the same quests over and over and over.           - Same enemies throughout the whole game (not dlc)           -Quest variety           - lack of customization           -bores you           - and the worst of all... THE ENDING. I can't spoil anything but all I can say is that it gets better in BL2.Overall it is a fair game.			"

												      I first played Gearbox's Borderlands on an Xbox 360 with my older brother. I was somewhat young, and much of the game's finer details escaped me, especially the humor. Now that I can comprehend  the game, I've decided to leave a review.      Borderlands is the first entry in an FPS series by Gearbox Software. It's pretty typical as far as gameplay mechanics, but it mixes in some RPG-style elements and is a really hilarious experience.      Let's talk gameplay mechanics first. The game is full of guns. Gearbox marketed the game as having ""bazillions"" of guns. While that's not even a real figure, there are still a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of weapons to use. Something around a few billion, in fact. The system works by generating guns in parts. A sniper rifle, for example, might have different parts for the stock, scope, handle, barrel, and body. Each in-game manufacturer probably has a few dozen parts for each component of each gun. So, with all of the game's different gun classes (pistol, SMG, sniper, rocket launcher, assault rifle, and Eridian), manufacturers, and parts per manufacturer, you have a pretty ridiculous amount of guns.      The second gameplay mechanic I'll talk about is the vehicles. The first Borderlands is a bit more limited on stock vehicles than later entries, only allowing two variations of the basic ""Runner"" vehicle, the variations being machine-gun or rocket turrets. You can spawn them out of thin air at stations throughout the game world.      Third are the characters. There are four characters to choose from: Roland, the soldier, Brick, the berserker, Lilith, the Siren, and Mordecai, the Hunter.Each character has a different skill tree and certain weapon proficiencies.      Fourth is the leveling. As you kill enemies and complete missions, your character will gain levels, up to level 61 with all the necessary DLC. When you hit level 5, you get to unlock your action skill, which is a character-based usable skill that can turn the tides of battle. Roland can deploy his Scorpio Turret, a sentry turret that has shields and can even heal players within its radius. Lilith can phasewalk, which allows her to move quickly without taking damage and get close to enemies to release an explosion at the end of the skill's duration or to move somewhere with better cover, for example. Brick goes berserk, where he trades his guns for his fists. Yes, he literally punches people to death. Mordecai releases his pet Bloodwing, which will fly at enemies and do ridiculous damage, and will often one-hit enemies once the player reaches higher levels and purchases the correct skills along the way.      Now that you have an idea of Borderlands' gameplay mechanics, let me inform you about two of the series' trademarks.      Borderlands has an iconic graphical style. The developers employed ""celshading,"" a technique which outlines all of the objects in the game world with thick black lines, sort of like tracing around everything with a black Sharpie marker. It's a very noticeable effect, but it still looks really good.     Borderlands is known for its humor as well as its graphics. One of the first main characters you meet is this funny, idiotic robot named CL4P-TP, but goes by his ""locally-designated name,"" Claptrap. He's kind of hilarious, and the reactions of other characters to him are just as funny.      Borderlands was and still is a fresh take on the FPS genre. It beats games like Call of Duty on multiple grounds, and is overall an extremely unique experience. Unlike other games, Borderlands' DLC is worth buying because all of the DLC is major, rather than being $3 packs that let you reskin your character, or something like that. I highly recommend the game, and really encourage you to buy it if you haven't already considered it.			"

												Fun game!  It's got a lot of good humor in it and many fun missions.  It took some getting used to, but once I got the hang of the game I enjoyed it.  My only complaint would be the incredibly stupid and enormously disappointing (in my opinion, anyway) ending.  I won't tell you what happens, of course, because I don't want to be a spoiler, but I thought it could have ended better.  But I can see why they ended it the way they did...they needed to be able to make a sequel  :P.   Still, overall it provided hours of fun and entertainment, so I felt it was money well spent.  And who knows...maybe you'll like the ending!			"

 BORDERLANDS + ""The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned"" (DLC) Borderlands is called a ""Role Playing Shooter"" (RPS). It's a excellent balanced mix of RPG elements without sacrificing the FPS game play.Tons of weapons, equipment, levels and more. Huge world with hours of game play to enjoy!You take on the role of a bountyhunter which has come to Pandora in search of riches.The game has a post-apocalyptic, almost Mad Max like feel to it. The graphics in Borderlands are quite unique and have comic book style looks to them which only adds to the post-apocalyptic feel. Borderlands has so much to offer in terms of game play, rewarding missions, loot, and fun multiplayer that once you start playing you won't want to stop. 9/10 "

												I have to say I honestly love this game. I'm usually one of the people who bash First-Person Shooters (Like COD) but this is something totally different. The cell-shading style of the came gives it a light-hearted almost cartoon-y feel while you love the bloodthristy gunfights. All the unique weapon possibilites and the character skills and perks make this leaps and bounds ahead of any FPS compared to it. It really is a FPS-RPG style game. Replaying it to get overpowered or even better loot doesn't lose it's charm, trust me, you'll be coming back to Pandora again and again in this game or the other two.			"

												EN: Borderlands is a really good game. This is a mixture FPS / RPG. Game life is profitable. Characters development is interesting, and we like the management of weapons (a bit like Ken & Lynch). If you have the opportunity to take it on sales do not hesitate! The only negatives points are maybe that some DLC are a bit repetitive as the overall game near the end. Solo or multiplayer to have a good time! But some missions (or some DLC as arenas) are almost impossible alone, you will need to play multiplayer for those parts...FR: Borderlands est vraiment un bon jeu. Il mélange FPS/RPG, et la durée de vie est rentable. L’évolution des personnages est intéressante, et on aime la gestion des armes (un peu comme dans Ken & Lynch). Si vous avez l’occasion de le prendre en solde n’hésitez pas ! Les seuls points négatifs sont peut-être que certains DLC sont un peu répétitifs comme le jeu global vers la fin. En solo, ou en multi, pour passer de bons moments ! Par contre, certaines missions (ou certains DLC comme les arènes) sont quasi impossibles seul, il faudra jouer en multi…			"
