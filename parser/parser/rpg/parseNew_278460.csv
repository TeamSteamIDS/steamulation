												2/22/14 Edit: Game cleared/fully experienced/explored.  Took about 7 hrs if you're diligent about it, maybe a little faster if you're good at this genre. This game is pretty legit.  I'll be brief and quickly summarize my first impressions from playing this game.Pros:Entralling Story - Having finished my first playthrough I can safely say that Skyborn offers an entertaining tale with various twists and turns that'll keep the player on their toes.  I found the closure at the end to be very satisfying as well (not really a spoiler, I'm primarily trying to convey that the end wasn't half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Avoidable combat - Unlike most RPGs where you run around and trigger random events that can't be seen, Skyborn has a system where players are able to physically see monsters on the screen.  This allows a player to circumvent an unwanted encounter while providing the option of easy EXP as well if they find themselves underleveled. Edit: I'll say this now - avoidable mobs are all OPTIONAL.  Under no circumstances was I ever pressed to level/grind on a normal clear.  I'm currently working on a hard clear to see if this is the same case.  Don't let this discourage you though, boss fights are still pretty difficult depending on your composition.Battle Arena - Later on in the game there's an arena that offers a substantial challenge if you find the fights to be too easy.  It poses a significant challenge compared to typical encounters.Crafting system - I haven't tried it too thoroughly yet, however there is a system in place for harvesting minerals etc and for creating weapons and armor.  It hasn't been too impactful in my playthrough since I've been finding gear frequently enough as is, but it's a nice side touch to have.Consistency/Persistent Story - The game feels very consistent throughout, and when I say that I mean so with regards to the story alawys being present.  Unlike other RPGs where you get a 30 second snippet of dialog followed by 2 hours of grinding mobs through a tower in order to reach an objective, Skyborn does a decent job of adding in short excerpts of character interaction to alleviate the grind.  While progressing through dungeons characters will talk and continue to give the player story while dungeon crawling.The Music - The music in this game is by far satisfying and enjoyable to listen to.  This of course is my own personal preference, however if something like this appeals to you then by all means consider this when making your decision as well.Cons:Lack of Backtracking - There are a couple of areas where I realized some chests were left unlooted due to not understanding certain trigger mechanics until later in the game.  From what I can tell, I'm unable to revisit these places for the time being since map movement is very story driven.  This is important because certain items come from said chests... and one of the initial lines implies that you want to collect all of a particular set for extraordinary rewards. Edit: At some point in the game it does allow for freedom of movement/control of your ship/destination - just don't expect it too soon.Options/Settings - I found this panel to be very lacking.  Not only do audio settings not save (I found myself having to lower game volume manually through the audio manager my OS provides) but there's very little customization available.  You can change the color of the major panels, however keybindings cannot be changed.  On top of that, the tutorial isn't very extensive, so figuring out what binds to what is a bit difficult at first.  They do bring up the least obvious binding (X has uses apparently), but they fail to mention that other buttons such as spacebar and enter can function as an ""a"" button if you were to play a hand held.Stat Values - This is the min/maxer speaking at the moment.  With regards to stats in this game, their effects are very helterskelter as far as values go.  I'm not talking specific number crunching for damage per turn etc but rather lack of clarity.  It's not exactly clear what +1 agility will do as opposed to +1 strength which was a bit frustrating.As for now, I'm a very satisfied customer considering the price I paid for this.  I'd strongly recommend it to anyone that was a fan of the old FFs (1-2 etc) who have a strong desire for pretty driven plot.  Overall, I'd give this game an 7.5/10 with everything above in mind. As far as buying goes, I'd be a bit hesitant in recommending full price for this game.  With the current half off sale though, it's very much so a buy that gives you your bang for your buck!			"

												When the touchy subject of RPG Maker commercial games comes up, I am not one to judge or deny the legitimacy of RPG Maker games as a commercial product. I have seen some fantastic games made on the engine like To The Moon, and I have seen absolute garbage like the Laxius Force and Millenium Quest series being put up for sale. My interest for this title was raised when the discussion on RPG Maker commercial games mentioned Deadly Sin and its sequel as an example of good RPG Maker games, and one of the studio's earlier titles was this.This game is a short story set in a steampunk fantasy world where the plot involves Claret Spencer, a mechanic who is about to get entangled in a pivotal racist conspiracy involving the Skyborn, a race of magic users with Dragon-wings, Humans, the ancient and near-extinct Fey, and Half-Breeds, the result of a Skyborn and a Human mating. The story is really focused in scope, goes through predictable motions and doesn't do enough world-building to be compelling. However, what it does have as far as story goes is quite competently written, and the characters in the story are fairly consistent in their actions.The gameplay has a few unique twists to the bog-standard turn-based RPG and equipment system in that armor doesn't  directly come into play for damage-reduction, but instead, they increase various stats depending on type. In a way, the type of armor used determines the type of build for each character. The combat system is a standard Conditional Turn Based system but with a twist to keep things interesting, and encourages players to use more support skills, and it's the Threat system. Characters with the most threat will be targeted for single-target attacks, dealing damage and killing enemies will increase the threat of that character for the duration of the battle. This system allows for the utility of skills that can transfer threat from one character to another, or to gather an enormous amount of threat for one's self. This combination of systems allows for a lot of min maxing to be employed, which is pretty refreshing for an RPG Maker game. There is also an augment and forging system that allows players to further customise their gear, which is good. What is not so good, however, is the unintuitive way of how the stats are used and how they are never explained ingame. See, the Strength stat determines the damage dealt by regular weapon attacks regardless of type, Intelligence determines the effectiveness of special skills, and Agility merely determines the Speed, Critical and Evade chance. While this would make sense normally, there is also the idea that there are 3 different types of damage ; Physical, Magic and Tech and one would easily be forgiven for thinking that Strength, Intelligence and Agility would determine the effectiveness of Physical, Magical and Tech attacks respectively. This leaves for some results that just plain doesn't make sense, like Corwin's (The designated mage/healer.) magical blast weapon damage that is determined by his strength instead of Intelligence. The other issue with the combat and gameplay is that on Normal, it is either too easy, or you get wiped out real quickly, with no battles that provide an evenly-matched struggle, and the being wiped-out part only ever happens if you don't do the side-quests before the point of no return. Once you did all the side-quests before the endgame, then the endgame becomes ridiculously easy again,Another bugbear of the gameplay of this game is that very few of the objects in the game can be interacted with with any measure, which brings us back to the point of the game being very focused and limited in scope to the point of its own detriment. It would have been nice if there are more props that give you flavour text, added an effect to your party, or can be interacted with to produce a sound effect. (Piano jingle, anyone?) As an RPG afficionado, I can tell you that most RPGs offer an immense amount of non-plot-relevant interactivity, which goes a long way with the immersion.Another issue is that there aren't enough variety in the enemy mobs to keep things interesting. All the enemy mobs have a role that is theoretically mirrored by one of the characters', and very few of the skills that enemies have are unique to the enemies, as a result, most enemies are very predictable, and thus very easy to deal with, even enemies with the ability to OHKO half your party. That said, the abilities that you do gain throughout the game are very useful and are a nice change from the generic damage ones that plagues most RPG Maker games. I also do like the design of the dungeons themselves which strayed a lot from the conventional square-like design that even commercial RPGs from the 90's suffer from, this results in a lot of the dungeons and natural cave systems looking very very organic, which is a great plus for this game.The strongest point of this game though, is the music. The soundtrack is very well-mastered with a lot of nice orchestral stings and swelling chords befitting of a fantasy RPG. It is no Falcom Sound Team JDK, but as far as indie RPG Maker projects go, the fact that the soundtrack isn't a set of crappy generic MIDIs alone is something I can appreciate a lot.So the final verdict is, do I recommend this game? And the answer is unfortunately, nope. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this game, and as far as RPG Maker games go, this is one of the better ones. However, with how limited and focused the scope of the game is, there is not enough world-building and lore to keep the player invested in the story and its characters, and the paltry offering with regards to interactivity and side-quests certainly didn't help it. Ultimately, the biggest drawback of this game is that it is not ambitious enough for the premise it presents, and maybe if the combat system is given more depth, if there are more character and story arcs, and if there is a less-linear progression through the story, then it might be worth the $15 asking price. As it stands, I cannot really recommend this game, outside of at least a 50% off sale, unless you really like RPG Maker games.			"

Skyborn reviewPros -Better than Dancing dragons Deadly sin seriesCharacters you actually care aboutStory is something you can follow and hang ontoCombat system was done in the best way I have ever seen in a RPGmaker game, All encounters are visibleControls were just fineNo glitches or bugs that I foundExploring gives you the best itemsKinda meh things -Music was nice but easily something you could forgetWhile combat is done well, It becomes too easy later in the game even on the most difficult settingNo map so getting lost is possibleWhile characters are likeable, Some might not find them interestingCons - LengthThe end boss in my opinion wasn't hard enough as defeating it probably only took me less than 2 minutes, I know that boss battles are supposed to drag but it felt too shortEnding feels short of explainingEven though this game isn't perfect, I would say it's the best RPGmaker game I have ever played.  I'm going to play again Final rating, 8/10 "

												Worth it, its an RPG maker VX game. Now although you may think thats pretty lame, it is. HOWEVER! the story is good, progression, characters, the sound choices are good, theres very few glitches, just generally its a solid game 8/10 and it took up a decent ammount of my time.I have one complaint: The last boss is RNG defeatable, in other words, you can either be killed in one hit by its ""Last Stand"" move, or you spend an hour trying to kill it. I haven't killed it. Kind of makes me angry. This is really bad because the move can be used on any turn within that hour of fighting him, so the chances are extremely high that it will be activated. Now I know what you're thinking, maybe if you would just get more ready for the boss befor- NO. I have 4 level 50's and a level 58. I have maxed out gear, and I was doing 20k damage per round I attacked him. ♥♥♥♥ YOU.So other than the last boss being unbeatable except by pure luck, this game is outstanding, I expected far less from an RPG maker game. It delivered, and it was worth it.Story: 9/10Gameplay: 7/10 (Basic Speed based turn fighting)Presentation: 6/10 (Rpg maker is by no means perfect)Soundtrack: 10/10 (Fitting, always played, variety, no complaints)Replayability: 0/10 (I don't want to go through the same story again, let alone grind some more to kill the final boss)			"

												Skyborn is a thoughtful and modernly designed RPG, in that it allows for those of us who just no longer have the time or interest to devote to typical RPG trappings (such as battle grinding and complex inventory management) to actually play through with challenge but not difficulty; and through its efficient game play, the creators really afforded me the chance to see where the game truly shines, in its intriguing story and interesting world building!

												Great classic style RPG with a very mature storyline and the characters are easy to relate to. Combat is quite fun and the augmentation system adds a little flavor to your gear so you can modify the characters as you see fit. The game itself allows you to explore for hidden items and upgrades and there are very few random battles which is the main reason I tend to avoid this style of RPG, so that is a definite plus! Monsters are visually wandering around and you can choose to fight or walk right by them most of the time when the story permits. Great game, looking forward to seeing how it all pans out!			"

												Skyborn is a unique story driven R.P.G. developed by Dancing Dragon Games and published by Degica. The Skyborn are a winged humanoid race that has defeated in war and consequently subjugated humankind. You take on the role of Claret Spencer, the star mechanic of an independent repair shop, who suddenly finds herself pulled into an epic city wide conflict which takes her and her friends on a journey through a tale of magic, metal and mystery as she unravels the secrets of the Skyborn. This is a R.P.G. Maker title which up to this point I had never heard of although I have played many games in the past with this same look and style. For those that don't know, R.P.G. Maker is a program that allows users to create their very own role playing games. With that said, the gripping story in this title is really well conceived and unfolds over the course of the game in unvoiced dialogue and cutscenes many times alongside gorgeous anime inspired handrawn artwork that is truly a pleasure to the eyes. There's enough intrigue, action and humor in this wonderful game to keep you consistently playing from start to finish.As you travel through the beautiful and heavily steampunk themed world of the game, Claret and the allies that she manages to assemble along the way will be forced to do battle against the Skyborn themselves as well as a variety of other enemies and adversaries. The combat in this title, which is very fun and quite different from the typical R.P.G.'s that I tend to play, takes place in the form of the turn based J.R.P.G. battle systems similiar to many classic well known Japanese Role Playing Games like Final Fantasy and Grandia. As you win you constantly earn experience points and automatically level up your group. You also have the ability to upgrade the gear of your character and companions by purchasing, looting or crafting various weapon and armor sets. Besides the main story, Claret will meet many interesting and sometimes hilarious N.P.C.'s who will provide you with the chance to take on any number of optional sidequests. There is also an incentive to explore the world because there are many hidden items to find which can yield extra experience points and crafting materials as well as currency. The musical score and sound effects in this title are phenomenal and fit the gameplay perfectly. Whether you are engaged in battle, leisurely strolling about or having a conversation there are tracks to suit the occasion. The world is filled with gears grinding and smokestacks puffing as one would expect in a steampunk themed game and this title does not dissapoint. I find myself listening to the classically inspired soundtrack on a daily basis as I'm logged on to Steam and will continue to do so because it's that memorable. Discovering this game came as a huge surprise for me as I never thought that I would have enjoyed a title such as this as much as I have. Playing this game has definitely piqued my interest in the R.P.G. Maker genre. Like I stated before, this genre is completely new to me but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this title has to be one of the most well developed and polished of them all. I constantly find myself scouring Steam every week hoping that I might one day come across another gem like this one. If you're looking for a lighthearted roleplaying game with a fantastic story, just the right amount of humor and interesting combat then look no further...Skyborn would make an excellent addition to your library and is highly recommended! As a side note, the developers have recently begun asking the Steam community what they would like in another Skyborn game so I'm crossing my fingers and hope to die that a sequel could definitely be in the works.

												I absolutely recommend the game, this is amazing work for a game on RPGMaker engine. What makes it special from number of other RPGM games? Well, bunch of nice things.+ Skyborn presents you a rather deep world, with background story, interracial conflict.+ Unlike most of RPGM games, Skyborn is set in steampunk setting.+ Game is nicely balanced between storytelling and fighting. That means you do need to fight, but it's not too frequent.+ Game has implemented mouse controls. Mouse is fully operational and working for UI and movement control. No other RPGM games can offer you this.+ Crafting and upgrading mechanics without grind.+ Game encourages explorers with free extra EXP and useful items.+ Class speciality upgrades, which allow you put more strategy in fights. However there is an Ultimate Class for each character.Now what can keep you from buying it:- This is a j-rpg game. That means turn-based battles, mostly repetitive fights. Some of enemies will be very hard to defeat, until you discover their weaknesses. Sometimes it's oddly balanced, for example I couldn't kill one optional boss in the end, but easily defeated final boss.- Game comes without Steamworks support. That means no Cloud sync and no Achievements (which could be good)- Plot doesn't have open choices and has only one ending. It's good for a story, but nowadays most games feature multiple endings.Still so good.			"

												Don't let the RPGMaker tag fool you, this is actually a fantastic game, reminiscent of the best JRPGs of the classic 16- and 32-bit era. The ensemble cast is fun and memorable, with each party member complementing each others quite nicely with their unique abilities. Too often in such games you will find a slew of useless abilities, status effects and debuffs that don't work (or that are nowhere near as useful as just dealing damage, for instance), but in this game, you have to really utilize each party member wisely to win, at least if you play on Hard (highly recommended for the best experience, though you will need an optimized party for the last boss). To the dev's credits, I don't think I found a single ability that was useless, and that's pretty much unheard of in the genre. ^^There are no random battles; enemies appear on the screen, and they do not respawn. This is a godsend, because if there's one thing I don't miss from old jRPGs it's random battles every two steps that constantly interrupt your exploration. Each battle is fairly meaningful (again, on Hard) with plenty of strategy. Dungeon design could have been a bit more imaginative, it's mostly just standard ""flip this switch to open this path""; but at least there's rewarding exploration and that's good enough. I would suggest to the devs to add more meaningful puzzles (à la Golden Sun or Wild ARMs) in a future game, that'd turn your game from good to spectacular. ^^ The story is nothing too original but it's well-written and engaging, never once did I groan in dismay at silly plot twists or anything like that, which happens far too often in these types of games, so congrats on a job well done. Oh and what are RPGs without good soundtracks and art direction? Skyborn's is excellent in both cases, so don't worry about that. I really loved the sprites and characters portraits, the artists are clearly very talented.I do have some mild criticism, but it's nothing that detracted from my enjoyment: the dungeons could have been even better, as I mentioned before, and the crafting system is a bit tacked on, IMO, and not all that useful. And when shopping for equipment, there should be a better UI to compare with what you have equipped (and of course offer to auto-equip after buying). Luckily, the menus are quick and snappy so it's not much of an issue to navigate between menus, but that could certainly have been improved upon. Some have complained that the game is too short, but I disagree. Doing all the optional content I could find and retrying the last boss a few times, I have about 19 hours; that's more than fair for a game without filler. Personally I prefer this over a 50 hour long game with tons of boring side-quests and meandering stories that drag on and on, so I have no problem with the game's length. YMMV. I suspect those who spent less than 10 hours probably played on Normal or Easy and breezed through without doing the side-stuff, which is weird to me.All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by how good this game was. I hesitated a long time before buying it, expecting a decent but probably amateurish product, but it's actually very well made, very polished, and the combat is, without hyperbole, among the best I've seen in turn-based JRPGs.

												Skyborn is an RPG that feels like the older FF games (1-6).  The story is there, it isn't an award winning story, it's a story that holds together the game and the characters well enough.  Sound design is alright, nothing to really complain about, but I ended up muting the music and just playing mine.  There is a crafting system that ends up being useless an hour into the game, and an augmenting system that you will always use.  Character classes are simple enough to understand, some classes have passives along with their active skills.There is absolutely no grind in this game, and the non essential/mob fights are triggered by walking into them.  For the first few hours I felt that I needed to kill every single mob which do not respawn from what I've noticed, eventually I stopped doing this and didn't feel behind in levels.  After a certain segment, you gain access to sidequest that lead you to areas where the monsters are capable of OHKO everyone except for your main tank, with proper strategy (not really that hard) no one should die.  For reference I ended up clearing the coliseum by level 29 once I gained access to the last party member, and the Gauntlet at level 35.TL:DRDo sidequestAlright storyIngots OPLinearCrafting is crapAugmenting is coolBLD=Weight Limit2/5 Party members are boringCan get by higher level fights with proper strategyMobs become easy after a certain pointCool steampunk setting if you're into that8/10			"

★★☆☆☆ Graphics and SoundHonestly, this game isn't that bad looking on the initially. Of course, this is completely thrown out the window the moment you enter combat. The enemies are almost entirely generic RPGmaker enemies. They do not match the theme of the game or the visuals. The attacks are unsatisfying visually, too. Then you find most of the puzzles in the dungeons involve pressing giant color coded buttons. Also, every enemy is represented by the same imp sprite. This game looks good but uses way too much stock assets and ends up looking kind of ugly.Music is nothing to note. It's usually not annoying, but it can be at times. Nothing stands out about it.The sounds are once again, extremely unsatisfying. Honestly I turned them off after a while.★☆☆☆☆ GameplayThis game throws an interesting concept at you, the Threat mechanic. The enemies will always attack the party member with the highest ""threat level"", which is generated by moves items and certain equipment. It's not chance based ether, they will always focus you. This turns certain party members into punching bags while the others are for aoe dps. It makes the game laughably easy because there no chances, it's abuseable to all hell.Battle system aside, there are no random encounters, they're all scripted, meaning that EXP is fixed and there's no difficulty curve as long as you fight everything in order. Not that the enemies are ever particularly difficult, even on the highest setting, due to the threat mechanic.Parties are not customizable in the slightest, you are given 5 party members that follow a role that will remain exactly the same regardless of how you decide to reclass them.Stats are meaningless and easy to inflate due to a poorly designed ""augmentation"" system.Simply put, it's lazy and didn't think mechanic with a lot of potential through very well.★★★☆☆ StoryThis is probably the game's greatest attribute. I'm being a little bit generous because the storytelling is rather forced upon you and rushed, but the theme and overall feeling has a good basis. The characters are likable from the start, but unfortunately do not really undergo any sense of development. It's a very short story and could probably benefit from slowing down a little bit.★★☆☆☆ OverallI don't recommend this game. It's short lived and a very forgettable experience. The entire time I found myself wanting to like this game, hoping it would get better, but it never does. Good concept, bad presentation, badly put together.			"

												Skyborn is a great game. Has a very good story with unexpecting ending for main boss. The combat is good if you ever play Deadly Sins 2 you will pick up on it espically the health items are mostly the same and some of the abilities characters has. There is no random encounters so you can pick and choose your fights, rewards exploring with decent loot and small stars that give extra exp. Biggest plus for me it is a fantasy world cross with machines really enjoy it a lot. Game is shorter then 8 hrs I spent on it but I like exploring. Would highly reccommend this game to anyone.			"

												Skyborn is a gem. An unpolished one for some, but definitely not blunt.IMO it's a good game. Not as good as a FF, but good enough. It took me around 19 hours to finish the game completely and I most certainly recommend to play it on Hard mode. Yet, like any game, it's got some flaws.The game is very entertaining and being made with RPG maker didn't bother me much except during the fights. Skyborn would have been much better with a FF like battle interface, just watching deck-like drawings moving on the screen isn't as exciting as it could be and it's a real shame that Skyborn lacks proper fighting grounds, especially considering the innovative combat sistem based on the threat level.Some people have complained about the dungeons, but to be honest I liked them and didn't feel like being slight variations of the same dungeons I'd already explored. I did, however, miss a full map that I could check so I could locate my position in the dungeon or track any possible hidden areas with chests.Speaking of treasure chests, I couldn't help it but feel a bit down when I finally got to some particularly pesky chests only to find that they only had a potion or another healing item that I wasn't gonna use anyway. Some of the treasure chests' contents could have been better.And lastly, one of the things that bothered me the most about skyborn is that the game doesn't give you any information about stats and you can easily play through chunks of the game the wrong, or at least not in the most optimal, way.Other than this, there are only minor issues that could have been improved to make the game better. For instance, moving through the menus can sometimes get chaotic, I really missed the FF battle option of remembering your last action, in Skyborn you always start on the ""attack"" command and the forge system is one of those things you think is important and you're going to be using in the future but you end up not using, or at least not as much as you think you would. Also, the Colosseum could have been improved, the augmentation system should have been explained in depth and Skyborn would've benefited greatly from Steam achievements. But none of this flaws break the game.In short, those are all the issues that I found in the game, but don't let that distract you from the truth. Despite everything, Skyborn is a really good game, very enjoyable with a nice difficulty curve (provided you play on Hard mode) which presents several innovations, such as a new battle system and an engaging story, that could have made of skyborn another ""Chrono Trigger""-like quality game but doesn't quite reach the top as it stands.Overall: 8.75/10Loved the music BTW!  (^_^)EDIT = They've implemented achievements now, so Hurray for them!!			"

												This title manages to overcome many of the issues that it could have faced and really raises the bar for what I'll be coming to expect from indie JRPGs and titles using the RPGMaker engine. Of the indie old-school RPGs I've played thusfar, it is the best title of that sub-category that is available on Steam right now and excels in every area, exceeding all my expectations. Though this is going to be quite a glowing review, I'll get into some of the downsides toward the end.There are largely original assets in terms of graphics- an original, rarely-explored Steampunk setting to explore, well done full-screen character designs, and a bunch of animations and effects that add more immersion and personality to the cut-scenes. It all ends up comparing favorably to retail classics. This is one of those titles where you can just look at the screenshots to see if it will be pleasing aesthetically, the actual game does not deviate far from that though unfortunately many of the dungeon areas fall into the typical types of rainforests, caves, mines, etc. Battle graphics are quite simplistic. I greatly enjoy the character designs which seem like a curious blend of Eastern and Western ideas. As for gameplay, there are enough nooks and crannies to the systems that it better resembles early PS1 RPGs like Grandia or Wild Arms rather than NES/SNES RPGs. The battle system is reminiscent of Grandia with multiple gauges and turn order being dictated by a character's speed stat and also by a weight stat, based on how many items they have equipped. There are some unusual ideas here, such as physical offensive characters having an ""energy"" gauge that fills up and makes more of their abilities accessible and a ""threat"" gauge that affects which character will face the brunt of attacks. Buffs, debuffs, and status effects are also available very early on and relevant quickly during battles. The most noteworthy thing about character management is about halfway through the game and again 3/4 of the way through, you receive special items that allow non-linear character classes. For example, a character can choose to learn high level healing OR offensive magic so your choices can accommodate your play style.There is a weapons and armor crafting and customization system along with the option to use multiple weapon types such as guns, dual-wielding swords, etc. In addition to seeking out treasure from dungeons you also seek out resources to create much stronger versions of the weapons and gear you'd buy from the shops in town. There is a battle coliseum and super tough optional enemies that add a few hours of gameplay.Dungeons are well-designed areas rife with very simple puzzles to work out. Towns are attractively intricate in design but have little to do beyond speaking to some NPCs, perhaps accepting a quest, and checking out the shops. This is perhaps an overly relaxed game in terms of complexity, but also a fast-paced one, which is a huge factor in its enjoyability. I would recommend choosing hard difficulty though my first playthrough (clocking in at almost 9 hours) was on medium.The menus are polished and a handy quest log can keep track of where you're at and what you're to do next (this could have been useful for so many old-school RPGs..) lack of cursor memory is my only complaint with the menus.Music is excellent, the original soundtrack sounds very reminiscent of earlier JRPGs but with enough technical merit to avoid sounding generic. The story is similarly exceptional- usually I expect these homages to old RPGs to come across more as fanfiction than an original story but Skyborn's writing may even exceed (or at least manage to bypass) limitations of both its peers and forebears. There are no issues with translation here, since the story is originally drawn up in English. Didn't catch any grammatical errors, it just seems also at a high standard of quality and the first hour alone is brimming with excitement. The characters are lively, amusing, and  mature in their actions. Those who dislike the slapstick that is common in more lighthearted RPGs will likely find this title appreciable.The story takes place in an alternate, very steampunk-inspired universe where there are three races- humans, the winged Skyborn, and the unfortunate half-breeds that are at the bottom of the hierarchy and face violent discrimination from both groups. There is another race to speak of, but I'll get on with things. The heroine, Claret, works at a mechanic shop until she finds herself caught between an escalating conflict between humans and the very powerful Skyborn who are seeking to enslave and decimate the other races. She's a plucky but strong and capable heroine who isn't over-the-top; rather, she reacts very relateably to the unfolding story and does what she can to help. From there the conflict becomes more chaotic and both allies and enemies are not as they may seem. Some entertaining twists along the way.Flashbacks with gameplay portions and specialized artwork to match add an extra bit of attention to detail in the story and help flesh out the characters. It's not the most original storyline in the world and I wish there were just a bit more character interactions since quite a likeable group is assembled, but it is one of the high points of Skyborn overall. Now for some of the downsides- this game's standard price is $15 and is about 8 hours long. Almost $2 per hour. Give or take a few hours if you wish to thoroughly explore each of the minor quests and grind out levels for a tough optional boss. That is still a lot to ask for a short title, and especially for a short title with as many old-school sensibilities as this one has. Absolutely worth the time if it's on sale. Even though I loved it, I can really only recommend this title at its full price wholeheartedly to someone who is looking for an old-school indie JRPG that performs exceptionally in its class.			"

Steampunk in full swingFun, creative, addictive and unique game world. The game borrows heavily from Aveyond, then throws in heavy doses of other steam-punk stories and ideas.Great looking visuals, again with a very distinctive and well done art style!Very pleasant audio, with catchy music throughout that fits the theme!A lot of variety in monsters.Overall, just a high level of production and polish.Warning! It contains violence! #notrly ""This guy was such a tool, I could have fixed this airship with him.""  "

												I would love to give a detailed review of this game about every its aspect individually, but you can really only do that when there is something to point out.The game is amazing, from the details, the sounds, the visual tricks it uses to the story and gameplay. The final boss battle is somewhat cliche in my opinion but everything else is spot on. It took me 9 hours to complete the game and I did that in one sitting, meaning I couldn't separate myself from it until I finished it.I was very sceptic about the game and I got it for virtually free. I didn't expect much from it even from the start because of prejustices toward the genre that I had but once I started it up, and realized how much work actually went into this game and how it does its best to push the genre to its limits, I was blown away.Recommendations to this game. It is truly...SKYBORN *dun dun dun*			"

												I wasn't really sure about Skyborn at first. I got the game a while ago but I thought I'd never really play it. I downloaded it just cause it was really small in size. I decided to start it one day when my internet was out due to an outage. I started the game and began playing, next thing I know I've been playing Skyborn for 10 hours start to end, my internet was back but I was so into it I didn't even realize. I'm really glad I started this game that day, because I would've missed a great game otherwise.I needed something with a new story, something interesting and fun to play and this game gave me everything I wanted. I only regret one thing about this game, and that is that it wasn't 10 times longer. Heck, I wish it was 1000 times longer.I would recommend this to anyone who wants to play a good game. 11/10.PS: Excuse my hours, apparently it doesn't count offline hours and updates when you come online.PS :I'm a bit addicted now to games like these. Add me and tell me about amazing games like this so I don't miss anything amazing ever again.			"

												I gave the game a fair shot, and my experience was mixed.First of all there is a lot of great custom art for this project.  Bravo to the artist for literally carrying this game.Sadly they left in the default sounds effects.  For a small budget you can get loads of free on the right sites with enough leg work.  It doesn't seem like the developer knew to do this. I broke quite a few events and even managed to find multiple passability bugs.  It really seems like this was someone's first RPG maker game as it has a lot of quality errors.*To the people who quality tested this game: Shame on you.  You missed a lot.  I won't go further into muck racking than that.  You failed at your job, and it blatantly shows.*Good music was another positive quality.  The theme was used enough and remixed to the atmosphere of the areas that it wasn't tired, but invigorating hearing it.  I was enthralled enough to keep playing with the BGM going.The story was patchworked at best, with things shoe horned in that left me confused at times without explinations. I enjoyed the ride, but the story didn't go anywhere.  The big reveal at the end came out of nowhere and literally stopped the story dead to justify the end boss.  Even then the ending showed that a support character was the most important and invested character in the game, not Claret.  Claret was the falling star of Skyborn, and is sadly on the cover.  She has no place on the title, because this is not her story.  It's Claska's story and rise to power.The battle system is simply steam rolling enemies at any difficulty.  The side boss is not worth revisiting, nor does she make any sense in the explaination of this world.  She seems to be able to go to the Fae world, so I assume she is an Earthenfae too.  Not that we are given any reason to invest in her.Items weren't worth investing into.  At a point in the game where major upgrades are bought you replace them with found treasure almost instantly.  It's a big time sink that didn't need to be there.  Had weapons been upgraded like Claska's claw it would have been a bit of a smoother transition and better use of the anvil and synth system which fell short of simply buying better gear.Skyborn can't decide what the Prometheus Engine is.  It tells us it is an Airship Engine at first, then an anti magic shield, and finally it turns out to be a mecha robot.  It has all but 30 seconds of screen time and isn't used in the final encounter.  Big build up and grind for little pay off there.  Claret focus quickly dwindled. Sully's focus happened at the wrong times with his father being shoe horned in, and then almost forgot about his sister nor does she appear in the Fae Realm with the other half breeds.  His part as the Red Spectre had little to do with anything other than baiting the player.Corwin is the ultimate silent character.  I feel like he wasn't even there.  He didn't even so much as chew the scenery.Alda's derpy blonde face with it's crossed eyes had me amused, but her character's motivation kept changing to the point I felt she wasn't a liability so much as a natural blonde.  She is the over kill character.  She is far too powerful to be in the group.  EMP blast and Missle Launch had nothing on her Mystic Blade and Lightfury.In the end it was worth one playthrough.  Was it perfect?  No.  Was it good?  Yes.  But it felt hastily put together and poorly tested.  You really need to pick and choose your testers.  Their laziness and inability to grow with the project's need hurt all of your custom materials.It wasn't the developers fault with this game, his staff didn't measure up to the challange.  Hopefully Phil finds better people.			"

												This is JRPG-lite and I mean it in the best possible way ever. If you're wanting to play a simple JRPG without dumping a large amount of time into it, this game is for you.The nostalgia that assaulted me within the first couple hours of the game was real. It's relatively shortish for a JRPG. My 100% leisurely playthrough on hard took me around 14 hours, but I enjoyed every moment of it except for a few boss fights.The game itself isn't very difficult. Even on hard it's at most an entertaining challenge. Until you get to a certain few boss battles.The 2nd boss fight took me half an hour to beat because it was hard. Really, really hard but beatable once you figure out how to go about it. The last boss battle made me want to break something. The last boss is just incredibly difficult to defeat because he has a skill that, unless you debuff him in time, will 99.9% of the time wipe out your entire party. I barely won this battle through the skin of my teeth. It was incredibly frustrating because I had gotten so close a few times only to get wiped out with a single attack.To beat the last boss you will need SPD (puffin feathers) on every bit of Chaska's armour, (Sullivan's too just to be safe), so she can use Humilator to debuff the boss immediately after he buffs himself with his Energy skill. Make sure she (and Sullivan if possible) has Haste all the time. I was not prepared for this battle, but I used the souls augment on Chaska and the whopping three puffin feathers I had in my inventory. The permanent Haste ability from the soul was enough to get me barely through the battle. I completely lucked out. Alda somehow survived his ridiculous OP attack and somehow I managed to kill him via status effect. I don't even know what happened, but I'm not complaining.A lot of the boss battles had a lot of luck attributed to them. If they use certain skills before you're prepared (ie: when you first encounter them) they can devastate you, but when you try again and they don't use that skill, it's a piece of cake. It's frustrating sometimes, but it didn't stop me from continuing to play.Another thing were that were two areas that looped so that you could never figure out whether or not you had gotten all the goodies in the area unless you walked in circles for forever. The battle UI also looks terrible.Aside from that, this was a genuinely fun game. It's gorgeous looking, and an incredibly well put together for a RPG Maker game. The story is pretty light and entertaining for the first half and gets more serious as the game goes on. It's not the greatest story ever, but it's and good enough. A huge plus is that there are no random battles. The monsters are all visible and you can choose whether or not you want to fight them. There is nothing more annoying in JRPGs then having to fight every two steps when you're trying to explore every inch of the map. I like grinding for the most part, I really do, but as a completionist that drives me insane.The character portraits are a really nice touch. Character design is great. I love the characters in the game. I love our spunky protagonist and her interactions with our tank. They're hilarious. I ship it.The music is top notch as well.I really highly recommend this game if you're looking for a nice little time killer. I didn't expect much when I started playing and found myself really, really enjoying this.Edit: I have been informed that you should put defense on stuff, so you don't get slaughtered by monsters. I wished someone had told me this earlier because I put attack on everything and was wondering why I could get owned very, very quickly. In hindsight, this was completely too obvious for me.			"

												I really, enjoyed this game alot. If you like 16bit JRPGs this game is for you. The battle system is very fun and the story is well told with likable characters. My own only gripe is this game seems short (I won it around 13 hours.) I was surprised when the game warned me that there was ""no going back"" and I was only level 30, I fought every creature and talked to everyone but I feel like I missed something. But that shows its a good game when you want more. Pick up this game if you like older SNES JRPGs you won't regret this purchase.			"

												The main selling points of an RPG are its combat and its story, neither of which really give much.The combat system is fairly generic, which I kinda expected since it's rpg maker (note: not saying that all RPG maker games are bad. To The Moon is one of my favourites) , but it's also unbalanced. Lightning based powers are practically useless, as most enemies are immune, and all it seems like you'd get screwed over if you didn't take the path where your healer learns revive, as item revive put a character on 1 health, meaning they'll get taken down straight away. The player powers are a bit all over the place too. There's a late game power that can take down 90% of enemies in a single blow while other characters can't really do anything other than buff - which I would be happy with if it was the healer, but I'm referring to the rogue. Storywise, there's potential but it just comes across as unfocused. Elements come and go without any real consideration. There's a side quest system but either they're hidden fairly well or there aren't that many. The ending in particular is unsatisfying as it revolves around a character that we didn't really seem to cover in much detail. While it's not a bad game, it's not one that I would recommendto others.			"

												Beautiful little game, takes around 5 hours to play through depending on your difficulty setting. The idea of multiple races not getting along and a group of protagonists attempting to fix society is definitely cliche, but the game does a great job of progressing the storyline in a way that tries to deviate from it.The artwork and gameplay itself reminded me of a Zelda/Pokemon-esque setting, and the environments you travel through are very well made. The game devs did a great job with the worldbuilding and you can feel yourself in the protagonists' shoes. The characters are also developed very well, and you can see their progressions as you complete the game.I wasn't a big fan of the combat system, it was turn by turn and was a bit boring for me, but it's not a big complaint. I also did not like the fact that there was no map or quest guidance system, but for the most part I was able to find my way after a minute or two of looking around the map.Overall, the pros heavily outweigh the cons. This game is simply fantastic			"

												I was someone who didn't like pixel-art rpg games. With all the others, why should i play it? i'd say.I saw Skyborn's non-pixellated images and i liked it. When i looked at the gameplay, i was SO dissappointed. Felt like a great potential was just wasted.Eventually, my girlfriend gifted me this game and it was in my library for weeks. I decided to give it a shot today in the morning.Oh. My. God.I've been playing this for 8 hours. Never stopped. Finished the game from 0 to 100%. It was amazing.Story is so fluent. It really makes you feel like you are out for a mission.Do NOT expect those fancy graphics in that game. It doesn't have, neither it needs to.Pros:+Great story.+Sometimes really strategic+Sidequests exist and rewards are useful+Awesome character development. Just... awesome.+You get to change your classes twice, and every time you do it you get new cool abilities+Ending was sweet+Fast gameplay and movement makes you feel like you're not wasting your time just moving around+Character drawings (not pixel ones) are anime style and well done+A big world to explore+Great, steampunk atmosphere+You have a big flying ship!Cons:-Large maps sometimes can be quite exhausting-No indicators of the quest you're after. Sometimes you feel like you're drawing circles.-Other than following pop-up texts, there's no way to follow debuffs enemies have-Fights aren't so animated, but since gameplay is fast, i'm not sure if it's a con or notI really wonder why that girl was so strong but i've never learned it.As a non-pixel lover, i loved that game.Recommended 9/10			"

The Short of ItSkyborn is a single, sweet piece of candy; it doesn’t last long, but what’s there tastes better than most other things you might put in your mouth.The Actual ReviewNarrative and gameplay are both tight, if simple, and suffer from none of the padding that usually accompanies lengthier JRPG-esque games. Sadly, there is a downside to the simplicity. The battle system tends to suffer from the early Final Fantasy games’ issue of having many awesome spells and attacks to use across all characters, but being better able to kill enemies by just spamming regular attacks. Apart from some of the bosses, I never felt compelled to explore the different ways in which characters could combine buffs, debuffs, attacks, and items to do more damage.  To so would have made the battles go on longer than need be.As for the system itself, it is an early Dragon Quest / Earthbound -esque affair with a few twists.  Each character has a threat meter, and enemies will focus exclusively on the character with the most threat until that character is dead.  Basically, this means that you have to do damage to your enemies (which increases threat levels) without taking the enemies focus off the tank character you get early on. Well, that, or you can just have everyone attack all the time and ignore the threat meter except for boss battles.  Enemies will end up doing a fair amount of damage this way, but the battles end much more quickly and the damage is easily healed.The system also differentiates between characters who have MP, which is exactly what you’d expect, and characters that have “energy.”  Energy starts at 0% at the beginning of each and every battle, but grows as the character inflicts / receives damage.  Because these characters cannot use their better skills until after the battle has gone on for several turns, these skills hardly ever get used at all.  That said, they are extremely useful for bosses, and are not to be ignored entirely.  All in all, the battle system is fairly fun time with a few notable flaws stemming from it never being quite as fleshed out as most other turn based systems.Meanwhile, the simplicity of the plot had no negative impact on the development of the characters.  After only 11 hours of game, they developed considerably and believably in accordance with their circumstances, showing off their differing yet understandable personalities.  I was never left wondering why characters did what they did, or doubting their personal abilities to do so.  Side quests and customizable gear are also featured, though not heavily. Quests are decent distractions with good gear or even permanent stat-boosts for characters.  While nothing spectacular or especially different, they are fun in their own right and the rewards are generally worth it.  Custom gear is also a good enough system that it is worth having Claret make some for the party, but the system by which she crafts things is straightforward to a fault. The is no real experimentation or concern over what is best to make.Thankfully, the augment system makes up for all of this.  Throughout the game, you will find augments that modify weapons and armor in different ways depending on the augment itself and what type of equipment you attach it to.  These effects can be anything from attack boosts to cutting a certain percentage of one type of damage to outright blocking all debuffs.  The catch is that each augment can only be attached to one piece of equipment.  At no point can augments be reattached to something different, and this creates an interesting problem of deciding what should go where, and who should wear it.  It is this kind of preparation and critical thinking for which I most love RPGs.In the end, Skyborn is a damn good, if short, RPG.  I recommend it to fans of turn-based battle systems, world building, and actual characters.  Being a lifelong hater of using 7 as “average” on a 10-point system, I consider a decent, ho-hum game to be a 5.  That being the case, I give Skyborn a 7/10 (Well Rounded) and say again that you should consider buying it, especially if it’s on sale.Scoring System:0-Insultingly Broken1-Broken2-Detestable3-Terrible4-Bad5-Okay, I guess6-Pretty Good7-Well Rounded8-Excellent9-Nearly Perfect10-Perfect         "

Not that it is really possible since there are no random fights or endless xp/money.While price is maybe a bit high for RPGMaker games, besed on included lore, plot, story and art assets I would say it is worth it if turn based fight RPG games are your thing.

												For this being a RPG Maker game, it is a masterpiece. Places, settings, and dungeons are greatly detailed and must have taken many, many tedious hours to make it so. The artwork is a bit simple, but nice. The gameplay is fun and somewhat innovative. The best of all is the story. Even though it is a short game, the story had me hooked from day one. I wanted to keep playing to unravel more story because it was so interesting and entertaining. In short, if you like (or don't mind) RPG Maker games, turn-based RPGs, and a good story, then you should definitely obtain this game at some point.			"

												Highly recommended, because Skyborn was was, by far, the BEST RPGMaker game I've ever played!  Given the limits of the RPGMaker technology (i.e. dated 2D/JRPG format), I'm going to subtract  one star from my review, however, ... I wish ALL the RPGMaker games were at this quality level.4/5 StarsI've read forum posts where people say they have played the game through 3-5 times even.  It's an interesting enough world that I may play it again, in the future, as well.  I did everything in the game.  [All the side quests, beat all the bosses, etc.  The last few fights are a real challenge!]			"

												One of the most important parts of an RPG, to me, is the option to level your character(s) at most any point during the game. This game doesn't give you much of that at all since EVERY battle is a scripted, one-time-only experience. You can't go back to an easier location and level up so a harder location is easier to handle since all past enemies are gone for good once you defeat them.			"

												As an avid fan of the RPG/JRPG franchise, and a diligent user of the RPG Maker it glads me to no end seeing projects from RPG Maker gets published like this. Not only does it spur me (and perhaps others) to try harder with their own projects, but it also serves as a sort of inspiration. Because let's be honest, not everyone who uses RPG Maker is educated in programming.Educated or not, this is a interesting little game. Note that by the time I write this review, I have yet to complete the game but I can already tell how it is going to end, and most of the details surrounding this game. As an RPG, it's very basic but enjoyable. However, for a open-world style setting it's way too linear and convoluted. And yet some maps are just way too large or a complete mess. I can understand the point of trying to make a forest into a maze...ish... thing but some players might actually have some serious issues with this and ultimately drop it just for a reason like this, seeing how fast paced the game is in general (I did not have any issues though, too many RPGs son). The combat system is extremely basic and simple, almost to the point where I actually got a little disappointed in it. It's solid though, I've seen way too many games screw up their combat system trying to make it either too complex or stylish.Towns are actually pretty damn good. Their designs are amazing, there's so many details and blends in perfectly with the setting of the game, the Steampunk style. It gives you a good feel for how the people are living, how the society is built up and whatnot. I cannot say the same about the clothing and weaponchoice for some characters, but that's hardly an issue. There are way more games that is just ridiculous about their choices of weapons, clothing and the likes (Final Fantasy X anyone?)Some other complaints I have is about the ""crafting"". Just like with the combat, it's really simple. But that's hardly the issue. In order to craft new weapons or augment/upgrade them, you need resources, right? Fair enough. You encounter resources by proceeding with the storyline. Everywhere. Literally. Since the game has moving enemy groups, it means you can skip those of you want to. But not resources, they're stuck in the walls. And they're everywhere. The game becomes more of a scavenger hunt than an RPG, simply because when you find one node you spot another one not too far away. And this goes on forever. To add salt to the injury, in order to craft you need an anvil. Also fair enough. BUT PLEASE GIVE ME AN ANVIL SO I CAN CRAFT, IT'S BEEN TWO HOURS OF GAMEPLAY SINCE I'VE SEEN THE LAST ONE JASJGLKAGLJDLHSKÖDLFJ....... I should also mention that if you just want to play for the storyline (which is actually pretty good, though some parts of the dialogue is quite... corny... and generic...) there's the skipable combat. Also, if you're worried about the experience needed for some of the of course mandatory boss fights, the creator(s?) has thought about that aswell. There are experience nodes scattered all around the map, just like with the resource nodes (wohoo, more scavenging!). These will yield you all the experience you'll need to safely pass the game on easy. And to add to that, during the game you can choose the difficulty you desire. There are three of them, depending on how hardcore and how casual you are.I can't say too much about the characters yet, because I haven't finished the game. But so far there hasn't been much development on many of the characters. We are introduced to them in different ways, but that's it. Only one of the characters has a solid introduction, aswell as history which we get to know but as I said, can't say too much yet. Graphics are average, the character has multiple ""sprites"" for facial and emotional expressions which was actually more than I hoped for. The design fits into the Steampunk setting aswell. Music... not quite sure what to say. I don't know if it's from one of the DLCs (I don't own any of the DLCs) or if it's composed by someone else but all I have to say is that... it's neglectable. It's so bland and generic, I don't think it would have mattered if it was there or not. Doesn't matter of it's symphonical (is that even a word lol), it doesn't fit.Conclusion, I'd say it's a below average RPG. It is well made in certain aspects, has a lot of thought put into it but the execution is not just there. It lacks so much to kick it up a notch and make it an unpolished gem. Doesn't matter how much of hard work is put into it, there room available for better performance, dialogue, combat system (my biggest complaint here), maps, NPCs (falls into dialogues) etc is just too great. Don't get me wrong, however. I am enjoying what I am playing and I will finish it. But the full price of the game for what you're getting is not worth it (bought it on sale). But if you want some casual time-killer, or inspiration for your own RPG game this is a good buy (only if it's on sale!).3½/10Edit: I've read a little on the Steam community for this game, and I noticed I might have missed a couple of things in this review, such as being able to use the cursor and whatnot (which is actually a cool feature). Despite of this, my opinion still won't change. You can make nice scripts, you can program a fully established battle system and make amazing designs but if you don't put it where it belongs it's a waste. I am however rooting for the next project, mistakes provides experience.			"

												Skyborn is a Steampunk styled, RPG Maker game with quite the enthralling story. This game was a nostalgic piece for me due to my love for RPG video games and Steampunk in general.The game takes roughly 7-8 hours to beat and is overall a really interesting game. I enjoyed many aspects of Skyborn, especially the combat machanics, the soundtrack, and the story. I won't spoil anything about the story, for I recommend that you should definitely play the game for the full experience. I must say, however, that the characters are very easy to get attached to. All of the characters have a personality of their own, and I found them quite charming and interesting. But, in regards to the soundtrack, each piece fit the mood whenever it was necessary. Of course, this is my own personal preference, and some may or may not feel satisfied with the soundtrack.The combat mechanics were easy to understand and very enjoyable. I was overjoyed when I realized that combat was unavoidable for most enemies. I've always disliked random encounters to a degree, and I truly love the option of avoiding or jumping into combat. I would fight some enemies in order to gain experience and eventually continue on when I believed I was ready for the next stage. The combat itself is turn-based and very strategic based on your playstyle. I'm a sucker for strategy-based systems, so the combat mechanics were some of the best I had seen in a long time.There are only a few cons I found within the game. I found the crafting somewhat cringeworthy due to the fact that I crafted  and bought some of the highest-level gear near the middle of the game. I soon found the crafting system to be somewhat miniscule due to the fact that I did not require it at all after I crafted 3rd tier armor and weapons. I understand that this could be because Skyborn is not a lengthy game, but this incident made this system, which was excellent in the beginning, seem almost useless near the end.Another con I found was the lack of backtracking. Once again, this is probably because the game is not lengthy. I somewhat expected a larger world with backtracking requirements here and there. The game has enough content to complete the story and satisfy the player, but it almost felt like the world was somewhat empty. I enjoy engrossing myself in the world of the characters in the game, so, when I'm limitted as to where I can go and what I can do, I question the condition and lore of the world as a whole. This is simply a personal arguement between me and other games. Other players may or may not feel the same way.In all, Skyborn is a wonderful game and I recommend it. I only wish that the game could be longer. If Skyborn was longer, perhaps the cons of the game would have vanish. However, I do highly recommend Skyborn because of its story, fascinating characters, and overall enjoyment. I guarantee that you will enjoy this game.			"

												I always have liked RPGs so when I saw this one on Steam I got surprised by the amount of positive reviews that it had so I decided to buy and play it: I enjoyed it so much, worth every cent I spent.What did I like:- The story, catches your attention- The length of the game, it's not as long as FF games so you can enjoy it on 2-3 days- The combat system, it's well designed and strategy based- Being able to save the game anywhere- Final bosses on hard mode, they are a great challenge (really, they are)What didn't I like:- I wasn't able to take Steam screenshots properly, so I had to use NVIDIA Shadowplay to take them- The game sets my screen to 640x480 when it's on full screen, I can't change it- Only four slots for game saves, and one more for autosave. I think I would have needed a couple more- There is a certain amount of monsters in the game, so this means the EXP and gold you can get it's limited by it- There are some unreachable chests/doors on the maps which are only accessible later on the story, but you don't know it so it can cause a few headaches			"

												An unexpectedly solid and fun jrpg. Even though it is super-linear and visits almost all of the jrpg tropes imaginable, it still comes out very, very sweet and satisfying. The combats are non-respawning (thank god!) fast and even avoidable, the character development is steady and satisfying, even if the enemies - with the exception of important fights - are mostly generic and forgettable.The interface comfortably supports both keyboard and mouse — one can sweep through the fights using keyboard quite fast.The game on the normal difficulty isn't hard at all, especially if one doesn't shy away from these fights to maximize the character stats.The game avoids the temptation of overly tricky labirynthine levels or crazy navigational quests, and the only minor level-design quips were visual and in the cities — ocassionally it's not immediately clear whether some area is accessible/walkable.All of the areas are quite atmospheric each in their own way - and the visuals with the music set the mood of each zone perfectly.

												Skyborn is a really nice RPGMaker game. Gameplay is fully combat-centered (there are no puzzles or choices that may impact the outcome of the story), battles are fair enough, visuals are pretty, story is interesting (although I feel it wasn't explored to its full potential) and the captivating characters are the best part of it (I honestly wouldn't mind playing some sort of sequel with the same cast, I feel like we didn't get enough of them!). I also really liked the augmenting system, which allows you to customise your gear as you please based on your resources. The game is also very straightforward, with only 2 or 3 sidequests (whether this is negative or positive is up to you). All in all, not an overachiever but still something you will have fun with. May be better to get it on sale depending on your currency though (R$28 is kinda pricey imo).			"

												This isn't the longest game in the world, not the most groundbreaking.  However, it tells a short, entertaining story well.  The addition of the ""threat"" mechanic to the basic turn-based combat makes for something interesting, and the story is interesting enough to hold your attention.On the downside, it's really not very long.  It will while away a few hours of entertaining JRPG style gameplay, but it's more of a short story than a novel.If you find it in a sale, I can heartily recommend it, but possibly not at full price.

												I really loved this game--right up until the final boss battle.I was playing on normal difficulty and I thought I was in a good position. I beat the second-to-last boss with some mild difficulty, but nothing too bad. Get to the final boss and it doesn't matter what I do, I can't win.Based on online reading, I need to go back and replay half the game (to get different classes) in order to fix my ""problem."" No thanks. As much as I enjoyed this game, I really don't want to replay half of it just to win the final battle. I'm done. This inconsistency/absurdity ruined the game for me.			"

												Its a fun little waste of time, I've sunk a few hours into it and it has kept me interested enough that I will continue to play it.  That said, it is severely lacking in comparison to many of the games you might have grown up with.  It is very linear, very easy, the story is pretty cookie cutter and the maps feel really phoned in as you progress through the game.  Balance was not a very high priority in this game as an unlucky critical can devistate your party and if not then the battle will be a cake walk.  There is a wierd system of resistances that bassically ammounts to a game of rock paper scisors based on your characters and the enemy type.  There is little variation in the packs you will encounter and less (aside from crits) randomness in the battles so you will simply have a winning pattern for each pack type.  Still, the game *is* fun, just simple and fairly standard.  If you want a little rpg action in a new setting this is for you.			"

												Skyborn is a simple 2D RPG reminiscent of 16-bit era JRPGs. The protagonist is Claret Spencer, a mechanic who gets caught up in a rebellion against the titular Skyborn, a winged humanoid race persecuting humans and, more prominently, the so-called ""half-breed"" crosses of humans and Skyborn.The story and characters are...simplistic, and if you play the game for them, you will probably be horribly disappointed. The production (visuals, audio) are nice, but nothing particularly noteworthy. Any saving grace would have to come from the gameplay...and that, in my experience, has been hit-and-miss.There was clearly attention paid to gameplay details, which I can respect. The classic RPG situation where three spells are useful and 50+ are useless is generally avoided. Some exploration is offered without being annoying, and a lot of weaponry and crafting options are available. On the other hand, very little explanation is given on matters like the str/agi/int stats, and enemy difficulty spikes horribly towards the end of the game without warning. Not to mention the relatively short length of the whole thing...I can only recommend this game on sale, if any of this interests you to begin with. At full price, there's certainly a lot more for your money available.			"

												Overall, Skyborn is a lot of fun to play and well worth the money.The effect of the early Final Fantasy games on the RPG genre is immense. That influence is felt very clearly in Skyborn. You can tell the makers of this game were inspired by Final Fantasy VI in particular. While some of the characters feel like they were lifted right out of FFVI, it's nowhere close to how World Heroes cloned Street Fighter.It lacks a clear writing style. The writing is strangly good at times and completely empty at others. It's almost like they were attempting to use different language patterns for the different characters (which would be great) but sometimes confused themselves with regards to who is speaking during the scripted events.The combat system is a wonderful reformulation of the standard turn-based systems with which any RPG player would be familiar. Yet, the one way Skyborn sets itself apart from other RPGs is in how it eschews constant combat by providing glowing experience ""crystals"" throughout the maps. These keep the story line moving forward, keeping the player on track for the next challenges without having to dedicate time specifically to leveling up characters. The drive to find these cheap experience locations also encourages exploration, which gives the player a chance to lose themself in the charming SNES-era graphics, complete with parallax scrolling effects to bring out the stratified society story line.If you ever enjoyed an SNES RPG, especially a Final Fantasy installment, you'll probably like this game.

												This game is a bit of a mixed bag, but if you're generally someone who wants to support RPG Maker game developers and try out a game that is pretty well put together, you might be interested in this title.For a RPG Maker game, the game uses a lot of the default settings, but adds onto it and makes the new ideas work, class trees being a big one; however, I generally found myself just obliterating all opposition by using blood magic and buffs, so most of the time boss battles really didn't feel that epic.  Its nice that the option is there, but overall combat in the game was rather easy, possibly too easy.The story of the game usually left me scratching my head.  For example, there's one point in the story where one of the bad guys does something bad, but the protagonist asks how the bad guy followed her and his reply is that he just tracked her good deeds.  But the player never sees her doing any good deeds like what he implies and you were really just running around in caves, so the excuse is just really bad and makes no sense.  It just threw me out of the story a bit, and there's a few moments like these where something odd breaks immersion.  It doesn't happen too often, and sometimes the game does a good job of telling a story where you do feel a bit invested, so it does try to make up for it.The game itself is a bit short.  I'd say you could probably beat this game in about 7~10 hours.  Meeting the final boss and quickly dispatching him sort of surprised me, because then the game was over.  I could tell though that some ideas were there to try to extend the length (since he didn't die too quickly), so I will give the makers credit there, but the game's difficulty sort of countered that.Overall, I'm not sure if I could fully recommend this game, a lot of the issues are pretty minor and not too destructive, but mainly the game's length and the difficulty of the game doesn't really warrant the current sale price (which is $14.99 as of this review) to me.  I would say get this game if you still want a simple story with good visuals, fairly varied combat, and a game made with RPG Maker that you want to support.  Mainly the last part, because for a RPG Maker game, this is pretty well done.			"

												Skyborn took me by surprise, not just because of the setting and the lush steampunk visuals, but the fun gameplay. The combat has a threat system that's not groundbreaking, but it adds a certain amount of strategy other than button mashing.For reviewers who complained about Skyborn not being an open world, it is not that kind of a game. This is a narrative-driven title where the player takes on the role of a surprisingly endearing female main character. I say surprising because JRPG females usually bore me to tears. Here, Claret is spunky, smart and has dialogue that actually made me smile. +The other party members are equally memorable, and their portraits really communicate their expressions well. +The story is also decent, predictable yet enjoyable, with a twist I did not see coming!+The game was short enough that it didn't outwear its welcome.+Exploration and gather resources is fun, if not indepth+I have to applaud the developers for NOT piling info dump on us, and letting the world and the dialogue describe the setting.Not So Good is what feels like an unexciting crafting system, and the story's tendency to remind the player of Skyborn prejudices again and again. Verdict: This is definitely a worthy buy! I actually found myself wishing I could explore the game more at the end. 8/10			"

												Despite the inherent limits of games made with RPGMaker, Skyborn is genuinely fun and it's clear that a lot of work went into making it.The story is fairly clichè, but is told in a charming way that will still make you care. The characters are likeable. The gameplay adds a few small twists to the classic old-school RPG formula (for example, you can change the difficulty at any time and you can avoid random mook battles). The art is pretty and the music is adeguate.One thing annoyed me: the game is not properly synchronized with Steam, so you can't take screenshots. In fact, the key that normally takes screenshots (F12) will reboot the game. Thankfully the game autosaves when you enter a new location!			"

Gameplay was very retro RPG, which, I usually tend to enjoy. Has a lot of undertones to it, and it reminds me a bit of FF4 and Chrono Trigger.There's a few bugs, but they aren't gamebreaking nor do they take away from the enjoyment. Only REALLY noticeable one was encountering a story mechanic on an airship that you haven't encountered yet and that's only because I was paying super close attention to it.RPG buffs will like it. Those who are looking for something new that reminds them of the old may also like it. Give it a shot.			"

												Disclaimer: I've only played through once, and bypassed some optional content.Pros:- Likeable and interesting characters.- Solid music and graphics.- You may typically choose whether and when to fight monsters, which is nice.- Good replayability: optional content (""Side Quests""), multiple class paths for each character, achievements, and three difficulty levels.Cons:- The threat mechanic, while innovative, seems...out of place in turn-based combat.- Difficulty levels, while appreciated in theory, are wildly under/over-tuned in practice.- It's almost as if some achievements were added for the express purpose of inducing rage in completionists: they are nearly impossible without cranking the difficulty right down, or -- where that isn't possible for the achievement -- having a certain class composition. While I appreciate the notion of using the right tools for the job, in a game with permanent class choices this is not good design, in my opinion.- No WASD support.- The story ends rather suddenly, and predictably.Verdict: despite its weaknesses, RPG fans should enjoy this one! 7/10			"

Venture into a charming steampunk world, as a strong-willed airship mechanic named Claret.Skyborn is a very pleasant RPG. It features a unique and likable set of characters, witty dialogue, a lovely soundtrack, and a delightful albeit slightly predictable story, all bundled up in 5-10 hours of gameplay. It is simple and has difficulty settings, so rookies to the genre can enjoy it just as much as a seasoned RPG veteran.One of the best qualities of Skyborn is that there is no grinding required. There’s no need to run around for hours. The monster encounters are well paced, yet the story moves along without feeling rushed. I got this in a bundle, and for the length of the game, the regular price does seems a little steep. I’d recommend picking it up on a bit of a sale. All in all, it’s a cute, fun, and simple RPG. Pick it up if you want something short and sweet. "

												Games designed with RPG Maker often get a lot of hate, due to the overall simplicity of the (basic) engine and the rate of sheer garbage that gets pushed out by wannabe game developers who have absolutely no idea what they're doing. But not all RPG Maker games are bad - just look at Skyborn.   It's certainly not perfect. It's a little rough around the edges, there's a few minor mapping errors here and there, there's a couple glitches, and the game balancing isn't the best... but it's okay. The overall mapping is beautiful and well designed, as are the graphics themselves which are largely custom made, featuring only a few of the basic RTP assets that come with RPG Maker. The music is all custom as far as I know, and is actually rather good. My only complaint is that none of the music loops for some reason, it just fades out and starts over. Gameplay-wise, it's pretty solid, if unbalanced. It uses a variant of the Charge Turn Battle System (the one from Final Fantasy X), which is in my opinion one of the best battle systems available for RPG Maker. All of your party members are decided by plot progression, and you have very little control over what skills and spells they learn (only decided by two class change events partway through the game, which change which skills you will learn), but you rarely feel like you're lacking in skill variety, and most of your skills are actually useful in one way or another. You've got an offensive fighter, a tank, a healer, an offensive debuffer and a sort of battle-mage, and each party member fills their purpose pretty well, except for maybe Sullivan, the tank, who does a great tanking job, but lacks any real offensive options at all. The main twist of the battle system is the Threat system, which brings MMO-style aggro into a turn-based RPG, where your party member's actions will determine how likely they will be to be attacked. But other than that, it's a pretty standard system, with a very heavy focus on managing buffs, debuffs and threat. Story-wise, it's a pretty standard rebels-against-the-empire story, with a few little twists and turns. If you like the Steampunk setting, you'll like Skyborn, since it's all about steam engines and airships and stuff like that. All in all, I'd recommend Skyborn. It's a pretty good JRPG-styled game on a platform with very few good games of the genre. It took me about 12 hours to beat the game, and I did pretty much everything there was to do (to my knowledge), so it's not a huge time investment, but it's fun while it lasts.			"

												I really enjoyed Skyborn, which was a nice mix of a pseudo-Steampunk aethetic, genuinely likeable characters, and a story that feels like a smaller-scale version of one of my favorite old-school RPGs Suikoden (more directly Suiko 2). I think the word that most aptly describes the game is ""charming."" The storyline -- a character gets swept up in events beyond their control and ends up joining a rebellion against tyrants -- is one I'm a total sucker for and when you combine that with a female main character, well, I'm sold. This is an RPG-maker game, so you can't expect fantastic graphics (though I thought the character designs were well-done) and Skyborn does have some faults. First of all, the controls can be fairly finicky and I found myself having to switch from keyboard controls (arrow keys) to my mouse (or vice versa) to navigate dungeons. Secondly, Skyborn desperately needs a map function. I spent right around nine hours playing the game and at least two of those hours were spent wandering dungeons aimlessly as I was lost. I appreciated that the dungeons were expansive and even included navigation puzzles but if you're going to do that you've gotta include some sort of map function so the player isn't retreading the same ground. And speaking of maps, a few of the city maps were full of needless obstacles that were more irritating than anything. Finally, as much as I enjoyed the game, I think it's a little over-priced (I bought it on sale). $15 seems a bit much for a 10 hour game, especially when they could have easily added more content in terms of deeper characterization, character backstories, and lore. But if you can catch Skyborn at $10 or less, you like old school RPGs, or want to support developers that create interesting female leads -- definitely worth the money!			"

												At present time the game gives me no sound whatsoever. I haven't been able to work out a fix, or find one online.Additionally, the developer seems to be ignoring the Steam discussion pages where folks are asking for help with black screen and game sound bugs.I'd like to be able to play this rpg but, until I actually can, I give it a thumbs down.

												This game reminds me of classic rpgs like final fantasy 4 and etc , it revolves about the story of a young mechanic who suddenly gets her life turn around when she loses her home , her job and her freedom and has several encounters with the skyborns the superior race or so they say.Enemy encounters are shown on the map so you can either skip them or fight them all for the enjoyement of fighting hard enemies , there's an arena and secret bosses to fight which are quite difficult to beat specially the one near the end of the game , you can also advance classes with two branches.This game will get you in one or another way , either because of the character arts , deep story involving the true of the races , or even just the nostalgia of this kind of games.Buy it if you like rpgs , but might want to wait for a sale			"

												This is the game that renewed my faith in RPG Maker games. It's got that gritty steampunk shine, a good story, likeable characters and reminds me of a time when RPGs had stories that weren't convoluted with forced deep meaning and abstract elements. Skyborn tells the story of a young vagabond mechanic who steals an airship after she is sold off to marry some rich snob. Soon they are joined by a vibrant cast of characters who help them on their quest to save the world. That about sums up the game. It seems to be just the right length and battle environments are never mindnumbingly long. Now while the majority of games like this tend to be on the long side I spent about 10 - 12 hours playing and that's because I couldn't find one of the quests. If there's anything the game could work on it's the quest system. Sure there's a quest menu and that alludes to where you go next but I got confused on where to go for one of the NPC side quest. None of this is consequential for finishing the game but I try to be as complete as possible. The battle system was also simple enough that at the harder setting required a bit of strategy. I've still yet to conquer the bosses on hard mode yet. I fear that would require a lot of grinding to reach those levels. Overall this game was a delight to play and I definitely felt like it was money well spent and the developer put a lot of thought into this title.			"

												Just finished playing through this game. Logged 10 hours on it with searching most areas. It is very well created giving just enough control to the player to feel important, yet not giving options everywhere so you sit thinking over the best option for 5-10 minutes trying to get the best outcomes. The story is certainly a good one and I wish there was more to it. I'm a 90s kid so I enjoyed the game play which is much like an old gameboy game with a top down view of the map which is layered over a background image. There are only 5 characters for your party and the equipment in game is not much varied but really you basically get exactly what you need with only having to choose the fight style of each character. Tip: When you get the apples, use them. They work for the whole party. I sat on my first one till I got the second one cause I thought it was only for one character.A great game to pass the time. I already wanted more of the game, but perhaps it ended with just the right amount of playthrough so it didn't get old before the final boss.P.S. Anyone figure out what beating Saerhel gets you? She is rediculously difficult...Also, I want to know about the Cloaked Man in the end scene.			"

												An incredibly fun, if short, RPG that has incredible potential.Length - 2/5The game lasts maybe 6-13 hours per run, assuming you explore the massively huge areas that you get.  Unfortunately, you only have a handful of areas to explore, and the game itself feels a little short.Content (Dangerous zones) - 4/5Although you only have a few areas to work with in the game, each zone is HUGE.  One zone takes maybe an hour or two to actually explore every nook and cranny of it.  Not only that, you are rewarded for exploring the huge areas (that you can also easily get lost in) with small consumables to ore for crafting to ultimate armor and weapons.  Each zone is beautifully and realistically made just for its terrain alone.  In addition to the beautiful zones, there are appropriate lighting effects to really add to their flavor.Unfortunately, the variety of monsters, their formations, and skill splash feel painfull average.  Although you don't face the same three enemies over and over again, you also don't face very many different enemies in random battles.  Some of them, sadly, only have one or two skills to take note of.Content (Safe zones) - 5/5The towns and villages in this game are incredibly made with vibrant NPCs from start to finish.  The lighting effects, incredibly beautiful terrain, and heartwarming NPCs bring life to these massive towns.  There are also rewards for exploring towns through exploration nodes (grants exp) and some small items.Balance (Early game + Mid game) - 4/5Not too rough; not too easy.  Just the perfect blend.  Random battles don't take too long, but they aren't excruciatingly long either.Balance (End game) - 2.5/5Unfortunately, the balance is heavily skewed when nearing the end of the game.  2 or 3 characters start dealing insane amounts of damage while the others are unable to provide significant contribution to DPS.  In addition, random enemies and bosses start to hit you with insane AoE damage (and healing doesn't seem perfectly tuned with that).  It doesn't help that some characters can take out most end game boss's (not optional but mandatory) HP bars to 25% with one skill.  Overall, this part of the game, combat wise, seems to be a little rushed or trying its best to cope with its new conditions (no spoilers, but it should be obvious which party member I'm talking about).Lore - 3.5/5The lore of the game felt interesting, and it hinted at a bigger depth than what the game actually provided with us.  Unfortunately, the depth and significant parts of the lore felt slammed onto the player near the end of the game with little to no mention in the first parts of it.  Lore was great; execution was a little sloppy.Plot - 5/5In the short time in the game, I constantly felt excited to keep the plot rolling.  There was little time for resting, and I knew that every action my party did was significant to their cause.The premises were amazing, if a bit cliche.  It can be summarized generally in a sentence: The Skyborn, conquerers of the world, are imprisoning all half-breeds (half Skyborn and half Human), and a small group of rebels want to stop this injustice.

												After the sheer joy I had (for the most part) with their previous game ""Deadly Sin 2"", I figured I'd finally sit down and give this game a go, as it had been sitting in my Steam library for a long, long time after I'd bought it for a couple of bucks during a huge sale. Let me say, boy, had I paid full price for this game, I'd be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. This game is SHORT. My playtime at completion is 5.4hrs, an hour of which was almost defintely spent AFK with the game running. Could I have done all the side quests? Of course, but the real issue here is the point of no return is just sprung on you out of nowhere. Imagine this, you're playing the game, greatly enjoying the story, then suddenly out of the blue you get notified that ""you can't turn back from here"" and you're thinking ""surely just for this quest, right?"". Well no, literally before you know it, the game is just over, and it feels rushed. For the content this game has to offer, I feel that the $14.99 price tag is vastly overpriced, but if you manage to get it 50% off or more, then its a decent bargain. So, why am I giving the game a positive rating? For that exact reason, I got it on sale. Most things the game does, it does well. A fair amount of new things were added or fixed from Deadly Sin 2:- You can augment gear while wearing it this time around, instead of having to unequip it first, which was a huge pain.- Carries over the same quest system/log, that I found to be a nice touch in DS2.- Crafting your own gear.- Visible enemies on the map. No more random encounters every 6 seconds.- ""Mining"" resources for crafting/augmenting gear.- Option to disable the mouse.- Actually has Steam achievements.- Job branches (Pro Tip: Sniper is grossly overpowered).Aside from being short, there aren't a whole lot of things to complain about, but here are a few:- When crafting, you can't see how many items you actually have to craft with. A bit irritating!- Items/Spell names are almost exactly the same from DS2. This just feels super lazy to me.- Characters no longer visible during battle like they were in DS2. Now you just have character ""cards"".Overall, I feel the story here is much better than ""Deadly Sin 2"", and there was SOOOOO much missed potential with this game in terms of plot development and lore exploration. TLDR: Buy it on a super sale and you'll enjoy it for an afternoon/evening.Sidenote: If you even remotely want a challenge, I'd suggest playing on hard and not upgrading your classes from the ones you start with, though even then the game is probably still too easy.

												With all the big titles around, games like this are way too often overlooked. Sometimes i just feel the need to dwell a bit in the past and search for a classic RPG-Maker game to play. The advantage of these type of games are that they don't rely on convincing with graphics, but rather on story and gameplay. And this one didn't disappoint me in the slightest.What i liked on SkybornStory & CharactersTake Claret, a rough-acting but soft-hearted Airship mechanist, on her journey to see the world, reveal the truth of the past and to fight the oppression of the Skyborns (the winged masterrace). The characters that you unlock while advancing are all from different backgrounds and are well appealing and authentic.AtmosphereI really liked the Steampunk setting with classic Fantasy elements. The music was really nice and fitting. Although this is a RPG Maker game, you get surprised by some nice Artwork later on in the game.Exploring & Character developmentAlthough the Story is linear the Devs added the ""Exploration Nodes"" that give xp and are hidden at places you won't visit when rushing through the maps. Beside that there are a lot of treasures to find so exploring is a featured part of this game. At 2 points in the game, you have the opportunity to choose from 2 paths, each unlocking different skills for all heroes.Through the game you will pass some areas that have gems on their walls that you can use to craft yourself gear or augment it with bonus stats. In general, there are lots of options to equip your team and augment it with items depending on your playstyle. Beside that there are a few sidequests and an Arena that give you additional bonuses when finishing. I strongly suggest to visit every corner of this game as another task is to collect all 13 Spades cards that are mostly hidden in chests through the whole game. Finishing this will open you a special zone in the venom depths with special loot once you defeated it's keepers.FightingEach character has skills to deal damage and support the group which leaves room for different playstyles overall. This game is heavily built around the Stat ""Speed"" which determines the order you are able to do actions in fight. Each character has a stat called ""Build (BLD)"" that, once you pass the value, slows you down in fights. So make sure you pay attention which items you equip. The fights itself use a interesting ""Threat"" System which determines which hero will be attacked by the enemy (at least the single target spells/attacks). You augment your threat value when dealing damage or killing an enemy. I adore that you see the enemies on the map so in case you want to advance faster, you can simply avoid the fights. The bossfights all have a twist so thinking and elaborating a strategy is needed in order to defeat them.Interface & MenuThe menu is well-arranged and simple to use. I love the option to deactivate the mouse which gives me the true RPG feeling. You are able to save at any given point of the story, aswell as changing the difficulty whenever you feel it's needed - two options i miss at so many games nowadays.Things, neither good nor badDifficulty differenceAlthough beeing away from classic RPGs for many years i didn't have major problems to beat the game on hard difficulty overall. However at some points the normal fights went like a breeze on hard before advancing to a boss that crushed me completely (Sanddozer comes in mind). God bless that you are able to change the difficulty at any point :)  No mapSince this game is quite linear, this option wasn't really needed. But i just sometimes felt a bit lost in the city or when looking for the right merchant, especially at the start.English onlyNot a problem for me, but might be for others.Nobody is perfectStats & Elements not explainedI couldn't find any information ingame concerning the benefits of the ground stats Strenght, Intelligence and Agility. Apparently Strenght determines the damage of the normal attacks, Intelligence determines the damage of all special abilities/skills and Agility increases Evasion and Critical-Hit chance. Apart from the classic physical and magical damage they added the ""Tech"" element/damage. What was a bit troublesome for me is that there was no information which element worked good or bad against the other elements. That left me often with no clue in fights and i had to use the try & error method. Working with resistance on items was at that point a non-factor for me. For enemy attacks you have the possibility to check your own skills (if alrdy unlocked) to see which element it is based and which resistance skill you have to use in case. Buffs don't stack in fightWhen supporting your Team with skills it sometimes happend that 3 Heroes lost a buff after 5 rounds and the 4th still had it on for another turn. When using the same skill again to get the buff up for all Heroes it could happen, that the 4th still lost the buff the round after (since he was alrdy affected from the first buff and the renewed buff didn't apply). The half MP cost didn't stack aswell i think. So when having equipped a ""half MP cost"" item and getting a half MP cost buff from a party member, the spell still costs only half MP and not a quarter of the initial Value.Undo augmentingWhen entering the last stages of the game, make sure to correctly use special augments, like the Spark of Creation, as you are only able to get the base item back when removing augments in case you misused them. The augment itself will be destroyed.Minor thingsWhile you see a speechbubble to accept sidequest you don't have a sign to complete them. So make sure you remember which NPC gave the quest to you. The amount of the same Item is capped at 20 in your inventory, so make sure that you sell gold nuggets for example before you have 20 of them as you need the gold to equip for the last stage of the game :) Also i sometimes had the impression that some augments (Drakonic Tear) and items (Heal Potion that seemed to heal the HP % of the guy who used it, not on whom you used it) didn't work as intended in the description but nothing gamebreaking at all.SuggestionsThis game makes the most fun on hard difficulty as the fights are mostly challenging but doable and equip matters. Use the normal Augments when you get them. Explore everything as the game rewards you for it. This game is also nice for achievement completionists as they are not grindy and well doable. For that goal i recommend to use the different savefiles the game offers on these points of the game to come back on a later stage if you wanna advance in the story: - When meeting your 5ft party member and she starts to talk about her past at the campfire (Trial of Arms which needs to be finished above 30 mins to unlock the achievement - The ingame reward is truly worth completing it)- When finishing the Venom depths and the Spades Cards Special Zone before spending the gold and augments to start the final part of the game. This allows you to try others items in case you face problems defeating the Endbosses on hard- When meeting Saehral for the 2nd time in the last part of the game in order to defeat her on hardIn general, the discussion hub on steam is full of helpful topics if you ever encounter problems in this game and the devs are still looking and responding from time to time which is a good sign they care about the game and the people playing it. Despite the few flaws this game has, i had a lot of fun and was encouraged to squeeze the best out of my heroes in order to finish the game on hard. If you have additional questions or suggestions i'll happily answer them in the comment section.Thanks for reading! "

												Bought this game because I wanted to see how an RPGMaker game would deal with steampunk. I must say it is beautiful and well-made. The setting is wonderous, the NPCs great, and the creatures... interesting. The game starts with Claret Spencer, the protagonist, having her world ripped out from under her, and deciding to do something... exceedingly rash. And well... that goes about as well as one woudl expect, thrusting her into the greater world and into a fight against an oppresive species. And maybe, she'll find love along the way.			"

												I enjoyed this rpg game very much. The music reminded me of favorite rpg games in the past, and it just has that crisp relaxing feeling, where you sit back, relax, and experience everything with a smile step by step.I am now collecting 'Dancing Dragon Games' games, especially the new one that recently released. Wonderful. =)Edit: I thought i would give new players a heads up as to what happened to me, which can happen to anyone in any game.  While enjoying the game, before I knew it, I was facing the final boss, and my lack of knowledge overall on gear upgrades and many places I missed for better gear caused me to fail in the end.While reading a boss guide, I was more than happy to play the game over again and finding out that i was missing out on much more of the game. In the end I accomplished greatly in finishing the game, even on a solid HARD mode. I would not call it a spoiler at all in my case.Hopefully this guide helps anyone enjoy the game more.

												This game was pretty fun and is the first good RPG maker game I've played that wasn't done by Freebird.  Here are a few things that stuck out to me:PROS:-lots of polish. plenty of little animations and cinematics that make the game feel more immersive. The character thumbnails are drawn with multiple different facial expressions to be used when appropriate, etc.-characters and writing are both very good. I really enjoyed the dialogue and the storytelling had me really interested in what was happening just minutes into the game. The story isn't groundbreakingly original persay, but I did really enjoy it, and the execution was very good. I felt genuinely interested and invested in what was going on in the Skyborn world all the way through the end.-good combat mechanics - I really had to think about how I was going to equip my characters  and what actions to choose in a battle.CONS- bit pricy. I thought it was worth it personally, but it only took me 15 hours to beat, and a dollar per hour of gameplay seems a lot higher than most games on the market.- very linear. no worldmap to move around on, and only a handful of towns. I usually enjoy games that are more on the linear side, so this will be a bigger con to some people than it is to me.- you'll have to look up the stats online to figure out what they do, or you'll be somewhat blind in choosing how to augment your equipment. As another  reviewer is saying, it's not explained and it's not obvious. Even knowing a little bit, I never quite knew whether I was making the best choices with my equipment, and I made lots of costly mistakes that I couldn't undo without reverting to a save.- enemies wander on the map instead of having random encounters. This would be fine, but when you kill them, they never come back, so if there's a way to grind in this game, I never figured out what it is, which is really frustrating since I couldn't figure out how I was supposed to beat the next guys at the colluseum. I just wasn't strong enough and had no idea how to get stronger. I suppose I could've looked online, but I really prefer to avoid walkthroughs if I can.Overall, excellent game. Engaging story, lovable characters, fun combat, and just the sort of retro RPG experience I was looking for.			"

												It is clearly a love story to the classic role-playing games of yore, yet unique with respect to its ideas and mechanics.

												Preface: It appears, Dancing Dragon Games, developed Deadly Sin as their first commercial release.  Deadly Sin II came shortly after. Their latest, steam available title, is Skyborn. If you play all three games, you will noticed that the underlying battle mechanic and misc. scripts have changed very little between the three. The largest change being the simplification of skill advancement, and the 'GUI' in the battle scene. But the crafting (augments), threat system, etc... All pretty much identical.TL,DR version:Skyborn isn't all that different from its predecessors Deadly Sin I & II, but it is different EXACTLY where it matters the most. I am referring to the story of course... If you've played the other two games and fought a single battle, you've played Skyborn's as well. While it  may look different, battles really aren't in any measurable sense. However, Skyborn has a far superior story line. While it has a few pacing issues that DS1 didn’t suffer (IMO), it is FAR better packaged, along with accompanying graphics and music. This game plays like an interactive movie... A 'B' movie with almost no budget, but respectable movie none the less. This strength outweighs its flaws to where I will recommend it, even to non RPG Maker enthusiasts.  Pro:- The Intro is GREAT. (First hour or so)The main character is well spoken, and has very HUMAN reactions (as opposed to typical JRPG tropes) to the nature of her circumstance. The camera movement, NPC introductions, and 'framing' of the events, that sweep you off into an adventure, are spot on. This is without a doubt the best written intro to ANY RPG Maker game to date. (IMO) It is a BIG reason why I recommend it.- Unlike Deadly Sin, the maps are pretty & reasonably designed.One of my biggest gripes with RPGMaker games is the haphazard nature of their maps... And while this developers previous games have been above average (in presentation) they were quite 'typical' in floor plan. Until Skyborn. Yes, it is still very linear, but there aren't nearly as many pointlessly long hallway dead ends, nor inexplicable road blocks.  Con:- Difficulty Spikes.Ugh... UGH!! ARGHAHH!!!!! Why is this so difficult for RPG Maker developers to get even SLIGHLY balanced?!?(Read my Deadly Sin review if you want to read my small rant)- One collection side quest - time sink.A flower collecting side quest... /sigh The reward wasn't even worth it... Not in the slightest.- This is Deadly Sin, re-skinned with a new story...If it wasn't such an improvement over the previous titles, this would have counted for more, and likely caused me to not recommend the game... It screams laziness.  It wouldn't be so bad if the game was LONGER and BETTER BALANCED for its complete repeat of the guts of the DS titles. But it's NOT. It actually feels shorter... though that may simply be my bias.(Yes I realize that they made the transition to a newer RPG Maker tool set... It's still no excuse.)Wrap Up:If you liked the Deadly Sin series. Buy this one without hesitation. Even at the MSRP. It was that enjoyable for me. However, if you are NOT a fan of RPG Maker games... This is worth the discounted price IMO. As long as you understand you are not buying a balanced game with satisfying combat. You are buying an interactive novel with a reasonably well done story. That also happens to have JRPG levels of grind.			"

												The Good: Story is compelling enough to keep you interested even if the characters are a little 2d personality wise.A threat system that will make MMO players a little more comfortable.The maps, oh the maps, visually pleasing, just challenging enough, but most of all they give you a real thrill to explore.   In a lot of these games I can easly predict which way is the treasure  and which way is the exit.  With this game I found myself exploring maps. Two tumbs up here.The Bad:Short:  I did unessisary grinding, exploration and all the side quests and still finished at under  hours on my first playthrough.Almost 0 replay value: not even a + game option to let you play through again with all your stuff intact.  If you want to play through again you gotta lose all you've don so far and start fresh.  This is made worse by the shortness of the game itself.Crafting:  Normally a plus in this game it's a minus because it is pointless.  9 times out of 10 you are better off selling off the crafting materials and buying the gear that you need in the next town since it is the same stuff you would have crafted anyway and the money you get will go further than if you had made the gear instead of buying it.Side Quests:  I found around 3 of them and I feel confident that I explored enough to say that is close to if not all there are.  If your going to have side quests have a bunch otherwise just skip them.  Much like crafting it felt like they added them out of a sense of duty than out of a real desire to have them be part of the game.The Ugly:  The limited number of side quests and crafting options combined with the shortness of the story makes me think DLC.   I hope I'm wrong but the game feels more like a framework that they are planning to add a ton of DLC to flesh out rather than just give us the whole thing from the start.In short good game for under 10 bucks but full price isn't worth it.

												Skyborn is another RPGMaker game, as To the Moon, the strength of this game are the story & storytelling. The Story is about that the Skyborns, who rule over humans and hunt down half breads. Nobody knows why, but you'll find out and fight along friends you meet through the story to victory.The gameplay is very simular to a classic JRPG, you can choose if you want to battle monsters or try dodge, the monsters and avoid a fight and missing out on the XP. However there are XP bonuses all around the world, which stop you from getting underleveled. Then in combat you won't see any animation/action, like old RPG's you'll just see the sprite of the monster and see the screen shaking if damage is dealt.Overall if you are ok with the gameplay you can a enjoy a nice steampunk/fantasy world, with interesting and beatiful environments.

												this game had so much potential. It starts out amazing. visually so much work was put in. for an RPG maker game, it has good music and great graphics.... but the battles are in the old style where you only see your enemies and not your characters, which is ok, but since everything else looks amazing I expected better...but where this game really fail is everything else. the battle system... makes no sense. There's no progression, no point to even fight any battles and no skills to learn (you get items that ""upgrade your entire characters class"" instantly learn all new skills). The battle are skipable yet super easy you destroy everything instantly. after 1-2 hours of gameplay you are over powered, yet the bosses still destroy you. its just not playable, not fun. its as if no one tested the battle and gameplay. they just made the game look amazing and then rushed it. its a very short game and there is no point to level and no sense of battle progression. that RPG feel is NOT there.and the story is short and unrewarding also. If you like classics like final fantasy, you will not get that type of progression and gameplay. sorry, not worth it. i have no idea why there are so many positive reviews. playing this game more than 1 hour you will see it just sucks.

												So I want to start by saying I have not finished this game, nor do I plan to. Overall, it's not a bad game, really. It has a few hiccups here than there you come to expect from indie games such as collision detection issues. For a game created in RPG maker, its really nice. I also noticed when I was dual wielding pistols, and one was very weak the other very strong, but they both hit for the same damage. I don't know if they just calculate the formula then split it that way, or if its really only taking into account one; this was an annoyance when testing weapons. The game itself was pretty fun, I enjoyed the crafting and augmenting system a good deal, the story was pretty nice, and the characters were all solid. It had one major factor that ruined it for me: the difficulty.As i said I havent finished this game, so maybe it gets harder; but I am currently 2 hours into it, and have yet to have any party member die nor have I felt the need to use an item. After two hours I feel I should have something to think about, but instead I have a character with 3 AoEs that an pretty much wipe the map (and this is with pretty bad weapons) and a tank that can always hold aggro and never dies. The bosses are laughably easy, I dont think any of them have brought any of my characters below 80% health. Aside from the mobs being horrendously easy, there is also never a point where you are in danger. All the mobs you can simply ignore and walk past, no line of sight or anything to really worry about, so anytime you are low on health you can just go to one of the various healing points (which are free) and heal up. Their is usually one somewhere in a dungeon, so if you wanted you could go in between every mob you fight. The mobs also don't respawn (not a big deal, since you will never find yourself needing to grind) which is just a personal annoyance of mine. I even gimped myself a bit, i began to not augment things and not really buy any upgrades; hell, two of my characters didn't even use all their gear slots, and I still had no worry at all. If you want a casual game to walk through with a decent story, by all means pick up this game. Just expect to kill all the mobs using the same tactic and never having a real challenge out of it.			"

												Skyborn is a little J-RPG made with RPG-maker, but don't look down on it, every single of its components is well-crafter, be it the musics, the pictures, the combat system or the story. Even given it's ""short"" duration (10-15 hours), it's worth the full price. I'd rather spend 15 hours playing an awesome game than 30 hours an average game for the same price.			"

												Very fun retro RPG! It's a classic story of rebellion set in a steampunk world. Pros:* No random battles to annoy you - instead, it uses a Lufia mechanic, where the monsters move around the map, and the battles only trigger if you run into them. * The battle mechanic itself is interesting too: there's a concept of ""Threat"", and the party member with the highest amount of Threat will be targeted for all enemy attacks, which makes it easy to designate a ""tank"" for receiving the brunt of the damage (all but AoE). It gets tricky, though, when your DPS characters start dealing out considerable amounts of damage, and thus, increasing their own Threat. It often begs the decision whether your DPS character should kill an enemy and receive the bulk of the Threat (and the full force of the next enemy attack), or do something else and let that enemy live to attack one more time, but give your tank an opportunity to rebuild their Threat.* The game rewards exploration by way of ""exploration points"" - free XP just for exploring the map.* There are plenty of secret treasures to be found in the game! Completing the few hidden (and not so hidden) optional highly-challenging bosses and dungeons will result in great rewards.Cons:* Doesn't support the Steam overlay (Shift+Tab).Overall, with full completion, this game took me about 12 hours to beat. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it.			"

												 I enjoyed the time I spent with Skyborn, its a lovely looking game and the soundtrack is fabulous and really sets the scene. The characters are interesting and have enough depth to allow you to pick a favourite. Claret in particular is well written, funny and an enjoyable protagonist to play. Non party characters do tend to be extremly 1 dimensional though.The combat can get a bit boring but Skyborn doesn’t have random battles, instead battles are represented by a monster wondering about on the map, so you can avoid them if you want and xp is earned by exploring as well as from battles so I never felt like I had to battle or else lose out on xp.And while the story does have some plot holes, it is interesting and keeps your attention throughout the game.So, I’m recommending Skyborn, especially for those that enjoyed the early Final Fantasy games,but you might want to wait for a sale as it is a short enough game. I completed pretty much everything and got it finished in 10 hours and others seem to have gotten it finished in much shorter times.			"

												Since this is a lesser known game I will give a slightly more indept review.  Story - Meh, it's interesting enough to keep you occupied but nothing particularly special.Characters - Good, they all have their unique quirks and have interesting interactions with each other but this is hampered by the game's brevity.Music - Meh. The battle music and the ambient music of most areas is somewhat memorable, the rest is forgettable.Gameplay - Very Good.  Considering it's an RPG Maker game, the battle mechanics are pretty interesting with the implementation of threat and each character is designed to have a specific role.  However, it does get boring after a while since most dungeons are the same kind of deal.Overall - Good but slightly meh. It's worth exactly one playthrough. Have fun!			"

												I just finished the game, and I must say it was more than I thought.  The game follows humans and half-breed who are trying to rebel against a tyranny, the Skyborn.  At the beginning, you don't really know who is who, but in the end you find out how all three factions relate to each other and what went wrong.The game play is quite good.  Most of the time, you move the group around by manipulating one of the characters, the others automatically follow.  The combat system takes a few tries to figure out what to do, but then I learned to love how combat worked.  Each character has a default attack, plus skills to use during combat.  They also have access to a few items.  Just attacking will get your group killed.  You need to have the characters work together to defeat strong foes.  For example, one of the characters, Claret, does tech attacks.  Another character can lower an enemy's tech resistance.  So first you lower the resistence, and then you attack.  While that mean the character lowering the resistence doesn't do an attack, the resulting damage adds up to more in the end.The storyline is well thought out, the characters are interesting, and the plot might leave you thinking.  Overall, I loved playing Skyborn and I recommend this game to anyone who likes playing RPGs.			"

												I had great fun with Skyborn. It's an old-style RPG with a grand adventure, turn-based battles, and dungeons to explore.Heard it all before? Well, Skyborn stands out from the crowd as one of the most focused and enjoyable games in its genre.In particular:- Good music. Uplifting, drives you forward, and doesn't get in the way. Absolutely as good as the big-budget RPGs.- Great variety of locations and atmosphere. This game is only 8-9 hours long (exploring everything, on normaly difficulty) - but you'll see as much variety as you'd expect from a 40-hour game. It's not just palette swaps, either.- No filler - see above. The length is short but the story's still all there.- No grinding: it's not even possible. If you want to make the game easier (or harder), you can change the difficulty level.- No random battles. The enemies are all visible on-screen. Most of them can be avoided, if you wish to; and once they're dead, they're gone. This means you can finish exploring the dungeons without a battle every 15 metres.In short, this is an RPG that's very respectful of your time. I would have liked to see a few more sidequests, and a little more interaction with the environment (if I walk past a piano, I expect to be able to play it) - but mostly, I'd like to see a sequel.

The game as a whole is very easy on normal untill you want to play hard then it requires much more time and thinking to get past some of the boss fights but if you farm enough you shouldnt have a problem with any of the fights.

												I am surely late to the party. Anyhow, let me comment on this game I played til the end.You shall expect a game that looks and feels like a menu driven JRPG game made twenty or thirty years ago. Except that it might be slightly unfocused. I was expecting a more thorough story and probably more elaborate mechanics in place.Technically, the game looks good in most places. Steampunk artwork is nice, fantasy artwork is so and so. It does not support gamepads, and mouse support seems odd. Click to move is not intuitive and combat menus are aligned per character, so the mouse pointer will travel a lot. There is the odd situation where a combat menu might be hard to recognize due to the busy monster portrait.Music has a punch. Its transition from battle music to world music is sharp and correct. I remember one world music that starts with some drums.Getting back to the mechanics, let me cite a few ones. You start with one that is the forge. You can create items for each character, including the fifth character in the party hours before it is available. There is no indication on what exactly you are going to create, or even if it is random or not. Apart from forging, you can augment weapons. Think of a 1 slot augmentation, with previous augments being lost forever. There are town shops, but these are not very useful most of the time, as you usually have better gear or a lot of currency. Characters do have an extra stat that is how much weight they can carry on equipped gear. Other games do restrict items per class, and that would not be too bad here. Not so here. Your magical user may equip the heaviest of armor if you so desire, at the possible penalty of being slow in combat. The thing is, the game does not tell warn you if the gear is too heavy. You need to get into the status screen in order to check that.The story is OK, with no special highlights for me. There are, at least, no annoying characters. Exposition on various themes is somewhat short. It is usually concentrated in few sentences, all given at the same time.I will only recommend the game to anybody that likes old-style JPRGs. Skyborn is a nice game, but it is too anchored in the past to me.			"

												Lovely game if you're into RPGs. The story and characters are fun with a mix of steampunk and fantasy. Can be played in 1-2 days. The only downside was, that the game crashed a lot when I played it, though other people don't seem to have had that issue, so it might be my system.			"

												It's a beautiful little RPGMaker game, visually wonderful and interesting, makes good use of assets both new and familliar.The turn-based combat is very satisfying. Interesting to wrap your head around, and really does kick your butt every once in awhile. The strongest part is the focus on managing a ""Threat"" system that's basically enemy aggro, and it's consistently interesting to try to sequence and control the battle to manage it properly.The story isn't wolrd-shattering, but I definitely enjoyed it- it has its slower points, and some plot points feel a bit half-baked, but the world is consistent and interesting and beautifully visualized, and there were a couple of parts of the story, one dungeon and its surrounding regions in particular, that really knocked my socks off. All of the major characters are distinct and interesting, and I never once felt like the story was wasting my time.I had a lot of fun with it, enjoyed the ride, have a reasonable few complaints here and there, but also no regrets about paying for it- It's a fun one if you just want to kick back and enjoy some satisfying turn-based combat and go along for the ride with a story that, while solid, isn't particularly revolutionary, though neither does it feel like it's too cliche.

												TL:DR This game gets a 6/10 aka slightly above average. A time killer but not a particularly memorable one.As far as RPG Maker games go, the game is pretty well done. Characters are interesting. Combat is a basic turn-based system with an augment system you can toy with. Music is ok but not Iconic or anything. I really only have two main gripes with the game.One is the story/character development. The characters are interesting but many things that you feel should be elaborated on or explored are sat aside and never touched again. That unfortunately leaves you with questions that never end up being answered. That leads to my second issue which is-The Game is a little too short. I'm glad its too short instead of too long but I really feel like entire arcs are missing from the game that would have been interesting to see play out. It ultimately leads to a somewhat unsatisfying conclusion.All in all, I did enjoy playing the game though it's ultimately never gonna be played again. I bought this game at full price but I recommend buying it while it's on sale.			"

												It is a decent RPGMaker game - and relatively cheap on sale. I spent 20+ hours playing it online and offline. I didn't realise that achievements are only unlocked if you are connected to steam. 100% achievements should take >10 hours. The game's best asset is its level design. You are always rewarded for exploring the beaten tracks. There is also a lot of attention to detail to distinguis nicely every area.Unfortunately the game is lacking in a lot of aspects (combat, classes, character development, ...) and has a few missed opportunities. For instance the crafting feature is neat as you have to collect the materials throughout the world, but this feature feels useless except for high-end weapons. If you are looking for a decent gaming experience with an old-school flair, then Skyborn will be a good pick-up. Despite the flaws I mentionned, I actually enjoyed Skyborn a lot.			"

												A short 15-20 hour RPG with a simple story to follow along. Because of the short length, the story and characters feel condensed. The ending really does come quick. This is the first RPGMaker game I have played. I enjoyed it for what it was and I did get a key for free. Some notes on the game: - Map layouts are sometimes confusing, but are always linear, especially with the color coded puzzles.- Checkpoints are generous, so healing and MP management was never an issue for me. I never used any healing items aside from reviving.- Forging was only useful near the first half of the game. Once I got enough ore and forged my things, I was already at a shop where I could buy better armor.- Money was not really an issue either. It's best to save for when you get the highest tier shops near the arena.- Fights were mildly easy with the right setups. When the classes fully unlocked, I felt way overpowered at the endgame.- It's pretty easy to run past monsters. They aren't randomized and they don't respawn, but I fought them all anyways.- My max level jumped from 49 to 67 by getting everything and beating all bosses (beating the hardest optional boss gives you a giant boost in levels).- The optional boss in the last dungeon was pretty challenging, I really enjoyed that fight.- Another reviewer mentioned this, but they are right about stats. STR deals attack power, even for Corwin. INT is for tech and magic damage which is useful for Claret and Alda's tier 2 and 3 class skills.- Debuffs (Equalizer, Majesty, and Humiliator) are extremely useful.- The best way to power up is through augments: clusters, ingots, and then rainbow prisms.- I suggest giving the weight reducer potion to Claret. I gave it to Sullivan, but his final gear was way below his weight limit.			"

												I got this game in one of the Humble Bundles from a few months back. Decided to finally play it. But after finishing this game, I can't recommend it to anyone. Skyborn is not a bad game. It's no good game either. It's just average. And the fact, that it's an average RPG Maker game just doesn't cut it, because there are so many free games you could play instead. If I have to pay money for a RPG Maker game, I at least expect something unique that warrants it. Yes, the games soundtrack was made by harmonic and it's good (not my favorite, but much better than RTP music). Yes, the game has nice edits and new Char- and Tileset graphics. But then you get to the story, which starts out interesting but then... just looses steam. The characters get less and less screentime as the game continues and more characters join, especially Chaska and Corwin.Gameplay also has some nice ideas, like the forging and the augmenting system, but aside from the whole augmenting, gameplay just... lacks. Dungeons have no puzzles (you can't call the ""press the button/lever once"" puzzles), there are only 3 or 4 sidequests in the whole game and battles all play out like this:You try to kill enemies before they kill you. If that is not possible, you buff/debuff and then kill them. Since I played on the highest difficulty, enemies could 2-3 shot most non tanks with their attacks. And since this whole threat system is implemented, each fight basically plays out exactly the same, unless a random crit happens. And this just gets boring after a while. There was 1 battle in the whole game which I liked, and that was the final battle in the Venom Depths. The final boss and optional boss in the final dungeon both were ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t difficulty with their abilities to oneshot the whole party if you even did a tiny mistake. And sometimes you couldn't even prevent it. It's nothing impossible, but those 2 fights, especially on hard, are just stupidly designed. There are other aspects which annoy me because I myself work with the engine. Stuff like simply wrong perspective, some ""ugly"" looking tiles I know could easily be done better without even editing them or these loooong wooden plank ways you find in most of the dungeons, especially the waterfall and Venom Depths lava area. Most people won't even notice this, but if you do it annoys you. Now, again, Skyborn is no bad game. But it's no good game either. And since it costs 15€, I have at least higher expectations that ""average"". Else, I could just play one of the hundred free RPG Maker games. What I find especially sad is the fact that I loved Legacies of Dondoran, a really old RPG Maker 2003 game made by the same people. That was REALLY GOOD. And I think even today it's a better game than this one.			"

I would rate this 9/10Pros:Addictive characters.Good combat system.Easy item gathering.13 card Spades deck.Nice stage designs.Story was so good it needs like 12 episode anime.Has a collusseum, where you can get a champion title.The music is good and fitting for every stage, but easy forgettable.Lots of secret items to discover, with special attributes, that cant be bought or crafted.Cons:No voice for characters.Lack of crafting stuff.No sequel to this.Not much sidequests.Saehral is too damn OP!Overall if you want to enjoy a RPGmaker game, that is well done, get this one, won't regret it.

												I really love this game.  It's simple.  It's old-school.  It's turn based.  While these are amazing things in and of themselves, they combine to make a very lovely, relaxing game here.  The story doesn't blow you away, sure.  It is fun and enjoyable though.  Satisfies nostalgic feelings for RPG's from my childhood.Characters are fun and relatable.  Battle is a cake walk until you select ""Hard"".  Then you're actually in for a bit of a fun challenge.  This is one of the few games I actually can find excitement to play lately.  There's just something satisfying about it.  I purposefully engage every enemy (enemy sprites move around the map and you can avoid them if you desire to do so), and don't find it to feel tired and repetitive thus far. Weapons and armor are augmentable and there is actually some thought required to be optimal, which is a nice change. That having been said, I would not pay $15 for this game.  At all.  I find the sale price to be perfectly reasonable however.  I even feel that it's a worthwhile purchase in that price range and would buy it again in a heart beat.There's a certain zen-like simplicity to this game, its combat and music, that just make it very relaxing and surprisingly addictive.  Stop thinking about it and buy it already!To the Devs, thank you so much for this! I really hope you have more things in the works!			"

												Time to completion: 9 hours total, though not including side stuff you can do (I didn't bother).It's an alright game, nothing spectacular but worth the 8 bucks I paid for it.You WILL need to run this in windowed mode, though - something about the fullscreen resolution was seriously painful on the eyes, perhaps a staggered frames-per-second rate or a lack of motion blur as the map panned across, I'm not sure. It looks fine in windowed mode, just significantly smaller. If you ever played an emulated version of FF6 you're probably used to that sort of thing.The character/monster art is nice enough, story is solid enough to be enjoyable, music is fine.Main complaint is that it felt pretty easy. Most of the fights I was just able to mash the attack buttons until badguys died. I was able to spam status debuffs on the final bossfights and pretty much completely incapacitate them while I would just wail away on them for about 20 minutes straight. Very straight-forward and easy stuff, not much of a challenge at any point of the game.As a side note: I'm talking about the main campaign. As mentioned there's 'side stuff' I didn't explore that seems like it would be tougher, so you can explore that if it's your thing, I just didn't have interest in it by the time I had gotten towards the end of the campaign.Ideal price would be around $10, $15 is a little too much for this game.

												I have played this game before the steam version. The battle gameplay is basically the default of RPG Maker (if it's not re-scripted a bit). Unlike most RPG Maker game, you can fully control the game with mouse (well the path finding script is tricky so click carefully). You can practically save the game anywhere (outside the battle off course).The artwork of this game is quite nice, however the gameplay is a bit short (10 to 15 hours). I forgot how much time it takes for me to finish this game but I'm sure it's under 10 hours. No need to grind unless you want to take out the optional boss (if my memory serves, there is a strong boss, one or two).			"

If u can have it from some Bundle/Giveaway, play it.---------------- Short Desc:+ Story+ Good battle system (at least better then pure rpgmaker battle system)+ Few class to chose for each hero+ Items upgrade system+ Some nice graphics (for example main heroes)+ You can see enemies- Too short, definitly- ""Mazes""- Side quests (nice option but only few)- Default graphics from RPGMaker for 15€? Really?- Lack of map- You can avoid most non-main enemies- You can't see enemies HP while choosing enemy, that sucks---------------- Opinion:Game is okay, storyline and end is pretty cool but i see potential to make longer and better game. It costs too much. When you have it - it's worth to play it, but don't run to buy it. I see no point in making sub quest system when you can have only few of those, and walking around forest maze without any map with tons of entrances/exits to find 10 flowers, really? It should also have some warning ""KEEP THOSE OBSIDIANS"", making normal weapon is waste of material (i could only find 5-6 obsidians). 7/10 (instant -1 for RPGMaker, with such team they could made something better) I guess it's best RPGMaker game i have played.

												I like the game. It does most of the things you'd expect, has likable characters, airships, magic and quite a lot of nice and touching moments. And funny ones too. The art is good and the soundtrack even more so! Would recommend to friends.That said, the game's sorta oldschool. You don't get much in terms of ""refinements"" or ""annoyance removers"" such as, say, aniimation cancelling when picking up stuff with an animation (iron etc.) and there's no map or minimap. Battles are so-so, but they can be buggy sometimes (enemies using attacks with no name or visual effect, for example). There is no 'sense', you just guess what sort of magic might be useful most of the time.It's also somewhat short. While the story's enjoyable, it feels like there hasn't been enough time for detailed chara-devel and story-devel. Some tips are somewhat misleading (like apples - they don't change your class. They upgrade it etc. ). But enough of that. Game's definitely worth getting if you want to play a short, nice, steampunk-ish RPG :)			"

This game's story is entertaining, the gameplay is challenging, and the world is incredible. This is a game I have been waiting for for a long time.It is easily one of my favourites.			"

												I like the game. It does most of the things you'd expect, has likable characters, airships, magic and quite a lot of nice and touching moments. And funny ones too. The art is good and the soundtrack even more so! Would recommend to friends.That said, the game's sorta oldschool. You don't get much in terms of ""refinements"" or ""annoyance removers"" such as, say, aniimation cancelling when picking up stuff with an animation (iron etc.) and there's no map or minimap. Battles are so-so, but they can be buggy sometimes (enemies using attacks with no name or visual effect, for example). There is no 'sense', you just guess what sort of magic might be useful most of the time.It's also somewhat short. While the story's enjoyable, it feels like there hasn't been enough time for detailed chara-devel and story-devel. Some tips are somewhat misleading (like apples - they don't change your class. They upgrade it etc. ). But enough of that. Game's definitely worth getting if you want to play a short, nice, steampunk-ish RPG :)			"

												Great game! The art is great, the dialogue is typo-free, and the gameplay is fun. I really enjoyed it. Do note that it can crash on infrequent occasions with no real rhyme or reason, so save frequently. Although, the game also has an active and useful autosave, so it's unlikely you'll ever lose significant progress. I recommend saving to separate files before certain events, such as using a class-change apple or before taking on the final quest, in case you want to go back to those points later.			"

												     Bringing to mind memories of days past, Skyborn is a turn-based Role-Playing Game that recalls famous titles from the mid-90s.       Drawing inspiration from games that made the JRPG genre famous, such as Chrono Trigger, various Final Fantasy titles, and lesser-known gems like RoboTrek, Skyborn weaves a story that leaves those that play it wanting more, even after the end. A memorable cast of characters and well-written interactions, along with a cohesive story and a refreshing plot twist, really make Skyborn a title that no Turn-based RPG fan should go without.      Though I enjoyed the game immensely, I did notice a couple of issues that prevent me from giving this game a full 10/10. A couple of characters had a few cliche traits that detracted a little from my overall experience. Though the character development fixes this, it comes a little too late to be completely redeemable. An overall dearth of sidequests, outside of one or two ""go here, get that, come talk to me"" fetch missions, is a bit hard to excuse in a genre known for its fluff and filler that add dozens of hours to a game such as this. Though the battle system is overall well-done, many times, up until near the end of the game, merely mashing the ""z"" key to attack and select the first target, will suffice. Enemies are plentiful enough in the game to build the party's experience levels to laughable proportions, making each battle after a certain level in an area a breeze. Later in the game, however, using each character's strenghs in conjunction with each other is encouraged, and the results are often awesome to behold, as what would have chipped a small portion from an enemy's lifebar becomes a devestating one-hit kill with a little preparation. However, even this can be fleeting, as some character class choices render them useless near the end of the game.A fully-fledged crafting system is in place in this game, and gathering the materials necessary to make the higher grades require a bit of treasure hunting in each area. However, each of these materials is often guarded by monsters, and so getting these materials, while good for armor, makes for an overly-easy endgame.As far as plot goes, for a turn-based RPG, the lack of any single main villain makes the plot a bit dull. While character interaction attempts to make up for this, in the end, and without any main face behind all of the wrongdoings witnessed throughout the game, it ultimately falls flat.All of that said, Skyborn is still a fantastic game, well worth the price and time. 7/10.

												Skyborn is a short but well executed RPG. It is an RPGMaker game, but the creativity present in this game allows it to shine despite the limitations of the engine.Unlike many RPGs, Skyborn has zero random encounters. You encounter enemies by running into an enemy sprite on the map. The downside of this system is that enemies do not respawn, limiting resources somewhat. The lack of spawning enemies might be a limitation of RPGMaker, but Skyborn is so well polished that I can't even call this a limitation.As a result of the enemy encounter system, there is effectively no gringind. Though this did shorten the game considerably, it kept it very much to the point. Leveling does very little to make things easier. Rather, what you do with your items, skills and equipment will ultimately determine the outcome of every encounter.During battle, the order in which each character may act (both allies and enemies) is displayed, allowing for deeper levels of strategy. The display wasn't immediately self-explanatory, but I couldn't help but get excited once I realized what it was. A character's speed reflects the number of times they can act before another character. Speed is a critical factor in Skyborn. It can be increased with some careful planning, but will fall drastically if a character is loaded up with equipment that is heavier than they can handle. The graphics are pleasant to look at, and are of a very high quality for a retro 2D RPG. If you don't believe me, check out the screenshots for this game. There's no background graphics for battles (the map graphics are darkened considerably), but this ironically kept me more immersed in the battle itself. The environments are varied and gameplay elements encourage exploring. Even when it's detrimental, I never go straight for the boss. I can't help myself.The story is decent, well executed, and draws you in. On the down side, it is a bit short, and nothing surprising happens. Optional quests are also somewhat lacking due to the game's length, but most are quite fun and challenging.There is an optional super-boss very near the end of the game. If you have any plans on beating it, you'll probably want to keep a save file before the point of no return, so you can experiment with equipment and other such things.Skyborn is a much more casual RPG experience than I'm used to. But there are plenty of other casual RPGs that are phenomenal (Chrono Trigger and Earthbound to name a few). Skyborn isn't among the best RPGs I've played, but it is a clean, well polished game with its own unique charm.			"

												This is an excellent game, one of the few who'se storyline I will cherish for a long time. I have played hundreds of games in my short time so far, but few that touch base with worldly problems. There were some things that could use some work, like a little more early explaination of the Skyborn race, and their culture still eludes me, but this game was very well done, and very well thought out. About six hours of my life, well spent. The characters are quite memorable. They each stayed on their personality track, and never strayed, not once. Except maybe Sullivan. One time. Then again, I shouldn't even count that time, so nevermind. That was key for this game's depth; understanding the characters. Excellent job.My review of this game: 8/10			"

  My Skyborn review  Skyborn is a simple RPG maker game, and to be fair that might already pull away most of the people interested in buying it, but for some reason, even through there are countless other RPG maker games like this one. I just can't call it bad. I love it. I love the taunt system even through it's  been reused in other games like Deadly Sin. I love the structure of the story and how you never really get overwhelmed by things to do but you still feel free enough for it to not be 100% linear. All and all the only critizism I have towards the game originates from it being made on RPG maker and possibly, like I said before, that the taunt system is a reused asset from other games the group has made, but even then, for this price, it's a really good first entry for JRPG styled games. I won't follow a number rating system, so I'll just list a few major cons and pros : Pros - Good structured storyline- Memorable and likable characters- Strong female lead- Tactical gameplay due to the energy and taunt system- An interesting crafting and mining system Cons - Generic JRPG formula- RPG Maker graphics- Reused graphical assets- Reused taunt mechanic-  No airship battles  (Okay maybe that was too much to ask for)Now that I look at all of these points, I realise that there is a specific kind of person who would enjoy a JRPG game. I grew up with the old Final Fantasy games so I never really cared for graphics, but I do know that there are people who require beautiful tree physics or else they'd rate a game bad despite what the game has to offer at the gameplay or story standpoint. There's also the fact that I do read quite a bit, so I find reading through the lore of a JRPG quite normal ; there will always be those people who are too impatient to read the text on the screen. So I do suggest people who are hesistant on buying this game to spend some time and anaylse if you're patient enough for the reading and don't mind the look of a game too much as in the end those two are the biggest factors in liking a game like this. Thanks for reading my first proper review of a game .u.			"

There is no challenge otherwise.You get five characters to fight many opponents and bosses and level them up to fight the final boss (classic JRPG). The story is decent, but the end game is a little disappointing. It isn't Final Fantasy VI, but definitely worth the purchase if you have some spare cash.			"

												I must say when I got this game it looked promising. A steampunk RPG? Sounds great, but you have to do it just right and the creators of Skyborn did great. I literally had to switch off from it to write a review of how great it is. The characters are interesting from a range of backgrounds. The world shows a great depth. The turn based gameplay gives a feel of an MMO rather than an RPG. you have your characters which you can choose to specialize in diffrent ways to make your kind of team and for an avid MMO player I of course have my tank, dps, and healer. This rpg as well is one of the only games I've ever known there to be a crafting system in. Though not as in depth as an MMO might be it gives a certain feel of progression that I thought only an MMO could do. You even have a sort of enchantment system which allows you to add diffrent states to your weapon and armor. This game by far blew me away and I feel myself getting jittery so I can play it some more. definatly a 5/5 in my book. Highly recommended.			"

												One of the better RPGMaker games I have played. I like the steampunk feel to it and the male characters are hot. I also enjoy how the characters are shown on the left when they speak, even their expressions change. This game gives off a visual novel vibe, which makes it much more enjoyable then others in it's genre. But, just like every RPGMaker game, I can't for the life of me figure out how to equip anything without mashing buttons and hoping for the best lol. Oh and switching out of fullscreen will crash your antivirus program if you use bitdefender.EDIT: Aha, I found the equip buttons! And homeboy just walked backwards out the shop wtf lol.			"

												Surprisingly good RPGmaker game. Linear gameplay (you can't go back to certain areas), good story and possibly a low amount of combat (you can avoid monsters), paired with a high amount of experience gain makes leveling and clearing the game rather easy.However, there is a arena mode that will offer some challenge later on (haven't tried it yet). The atmosphere and game world is beliavable and unique and the encounters differ from location to location. Music is good and mostly fitting. I wish I could resize the window to a size I wanted through the game menu - this isn't possible right now.There are some small inaccuracies and glitches in the game. For example, an ability that's supposed to slow enemy STR and Speed by 50%, does damage for 50% of their current hp instead. Abilities could use more balance; you stop getting abilities at certain points in the game, so leveling doesn't really do much. The enemies can be very unbalanced, being easy to kill at first and then they start doing insane damage, 1 hitting some members of your party (when I went to the mine for the second time, I got hit for 30k when I had 2k hp). The end boss is incredibly unbalanced, often almost 1 hitting my whole team and keeps doing that until i run out of mana or get critically hit. very frustrating ; i have teh best gear, augments and everything but it simply hits for too much .. even though I did skip doing colosseum and getting full card set, it should be doable as I followed the story right.I'd say the game is worth at least 5€ tho.8/10			"

												The story is surprisingly addictive.  The game play reminds me of old Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy games... the 32bit is gorgeous and lovely.  This game is oddly addictive, it's something you don't want to stop playing.  I would highly recommend it, but I would wait till it goes on Sale.  I got it in a Humble Bundle.  I think $15 is a bit much for this game. I would pay $5/6 for it, which I did plus lots of other stuff in the humble bundle, but $15 is a bit much.  Keep an eye out for it to go on sale!Visible enemies with high exp and exp nodes make getting exp fun, and easy when you want to, no being constantly ambushed by invisible enemies.Chests and puzzles are challenging, but not impossible or overly strenuous.The story is oddly addictive.  It's not ""adult only"" it doesn't try to be pretentous, it's just good clean fun.  It made me genuinely laugh, and care for the charcaters.The ""Skyborn"" is a relatively common theme, but it is executed perfectly so far.I've been playing 5 hours, enjoying every moment of it, and I keep playing.  I love it, it's addictive and fun.Making money is difficult, so it requires you to forge your own equiptment, which is new and lots of fun.The main character is a strong woman, I love that.  It's rare now a days.  She doesn't need saving, she's kickass.You can watch me play on twitch.  my name there is BaddestBadWolf look me up and watch me play.  :)			"

												For some reason, this game just clicked with me. I liked everything about it, the characters, the writing, the art, the setting, the music... I'm no super RPG expert or anything, but I can recommend this game if you're a fan of casual RPG's, a fan of the steampunk genre and/or airships, and like well thought out and imagined story lines. Battles felt balanced and weren't too difficult if properly geared with the right skills, in normal mode. (I never play in Hard mode, as I'd rather casually pass the time with an enjoyable play session than stress out over every battle I encounter, and this is with any RPG.)  I just wish this game had a direct sequel. With the amount of positive reviews Skyborn has received, it's well worth the cost, especially if you catch it or the Dancing Dragon bundle on sale.			"

												For an RPG Maker game, it was really good.  Very straight forward.Cons:  Very little side content/bonus content (other than difficulty settings/and a bonus boss on the way there that requires massive grinding to beat).Somewhat short 12 hours but not a con if you're not all about timeEnemies don't respawn after killing them, so I'm wondering how you get more levels than intended?Characters didn't have a lot of ablities not a lot of varartion.VERY short credit roll give music and resources used!Lots of RTP resources used but that's hardly a negative.Pros:  Cute story and enjoyable.  Love the diveristy moral the game presents at the end.Good musicAtmosphere was good reminded me of Secert of Evermore from SNES.Interesting way to handle MP.Innovative threat battle system.Overall got my 5 bucks from the sale worth.  Was a very decent RPG Maker game and I'd recommend it to anyone. "

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game. As far as RPGs go, it's in a classic style that's easy to understand.However, there are a few criticisms I have. As a new player, I absolutely blew it on my stats the first time I tried to play the game, and I got so frustrated because I couldn't understand what I was doing wrong. While you always have a quest going, the game doesn't tell you that you need to explore and/or do sidequests to grind enough levels, farm materials, and find gear to advance in the main quest line. If you're a newbie like me, keep that in mind.On the positive side, the storyline was engaging, the characters were wonderful, and I found myself pleasantly surprised by the plot a couple of different times. I only wish it were longer because it was a great experience.			"

												Great game! Good graphics, nice game mechanics (weapon crafting, ""augment"" powerups, interesting combat system, etc.), and interesting--though somewhat a little predictable--story. I would've liked more maps, and a longer story, with some more plot twists and tragedies. It feels as if the end was rushed... This is no Final Fantasy, but overall I do recommend the game because I enjoyed it, still.			"

												A short entertaining JRPG. This is unique enough to distinguish itself among JRPGs but lacks sufficient depth in the story and length of game-play to establish it as a classic. A good indie-style game worth trying if you like JRPGs.I would rate it at 4/5, pretty good.			"

												This is probably one of the best RPG games made on RPGMaker that I have ever played. Another one that I enjoyed as much is Eternal Senia. The storyline, characters, graphics, and music are all charming. Best yet, you can avoid the monsters so you don't have to have endless battles (unless you want to). There's also very little grinding needed to go from one boss to the next which is great. Now, is the game worth the full cost? In my view, no. The main reason I say this is not because I don't like the game but because the game can be beat in less than 20 hours. I bought it on sale which was completely worth it.			"

												Skyborn was really fun.  In a lot of ways, I guess it seemed like ""another RPGMaker game,"" but the characters are very likeable, the story is compelling, and gameplay was well-paced.  It really didn't take long for me to be hooked on the game.You have to understand that I rarely see a game all the way to the end, even a ~6-hour game like Skyborn.  My attention span runs out... but not this time.  I cared about the characters and really wanted to find out what happened to their story.PROSExtremely likeable characters -- nearly every time a new character joined the party, I was immediately drawn to his or her unique personality.Interesting (though short) story.Nice graphics... RPGMaker style, of course, but a really nice example of what that platform can do.No time wasted on tedious, pointless questing.No grinding.CONSCombat was... a little one-note.  There wasn't a lot of depth to it.Short game. (Maybe a pro for some folks...)No support for Steam Overlay features in Windows.Er... that's mostly it.  I didn't have a lot of complaints about the game. :P			"

												I rarely write reviews now, but this game is such a hidden gem it deserves more support than it currently has. I've had this in my library for several months, never caring enough to check it out. I had never heard of it before, and it took extreme boredom to force me into exploring the nooks and crannies of my library and install this title. I didn't expect it to be much good, and I was pleasantly surprised. This game far exceeded my expectations. It certainly has its flaws - the interface could be easier to use at some places, the fighting system takes some getting used to, and I wish the game gave more insight into character building (stats, skills, etc.) But the charm of its storyline, plus the very fitting soundtrack, are hard to fault.

												It's been a while since I play an RPG, but I almost always get bored quickly if the story isn't interesting enough.That did not happen with Skyborn, it took just a little time to understand the basics of the story but from that moment I was hooked, probably played like 3 or 4 hours straight without even realizing.So all I have to say is if you like RPG games, this will probably be a good game, maybe not a great one, but certainly an entertaining one. Good story, good combat, nice graphics and amazing music!Also, maybe there could be like a guide book or something added to the game explaining some things that weren't obvious, at least the basics.

												So I just beat this game, took me about 5 hours because I spent half the time afk... No pause feature ftw, anyways... I enjoyed the game for the most part, I think that the combat system could use some work however, primarily the fact that it's more of a whoever can hit the hardest the fastest wins type system. I had taken the pure dark side of corwin and actually have to say minus the lacking of any revival it was really nice being able to never worry about health until you get to the insta killing foes(there were only such when you are undergeared, I didn't finish the colleseum, just enough for gear and such from the shops due to the tough guys, have to say they are stronger than anything you encounter after it...). The music was decently done, though I'd have liked some intense music during boss fights... And the end boss was a big let down...hell there is a tougher fight in the same area in the form of a reoccuring NPC who talks about food a lot(Forgot her name, couldn't even come close to beating her). Over all though I'd recommend this game purely for a quick hit it and quit it game, the main issue I had was that it looked like it was made on one of the RPG makers and as such lacks any real potential that a hand crafted game could have(odds are it may have been hand done, but just wasn't planned to be pushed further... either way it's still good) I'd love to see a sequal or what happens next, though I'll say that the story definately could of used some work, and chaska while I loved her design, her personality was poorly done... the others were at least somewhat respectable for their roles... I will add however that it's not worth $15 due to it's length...			"

												Ok let's review this game.The first thing i felt when i opened the game was that this game was going to be good, and now that i finished it i feel that i was not wrong, let me explain why:First of all, the characters! I just loved the main heroine Claret Spencer, she's a well made character, but the others are not that inferior, everyone of them is well made. Second point, the plot, i liked it, it's not too much complicated and twisted but it's somewhat genial, a world ruled by the mighty skyborn race, the long story about the humans and the skyborns was absolutely pretty. The game is steampunk themed, flying steampunk ships everywhere and that kind of stuff, i like it but it is a matter of tastes.The gameplay is pretty fun, the dungeons and mazes can be very tricky if you do not pay attention to the switches or to the hidden chests, but i have something to say regarding the fights, they're not too hard, i played the game on normal mode but there are people that complain that those fight are too much easy even on hard mode. I think that only the colosseum fights were hard to beat.The maps are very good for the eye, the developers did a good job here, you go from a steampunk city to a sandy desert to a fantasy forest, good point here!The soundtracks are enjoyable and put at the right place, expecially some fight OSTs made me ""hype"".The only thing i have to complain is that the game is quite short, it takes around 8 hours to fufill the main storyline.I suggest to buy Skyborn, it's worth the price. (maybe you want to get it on sale)Oh right i forgot, Chaska for the win!			"

It rewards exploration just enough that you don't feel bad for missing something, but still very rewarding for going out of your way frequently. NPCs provide give the scenarios even more life, and the main story has good twists and elements.On the other hand, combat can feel very soft, so if you come for that, switch it to hard.

The dungeons and combat are just ""okay"", they're not annoying but not the most creative thing in the world.  I did appreciate though that the game tried to do some creative things with the engine, like giving you XP for exploring the map fully and also having optional quests.  These things give the game some extra depth.			"

												This game feels a lot like the older Final Fantasy games, particularly FF6. The story holds together well enough. It's a little predictable, but the characters are likable and the action is compelling enough. It's short, which is either a positive or a negative depending on your point of view. Took me about 12 hours to do a full clear on hard, though honestly, that was mostly due to a lot of backtracking to get items I missed along the way. Average playthrough should be around 7-10 hours. Even fully geared, the final bosses were pretty challenging, especially the last boss who has an autowipe spell. For those complaining about how crafting is useless, you can build +2 weapons and armor through crafting and stack an additional +4 enchantment on top of them, making them better than the best gear in the game. Anyway, it's a fun game to waste a weekend on, especially if you're feeling nostalgic for RPGs from the SNES era.			"

												This game has a nice, old take on the classic RPG games like earthbound, for its combat. The story is rather easy to follow and piece information together since it dosnt throw too much at you at a time, give or take a few bits. A few complaints are that there is not too much in terms of interaction with things in the world, only switches and people and doors. and it begins to be very easy when you get the full party. It also lagged a bit during the walk-around bits, but it may have just been my computer, and there seems to not be any settings for graphics either. The people in the world all seem somewhat interesting, but it only foucuses on a few of the party members, and the NPC's backstories are little to none, give or take some important NPC's All in all i think it is a good game, well worth my money but it could be better in some areas.

												I'm torn.While I don't innately hate all RPG Maker games just because they are... well, RPG Maker games, there are always many glaring flaws and telltale marks that accompany them.As for the game itself - I can't say it was the best thing ever, but I felt compelled to finish it to 100%. The story was semi-decent, the combat was fairly okay, the music was pretty good and the art as well.All in all it's not a bad game, it's just very ""okay"" all-around. Ultimately, for what it is, it is recommendable. It's not the pinnacle of quality gaming, but it's solid enough, and half it's flaws stem from being an RPG Maker game, anyways.If you want it or are on the fence, get it; if you are disinterested, there's really nothing for you here.

												Skyborn is a classic JRPG with good story, characters and music. I completed it in 9 hours skipping some optional content; can't really complain for the price right now (50% off - $7.49 USD).Made using RPGMaker 11, which should tell you a lot.Combat is not complex; turn-based with an action sequence queue. Buff/debuff and equipping too heavy items will change the order. Some actions take multiple turns to execute. You have skills using two kinds of resources: Mana, which regenerates slowly, and Energy, which always starts at 0 increases by hitting or getting hit. Enemy AI reacts to threat - a displayed percentage indicating how dangerous you are. There are skills to manage threat, which in a nutshell means you dedicate a party member to be the official punching bag.There are no random encounters; enemies patrols the map which you can choose to evade. Once killed they will not come back. This also means you cannot grind for levels.You have the standard item shop and treasure chests; also a simple crafting system. You can collect ores and craft weapons and armors (the protagonist is a mechanic), which is not really useful as it only allows you to get the next tier of items a little earlier. Then there is an augment system, which allows a one-time insertion of various bonus into weapon/armor. You can pretty much ignore both though; you are given new items quite frequently so you can get by without any crafting.Each character starts with a predefined class; during the course of the game you get two promotions for everyone, giving you different skills to use.You can change combat difficulty from easy to normal to hard anytime you want; I have it set at normal the whole game, and combat is generally very easy with the exception of some optional fights... two of which I didn't complete, as you cannot grind in this game.

												Eh....It's got a compelling story. It's got flashy graphics. Memorable characters. All of that good stuff.It's just not fun to play. I don't enjoy sitting through half-hours of uncontrollable cut-scenery. I don't enjoy the battle system one bit.There are some really, really cool features, such as the forge, and the skill-set design is really good for the battle system, but these aren't enough to make me enjoy the game. I just don't have fun while I'm playing it. I'd almost rather read the story as a book.Oh yeah, and those stupid pop-up portraits that take up the entire freakin' screne when anyone talks.It's wonderfully produced, just not my cup of tea. I can honestly say that I tried very hard to enjoy the game, and just couldn't.			"

I typically hat RPG maker games but this one keeps me coming back to play more. Worth at least $5. Maybe more.

												Looks like a typical RPG Pixel game~ But you can't deny the fact that the game is Fun,Epic,Adventureous and relaxing at the same time. The map is also big and there's an Okay-ish level of interaction around the map. The only con I would say is that it doesn't have a mini-map or a map for you to look for directions, so you can get lost pretty easily. Other than that, I highly recommend it ~			"

												Skyborn really impressed me. It cracked my top favorite RPG Maker games, some of which are, for example, LISA and Data Hacker. Firstly, something that always annoys me while playing these types of games is the utilization of the default resources available on the engine. Lots of games feature this negative aspect and that simply takes me off the title's experience. Skyborn basically has custom everything, from the tiles, to character design, to even battle effects and battle sounds. The soundtrack is also pretty amazing and I found it perfectly fitting the game's setting.  The story in Skyborn is a huge positive aspect in my books. A civil war is occuring in the realms where this title takes place. Skyborn wish to destroy and enslave Humanity, claiming they are a better species and were born for the purpose of ruling everything and everyone. Skyborn have wings. That's enough to convince you on what side you should take, am I right? Four mechanics, and various little changes, distinguish this title from other RPG Maker games. The first being mining. By clicking on an ore located on a wall, you mine it. That simple. Secondly, crafting. Ores found by mining can be used in means of crafting new armor and weapons for your party. In third place comes augments. Items can be found all over various environments, which have the purpose of enhancing character's weapons/armor stats. And, lastly, side quest are available to extend a bit of the playtime this game can offer. I found 3 in total. Concluding this review, my final thoughts are simple: if you've been looking for an RPG that provides some kind of nostalgia, and also made in RPG Maker, Skyborn is definitely worth your time and your money. It will not be easily forgettable, as the story is indeed well crafted, from the beggining to the very end. Recommended! "

												Skyborn is a fun RPG, and deceptively simple!I tried to go into a in-depth review of it, but it turned out way too long, so I'll just go into a Pros and Cons type of points, with the full analysis for myself. If you're interested in it, I'll send you the whole review, just!Pros-Great world! It starts out fairly average, but it later reveals itself. It has a few interesting concepts, worth looking into.-Unique combat system. It's a mixture of the classic turn-based combat, with a few more modern Skills and Gameplay concepts, akin to MMOs, like a threat system, big focus on buffs and debuffs rather than pure firepower, and good interaction and role separation between classes.-It looks pretty good.-Music is simply fantastic! It really reminded my of Golden Sun. While it's not quite at that level, it's still very good, and it feels more modern sounding. I really liked it.-Provides a good challenge on Hard Mode without feeling too frustrating (until the last 2 Bosses, which are impossible unless you do absolutely every objective before heading into the final section of the game. However, nothing previously indicates that to be the case, which one is likely to miss, not realizing it until it's too late to go back.)-No random encounters! You can see those encounters on the screen, approaching at will.-Retry feature to get right back into a battle when you're defeated.-Good control scheme (I personally used a controller for a more laid back experience, and it worked fine).Cons-Lack of any resolution options, leaving you with a very badly scaled game in Fullscreen, or just a small window (the latter is recommended, Fullscreen looke hideous).-Poor interface design, looking very average, and not very functional.-The crafting system was awful to navigate, and didn't provide much benefit, as you could earn enough gold to render it useless, as everything would be for sale.-The game loved to surprise you with Boss Fights, and having you walk for half an hour if you did something wrong regarding leveling, or equipment. Some Boss Fights also appeared out of nowhere, sometimes making it impossible to procceed without reverting a couple of Saves.-Low amount of Save Slots (only 4).-The last few maps seemed a bit too clustered and confusing.-Lack of information. This game is not very informative regarding some of its details, leaving it all to trial and error. Sometimes, it can be very damaging to the player's experience. Every shop, forge (for crafting) is very far apart, leaving the player with empty hands for long periods of time.In the end, it was my downfall, as I literally couldn't go back, but HAD to, to be able to finish the game. Again, it does NOT give the player enough information for the player to make some decisions safely, but it was a big sore spot for me.Overall, Skyborn was an enjoyable experience. I liked a lot of it! But, looking back at it, it is also riddled with so, so many issues...!Some of those are inherent to RPGMaker, but some of those were also huge design flaws, which is disappointing.If you're looking for a JRPG with a more modern feel, give this one a try! I enjoyed most of it.Not recommended at full price, though, 15$ seems way too high for this game. It feels small at times,and just doesn't seem worth that price point, with so many amazing games at 10$.			"

												This is an RPG Maker game, which suffers many problems due to the use of that engine. Most notably is widescreen is not supported which in 2014, the release of this game, is kind of a glaring flaw. Along with that, the graphics are at an SNES level which is all the engine supports.Graphics don't make a game though. So what about everything else?Combat is turn-based which is ideal for me as that's my favorite type of RPG. Unfortunatly the balance of the abilities is fairly poor, and their variety lacking.There is a small amount of customization avalible, and a rudamentary crafting system.The story is so-so with around a high school writing level.Overall the game is fairly mediocre. My recommendation is to pass, but if the description sparked your interest you should definatly wait for a sale, the game is not very long and offers zero replay.			"

												Skyborn, a RPG Maker title with a steampunk setting tells an interesting tale of a spunky female mechanic named Claret who, after a chain of events becomes embroiled in an rebellion against a Winged Race of beings simply known as The Skyborn. Skyborn offers a standard RPG experience but with some neat features, such as the ability to forge more powerful weapons and armor and adding augments to further enchance equipment. These Augmentations can either make you more physically imposing, a more powerful spell caster or a more nimble character overall. So there is a small element of battle preparation and strategy when forging and augmenting your party's equipment. Visually it's much like many RPG Maker and 16-Bit era RPGs of it's day though some of the steampunk aspects stand out a little for me. Music and sounds are pretty good as well, with some haunting melodies and catchy battle themes, though the sounds used are standard RPG Maker stock noises. Battles play out like many J-RPGs in that each character and enemy take their turn with a choice of physical attack, special skill, or defending. Though I've only started playing this game I highly recommend giving it a try, especially if you are a fan of RPGs in general, you will not be disappointed.			"

												I'm apparently the 1000th review for Skyborn - fitting since this is my first review on Steam ever, despite playing thousands of hours and owning more than a hundred games. I have to give it two thumbs up - great gaemplay and visuals, but above all else wonderful characters and an engaging story that managed to feel tight yet satisfying. My only complaint might be that the game is a little on the short side - I finished in roughly 10-11 hours on the hardest difficulty setting with pretty much every possible thing done. But while usually I hate getting into a game that doesn't last 20-25 hours at minimum, Skyborn felt like a joy for every hour; by far the best commercial indie/RPGMaker of the 6-7 I've played. Highly recommended.			"

												the ""cover art"" for this title is beautiful and i love me some old-school rpgs. however the art style from the store page is not carried over into the game. it is similar but you can tell a lot less of something (skill, time, or effort) went into it. shame really because i did not really find the art in game that engaging. to be clear i am not talking about the game world sprites; i am talking about the character avatars for conversations and battles. i honestly wish the devs had just used the sprites everywhere.that brings me to the inconsistency of the games aesthetic. it is not so jarring when the conversations have the non-pixel art, but in battles you have these fully rendered drawings (fully rendered does not mean beautiful, good quality, or high-res) that do not match the rest of the games art. even the background of the battle-scenes, those i saw, were the games pixel art. the pixel art in this game is good, but the non-pixel art is really quite unappealing. the entire battle scene could be improved so much if the dev had just used the pixel sprites they already had instead of the illustrations that are used.i also do not like that the battle scene does not use the character sprites as if they were on a battlefield like the original final fantasy games and chrono trigger. when i play 16-bit rpgs i want 16-bit art and my battles to happen in the game world rather than overlayed on top of it.i am not a connoiseur of good writing, but even i found the writing to be trite and unengaging. sure it is leaps and bounds better than legionwood 2, but it is still pretty terrible, even compared to some other classic rpgs with terrible writing.as you can see i did not play for very long, but that is because i found nothing to keep me playing longer and plenty to make me want to quit playing sooner. overall i cannot recommend this game.

												This is one of the most amazing games I have ever played. The storyline is enthralling, filled with original ideas and plenty of plot twists and turns. The games art is beautiful. Every time I battled against a new monster I simply marvelled at its beauty. The characters were incredible. They didn't feel like little pixels on the screen, they felt like they could be real people, as they were so incredibly well developed. My only qualm about the game is that towards the end, it felt rushed. Like the developers had all these wonderful ideas, but just shoved them in at the end.9/10 Well worth playing!			"

												Not bad, not great. Typical GBA style RPG if I had to throw it in a category. Kindof reminds me of Golden Sun or a FFIVish clone.I really do enjoy the steampunk styling, the optional battles, the battles themselves, full mouse function (one handed skill ++), augmentation of items, and the threat system. The card-like battles are a nice break from the all-too-common sprite battles (insert FF memories here). The threat system is overwhelmingly my favorite part of this game; all monsters focus their attacks on the character with the highest threat. Threat is dependent on damage dealt (think enmity/paladin if you've played FFXI), and pretty much eliminates the whole sh*t-my-healer-died headache.It's casual; you play it when you're watching investigative murder porn or whatever. I don't even know what the game music sounds like; I've played through it with iTunes on in the bkg, nothing's missed.  What I dislike:i. the menus are quite primitive. I had difficulty quickly comparing armor pieces upon pickup. ii. sprites for the monsters are overused. Haven't finished the game yet, but would've been interesting to see different models for different baddies. Why should you consider it? It's 15$. That's a movie; play it for 2 hours and you've been more cost efficient with your wallet than going to see a lame Thor sequel. If you miss older rpg games before the community was obsessed with graphics, you'll probably like this psuedo-throwback.			"

												Skyborn. I thought maybe this was about dragons. I had no idea this is about dragoons. So as the story goes. YOu start out as a tinkerer named claret. So you can not name any of the characters for your own. so this is not a options game. I believe this is a RPG Maker VX ace game that was enhanced with mouse support and some keyboard support. I know a script on getting the keys E, S, F, D to work on this. Oh lol im talking about scripts. Well you arrive in a town that has no map. So good luck. not that i dont like games with no maps but its very confusing. However on this title I was not so lost as I have a high IQ to figure out where I have been and where I wanted to go. I did like the mouse support as this made the way of walking very easy to point and click to use.  Now hmm the game feels like your going to do some grinding but there is very little as if you look for the little experience points in the game, then you dont really grind at all. Now I was concerned about what that has to do with the support jobs to earn. I think that the way you use the different weapons are great but the way you can only get a certain number of upgrades from the character. So if your looking for a way to get better upgrades. I believe there should be a picture of what your trying to achieve. It is like blind crafting and what are we crafting and is it better. I know this is a different perspective but crafting blindly to achieve a greater craft? You will just have to play to see what I mean. Five player support. Now that was a Party no doubt and the overall support of the last character was a 1:4 ratio as you are advancing with this character as to be like her. There are twist to her role and I support the team that came up with that. I wish there was more story to the Fey characters. If there is Skyborn 2 hopefully. I would try to support the character that is odd in the game and at least get a supply of weapons for her. I just feel characters need to support characters to a 50/50 percentage. That is how I feel I know that is not likely but character support would be nice. I do see that some of the characters really hate each other lol and so that was entertaining. Okay so I beat it once but I would replay this as to try to work on the areas I failed to see. There is a point of no return in the game and you better pay attention. The boss at the end is extremely difficult and will let you know if your worthy. So you get a free battle it seems till he decides at 30% he's had enough of you and WHAM whole party is retrying. OH the Army of the military Skyborn seems incomplete as I was not sure who the commander was or was that the point. Now the action of the sequence was intense. I did like the next character reference like something of Dragonwarrior series. I like to read the action. Can you tell? So you fight in a sequenced way of fighting and the options of availability are not in a constant order. So if you have a enemy that only gets affected by certain options of the party. So you need 3 characters at all times. If you have 1 or 2 in the other areas of the game. I believe you will see a cruel fate mostly.So with that said. I would recommend SKyborn to a player it is rare and seems like another of its kind shall embark soon....			"

												I have mixed emotions about this game. It's fun, but I was a bit disappointed about the battle mechanics. I was hoping for a final fantasy type deal where it goes through a cutscenes to a fight. It just shows a picture of a enemy and you just click and randomly pick things to attack or defend. The game has a great storyline so far even if battle mechanics are just meh. I will suggest this cause the storyline is good. I hope to see the creator make more games with improved battle mechanics			"

I personally think this is very well done.Edit: I was never much of a fan of old school JRPG's, but this one has me hooked and I probably will look at these more in the future. I like the scripting in the game most of all and is very rewarding if you take the time to explore. I LOVE exploring in games and this one has me doing a lot of it and it pays off everytime.I strongly recommend this game to fans of this genre.Please, for the love of everything holy, don't pay attention to people complaining that it was done with RPG Maker.... they all seem to have very biased opions			"

												I was in the mood for some steampunk game and noticed I had this (I'm assuming from some humble bundle). Thought I'd turn it on, play a few minutes and go meh. To my surprise I was enjoying it. Story is so far is... meh generic jrpg/rpg story line. However, it was the innovation with game mechanics for a jrpg that I was enjoying. Like a MMO it has a threat system. Balancing that threat bar to have your healer/squishies not be attacks and have your big swoll guy take all the damage. As well as mana regen in combat through either regular attack or when character turn ends (haven't figured out which one it was). As I keep playing though I do hope there are some more rpg elements like a class system or story choices... so on ward.. to keep playing and find out.    So far I would recommend it. For either a intro into the jrpg genre or just  innovation with the combat system. (This is atleast the first jrpg with these mechanics I've ran into... so their very well could be others that I've missed that have done the same thing.)			"

												Did a first play some time ago , didn't go that far, by lack of time mainly and characters didn't hook me up yet. Came back on it recently and I must say it's quite a gem of an ""old-school"" rpg. The story, without being groundbreaking is well written and the characters are really lively and relatable. No cliche of the ""dark hero with a tortured past""  or the ""happy go lucky kid who somehow gets stronger than veterans because ♥♥♥♥ logic he's the chosen one"" here. It's a relief. When you kick a baddie's butt here, you feel gratified to teach him a lesson and that tells about how well the whole thing is written. About the gameplay itself though..... Well..... it's too easy. I'm playing on normal and plan to give a try with a second run on hard to check but damn, I didn't die once so far. The amount of augments and accessories make for a wide choice to modify your characters and also you can chose advanced classes which seem to propose pretty different strategies. I'm a bit disappointed enemies don't have better patterns and ai, especially bosses which I could basically faceroll against the floor in 2 minutes so far. Maybe it gets harder later but for now I'm at around 6 hours of real game (I left the game running while doing other stuff a lot) and no difficulty whatsoever. It doesn't disturb me that much because it's still fun and I play rpg more for the story than anything else. I wonder how some guys got lost in dungeons because the map design is pretty simple without being over-simplified either. You have room to get some extra-loot and xp which is always nice. Doesn't seem to have really hard to get secrets so far though. Time will tell maybe it comes later. The music also is pretty good. One of these games (like the Legionwood franchise) proving that YES, you can produce a good game with rpg maker. Without game-breaking bugs and actual fun. Which actually took time to polish. Incredible. Wow.			"

												the ""cover art"" for this title is beautiful and i love me some old-school rpgs. however the art style from the store page is not carried over into the game. it is similar but you can tell a lot less of something (skill, time, or effort) went into it. shame really because i did not really find the art in game that engaging. to be clear i am not talking about the game world sprites; i am talking about the character avatars for conversations and battles. i honestly wish the devs had just used the sprites everywhere.that brings me to the inconsistency of the games aesthetic. it is not so jarring when the conversations have the non-pixel art, but in battles you have these fully rendered drawings (fully rendered does not mean beautiful, good quality, or high-res) that do not match the rest of the games art. even the background of the battle-scenes, those i saw, were the games pixel art. the pixel art in this game is good, but the non-pixel art is really quite unappealing. the entire battle scene could be improved so much if the dev had just used the pixel sprites they already had instead of the illustrations that are used.i also do not like that the battle scene does not use the character sprites as if they were on a battlefield like the original final fantasy games and chrono trigger. when i play 16-bit rpgs i want 16-bit art and my battles to happen in the game world rather than overlayed on top of it.i am not a connoiseur of good writing, but even i found the writing to be trite and unengaging. sure it is leaps and bounds better than legionwood 2, but it is still pretty terrible, even compared to some other classic rpgs with terrible writing.as you can see i did not play for very long, but that is because i found nothing to keep me playing longer and plenty to make me want to quit playing sooner. overall i cannot recommend this game.

												the game itself is ok-good (6-7/10) but i can't recommend this one to achievement hunters/completionists. Often Achievements will just not unlock although you met the requirements. The solution to this is, do it again ... and again ... and again. It will eventually unlock in one of your following tries without a specific reason.It really drives you crazy if the specific achievement is about beating a hard boss or so. Achievements are out for about half a year as i'm writing this and they weren't able to solve it. I even don't know whether they're trying or not...			"

												Difficulty leave: normalplaying casually not really puting forced thought and not really Saving and undoing mistakes just playing as if it were a fun game.Pros:The art is beaufitful it's really great and it seems to be rather clean then pixels.The Mechanics/ ui Everything runs smoothly, their interfaces for each menu look pretty and are very informative. I like the touches they did with the battles. Overal the Ui is being the Ui and doing it's job. telling me what I need to know without overwhelming me with boxes upon boxes. StoryThe story really interest me. has a bit of clice [parents left turns out they were rebels blah] but it's all clice when you look at all rpgs. The storys great you really can see how they play out in some scenes weapon craftingUnique and some what nice.  status effectsPlayers arn't restricted in status effects. all effects only lessen things and nothing takes away a players turn. blind something that would make you miss lowers your damage. there hasn't been a sleep spell nor has there been something that disables my player and makes me feel like that person is useless until there status effect is removed. any time I attack I feel that I'm doing something. Cons:Give a character a double attack.I craft a steel weapon [probably teir 2-3] and recieve a weapon in a dungeon i'm dealing 400 per hit twice. and if charged for a moment 1k possibly. This really hurts the fact that the main chracter is dealing all the damage. I get that 1's a healer 1's a tank and then you have your character. but for the early story thats 1 person dealing tons of damage 2-3 shotting all the monsters for no reason.... no reason at all. My tank tanks and my healers heals are kind of weak. and my 4th party memeber who is crit happy only deals 150 base damage. so I have to protect the double attacker because she is all my damage... :/ makes the game feel like I'm forced to deal all damage with her.Weapon crafting limitationSo I can't see what weapons I'm making or what armor I'm making and I understand something basic like a mage can't wear something heavy. and my tank shouldn't wear light things. but what does it all make? not knowing what desicion I'm making really hurts when I build a +2 damage for my damage dealer and get a new weapon in that dungeon moments later. or when I build something for my tank to attack and deal more damage to gain threat for the finishing blow and he gets a weapon. You can't craft weapons for other party memebers that I know of just yet. the first 4 you get you make weapons for the people who get items in the dungeon.... it makes crafting weapons worthless early on. and How was I to know?  I've just wasted resorces thats what I know.difficulty/ bossesbosses on normal difficulty arn't fun... You fight monsters 2-3 shot each of them, sometimes 1 shot. you fight the boss [which i've encountered 3] they hit all of your party memebers they 3 shot the tank and the 6 shot the person i'm desperatly keeping alive using heal all the potions I can throw on her because shes the ONLY ONE that can HURT THE BOSS. and a tech boss [2nd boss] and a female skyborn boss [3rd boss] share the ablity that gives them haste + all stats pretty much. :/ like really... Money issues. what exactly has real value...Your shops seem rather strange. you don't buy weapons you buy augments which can only be put on 1 weapon. ontop of that you don't need potions because you 2-3 shot everything. and you have a healer that uses 2-1% of mana to cast heal. and the mana used has no issues. no one has mana problems. :/ your tank uses 0 mana to taunt. your damage uses 22% to deal aoe damage which sets ablaze sometimes. and your crit happy person uses it to blind people. which just lowers damage and doesn't affect bosses... I have no clue what to spend the money on since Augments really seem like a 1 item use and you don't feel a value for them. Early game healer/ healing outside of comabt,healer in dungeon 1. It is little to no cost to heal and it has the problems of not really doing much of a heal inside of battle. The regen ablity is nice. and dehablity is nice but your taking a party memeber giving them the healler roll. so giving them damage doesn't really help your team. if your a healer. you need to use your action to heal. not deal damage. No grind factor.all encounters are plotted. meaning I can't go off and grind if i'm struggling with a boss. It's fine if the enemies are plotted but if they are. they need a respawn or their needs to be a way I can grind if I feel I'm unable to progress. If i'm struggling it means I've made a mistake with my resources but I have no way of destroying my weapon to craft armor. or to craft anything that could really help me out. heck I don't even know what teir my armor is when I get it because when I crafted new armor it was same teir as class 1 and I had no clue. their for MORE resorces wasted.Final analysis  I played the game and I'll still play the game for more research if my mind changes on this game and i'll rereview it but from first dungeons and bosses if it remains the same then It's going to stay this way. Art 5/5Game play 2/5Sound 4/5price 2/5 Story 4/5FInal verdict 6/10 Buy it if it's on sale for under 10 maybe 8 dollars but its not worth your 15 dollars... it really isn't Their are plenty of games that look nice sound nice but play better then what this has to offer in its early on game play.

												I gave this a thumbs up when I first started playing, but am now giving it a thumbs down. I am halfway through the games and there are far too many parts of the world you can't explore. Not because of limited world, but because of bugs. You click to move to a part of the map and are unable to move suddenly. Not even back to where you were. I'm so frustrated. I tried working around the bugs. I really did. I had so enjoyed this game til halfway through. But now... it's like buying a piano and only half the keys work. You try to play songs, but only some sonfgs can be played because the rest of the time, no sound comes out. I just want my money back. I don't want a broken product.			"

												Way too many mazes. Mazes within mazes. Just when you start to think you've covered most of an area and you can get on with the game, you find yourself in yet another maze. There's not much worth seeing or doing in these mazes, either -- a few mostly useless trinkets to ""mine"", very little loot, no lore or background story, just some sparkly nodes where you get a few XP or something. And doors and buttons and switches to really nail down that glorious maze experience. Combat system gets old quickly, too. Oh yeah, there are characters and a story here. Seemed pretty interesting. But somewhere in the middle of a maze within a maze within a maze, I stopped caring and remembered all the other games I have that involve actual playing and not wandering around aimlessly.			"

												Discalmer: I haven't finished the game. 2 hr 20 min played time.Combat:  The combat in this game is pretty simplistic.  You will pretty much be using the same two or three spells/abilities every round on any type of enemy.  Very little depth.  The threat system could have potential but it pretty much just makes it so you can have glass cannons and one tank.  It's very easy.Story:  I thought the story might be decent but after I left the first town I wasn't even sure why I was going to the places they were telling me to go.  Hey we made it to XXX, go though the coal mines to the next town!  Ok...why?  Good job, now proceed immediately though the volcano dungeon to the next town!  I quit in the volcano dungeon because it was just starting to feel like a grind.  Nothing was driving this story.Enviroments:  There's a good amount of detail on the map and it looks pretty well done for an RPG maker game.  The only downside is that there's not much you can interact with.  Also the enemies seem to be stock or something, most of the time I can't figure out why giant spiders, bandits, and skeleton men are all walking around in a room together.Graphics:  Look at the screenshots.  SNES level, no widescreen support.  AKA an RPG Maker game.I wouldn't say this game is bad but there's really nothing that made me excited or interested in playing it.  Do not recommend.			"

Skyborn is a narratively focused RPG by Dancing Dragon Games, set in a rich but dark steam-punk world. While fairly linear in terms of narrative, it offers plenty of exploration and combat alongside. But how well does Skyborn set itself apart in an ever-increasing saturated genre? Find out in the video review above!I hope this helps you make a well placed and decided purchase.

												Couldn't stop playing. If you love JRPG's you will love it for sure.I like how simple the controls were, and the fact that there are no random encounters, which means your free to backtrack if you felt like you might have missed something. I do wish there was more customization and a general breakdown of what each stat means - sure some of them are fairly easy to guess such as magic defense. Doesn't mean a description isn't desired anymore though - many of these types of games have slight differences in how they treat certain stats.Agility for example might mean how fast I get my turn (Don't think so since they have a speed stat as well)It might mean how accurate I am, or how often I dodge (or both)anyway you get the idea - I don't like to guess.The characters and plot are the main driving factors here, while the gameplay is good, but nothing I felt was all that intuitive, though the main characters fighting style is a bit different than the norm.Overall I definitely recommend it , and had lots of fun.

												If you're an RPG fan I'd say pick this game up while it's on sale (at least 75% off) or in a bundle. I found the story premise to be interesting, the art to be overall nice looking, and the dungeons to be well designed. It's a fun game worth playing, but the asking price is entirely too high for what the game is. The following reasons are why I think that the game isn't worth what they are asking for it:1) The game is WAY too short for the pricetag. I did absolutely everything to do in game--all the sidequests as well as the optional bosses--and I clocked in at just under 15 hours of in-game time, which includes a few times when I left the game open while doing other things. I would expect at least 15 hours of base gameplay and 3~5 hours of extras for what amounts to about $15 USD.2) The plot was interesting, but extremely under developed; the ending also did not wrap things up as well as it could have. I would have liked to see a lot more time spent developing the world lore--both historical and present--in side quests and other optional events. I would also have liked to see more intra-character development in optional quests, events, and other places.3) The crafting system, while a good idea, was poorly designed. The UI was terrible (generic message window instead of a more in-depth interface that would let you know exactly what you were crafting) and the only things worth crafting were the +2 weapons. If this system had given the TLC it deserved, it could have added hours on to the fun bonus content.4)  The battle system is poorly balanced. I went through the entire game in hard mode. On the plus side, the beginning part of the game was actually hard enough so that I had to use items (I am a person who stockpiles items ""for when I need them"" and then never uses them), but by the time I got to my first class change I was tearing through the enemies like they were paper. The only battles that gave me trouble were the arena ones, the Venom Depth ones, Saehral, and the final boss (although the final boss was only troublesome because of bad timing). I believe I finished the game at around level 66 (Alda was 74ish because she was 10 levels ahead of everyone else), but only because beating Saehral levelled me up at least 15 levels.5) Bugs. There were some minor bugs regarding being able to walk on tiles that you shouldn't, but the big ones was that some of the item and augment effects didn't work as advertised.			"

												The Elder Scrolls V: SkyrimFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls action role-playing video game series, following The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Skyrim was released on November 11, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Three downloadable content (DLC) add-ons were released—Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn—which were repackaged into The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Edition, which released on June 4, 2013.Skyrim's main story revolves around the player character's efforts to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. Set two hundred years after the events of Oblivion, the game takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops their character by improving their skills. Unlike previous The Elder Scrolls games, Skyrim does not require the player to select a character class at the beginning of the game, negating a problem the development team felt previous entries had by forcing the player into a rigid play-style too early into the game. Skyrim continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.The game was developed using the in-house Creation Engine, built specifically for the game. Skyrim is not a direct sequel to previous The Elder Scrolls games, and was considered a spiritual successor to Oblivion and 2008's Fallout 3. The team opted for a more unique and diverse game world than Oblivion's Cyrodiil, which game director and executive producer Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers particularly responding well to the refined character development and setting. The game shipped over seven million copies to retailers within the first week of its release, and sold over 20 million copies across all three platforms.GameplaySee also: Gameplay of The Elder Scrolls seriesThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing game, playable from either a first- or third-person perspective. The player may freely roam over the land of Skyrim, which is an open world environment consisting of wilderness expanses, dungeons, cities, towns and villages.[3] The player may navigate the game world more quickly by riding horses, or by utilizing a fast-travel system that allows them to warp to previously-discovered locations.[4] The game's main quest can be completed or ignored at the player's preference after the first stage of the quest is finished. Non-player characters (NPCs) populate the world and can be interacted with in a number of ways; the player may engage them in conversation, marry an eligible NPC or kill them. As in previous Elder Scrolls games, killing certain NPCs can make some quests or items unobtainable. Some NPCs cannot be killed. If witnessed, crimes like murder and theft accrue the player bounty points in each of the world's nine districts. Should the player be stopped by a guard, they may wipe their bounty with gold or jail time, or may resist arrest which will trigger an aggressive pursuit. NPCs may allocate the player additional side-quests, and some side-quests have parameters adjusted based on nearby dungeons the player has yet to explore.[5][6] Some NPCs that are befriended or hired by the player may act as companions who will accompany the player and provide aid in combat.[7] The player may choose to join factions, which are organized groups of NPCs such as the Dark Brotherhood, a band of assassins or the player may choose to destroy them.[8] Each of the factions has an associated quest path to progress through. The cities and towns in the game world each have an economy, which the player can stimulate by completing jobs such as farming.[9]The player character engages in combat with monsters while exploring a dungeon. The player may dual-wield weapons and magic at once in order to be more effective against enemies.A perpetual objective for the player is to develop their character. At the beginning of the game, the player creates their character by selecting one of several races, including humans, elves and anthropomorphic (including cat and lizard-like) creatures, and then customizes their character's appearance.[10] Over the course of the game, the player improves their character's skills, which are numerical representations of their ability in certain areas. There are eighteen skills divided evenly between the three schools of combat, magic and stealth. When the player has trained skills enough to meet the required experience, their character levels up. Each time their character levels, the player may choose to select a skill-specific ability called a perk, or store perk points for later use. Unlike earlier entries in The Elder Scrolls series which used a character class system to determine which skills would contribute to the character's leveling, Skyrim allows the player to discover preferred skills as they play the game and rewards the player with more experience when a frequently-used skill is leveled.[5][11] A head-up display (HUD) appears when any of the player's three main attributes are being depleted. Attributes regenerate over time, although this process can be accelerated by using potions or regenerative spells. Health is depleted primarily when the player takes damage, and the loss of all health results in death. Magicka is depleted by the use of spells and by being struck by lightning-based attacks. Stamina determines the player's effectiveness in combat and is depleted by sprinting, power attacking, and being struck by frost-based attacks. The player's inventory can be accessed from the menu and items can be viewed in 3D, which may prove essential in solving puzzles found in dungeons.[12] "

												Skyborn is a game for any RPG enthusiast, though for 13.99 I found it a bit rough round the edges, it pulls through with fun combat/characters and some decent art. If you can put the RPG maker feel behind yourself and look at it like you would an older final fantasy game, you will have a blast. If you love RPGS, You will love starbron			"

												While it may be an RPGMaker Game with RPGMaker-ish textures and RPGMaker-ish Enemy Battle Portraits, I think it's hands-down the single best RPGMaker Game I've ever seen. Actually I think that's not doing it justice, I think it's actually one of the best Classic-Style RPGs I've seen. The level of detail that was put into this game with it's multitude of custom-drawn character artwork, each with multiple facial expressions. The battle system was fun and interesting, and not once did it feel ""dull"" or ""repetitive"" as these RPGMaker games tend to do sometimes.Even with the Vanilla RPGMaker Map Textures, this game knew exactly what it wanted to be and the Steampunk-ish world-setting was actually very beautiful to look at, I kinda had a huge nostalgia trip back to the days of SNES-Era Squaresoft Games such as Final Fantasy III while I was playing this. (That's what we called them back then. Nowadays, we say ""Square Enix"" and ""Final Fantasy VI"")I absolutely fell in love with the universe and it's characters. (Especially Chaska) And while the story never really graduates beyond your archtypical ""Noble Rebels versus Evil Empire"" which we've seen hundreds of times before, I feel as if that's not really much of a point against it when this game is so well made and so much fun to play.In short, this is not the ""same ol' same ol' RPGMaker Game just like all the others."" It really stands out from the very crowded scene of RPGMaker titles which all seem to blend together sometimes. And it's just plain really damn good. Should you buy it? Up to you honestly, but I most definitely recommend it.			"

												Without a doubt, one of the more enjoyable jrpg's, there's enough story driving you through each area for it to not feel nearly as repetitive as most of them. Even the music will make you raise an eyebrow in notice every now and then, the game feels like the devs actually cared about it. Downsides, it IS a rather short game, took about 5+ hrs to complete, but that's because you never actually have to grind. Also, although it is story driven, there are few extra areas to explore, gameplay is very linear. Despite this, still felt like a very enjoyable and complete package, pick it up if you want a good story to hold you through a day.			"

												This game looked great when I started to play it. The graphics were nice, and the steampunk theme went along really well.But there was just one part that ruined my experience. The controls.I just couldn't play this. I couldn't edit the controls in the options menu, and I had to click on my mouse instead of using the arrow keys or WASD.Whenever I clicked, the character I was controlling would go all over the place, instead of where I need the character to go.Like when I click to the left, the character would go left, make a turn, go right, then go down. This keeps on happening and I just decided to stop playing.DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!			"

												This is a pretty good game, all things considering, it was made using the rpg maker I believe and it runs great. The art style is a great mix of old school rpg over world with very beautiful dialogue characters, not sure how to describe it but it is very well done. The combat is clean. It is turn based typical rpg combat with a cool new ""Threat"" mechanic that adds another depth to strategizing during combat. The combat is not animated save for the attacks but the enemy sprites look fantastic and you feel powerful using your different weapons and skills. The one gripe I have had with this game so far was the amount of time it took me to format my 360 controller to work with the game as the mouse and key board setting was not very comfortable, here is a tip when setting up controller pad, “C” is the “A (green)” button. And to access the configurations hit f1 but make sure you are not in any menus when you are tinkering with the layout. If you like old school rpgs you will love this game, also it is on humble bunde so you can get it for super cheap atm.			"

Still, from what I've seen, this is a really charming RPG, with characters full of personality, a steampunk world (always a bonus) and not incredibly cliché plot (in a RPG, inconceivable!). A lot of people may not give it a second glance in their Humble Bundle package, but it really deserves some attention. Also, the art is gorgeous and the dialogue snappy, what more can you ask?			"

												Overall, this a very good game. Although it's got a few problems, these can easily be overlooked.The Good________Story: The plot is engaging, with a lot of neat moments where you feel emotionally compelled to keep playing. If you're playing an RPG, you NEED a good story to compel play. At the beginning you're forced to betray/trick someone to save your family. Who isn't willing to do everything they can for their family?BGM: The music is very atmospheric, usually fitting situation well and sound very much like music from games on the PS2 or XBOX. The music is in stereo as well, but this is less useful than stereo sound effects.Graphics: The visuals are reminiscent of the 16-bit era of console gaming in terms of color and the sprite drawing methods common on the NES/SNES, Genisis, and PSX. More than anything else I'm reminded of the original Dragon Warrior (Dragon Quest) 1-3 and Breath of Fire 1 and 2 games in regards to gameplay, with a Town overmap, a menu overmap, dungeon overmap, and world overmap, along with the turn based combat system. Also, when going full screen on my monitor the game doesn't look bad, but doesn't have 1080p support running at 640x480, so probably won't work well with or look good on TVs.The Bad_______Sound: The sound effects are very subpar by todays standards, but equal to if not better than those of the 16-bit and 32-bit console era. The sound effects do not seem to be in stereo.Sound/Visual Timing: Often sound effects, i.e. attacks in combat, will occur just before the visual identifier does. This tends to throw the combat immersion right out the window for me, but it's not overly horrible, and certainly doesn't break the game.The Ugly_______Controls: X-input controllers, that is to say anything resembling the Xbox 360 controller, have wonky button command registers, with Menu/Cancel being assigned to B and Interact/Accept being assinged to X, and Previous Page/Next Page being assigned to Back/Start respectively. Worse, still, there is no way to reassign them in game.The controls for D-input controllers, resembling Playstation 2 or 3 controllers, is much better with Menu/Cancel being assigned to X and Interact/Accept being assigned to O, and Previous Page/Next Page assigned to L2/R2 respectively. The Logitech F series controllers 310, 510, and 710, are able to switch between these input types, so I recommend using D-input with them. I've tested PS3, Wireless Xbox 360 for Windows, and Logitech F510 controllers with this game.Mouse and keyboard are simple enough with the avatar attempting to take the shortest route to where you click on the overmaps or moving in the cardinals with the arrow keys, and clicking on commands and enemies in combat or selecting them with left/right arrow keys and pressing enter.

												Skyborn is a rather unique RPG game in the sense that it plays somewhat like an old Dragon Quest game. It has a first-person battle system, with vastly different skills for each character. It also features XP spots, shiny lights that give you a good experience boost. There are several levels of difficulty, which can be changed if you want to increase or decrease the challenge. There are quite a few achievements, most of which are practically unmissable if you explore everything and talk to everyone. There aren't many side quests, but a few of them do give achievements and good rewards. There's even an arena/colisseum to test your mettle (which I'd advise taking on as soon as you get your final party member). The story isn't anything new, but it is interesting and fun nonetheless. The banter between the characters is humorous and entertaining, especially Claret and Sullivan. Skyborn is ultimately an unfortunately somewhat short RPG but fun nonetheless. You will be glad you played it but will be left wanting more. So in the mean time, play Echoes of Aetheria afterwards.Length: 10-15 hours, depending on play stylePros:A good story, some funny parts, mostly light-hearted but with some dark bits here and thereFun gameplay, some challenging fights, battle arenaNice custom tilesets and graphicsGreat character art that conveys emotions and goes well with the dialogueSnarky dialogue and humor, some funny easter eggs and references here and thereCons:Short game. Ended too soon but felt complete for the most partRPG Maker game. So with that, it has some of the same annoyances that most RPG Maker games have: No resolution options, stretched fullscreen, no D-pad support for gamepads, etc.tl;dr: Definitely get it on sale.			"

												Decent game, especially for an RPGmaker title. Lots of custom artwork and it isn't the typical half baked story made with stock assets. I liked the steampunk setting and the threat system for battles is nice, it helps when you can manage who's going to be attacked and not just someone at random. Being able to change difficulty whenever you want is good too.That being said, overall it doesn't really feel like a $15 game, maybe pick it up on sale.			"

												I played about 40 minutes of this game. I felt thrown into the story instead of being introduced. The amount of dialog I had to read and the amount of the game that was being controled by the computer with me just reading cutscenes made it feel like I was playing a 16bit top down call of duty game. It could of given the player more freedom to move around and control their own experience instead of doing effectively everything for the player.			"

												Played about an hour into it, it's a very well-made RPG game and the character art is GORGEOUS. The writing is really, really good and the main character and so far supporting characters are very interesting and multi-layered. Battles seem fair and the game even comes with an easy, normal, and difficult mode if you're feeling under- or over-challenged. Music fits the mood, and the level design seems pretty good so far. I'm already very interested in the steampunk world and the game's own story, and I'll definitely be playing this one to completion!			"

												Tl;DR: Bugs, awful storyline that could've been written by a twelve year old, same old pixel-rpg elements, brings nothing worthwhile to the table. 3/10For the however-long I played this game, I never want to play it again. I was lucky enough to get it free in a giveaway, but if you are considering paying for this, I beg you to consider your money put elsewhere.The story, and characters, are quite frankly, abyssmal. You play Claret Spencer, your typical 18 (16? I don't know she was never given an age.) year old-raging-on-hormones-because-all-girls-do-that shop mechanic. The characters act so suprised about things that should be understood so easily. The characters had to re-explain to Claret over and over certain aspects of the universe, like skyborns and magic. I've been here for ten minutes and I understand everything in this games history better than the main character that has spent her life here.As for bugs, straight off the first weird conversation scene thing, you walk out of your shop and can just ♥♥♥♥ing walk through guard rails and stairs to stand in puddles or walls. The stairs are also really gimicky, sometimes you get thrown off of them into walls and stuff, but don't worry, just phase your way back into reality by walking in said wall till you reach the actual path again.This game brings nothing new that is worthwhile to the table. It has a ""threat"" system, where enemies attack whoever of your party attacks them more, which at first seems like a cool idea, till you get a mage and relize you can constantly heal the character they're attacking and never worry about said mage taking damage, pretty much impossible to die, making combat boring pretty fast.WARNING: SPOILERS -- What I really wanted from this game was choice, I wanted to join the super-cool skyborn soldiers but instead the game makes them out to be complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who try to kill you, a random human they've never seen before, whenever they meet you. At one point you're told to follow the rebels back to their hideout and report back to a skyborn to get your brother out of prison. I was totally ready to do that, but then the ""Red Spectre"" tells you what ""horrible"" people the skyborn are, torturing humans to see if they can use magic. I didn't care, sounds like an effective way to see who can use magic to me! But when the time comes you have no choice and you're character imediately without your consent is like ""HOW HORABLE IL HALP!!!!XOXOXO"".I could keep going, there are TONS of plot holes in this game, your brother apparently sells your shop, and you along with it, to an actually nice rich guy who your character hates for no reason, simply because your brother wants to go out and see the world...or something. Oh and your character is mad at the skyborn because they arrested your friend/boyfriend/employee for being a half-breed when he is in fact a half-breed and the skyborn were totally right. But whatever, you're automatically good no matter what you do because you're the hero, right!?!?!Anyway, this game just infuriated me to no end, I actually quit when it MADE me sign up for the rebels. 3/10 would not play again.

The game it's made with RPG Maker, a japanese tool which is over 22 years old, which makes the locked low resolution make sense.			"

												Short version spoiler free: Not worth $15 and not well thought out.Second boss appears to be impossible to beat on primary default difficulty (Normal?).  I've gone back, spent lots of gold upgrading my armor and such on all my people, I had already gone through every cavern and crevas prior to getting there and battled EVERY encounter.  According to this, I was already at the maximum level I could achieve from that point in time.  If you can't ge more random encounters, you can't level up further.  The boss is immortal, and auto heals it's self while attacking all of you simultaniously.  Heals 1000-2000 HP per turn and you deal between 400-900 per turn. (Turn meaning all the way around once basically) "

												Its extremely generic. Like, I dont leave reviews such as these, but I have played several other RPG's in my time. (ATTENTION: THERE ARE SPOILERS. STOP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT THEM) The story is generic: one ""bad"" government owns the area your character lives in; they are racist against a species of people. You are trying to attack the leaders. It's not very engaging, and the quickness from where you go from a recruit to a rebelling group to the leader is almost laughable. the battle style is very reminicient of earthbound-but thats not necisarilly bad. However, this game does have amazing graphics along with a great style that you can tell the developers worked hard on.All in all, would I reccomend this game at 15 dollars? No? If its on sale at under 10, it may be worth your time to take a look at it.			"

It's totally linear as in questing and travel for the most part, but I did find the story enjoyable and my only gripe is that there is no continue after the main quest.  This game would be in my minds the perfect little budget RPG if they let you keep playing to the finish some of the stuff like the arena and so on.  But I highly recommend anyone who played games like Legend of Zelda and Dragon Knight of old to try it out.			"

Games are about the feeling and the fun of playing it ... this game has entertained me many hours and now that ive also got it on Steam i can enjoy it again and i still love it. The graphics are cheap and rpgmaker stylebut they feel quite nice. The storyline is at one side predictable but at the other side its a very charming story and it does attract your interest .. the gameplay itself feels good and the combat though not the most innovative can be quite challenging but still not feeling grindy at times (Play it on hard difficulty, anything below that might be to easy for some :D)Overall a nice game worth being on Steam(99% of rpgmaker games is still crap, but this one luckily is alot better ;D)			"

												1. The screen is entirely black screen in fullscreen, can only play in a tiny unrezisable window.2. Gamepad buttons binded to wrong buttons, no option to rebind keys to practical places.3. Can only move character with analog stick even though it's movement is not analog.4. The game is slow and boring.The game is almost unplayable and not fun in this state imo. I refunded it.			"

Posted: August 4, 2014
												After going through the game twice I decided I'd review it. Let's start with the good:Pros:Probably the best overall of the RPG Maker games.The protagonists are generally likeable and believable characters.The antagonists do a good job of making you hate and want to beat them.The game mechanics have a reasonable amount of depth and options that are introduced gradually throughout the course of the game which prevents information overload.With one exception, the game plays fair and enemies generally have access to the same options and resources as the player.Cons:Very short, especially for an RPG.Very easy, even on Hard difficulty. Even the optional superboss.The final boss has an unavoidable death combo and the fight lasts long enough he usually gets at least one chance to use it on you at which point everyone dies. He is otherwise entirely trivial.Mostly linear. There aren't many side quests overall and most of them are along the lines of complete an additional objective in the area you were going anyways instead of directing you somewhere else. It's also rare there is more than one place you could go and get something done at any given time.Once you get past the first few levels you no longer gain skills by leveling up, only by reaching certain points in the game.What I'd like to have seen:At least twice as long.Buff the difficulty considerably (leave Easy easy for those not looking for a hard game).Buff all the final boss' attacks except for the unavoidable death combo, then either make sure you always have time to react or make it not always kill everyone instantly. That way he provides a hard but legitimate challenge.More side quests and side areas.Instead of class changing instantly granting all the skills, make it give one now and the rest with level requirements.Massively buff the super boss. She's honestly a joke, her best attack does 2k or 3k on all at full power. Anyone complaining she's hard didn't go in prepared at all and is taking much more damage than that.			"

												Many of the positive reviews laud it as being one of the best RPGMaker games out there. The others it is compared to must be appalling, rather than merely bad.There's good things about the game- the aesthetics and music are fine for example. The story is simple and predictable, and is hinged on several strokes of unlikely luck. The battle system is poorly tuned and unbalanced, with the rare occasions you have something challenging even if underlevelled then relying on rolling back to an old save or more likely repeating the fight hoping for the status effects to stick or be dodged by your party.If you want a quick jrpg style game and can get it for a tiny amount of money then as other reviews state there are worse choices.

												Unfortunately the combat in this game feels a lot more like a distraction than anything that contributes to the story and the combat mechanics are boring as well.

I'd been playing for an hour, so please make autosave a feature! :(I did like it, but flicking through all the dialogue for an hour again is something I don't really want to do, so I'm a bit disappointed...

I believe in supporting small developers and indie so if you see this game and want to similar experiences to Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy you will not be disappointed. I look at greenlighted games which vastly are alpha or beta unfinished products. Now compare them to ""RPG Maker"" designed games and I shake my head at all of the gems which could be slipping through the cracks, dont let this game be one of them!			"

												Good RPGMaker Game that reminds you of the ""Golden Days"" of RPGs during the SNES Era.The Battle System is what amazed me about this game. A Threat System, in a Turn-based RPG? Awesome! The Action List reminded me of games like Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy Tactics, while the Threat System clearly takes ideas out of MMORPGs.The Crafting system has its flaws; you can't see WHAT you're about to make until you've already made it, but thankfully you can save anywhere so you can save before you use your materials. A couple hours into the game and I'm already making ""Tier 3"" gear, so something tells me the game isn't hugely long. But then it doesn't have to be; I've played a lot of Sub-5 hour games and enjoyed them for what they were.The story seems well-written thusfar, it is basically a Final Fantasy in a Steampunk setting. Pretty standard fare, though this isn't a bad thing for those looking for some nostalgia. The characters seem fairly well-done, each with their strengths and weaknesses (though the Claret seems a touch overpowered). The Magic and Energy Systems are well-implemented and make sense, and the Class Changes were an interesting addition as well.Overall: 8.5Short, enjoyable nostalgia trip for those of you who remember the SNES Era Final Fantasy/Lufia-type games fondly.

												This is an awesome game! I generally have two requirements for a game: Good story, and visually pleasing. This is both. And on top of that, it has great music!I breezed through it in about 8 hours, but I'm also severely directionally challenged and tend to wander around the same areas several times, just in case I missed something. This is a good game for wandering, especially in some of the later levels because it's just darn pretty! If you're like me and you want to do ALL THE QUESTS and find ALL THE THINGS, you can probably get another few hours out of it. Aditionally, when they tell you that you're about to go past the point of no return, they really mean it! If you have unfinished quests, or if you just want to meander through some areas again, make sure you do it before taking on that mission.Overall, it's a gorgeous game, great music, and a wonderful story line. Definitely worth the money.			"

												All in all, you can play through it in about 6-7 hours, so not a long game. Nice story, moderately acceptable (if clicéd) characters. Item variety seems OK. Graphics-wise, I wish the ingame character-drawings got nearly the same attention as the one on the boxart. They are jarringly different. It has its own set of bugs (the most annoying is hiding  the enemy life bar about a second after it changes), but it is playable. There is also crafting that can get you some pretty nifty items. All-in-all, nice, but short indie RPG. Not worth the 13€, but for $1 bundle, it was A-OK.			"

The square angular beaches look so weird.Battle system if very fun, with a threat mechanic similar to mmo's yet turn based.Its really short though with the main quest taking me just under 9 hours.Its still worth playing and I would actually suggest this to people who like mmo's due to the fun battle style.

												First off, ignore all the complaining about RPG maker.  If an RPG has a good plot in an interesting setting with unique characters and a good combat system, who cares how it was made?  Luckily, Skyborn has all this and more.  It starts off fairly easy but the combat system has enough depth to really give you a challenge after the first few areas.  I played on medium difficulty and I found the battles challenging and fun.  There are also plenty of optional battles in the late game that will challenge you, but they're not needed to beat the game. The story is the best part of Skyborn.  There's a unique setting combined with memorable characters.  The game is a nice length as well.  It's probably 11 to 15 hours total.  I did all 4 sidequests along with the arena and the Venom Depths which are optional, along with maybe 45 minutes of afking for dinner, beer, and bathroom breaks.  As far as the details of the game go, I enjoyed the level design.  Graphics are SNES level, but I'm playing for the plot and there were some moments where certain levels looked quite pleasing and so I'd say the graphics are fine for the genre.  The plot and setting were great.  This isn't a generic steampunk cliché universe.  There's no annoying puzzles and all but one time it was clear where to go next. The crafting and augmenting system is deep enough to cause you to put some real thought into what to upgrade and it's fairly open.  You can skip crafting if you like, but it's fun to forge very powerful weapons for your favorite character.  The music was ok, not fantastic.  Sound effects were solid.  In the first 2 to 3 hours of the game, the enemies can seem a little repetitive and it's a bit too easy (on medium) but that changes.  There's also no real ""grinding"" levels.  Enemies do not respawn so it's to your advantage to fight every enemy, but you don't just have to sit around leveling up.  Bosses are challenging and feel epic.  Overall, I'd give the game an 8/10 for being an enjoyable, well made RPG.  It's a bit expensive at the current 15$ price tag, but if you can pick up this game on a sale, it's worth it.			"

												I got Skyborn in a bundle a while back and played it last week, and it's a surprisingly decent game - there's almost no grinding, the characters are fairly diverse (though there's a slight flaw with one of them due to how his MP mechanic works in the late game), it's somewhat well written (though the plot is fairly generic) and it doesn't overstay it's welcome (since it's only 8hrs long, though I imagine you could get another one or two with the bonus dungeon I didn't touch). It may not be worth £12, but I could see it being worth buying at 66% or 75% off if you fancy a decent JRPG or RPGMaker game.			"

												Skyborn had a fun cast of playable characters and a combat system that's simple yet enjoyable. It's sort of short but a pleasurable experience all around. If you want something that won't take a lot of time, I'd recommend this game.			"

												Skyborn is . . . competent, I guess I'd say. Not amazing, but not bad. Its strongest points are the setting, story, and characters. Admittedly, there are a lot of bog standard tropes across the board, but they're pretty well-executed. The world is interesting, and I found myself wanting to know more about it. The characters are well-written and more fun than I expected. The story could have benefited from more development and better pacing, but still, it was engaging enough to keep me playing to the end (seven hours or so).That's more than I can say for the combat, however. My biggest issue with the game is how boring the combat became. I'm not an RPG veteran by any stretch, and I paid almost no attention to Skyborn's mechanics, yet I was still able to snooze through all but one fight. Sooner rather than later, Claret got some mega-OP skills that obliterated anything that tried to get in her way, which completely trivialized most of the enemies and turned encounters into tedious detours. Also, the combat screen uses default RPG Maker enemy sprites, which often look weirdly out of place amongst the otherwise consistent anime aesthetics.Final verdict: yes, it's worth playing, but wait for a sale.

												Skyborn is a beautifully crafted world with art work that reminsces from the SNES era. The graphics and art are better than that, but the RPG style is exactly the same.Anyone who played those games, I mean really played them love them. You'll love Skyborn too. It mostly does everything those games did.However Skyborn is a small game. I would call this a one and done deal. You play it once, feel fully satisfied, and never touch it again. That's ok. Not every game has to be a game you play a bunch of times. Not every book is a book you read multiple times. Not every movie is a movie you watch more than once. Enjoy the game for what it is because it is a lot of fun. I had a great time with it.Classic JRPG feel with better graphics. If that's what you're looking for, you'll get it in this pint sized adventure. If you spend 4 hours on this game, you rushed through it and shame on you. If you spend 6 or more, you spent time and explored.			"

												A nice little RPG for the price. The game really ramps up in difficulty after about 5 hours in playing on the hardest difficulty. For a while I had actually forgot I was playing on the hardest difficulty. At this point there were several fights that had me worried I might actually have to restart from my save. After getting the current tier armor and weapons upgraded and augmented I still have one or two party members go down each fight. Steel Slimes hit like a truck >.> Boss fights up to this point have been fairly simple with them dying in a round or two. I have yet to fight a boss since the difficulty curve has been upped. If the regular monster battles are any indicator it is going to be very difficult. There is also a little bit of humor in the game that I find quite enjoyable. Storytelling is pretty good as well.Overall I am quite pleased with this game.			"

												I beat the game on hard all the way through and it was fun.  It took about 16 hours of real time and that was with exploring everything and fighting every mob/boss I could find mixed with a little bit of backtracking.The soundtrack is good.The characters are likeable.The story is fairly simple but still very good and interesting.The architecture of the game is aesthetically pleasing.No random battles, the monsters are all visible (though I strongly suggest you fight them all if playing on hard).  Also if on hard explore everywhere, limited resources.The combat system is ok.Gear comparison/viewing items stats is extremely tedious.If you like JRPG's I recommend this game despite a few flaws overall it was definitely a fun experience and worth playing.

												I know people give RPG maker games a lot of flack but just because something is made with a game making engine doesnt mean it has to be terrible. Both Unity and the Unreal Engine could be considered game making tools, albeit on the more high end. I think the reason that RPG Maker gets such a rough rep is that its so accessible anyone can use it and therefor you end up with more♥♥♥♥♥♥than gold. Happily Skyborn is pure gold and while the actual tile sets are mostly of the stock type that come with the set, the character portraits are amazingly detailed and expresive and the author is himself a professional musician so the soundtrack is incredible. Set in a steampunk world where the humans are oppressed by a group of winged beings known as the Skyborn, the reluctant heroine Claret is drawn into a rebellion, first merely to save her brother but then out of altruism as she sees just how badly the Skyborn treat the lower classes. It has a great cast of likeable characters and while, as with many RPG's the combat can be a bit grindy, it has enough clever mechanics to keep you going til the end. 20 hours game for $14.99 is pretty good value. Get it.			"

UNDERRATED SNES-like RPGGot this game free and expect nothing out of this to be honest. However, I've enjoyed this game so much and plan to finish it. Just played couple of hours but already there's a good story behind this UNDERRATED gems.PRO SNES RPG nostalgia. Pretty good story. Unique main character. Easy navigation / control. Non-complicated RPG system. Polished simple graphic style.CONS Path a little too linear. It's probably just in the beginning, but pretty much lack freedoms. Probably just beginning, but enemies too easy even at hard.MY SCORE:  8/10  "

												Growing up, the first RPG I ever played was Dragon Warrior on the NES, then it was Zelda, then between the NES and SNES I played the Final Fantasies, etc.  JRPGs were a genre I loved, even if I didn't really know the genre name back then.  I haven't played a JRPG-ish type of game since Albert Odyssey on the Sega Saturn back in the mid 90's honestly, so when I saw Skyborn pop up, I was intrigued.  I was hopeful that Skyborn would capture that spirit and feel that made me fall in love with the genre (but not rely on nostalgia).  My expectations were met and exceeded.  This is a fantastic JRPG game that has all the elements that make the genre great.  The story is fantastic, the battle system is tight, the graphics are clear and crisp and the musical score is extremely well done.  Another thing I enjoy here are that there are elements of random turn-based battles, but it's not random at all.  Enemies walk on paths that you can somewhat predict.  If you engage an enemy, you battle.  If you avoid the enemy, you don't.  There are certain narrow walkways where it would be hard to avoid an enemy, but honestly, you could probably play the entire game with only accidentally engaging a few enemies.  Or, you can choose to engage all enemies.  I love this option, because you still get plenty of fighting time, but you have a say in exactly when you'll be battling. The end result is a 8 hour (if you play just to win) to probably 15 hour (if you do all the quests and explore everywhere) JRPG that anyone will love who is a fan of the genre.   "

												Surprinsingly enjoyable. I did not think that I would like an rpgmaker game as much as this one, especially since it's turn-based. I got the game when it was free, so wait for a sale.Awesome points:There is a lot of freedom in this game. You can do whatever you want, whenever you want. There's crafting, an arena, collectables and tons of places to explore.The story is pretty well written. The characters were memorable. Their individual storylines were awesome to read and wove into the main story really well. (Personally, Alda's is my favourite storyline. Especially the end.)It plays a little like a visual novel. With fighting and exploring. Not bad. Lots of reading.Downsides include:Lack of map, extremely easy to get lost. I would love to have a minimap or something to show locations. Very little tooltips. Though, that may be an upside as well? It takes a bit of experimenting and trial & error to work out exactly what's going on in the game.Mouse interaction was not smooth. It was difficult to navigate the inventory. Mouse control over the menus was pretty clunky as well.Quest menu sucked. Sometimes the writing at the end would be cut off and it was impossible to read the last couple of steps. Sometimes I forgot who I had to return my sidequest to, as the place wasn't stated. Ended up running around for half an hour talking to everyone I came across.If you can deal with the downsides, the game is enjoyable and worth the time.			"

												I wasn't expecting much when I started up Skyborn, but was pleasantly surprised almost immediately. It has a very well-developed and likable cast of characters. The combat and game mechanics are just deep enough to make you plan things out, but intuitive enough that you'll know what you're doing right away. I especially enjoyed the Augment system, which allows you to add various effects to your gear and dramatically improve their usefulness. The music is also very well done, enough that I would even be willing to pick up a soundtrack. The story isn't anything spectacular, but it's simple and engaging enough to keep you interested for the entire length of the game (which was about 11 hours, including all of the sidequests). The adjustable difficulty level is also extremely useful, because with a bit of planning and sidequesting, you can become pretty much unstoppable and render most end-game foes meaningless.All in all, I give this an 8/10, and definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a good retro-style RPG.

												Good RPGMaker Game that reminds you of the ""Golden Days"" of RPGs during the SNES Era.The Battle System is what amazed me about this game. A Threat System, in a Turn-based RPG? Awesome! The Action List reminded me of games like Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy Tactics, while the Threat System clearly takes ideas out of MMORPGs.The Crafting system has its flaws; you can't see WHAT you're about to make until you've already made it, but thankfully you can save anywhere so you can save before you use your materials. A couple hours into the game and I'm already making ""Tier 3"" gear, so something tells me the game isn't hugely long. But then it doesn't have to be; I've played a lot of Sub-5 hour games and enjoyed them for what they were.The story seems well-written thusfar, it is basically a Final Fantasy in a Steampunk setting. Pretty standard fare, though this isn't a bad thing for those looking for some nostalgia. The characters seem fairly well-done, each with their strengths and weaknesses (though the Claret seems a touch overpowered). The Magic and Energy Systems are well-implemented and make sense, and the Class Changes were an interesting addition as well.Overall: 8.5Short, enjoyable nostalgia trip for those of you who remember the SNES Era Final Fantasy/Lufia-type games fondly.

												The game was good, it had a great storyline (in my opinion) and it reminded me of my love for RPGs, it's clearly made with the rpg maker VXAce, and I was disappointed to see the lack of spelling errors, (there were maybe 2 or 3). Truthfully, it isn't worth the full price of $14.99, but it was worth every penny I spent on it. (I got it with the rpg maker humble bundle, it was worth about 10 cents for me). The game is really short, I beat it in about 4 hours, but there are plenty of side quests for you to do if you're easily distracted. I'll probably give it an 8 out of 10.			"

												All in all, you can play through it in about 6-7 hours, so not a long game. Nice story, moderately acceptable (if clicéd) characters. Item variety seems OK. Graphics-wise, I wish the ingame character-drawings got nearly the same attention as the one on the boxart. They are jarringly different. It has its own set of bugs (the most annoying is hiding  the enemy life bar about a second after it changes), but it is playable. There is also crafting that can get you some pretty nifty items. All-in-all, nice, but short indie RPG. Not worth the 13€, but for $1 bundle, it was A-OK.			"

												First off, ignore all the complaining about RPG maker.  If an RPG has a good plot in an interesting setting with unique characters and a good combat system, who cares how it was made?  Luckily, Skyborn has all this and more.  It starts off fairly easy but the combat system has enough depth to really give you a challenge after the first few areas.  I played on medium difficulty and I found the battles challenging and fun.  There are also plenty of optional battles in the late game that will challenge you, but they're not needed to beat the game. The story is the best part of Skyborn.  There's a unique setting combined with memorable characters.  The game is a nice length as well.  It's probably 11 to 15 hours total.  I did all 4 sidequests along with the arena and the Venom Depths which are optional, along with maybe 45 minutes of afking for dinner, beer, and bathroom breaks.  As far as the details of the game go, I enjoyed the level design.  Graphics are SNES level, but I'm playing for the plot and there were some moments where certain levels looked quite pleasing and so I'd say the graphics are fine for the genre.  The plot and setting were great.  This isn't a generic steampunk cliché universe.  There's no annoying puzzles and all but one time it was clear where to go next. The crafting and augmenting system is deep enough to cause you to put some real thought into what to upgrade and it's fairly open.  You can skip crafting if you like, but it's fun to forge very powerful weapons for your favorite character.  The music was ok, not fantastic.  Sound effects were solid.  In the first 2 to 3 hours of the game, the enemies can seem a little repetitive and it's a bit too easy (on medium) but that changes.  There's also no real ""grinding"" levels.  Enemies do not respawn so it's to your advantage to fight every enemy, but you don't just have to sit around leveling up.  Bosses are challenging and feel epic.  Overall, I'd give the game an 8/10 for being an enjoyable, well made RPG.  It's a bit expensive at the current 15$ price tag, but if you can pick up this game on a sale, it's worth it.			"

												LOVED This game. It took me about 8 hours to clear (I played in offline mode on my laptop for half of it). The combat is balanced and the characters are interesting and all useful in their own way. All characters are customizable from picking which skills they learn, to choosing equipment, to finally choosing which item/buff to apply to each piece of equipment. Building up my characters was the funnest part. The combat is interesting. It has a threat system where enemies focus on the party members doing the flashiest moves. Exploring the game world is vastly rewarding and encouraged. Not only do you find great gear, but you can find experience points by exploring. The game also has additional side content that I didnt complete in my 8 hour playthrough. This includes, a fighting arena, a side dungeon to explore, and finding a deck of cards that has been scattered across the land. My only complaint is that the weapon/armor crafting system in this game seems tacked on and forgettable. The items you can craft are limited and you usually have them by the time you can craft them anyway. Having said that, this is a game that no RPG fan should miss out on. 9.5/10			"

												An endlessly charming and simple Japanese-style RPG that brings to mind Square's SNES efforts, as well as lesser-known Genesis and Turbografx adventures (Lunar and Cosmic Fantasy come immediately to mind).  Easy to grasp mechanics and an interesting story punctuated with excellent writing and the first truly likeable cast I've come across in quite some time.  It speaks volumes that I enjoyed this humble little title more than recent multi-million efforts from big name developers.  It's quite succinct at only 7-10 hours long, but there's also little pointless backtracking and padding to slog through.Absolutely recommended to gamers that look back fondly on the golden age of console RPGs.Note: Disregard people dismissing Skyborn because of the engine it was built with.  RPG Maker is fully capable of producing unique and captivating games in the right hands, as evidenced by Yume Nikki, To the Moon and the subject of this review.			"

												For a casual RPG player like myself, Skyborn was a wonderful little game with a poignant story, fun gameplay, and quick pace.  There was never a need for tedious grinding--in fact, you could avoid most battles if you wanted to, but I don't know how that would affect your leveling.  Shops were placed conveniently between stretches of dungeon to buy (or make) better weapons and armor.  You could also buy supplies, although the plentiful item chests usually provided enough for me.  Some areas (Nordenwald Forest *cough*) were rather lengthy with extended puzzles involving painful walking from one end of the map to the other.  Aside from the particularly grueling dungeon and the utter lack of promised side quests, Skyborn proved to be a short but delightful game.  I'll certainly be replaying it in the future to try different class combinations and fighting styles.			"

												Played through this in about six hours; in one sitting.  Why in one sitting, you ask?  Because I couldn't tear myself away!  The story here does a rather good job of telling itself during that six hours(which could be four or less if you're in a hurry).  It's a fairly nuanced tale with all the proper tragic hero tropes, plot twists and surprise endings, but it doesn't do a lot of padding to get there.  If you're looking for any kind of gameplay balance, do speed runs.  Otherwise this game is incredibly easy even on its hardest settings, although there is one battle you will never win ;).All in all, for $7.49 (at half price) I felt like I got my money's worth and then some.  This is a rather well-polished RPGmaker gem that will leave you wanting more from this developer in the future!			"

												Great classic RPG feel to the game with a decent storyline. The music is very nice, and there are skills and members to keep the fighting fun. It is also very rewarding to explore, which keep you interested. On the downside the game is a bit short, but still worth the time and money.			"

												I couldn't remove a selection and I couldn't make an intermediate selection so I went with yes.  I enjoyed playing the game for the most part.  The story may use a tried and true plot device, but it does contain a few twists that I, at least, didn't see coming.  The world is fairly small, but most of the areas are very diversified so it doesn't feel that way.  Also the smithing is a nice touch, though I would have liked to make higher quality armor as well. My problem with the game was the combat balance.  For one I almost immediately turned the game up to hard.  This is something I almost never do as I generally like to keep combat just difficult enough that I keep interested without becoming a hassle.  On Normal there was absolutely no challenge.  For most random encounters that didn't change much on Hard.  Boss battles, came in two varities: 'What just wiped me in 2 seconds' or 'what did I just roll over.'  There are certain skills in the game (For you and your enemies) that are just ridiculously strong.  But if you don't use them, then battles just drag on because at least with how I was building characters (trying to emphasize +Str as much as I could!) only 1-2 of my characters ever did appreciable amounts of damage.  Also the character classes are very specialized. Only certain people dealt damage, and at times it really felt the only reason ""threat"" existed was to give the tank something to do on his turn.Overall Story is a +, game balance is a -.  Take your pick on which is more important to you.			"

												Solid, enjoyable, well put-together game.The game's difficulty on Normal is a bit too easy, although Hard mode presents a decent challenge, especially earlier on in the game (before you get access to the really OP debuffs).Despite the RPG Maker feel that a lot of people seem to detest, Skyborn's a very polished package.  I noticed a couple small bugs and a couple typos, but that was it on the negatives.I was able to play this with a controller, which was very appreciated.  I used a 3rd party knockoff Xbox360 controller, which didn't require any additional setup upon booting the game.  However, I was able to hit F1 in-game and remap the buttons to something more sensible, the defaults didn't make sense on my particular controller.Dialogue was well-written, enjoyable, and fairly humorous.  Plot, while a bit short, was interesting and flowed well.  Combat system had a nice brisk pace, with good yet swift animations for attacks.The leveling and itemization was a stand-out success, in my mind: armor is equippable by all characters, but if you weigh a character down beyond their carrying capacity, their speed drops off.  There are a few ways of increasing that capacity later in the game.  But that broad eligibility allows a much wider amount of equipment options for each character, as you can trade off weight between different slots to equip items you REALLY want.  The augment system is simple yet robust, offering another layer of customizibility to your characters.  Furthermore, there are two ""class up""s during the game, where you can upgrade each character to a new job class.  The game does a great job of explaining the options prior to selection, so you don't need to consult a third party resource for information.It took me about 15 hours to complete the game, playing in hard mode and completing all optional content&bosses.  I'm a bit of a slow player, though, so most folks will probably take about 7-12 depending on difficulty and completeness.I don't think I'd pay the full $15 for this one due to its length, but at sale prices it's a great purchase.Enjoy!

												I don't actually remember buying this game, and when I found it in my library and played it I was pleasantly surpised. It's surprisingly well written, and the gameplay is well balanced.The gameplay is far from revolutionary, apart from the 'threat'-mechanic which I've never seen before, but works really well and is nicely streamlined. It's well balanced, but some areas lack a little polish. That's acceptable since it was made by a small team, and it never breaks the game in any way. The soundtrack is nothing revolutionary either, but at least it's nice music and it fits the settings it plays in.The main characters are well written and realtable. The game succeeded in making me like the heroes and at least disliking the villains enough that I agree with the ultimate goal the heroes are working towards. The story is not overly dramatic, it doesn't try desperately to be funny all the time, and it's not all grim or lighthearted. It introduces characters at a good pace and gives them space to develop over time.This game is like a good fantasy-steampunk book, with monster slaying in between every chapter. The game succeedes in really feeling like an adventure, but it never loses sight of the end goal.			"

												Skyborn is probably the best RPGMaker game in the market, it is a fun RPG with lovely visuals and a great story that will keep you motivated until the end.Pros:  Lovely textures and character drawings.  Well made Steampunk world with an interesting society.  Unforgettable cast of characters.  Nice, fitting soundtrack.  A great story that makes the game more enjoyable.Cons:  The game is short, after 8.5 hrs I've finished the main story. This has a good side, you barely have to do any grinding so all your time in the game will be enjoyable.  Lack of secondary quests, the game is made towards the main story, I only found 2 secondary quests along the way.  The game resolution is locked to 640x480 so I had to play the whole thing on a small window on my 1080p monitor. (You can play it on fullscreen mode but if your monitor is 16:9 it will look stretched)Overall I really enjoyed my experience with Skyborn and would definitely recommend it, specially if you can get it on sale.

												First off the game is only about 7 hours long so if you wanted a game to go trhough in one sitting then this oculd be it.Sure it could be long if you do every single battle and every side quest but probebly only by like 3 hours more. Game play is your typical rpg maker game so there really isn't anything new here  other then the threat meter.Depend on what character has more threat that character will get attacked more. Story is actually pretty well written it kepts me coming back to it so it has that. Music is decent and as far as i can tell it is original. Most of these rpg maker games tend to rip off others but i don't think this one does.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: If I (the reviewer) have played a game that has less than 1 hour of gameplay and is not recommended, means that I did not enjoy or it did not live up to my expectations! Think twice before rating or giving out a comment... Sadly, I cannot review this game properly. Why? Because sadly there is a glitch where the screen flickers like mad if you play it in full screen, this glitch does not happen if you play it on a small window, I don't know if this is a glitch in the game or of the engine that they used which is the RPG Maker VX/VX Ace engine, and sadly you cannot fix this issue, and I'm sorry, I cannot play games in a small window.But, from what I have played, it seemed interesting. But sadly, for modern day computers, I'd suggest not buying it (bare in mind I got this for free from the PCGamer's giveaway) NOT RECOMMENDED :(  "

I were able to kill most bosses in 2-3 turns even on hard mode except for last 2 bosses which were nearly impossible so I gave up and finished it on normal.			"

Enthralling but short would be good for it - also, unlike many RPG games, one of the biggest Pro's for Skyborn: Grinding isn't needed. Or rather, enemies do not respawn, yet there are many ""exploration"" points out there, similar to revealing a new map location in an MMORPG, that grant a considerable amount of experience to your party.

												I give this a recommend, but only a slight one. The game play is short, but works. The characters are nice, although somewhat predictable. What got me was that my party was slowly becoming a glass cannon. You can easily avoid monsters, and there is no obvious leveling ground. As such, I started my ""no turning back now"", and was able to easily make it to the end boss, including killing all the bosses within the area before the final boss.But then, the final boss has an AOE that one shots my entire party. So that is my only complaint, that you really need to attack monsters while going through, don't avoid them. If you do, you can easily end up not knowing the end of the game because the last boss is just so much more powerful.			"

												Among RPG-Maker games this one stands out with its threat system combined with various specilizations for the characters and quite meaningful itemization; Rather than incremental upgrades the choice of gear and augments makes a huge difference in terms of combat damage.Also, by sprinkling experience nodes around the world, you're not forced to fight for the sake of leveling if you want to focus on the story. Well, and of course the story is quite engaging.			"

												Skyborn is a short RPGMaker-made game that's very good looking (in the japanese anime classical style) and has great music.  It exposes interracial and social classes conflicts in a steampunk-fantasy sort of environment. The story is good but the arcs of the characters' stories are not very complicated and there are no important choices to make or crossroads where several endings can develop.Fights are not at every corner of an alley because you can visually choose (most of the times) if you fight enemies or you just ignore them. The story/fighting ratio is well balanced, but while some generic enemies are a piece of cake some bosses are a pain in the mouse's left button. By the way, while some enemies' design goes according to the world presented, some others seem to have been taken out of other very different projects.Gameplay is easy either with a keyboard or with the mouse, but the UI both in the character menus and in battle is a little bit of a mess and if you pause the game for a long time you will have to re-learn almost everything. Fights are repetitive and turn-based and the special effects are not outstanding but acceptable. You can upgrade your characters' classes and abbilities but even then some of they are left behind while others grow.I recommend Skyborn if you like classical J-turn-based-RPGs and you are not too exigent.

												12 hours of solid gameplay, definitely worth the money.

The story is interesting and you will find your way through the game without a problem. BUT there are some things that could be irritating to some people.To start, monster will not respawn, which limits the maximum amount of money and experience. Furthermore, the game has a very linear story line, which is a little bit dissapointing but not bad at all. Moreover, the game seems a little rushed, there are very interesting characters that just vanish. Finaly, some people may think that the developer had more in mind for this world but it `needed to get done`.			"

If you're a fan of the old-school RPG, such as for example the earlier Final Fantasy games, this is surely something for you. Check it out, because I promise you that you won't get disappointed.Beautiful story, and a beautiful game. It has all the things so many games today lack. 10/10			"

												Among RPG-Maker games this one stands out with its threat system combined with various specilizations for the characters and quite meaningful itemization; Rather than incremental upgrades the choice of gear and augments makes a huge difference in terms of combat damage.Also, by sprinkling experience nodes around the world, you're not forced to fight for the sake of leveling if you want to focus on the story. Well, and of course the story is quite engaging.			"

												Excellent game that really has its own unique feel and style. The characters and dialogue are great, are the environments are lush. My main complaint is that it's seems rather short: the game was over before I at all felt like the story was coming to a climax (there were actually a few sidequests that I hadn't quite finished, which I figured I'd have ample opportunity to return to). So my pacing about building equipment and using rare items was totally off. I was also disappointed with the total lack of controlling an airship on a overworld map. Despite these gripes, I really enjoyed the game and heartedly recommend it. I will definitely be playing it again in the future!			"

												Skyborn is a simple 2D game made in rpg maker. the combat is mediocre but lets face it your not playing an rpg maker game for the combat. Skyborn lists an array of interesting characters and a story line that will make you want to keep playing to see how it unfolds. I would recommend it as the price range meets up with what you would expect from a simple little game.			"

The turn base combat is great and thoughtful, all the controls and menus are intuitive and the art and style of the game is quite good. However i wished that all characters had an animation when they speak and sometimes the music just stops and there is no audio, getting rid of all immersion. Other than that the game is fun and if you are thinking of getting it get it.I give it a solid 7.8			"

												This game is really a beauty! Filled with beautiful art, interesting characters and a story that keeps you going without boredom, it gets my full recommendation. It is well balanced, giving you just the right challenge throughout the whole game (although the final battles were long rather than challenging, it doesn't really negate the rest of the game's balance).If you're looking for an RPG game with a different and interesting story, this is definitely for you.There might be three tiny complaints: the dungeons did seem quite similar to each other, the sidequest fanatic in me didn't quite get its hunger satisfied and most importantly - I want more! Give me a sequel, please! I want to dive even further into the universe. I am definitely going to be on the lookout for any other games by this publisher.			"

												After reading the synopsis for this game, I was unsure of what to expect. The story sounded dull, but I was looking for a new RPG to play, so I gave Skyborn a chance. In the end, I am very glad I made that decision.I was enthralled by the lovable characters, the gorgeous environments, and a surprisingly endearing story. Skyborn also utilizes a targeting system called “Threat Levels”, which results in very satisfying battles.Although the game can be completed in a short amount of time, in my opinion, it is worth the full price.  If you are looking for an excellent turn-based RPG to play, I highly recommend this game.			"

												I guess I'm now about 4-5 hours into this game, and I can say that I'm really enjoying it. This comes from one who has almost given up on RPG maker games. Skyborn is a game well done. While I don't anticipate it being very long, I think it should be just long enough. The story is good. The fighting system is good. The music is great. The level of polish is great! At this point, the game has given hints of secrets and things to keep the player busy well after the main quest. There is a coliseum in which I died on my first fight, a whole series of shops reserved for high level people in the Coliseum. I also believe there is probably a bonus dungeon, based upon things the NPCs say. The maker of the game has put a lot of effort into this game. While I would assume the RPG Maker program has it's limitations, at moments, I simply forget this is a RPGM game. The game does not have random enemy encounters. Instead, there are a limited number of on screen enemies. This puts a limit on the experience and gold one can earn. This puts grinding to a minimum and makes the player figure out how to use the system to beat the bosses. The only negatives I can mention is that nearly ALL RPG Maker games have moments of slowdown on my computer for some reason. I can run Skyrim at good FPS, but I think the performance problem is rooted in RPGM and my hardware. I can't fault the maker for that. The other thing, is that despite this game having what seems to be a pretty straightforward crafting system, I have no idea what I'm crafting and how much of each material the thing I am crafting takes. It says, ""200% more ore"" but doesn't tell me exactly how much of what. Perhaps I've missed something early on in the game. Other than that, I can gladly say that this is a great game. There are moments when the story, the action, and the music all come together to a near final fantasy level moment. Since then, I now have Deadly Sin and Deadly Sin 2. I've also got my eye on Echoes of Aetheria. One last thing, I believe I picked this game by either Humble Bundle or one of the bundle sites. If it were not for that, I never would have heard of it. I am glad I came across this gem!			"

												A short, fun game about a strongheaded mechanic, a noble, and three 'others'. The story was good and the game was customizable. If you don't enjoy grinding, Easy gets you through just like a visual novel, a very easy run. The end is somewhat bittersweet. Wonder if the 'enemy general' will ever meet the Empress again.			"

												A nice little RPG for the price. The game really ramps up in difficulty after about 5 hours in playing on the hardest difficulty. For a while I had actually forgot I was playing on the hardest difficulty. At this point there were several fights that had me worried I might actually have to restart from my save. After getting the current tier armor and weapons upgraded and augmented I still have one or two party members go down each fight. Steel Slimes hit like a truck >.> Boss fights up to this point have been fairly simple with them dying in a round or two. I have yet to fight a boss since the difficulty curve has been upped. If the regular monster battles are any indicator it is going to be very difficult. There is also a little bit of humor in the game that I find quite enjoyable. Storytelling is pretty good as well.Overall I am quite pleased with this game.			"

												I wasn't expecting much when I started up Skyborn, but was pleasantly surprised almost immediately. It has a very well-developed and likable cast of characters. The combat and game mechanics are just deep enough to make you plan things out, but intuitive enough that you'll know what you're doing right away. I especially enjoyed the Augment system, which allows you to add various effects to your gear and dramatically improve their usefulness. The music is also very well done, enough that I would even be willing to pick up a soundtrack. The story isn't anything spectacular, but it's simple and engaging enough to keep you interested for the entire length of the game (which was about 11 hours, including all of the sidequests). The adjustable difficulty level is also extremely useful, because with a bit of planning and sidequesting, you can become pretty much unstoppable and render most end-game foes meaningless.All in all, I give this an 8/10, and definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a good retro-style RPG.

												A charming little RPG combining past and present gameplay elements -- it appeals to both casual players new to the genre or just in it for the story and core players who want to dedicate hours grinding, item hunting, and beating side bosses.  For a game easily beatable in under 12 hours, the game has quite a few memorable moments.  Dialogue is well-written and scenes both comical and tragic actually hit home.  The story is somewhat standard but with occasional twists and turns, and there's so much optional content that you can easily draw the game out for a few more hours if you like.  The game definitely lives up to its reputation of being reminiscent of old-school entries in the Final Fantasy and Mana series of games, but visual effects and in game interfaces do also have a modern aesthetic.  You may not want to pay full price considering the short length and lack of replay value, but this is definitely a good choice for any real fan of the genre, and a fantastic snag if found on sale!

												Skyborn is a game that was made with love by a handful of people with a Steampunk feel that's made with the RPG Maker suite of tools.  It's one of the best games ever made with that suit (to my mind) and I finished it in roughly 12 hours of play.  It's not that long.  I've played around 10 or 11 RPG Maker games, and I've always found it to be one of the better gaming experiences.  Skyborn has a lot of things going for it.  The game works pretty smoothly, the plot and setting are very interesting and different from a lot of boring ""Dragon Warrior"" or ""Final Fantasy"" clones.  The game has levels of difficulty I didn't expect, and the game is pretty standard fare for the engine.The major character is a tinker and engineer lady who's had it pretty okay under the thumbs of the ruling class Skyborn that look like draconians from Dragonlance.  As she is set on her explorations, she finds a lot of people who have it worse than she did.  And she'll rally some folks to the cause, and set out to bring down the big bad and some of the Skyborn race.  If you just want a diverting throwback to the mechanics of old, but with modern settings, story-telling and concepts, then Skyborn is a pretty satisfying way to spend some time.  I enjoyed the time that I invested into the game.   "

												Let me tldr my review: This game's story is one of the best I've encountered from an independent studio, and the mechanics itself work quite well. But my experience has not been a positive one. I may keep playing just to enjoy the story, but probably not on my pc if I do. My experience may not happen for everyone, but I can only speak for my experience.For the rest of you.I want to love this game. I do. I really do. But the design choices that have been made are pretty bad and the excuses made for them even moreso. 640X800 is not an acceptable visual resolution in 2015, or in 2014, or in 2013, or in fact any time in the past decade. To hard code it at that level seems almost preposterous. We can blame the system he used to craft this game all we and he wants, but I have played a good number of RPGmaker games and they all worked just fine in higher resolutions. Going on isn't explaining, so let's explain. When I enter fullscreen mode, a good 1/6 of the screen becomes invisible. Unfortunately, it's the part of the screen where all the buttons are. This appears to be hardcoded. I have tried a number of solutions to make the screen fit into my monitor, and none have worked.So I could play it in windowed mode? Yes, but windowed mode is not resizable. And I've not had much luck in moving it around the screen, either. More importantly, I don't like playing in windowed mode and I resent being told that is my only choice.You may be asking. why is this a big deal? Well, it isn't, strawman. It is not a big deal. It is, however, enough of one. The market is full. Crowded to the brim with games as good or almost as good as this, many of them almost as well written or even better written. When it comes to things like this, everyone decides their own place to draw the line, and this is mine.I already own the game, I wouldn't return it if I could, and I wish the developers all the best in their future endeavours. But I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Skyborn is a short RPGMaker-made game that's very good looking (in the japanese anime classical style) and has great music.  It exposes interracial and social classes conflicts in a steampunk-fantasy sort of environment. The story is good but the arcs of the characters' stories are not very complicated and there are no important choices to make or crossroads where several endings can develop.Fights are not at every corner of an alley because you can visually choose (most of the times) if you fight enemies or you just ignore them. The story/fighting ratio is well balanced, but while some generic enemies are a piece of cake some bosses are a pain in the mouse's left button. By the way, while some enemies' design goes according to the world presented, some others seem to have been taken out of other very different projects.Gameplay is easy either with a keyboard or with the mouse, but the UI both in the character menus and in battle is a little bit of a mess and if you pause the game for a long time you will have to re-learn almost everything. Fights are repetitive and turn-based and the special effects are not outstanding but acceptable. You can upgrade your characters' classes and abbilities but even then some of they are left behind while others grow.I recommend Skyborn if you like classical J-turn-based-RPGs and you are not too exigent.

												I got this game for free on a site  that I used to buy Steam Games cheaper so here are my Good, Mediocore and Bad. I am an avid RPG/JRPG game who used to play Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger when I was younger and still play them to this day sometimes.Good:Characters - I actually like these characters, great backstory wished they introduced characters more clearly than rushing them.Mediocore:Music - It's okStory - It's kinda messed up as you get thrown into different scenarios and I partially have no idea whats going onArtwork- Although decent but kinda plainBattle System- Quite nice of adding in a Threat system. Thinking of my way through of how to deal with my enemies but that was quickly overlooked aka get the guy who has the most hp finishing off the enemy so he takes damaged while keeping the damaged dealing with hp sustain and weakening the games. Also my characters get KO in battle unfairly: Gouge- Me: Chance of blinding a person with an attack. Monster: Chance of Blinding the enemy with a chance of KO.Bad:ITS FEELS SHORT - I take my sweet as time when learning a new RPG game but dam the short feeling is strong here.CURRENCY IS REDUNDANT- You can basically survive off the items that you find instead of buying them, there are plenty HP/MP restore points in the game.Boss Battles: Feeling extremely boring and easy heck Yakra gave me a harder time than the first couple bosses combined. In short if you were buying this game don't buy it at full price its not worth it.			"

												Skyborn is a simple 2D game made in rpg maker. the combat is mediocre but lets face it your not playing an rpg maker game for the combat. Skyborn lists an array of interesting characters and a story line that will make you want to keep playing to see how it unfolds. I would recommend it as the price range meets up with what you would expect from a simple little game.			"

												I am an old school gamer and I played a tone of old style RPG games and this one really takes me back at least to the super Nintendo years. this game really has a lot to offer really good sound track. an unusual but interesting combat system. this game has a really solid story line and the dialogue is also quite good. most games like this have serious dialog issues and they sound corny or just silly so its nice to play a game that has a nice flow to it. The art work for this game is also very nice to look at, not professional mind you but still very good. The maps and out side world are pleasant with lots to look at but not filled with clutter.  this game offers a crafting system that on one hand is rewarding to find components to craft with, but unfortunately the crafting system leaves something to be desired. all in all this game has good balance the character roles are well defined. my mage is not a tank my tank is not a DPSer and I have options to develop my character classes the way I want to fit with my play style through class upgrades reminiscent of the original Final Fantasy games.  I felt the ending was a bit rushed and you can get through the story line rather fast so you wont be racking up 40+ hrs of game time on this one you might not even get half that. so I wish the game had been a bit longer with some more side quests to do or even a bit more towards the end.  I don't want to be down on this game just fair. I will add that this has been the most enjoyable game of its type I have played so far. great work!!!			"

												This is a very good example of what Indie games can be, besides Slender of FNAF. This game is a basic RPG that did a lot of things right, with only a few little fall offs. The story was good, not an intricate multi-level story, but enough to drive you to want to continue the game. Meanwhile the combat is the basic RPG maker system, which is not THAT bad, but could feel more engaging.The art work for the game is actually pretty good, it melds the color pallete nicely, it gives the game a rust-like brown that shows its metallic and manmade (Which I think fits the story nicely). The plot is a bit bland, I could tell what was going to happen a few times. However the dialog overshadows the blandness with a nice uplifting comedy-like undertone.I give this a 4.5/5.			"

												Among RPG-Maker games this one stands out with its threat system combined with various specilizations for the characters and quite meaningful itemization; Rather than incremental upgrades the choice of gear and augments makes a huge difference in terms of combat damage.Also, by sprinkling experience nodes around the world, you're not forced to fight for the sake of leveling if you want to focus on the story. Well, and of course the story is quite engaging.			"

												I got Skyborn in a bundle a while back and played it last week, and it's a surprisingly decent game - there's almost no grinding, the characters are fairly diverse (though there's a slight flaw with one of them due to how his MP mechanic works in the late game), it's somewhat well written (though the plot is fairly generic) and it doesn't overstay it's welcome (since it's only 8hrs long, though I imagine you could get another one or two with the bonus dungeon I didn't touch). It may not be worth £12, but I could see it being worth buying at 66% or 75% off if you fancy a decent JRPG or RPGMaker game.			"

Because sadly there is a glitch where the screen flickers like mad if you play it in full screen, this glitch does not happen if you play it on a small window, I don't know if this is a glitch in the game or of the engine that they used which is the RPG Maker VX/VX Ace engine, and sadly you cannot fix this issue, and I'm sorry, I cannot play games in a small window.But, from what I have played, it seemed interesting.

												I give this a recommend, but only a slight one. The game play is short, but works. The characters are nice, although somewhat predictable. What got me was that my party was slowly becoming a glass cannon. You can easily avoid monsters, and there is no obvious leveling ground. As such, I started my ""no turning back now"", and was able to easily make it to the end boss, including killing all the bosses within the area before the final boss.But then, the final boss has an AOE that one shots my entire party. So that is my only complaint, that you really need to attack monsters while going through, don't avoid them. If you do, you can easily end up not knowing the end of the game because the last boss is just so much more powerful.			"

												I used to love JRPGs growing up, but found them less to my taste as I got more and more crotchety.And yet, this one was pretty much perfect. It wasn't so long that it overstayed its welcome, Hard mode was perfectly difficult, beating the optional boss in the last dungeon made me feel like I'd just breeze right over the final boss and yet I didn't at all, you aren't punished in the endgame for your class choices, movement speed was great, you can play with keyboard or mouse or gamepad or any combination, combat never became droll on Hard, I cared about some of the characters and was interested in the world... Honestly I can't think of any real cons.I got this as part of a bundle and it was a welcome surprise. If you are okay with paying around $1 per hour of playtime for an exceptional JRPG that doesn't feel like an RPGMaker game at all, then this is highly recommended.			"

												Overall, I was pretty happy with this game. The fighting system is well made, and enjoyable. The puzzles (lever/button mazes) are just long enough to require some thought, but not so long that they are unpleasant. The story is well done, if short. And the weapon augmenting system made equipping characters highly customizable and fun. If you don't do the extra content, the end dungeon and boss are very, very hard (even just on normal mode). But if you do the extra dungeon and colluseum all the way through, you will have no problems with it. Also, make sure to use the 2 fruits you are given during specific points in the game. I thought they were just for a free level up, but they're actually how you learn your next sets of skills. The bonus dungeon (Venom Depths) can be found by taking the red portal on the celestial elevators from the poorest town in the bottom lefthand corner, it has a stone formation on either side of it.

Skyborn is an RPG in the style of classic SNES-era JRPG's. It's fairly typical to the genre, but I found that it had some nice tweaks that kept it interesting.The turn-based combat system features ""threat"" for each party member, which rises as that character does more damage against enemies. Enemies will always attack the party member with the highest threat, leading to some interesting decisions. The characters' special abilities were varied and each party member felt unique. Buffs, debuffs, and other status changes were key to winning battles, so I didn't feel like I was just constantly tapping the button to attack. Several times during the game the characters will be able to upgrade their class, with each of the options granting different new abilities.There are no random battles, but instead monsters wander around the map. Once they are defeated, they're gone forever, so you can't really over-grind. Leveling up doesn't increase your stats all that much anyway, and most of your stat boosts will come from new equipment. Equipment can be forged from various stones found in the environment and further augmented with gems and other items.The story involves the conflicts of ground-dwelling humans and winged skyborn who are gifted with magical abilities. It kept me playing and had a few unexpected twists, but wasn't anything truly ground-breaking.I first started the game on Normal difficulty, but after finding a few battles too easy I switched over to Hard. I found battles much more interesting on this setting and I kept it this way until the very end of the game. The second-to-last boss kept destroying my entire party before they could take any actions. As I was at the point of no return with no way to get better equipment, I could either load up an earlier save, or decrease the difficulty level. I chose the latter. Reading the game's author's comments on Steam, it looks like defeating the final bosses on Hard would have required a lot more effort, so my regret over this decision is minimal.If you're looking for a relatively-short classic JRPG with a few modern twists, I'd definitely recommend giving Skyborn a shot. It's been bundled several times and I expect it to do so again, so you should be able to find it for cheap.			"

												So I'll admit, when I first saw this game my thoughts were ""Another RPG maker game…great.” But I got it and played it all the way through.First I shall start with the cons:  It took 9 hours to beat….THAT’S IT!!! NO other cons!! I loved it so so so much!! This game! Seriously the best JRPG I have played in a LONG time. Since most JRPG’s basically have the same mechanics, the thing that sets them apart is their story, so the story has a huge impact on a JRPG. A great story makes a great JRPG in my opinion, and this game’s story was fantastic!  I won’t go into it, because I want you to go and experience it for yourself! It starts off a little generic and slow, but it speeds up fast, and the world that is built is amazing.As for mechanics, there are two things I loved. First, in battle, there is a component called Threat, and a party member’s threat goes up based on the strength of their attacks, and killing enemies. The enemies will attack the party member with the most threat, so it adds an extra level of strategy. You can have a character who is a heavy hitter but can’t take hits, so you have to strategize to have your tank build up their threat so they can take hits for them. Second, the game rewards you for exploring. If you look around the world you will find little nodes hidden away at dead ends and tricky spots, which reward you with EXP which helps you level up. Also the chests have some great loot as well.Like I said, I wasn’t expecting it to be so short. When playing these kind of games you expect long an epic, and lingering story that has so many unsuspecting pit falls and delays, but this game had its story short sweet and to the point, which I have to say worked out nicely for it in the end. I really loved it.			"

												I couldn't remove a selection and I couldn't make an intermediate selection so I went with yes.  I enjoyed playing the game for the most part.  The story may use a tried and true plot device, but it does contain a few twists that I, at least, didn't see coming.  The world is fairly small, but most of the areas are very diversified so it doesn't feel that way.  Also the smithing is a nice touch, though I would have liked to make higher quality armor as well. My problem with the game was the combat balance.  For one I almost immediately turned the game up to hard.  This is something I almost never do as I generally like to keep combat just difficult enough that I keep interested without becoming a hassle.  On Normal there was absolutely no challenge.  For most random encounters that didn't change much on Hard.  Boss battles, came in two varities: 'What just wiped me in 2 seconds' or 'what did I just roll over.'  There are certain skills in the game (For you and your enemies) that are just ridiculously strong.  But if you don't use them, then battles just drag on because at least with how I was building characters (trying to emphasize +Str as much as I could!) only 1-2 of my characters ever did appreciable amounts of damage.  Also the character classes are very specialized. Only certain people dealt damage, and at times it really felt the only reason ""threat"" existed was to give the tank something to do on his turn.Overall Story is a +, game balance is a -.  Take your pick on which is more important to you.			"

												Played through this in about six hours; in one sitting.  Why in one sitting, you ask?  Because I couldn't tear myself away!  The story here does a rather good job of telling itself during that six hours(which could be four or less if you're in a hurry).  It's a fairly nuanced tale with all the proper tragic hero tropes, plot twists and surprise endings, but it doesn't do a lot of padding to get there.  If you're looking for any kind of gameplay balance, do speed runs.  Otherwise this game is incredibly easy even on its hardest settings, although there is one battle you will never win ;).All in all, for $7.49 (at half price) I felt like I got my money's worth and then some.  This is a rather well-polished RPGmaker gem that will leave you wanting more from this developer in the future!			"

												Solid, enjoyable, well put-together game.The game's difficulty on Normal is a bit too easy, although Hard mode presents a decent challenge, especially earlier on in the game (before you get access to the really OP debuffs).Despite the RPG Maker feel that a lot of people seem to detest, Skyborn's a very polished package.  I noticed a couple small bugs and a couple typos, but that was it on the negatives.I was able to play this with a controller, which was very appreciated.  I used a 3rd party knockoff Xbox360 controller, which didn't require any additional setup upon booting the game.  However, I was able to hit F1 in-game and remap the buttons to something more sensible, the defaults didn't make sense on my particular controller.Dialogue was well-written, enjoyable, and fairly humorous.  Plot, while a bit short, was interesting and flowed well.  Combat system had a nice brisk pace, with good yet swift animations for attacks.The leveling and itemization was a stand-out success, in my mind: armor is equippable by all characters, but if you weigh a character down beyond their carrying capacity, their speed drops off.  There are a few ways of increasing that capacity later in the game.  But that broad eligibility allows a much wider amount of equipment options for each character, as you can trade off weight between different slots to equip items you REALLY want.  The augment system is simple yet robust, offering another layer of customizibility to your characters.  Furthermore, there are two ""class up""s during the game, where you can upgrade each character to a new job class.  The game does a great job of explaining the options prior to selection, so you don't need to consult a third party resource for information.It took me about 15 hours to complete the game, playing in hard mode and completing all optional content&bosses.  I'm a bit of a slow player, though, so most folks will probably take about 7-12 depending on difficulty and completeness.I don't think I'd pay the full $15 for this one due to its length, but at sale prices it's a great purchase.Enjoy!

												The devs of this game have bottled up the sheer joy and sense of wonder from the old school Final Fantasy games (before they became emo boy meets emo girl romances) and just gave us a fun, well written, wonderfully designed and beautifully scored RPG. Some tropes are followed and a little predictable but the additions of a fast crafting system and no random enounters makes the game a positive experience. It made me feel 15 again, staying up super late to play just a little longer. Although if you do it once with this game you'll probably finish it as I hear it averages about 8hrs play time, though I don't know what difficulty that is. Get it on sale for full value.			"

												For a casual RPG player like myself, Skyborn was a wonderful little game with a poignant story, fun gameplay, and quick pace.  There was never a need for tedious grinding--in fact, you could avoid most battles if you wanted to, but I don't know how that would affect your leveling.  Shops were placed conveniently between stretches of dungeon to buy (or make) better weapons and armor.  You could also buy supplies, although the plentiful item chests usually provided enough for me.  Some areas (Nordenwald Forest *cough*) were rather lengthy with extended puzzles involving painful walking from one end of the map to the other.  Aside from the particularly grueling dungeon and the utter lack of promised side quests, Skyborn proved to be a short but delightful game.  I'll certainly be replaying it in the future to try different class combinations and fighting styles.			"

												Great classic RPG feel to the game with a decent storyline. The music is very nice, and there are skills and members to keep the fighting fun. It is also very rewarding to explore, which keep you interested. On the downside the game is a bit short, but still worth the time and money.			"

												I am an old school gamer and I played a tone of old style RPG games and this one really takes me back at least to the super Nintendo years. this game really has a lot to offer really good sound track. an unusual but interesting combat system. this game has a really solid story line and the dialogue is also quite good. most games like this have serious dialog issues and they sound corny or just silly so its nice to play a game that has a nice flow to it. The art work for this game is also very nice to look at, not professional mind you but still very good. The maps and out side world are pleasant with lots to look at but not filled with clutter.  this game offers a crafting system that on one hand is rewarding to find components to craft with, but unfortunately the crafting system leaves something to be desired. all in all this game has good balance the character roles are well defined. my mage is not a tank my tank is not a DPSer and I have options to develop my character classes the way I want to fit with my play style through class upgrades reminiscent of the original Final Fantasy games.  I felt the ending was a bit rushed and you can get through the story line rather fast so you wont be racking up 40+ hrs of game time on this one you might not even get half that. so I wish the game had been a bit longer with some more side quests to do or even a bit more towards the end.  I don't want to be down on this game just fair. I will add that this has been the most enjoyable game of its type I have played so far. great work!!!			"

												I recommend Skyborn, but I don't recommend it strongly.  There are a few important things to know about it.1) Skyborn is pretty fun.If you like oldschool RPGs -- and I mean Might and Magic 1/Final Fantast 1 oldschool, you'll probably like the system and combat style.2) Skyborn is pretty.The art really is good.  The game is guilty of using a lot of pallet swaps, but everything is pretty appealing to look at (unless, of course, it's not supposed to be)3) Skyborn has a really wonky difficulty and progress flowThis is a game that will, pretty randomly, decide to kick your♥♥♥♥♥or be a cakewalk.  In that way, the design behind it isn't really great.  What's more, the game itself doesn't have a whole lot of flow to it: there are♥♥♥♥♥numbingly long dungeon segments, but then there are segments that go by FAST.4) Skyborn is short.I don't know if I missed a ton of game somewhere, other than grinding to do the arena sidequest, but the endgame difficulty seems to suggest that no, I didn't.  It really doesn't have a lot to it.  What there is is good, but it isn't long.  I guess that's alright, since a game that's too long can easily overstay its welcome, and I've known plenty of games to be both good and short, but part of me wanted more out of Skyborn.  I guess looking at my time logged I have to say it's not REALLY short, just shorter than you might expect out of a game of the genre.So, from that you can probably tell whether you'd like Skyborn or not.  It's got a good look and feel and a good plot, but a few flaws that I don't really mind, but that might be dealbreakers for some.			"

												JRPG. Character sprites and portraits are attractive and well-animated. If you liked the original Final Fantasy, I think you'll like this too. Took me 11 hours to finish; short but satisfying.I'm a completionist, so I accepted every single random battle and got every side quest and searched every nook. If you want to do the minimum possible, you may have trouble with the boss battles later on.Battle is turn-based. Some MMO elements: threat and energy generation. There's an in-game tutorial but I ended up skipping it entirely. There are many buffs and debuffs, so much so that it's easy to lose track-- names aren't terribly intuitive either, e.g. Majesty is a debuff?Character and gear stats are fairly opaque; I used a GameFAQs guide to figure things out. UI is clunky when it comes to gear stats. It's difficult to see the stats on equipped gear; Equip and Augment pages aren't laid out very well.			"

												Overall, I was pretty happy with this game. The fighting system is well made, and enjoyable. The puzzles (lever/button mazes) are just long enough to require some thought, but not so long that they are unpleasant. The story is well done, if short. And the weapon augmenting system made equipping characters highly customizable and fun. If you don't do the extra content, the end dungeon and boss are very, very hard (even just on normal mode). But if you do the extra dungeon and colluseum all the way through, you will have no problems with it. Also, make sure to use the 2 fruits you are given during specific points in the game. I thought they were just for a free level up, but they're actually how you learn your next sets of skills. The bonus dungeon (Venom Depths) can be found by taking the red portal on the celestial elevators from the poorest town in the bottom lefthand corner, it has a stone formation on either side of it.

There isn't a whole lot of content besides the story, but that's the point: it's a narrative driven experience, and pretty darn good one at that.			"

Maybe add some more after game quests or even a continuation story arc having to do with the rebuilding of the civilizations as a cohesive cooperative group of races or something or even quests to help our little fey friend return to the mortal realm? I recommend this game overall because the storyline is amazingly well developed.			"

												LOVED This game. It took me about 8 hours to clear (I played in offline mode on my laptop for half of it). The combat is balanced and the characters are interesting and all useful in their own way. All characters are customizable from picking which skills they learn, to choosing equipment, to finally choosing which item/buff to apply to each piece of equipment. Building up my characters was the funnest part. The combat is interesting. It has a threat system where enemies focus on the party members doing the flashiest moves. Exploring the game world is vastly rewarding and encouraged. Not only do you find great gear, but you can find experience points by exploring. The game also has additional side content that I didnt complete in my 8 hour playthrough. This includes, a fighting arena, a side dungeon to explore, and finding a deck of cards that has been scattered across the land. My only complaint is that the weapon/armor crafting system in this game seems tacked on and forgettable. The items you can craft are limited and you usually have them by the time you can craft them anyway. Having said that, this is a game that no RPG fan should miss out on. 9.5/10			"

												This is an amazing game. It's extremely well written and definitely one of a kind. It has it's flaws, I actually found it to start getting a little slow towards the middle, but not unbearably so. Short gameplay, but a really fulfilling story and interesting lore. My major quarral was the lack of the ability to complete the side quests after the main story was through. I'll drop it a star for that, because it was a pretty major letdown. Otherwise, it's a four out of five stars. This is my first playthrough of an RPG Maker title, so maybe as I realize the potential of this engine by playing games in the future (created in RPG Maker) my review might change. Nonetheless, it's a great title, and well worth its price and I recommend it to anybody who's a true fan of a good story.			"

They have a crafting system thats based on ores you can find on the field which allows you to make some really good weapons at certain points in the game.

												The story can be somewhat predictable while still being very good.  The dialogue is written extremely well and all of the characters stayed true to themselves throughout the game.  The combat has a lot of depth for a turn based game, the customization options for class ups and for equipment add a decent amount of replayability.  I really only had a difficult time with 1 boss battle during the game and if you abuse a certain item that fight becomes somewhat trivial,  Thus the difficulty of the game even on hard is not very high unless you don't understand how to min max your party.All in all I would recomend this game.

												One of my two favorites from Dancing Dragon Games!Good graphics,you see the character from top to stomach as he speaks.The poor are exploited; the powerful soldiers use magic from an unknown origin. The story starts as a mechanic girl who’ll be caught and meet rebels. It becomes mysterious, there is a puzzled desert you’ll feel lost as you see the same screen often but if you observe you’ll see something guiding you. There’s the great revelation of a character’s true origin and the story of her people in a narration mode that is pleasant and captivating to read. Stunning graphics, travel by airship and character artworks.Dancing Dragon games features: •	craft weapons with ores to avoid their purchase if needed•	arena you take the next fight at will, in which you fight a series of enemies with more level each time and get a proportional reward. •	A university building for infos on the game‘s tools. A weight stat to see how much weight a character can handle and respect it or it will play on attack. •	There are areas with 4 colors of buttons you have to push to progress. A deck of cards to collect to get a boss and a powerful gauntlet.			"

												An interesting and compelling game from start to finish. Skyborn is an RPG-Maker made game with it's unique style, the environments throught the game are very well detailed which just goes to show how much work and time the developers put on it. The game is very story-driven so if you're not so much into story and more into constant action this isn't the game for you. The characters are well designed, each one having it's unique objective and background explained in the game through constant flashbacks, which in turn translates into a nice storytelling. Skyborn features a crafting system which allows you to craft armors and weapons from ores you pick along the way and an augment system which allows you to enchant them, the system itself is really simple but at the same time really addicting and you'll find yourself more often than not looking at every wall in search of ores (I know I did!). Not all is good about the game however. Some changes to the battle system for example (which still features some RPG-Maker standard sprites and grid system) could have been explored way better. The mouse feature, here strangely introduced, also doesn't make much sense for this kind of game, you'll find out that using the mouse will only make things more complicated and unnatural, luckily the developers added an option in the menu to toggle on/off the mouse feature. Achievements for Steam also not supported which is actually a real bummer since you have so much to achieve in this game! Oh well :)Overall a great game with over 12+ hours of content to explore, be it sidequesting, following the main story line or crafting in your free time. Congratulations to the developers. 8/10			"

												This game isn't good.  I can't play it at full screen, because there is a black tearing whenever anything moves.  The second problem is the audio is all over the place.  Some sound effects are too loud the music dips down to allow for sound effects.  It's a mess.  The third problem I have is the combat.  So boring.  All you see is 2D sprites.  There is no battlefield, or  anything special happening on the screen.  Pass this game up.			"

												I got this game free from Bundle Stars and finally got around to playing it. I really enjoyed the story and the mechanics of the game. While it seemed a bit short there are some extra side quests put in that extend it a bit. The game can probably be finished in under 12 hours. I spent more time doing the side quests and trying to kill every enemy I could find. There are a finite number of enemies in the game so you can only level up so much. Wasn't really a problem as I was able to easily run through the last leg of the game without any trouble. I did consult a guide but you probably don't need to unless you are trying to collect all the spade cards. Don't forget to hit up the arena, I almost missed it. You get some good loot there.			"

												Skyborn is a game that was made with love by a handful of people with a Steampunk feel that's made with the RPG Maker suite of tools.  It's one of the best games ever made with that suit (to my mind) and I finished it in roughly 12 hours of play.  It's not that long.  I've played around 10 or 11 RPG Maker games, and I've always found it to be one of the better gaming experiences.  Skyborn has a lot of things going for it.  The game works pretty smoothly, the plot and setting are very interesting and different from a lot of boring ""Dragon Warrior"" or ""Final Fantasy"" clones.  The game has levels of difficulty I didn't expect, and the game is pretty standard fare for the engine.The major character is a tinker and engineer lady who's had it pretty okay under the thumbs of the ruling class Skyborn that look like draconians from Dragonlance.  As she is set on her explorations, she finds a lot of people who have it worse than she did.  And she'll rally some folks to the cause, and set out to bring down the big bad and some of the Skyborn race.  If you just want a diverting throwback to the mechanics of old, but with modern settings, story-telling and concepts, then Skyborn is a pretty satisfying way to spend some time.  I enjoyed the time that I invested into the game.   "

												I played through it once from beginning to end. Not very complicated, but it's not meant to be. Good story, great artwork. I haven't been more enthralled in a game for a long time, and, frankly, it was refreshing. The towns blew me away. They're all unique. The game does have flaws, specifically, the Colliseum bosses and the final optional boss in the last dungeon were both rather up there in difficulty, and I was surprised by the last minute appearance of platinum ore. Very disappointing in that I was unable to use the platinum ore. Combat was straightforward, but got a little boring after awhile. The side quests were cute! Unfortunately, I only found a couple and I wanted more! In all honesty, these complaints are minor and I feel like I'm nitpicking. For $15 ($1.53/hr over 10 hours)? Worth it.			"

												Let me tldr my review: This game's story is one of the best I've encountered from an independent studio, and the mechanics itself work quite well. But my experience has not been a positive one. I may keep playing just to enjoy the story, but probably not on my pc if I do. My experience may not happen for everyone, but I can only speak for my experience.For the rest of you.I want to love this game. I do. I really do. But the design choices that have been made are pretty bad and the excuses made for them even moreso. 640X800 is not an acceptable visual resolution in 2015, or in 2014, or in 2013, or in fact any time in the past decade. To hard code it at that level seems almost preposterous. We can blame the system he used to craft this game all we and he wants, but I have played a good number of RPGmaker games and they all worked just fine in higher resolutions. Going on isn't explaining, so let's explain. When I enter fullscreen mode, a good 1/6 of the screen becomes invisible. Unfortunately, it's the part of the screen where all the buttons are. This appears to be hardcoded. I have tried a number of solutions to make the screen fit into my monitor, and none have worked.So I could play it in windowed mode? Yes, but windowed mode is not resizable. And I've not had much luck in moving it around the screen, either. More importantly, I don't like playing in windowed mode and I resent being told that is my only choice.You may be asking. why is this a big deal? Well, it isn't, strawman. It is not a big deal. It is, however, enough of one. The market is full. Crowded to the brim with games as good or almost as good as this, many of them almost as well written or even better written. When it comes to things like this, everyone decides their own place to draw the line, and this is mine.I already own the game, I wouldn't return it if I could, and I wish the developers all the best in their future endeavours. But I cannot recommend this game.			"

												I've played hundreds of RPGs over the last 25 years.  There's nothing unique or revolutionary about this game, but it's definitely a step above most games developed using RPGMaker.  Despite the short length, I feel I got my money's worth.Pros:  - All primary characters are engaging, relatable, and offer unique contributions to group combat.  - Combat includes a ""Threat"" mechanic, based on how much damage or healing is done by each group member. Monsters focus single-target attacks on the character with the most threat.  This lets you build a team with the traditional tank, healer and damage dealers, rather than just a bunch of toons with high stats that bang on mobs until they're all dead.  - Enjoyable storyline.  I also liked how the backstory was introduced.  There's more groups involved in the conflict than just humans and Skyborn.  - No bugs, glitches or typos.  - There's no grinding.  There's only a fixed number of monsters in the game, which are visible on the map and avoidable if you choose.  Instead, the game offers an alternative: ""exploration nodes"".  These grant experience (as though you won a combat), rewarding those who focus more on exploring.  - Several secondary conquests, including a gladiator arena and a deep dungeon with additional challenges.  - Forge mechanic.  You can collect some materials (iron, coal, platina) throughout the game and use it to craft some weapons and armor.Cons:  - Preferred more character development for the antagonists, villains, and that one mysterious girl who talks about being hungry.  You'll know who I mean. :)  - Length of gameplay: only about 15-20 hours.  This is on par with old school 90s RPGs like Final Fantasy IV, Chrono Trigger, and Secret of Mana... although those 3 games felt like they have far deeper, more drawn out stories compared to this game.  - Lack of difficulty.  I played the game on Hard (max) difficulty and there wasn't much challenge, other than a little bad luck with RNG on a few midgame bosses.  - Lack of challenging puzzles.  It's mainly just finding the right buttons to open passages.  - Lack of side quests.  I found only one actual side quest (the rest were part of the main storyline).  - Not much actual exploration involved.  Lack of open world feel.  Game is fairly linear.Final Rating: 8 / 10			"

												TL;DR: Yes, yes, yes. Will follow developer's new games. Buy on sale if possible.Just finished this game last night. I enjoyed it so I feel a sense of obligation to write my thoughts on it for others.I was impressed by this game, especially being a RPGmaker game. Every setting was decorated beautifully! I found myself appreciating every new screen my characters would visit and could tell the developers took some time to make everything look nice. The storyline was really good as well, and story line progression was at a good pace so that I wouldn't get too restless on each quest.There are quite a few ways the game could have been improved, such as the combat system, forgery, side quests, and ""hidden gems"" but honestly I'm too lazy to get into details about those :PAlso, I got it during the Steam Summer sale and I firmly believe it was well worth the money. It took me about 10 hours with a leisurely playstyle and on and off. The current price of $14.99 is a bit high in my opinion, even though the game was beautiful so if you can get it on a sale, that'd be great.			"

 ""Is a good/regular oldstyle rpg game""  Talking a bit about everything Has a good story, the graphics are simple and ""oldstyle"" probably your pcmasterrace machine won't use even 10% of it's power but for me is ok it really remembers me of the old games I used to play, I liked the music, the combat is really what you would spect, simple 2D images getting impacted by your attacks (like a pokemon fight, not pokemon go, just pokemon...). Good classic gameplay  I really liked this game, while I played it I felt very good, having a slow game with a good story is unusual this days but was really good to play it, every time I was stressed and no one was playing anything I just started playing this and in a short period of time I completed it. The price... I got it for free  According to the actual price of the game it costs $14.99 in my opinion this is a high price for this game, but probably (not entirely sure) the game during steam sales should be around half the price and at that point (around $7.5) for me it would be a good price, but if it is even lower than that I would grab it.

												REVIEW:While very skeptical when first acquiring the game, I decided to give it a go and was not let down. Very similar to the RPGs of old, those seeking to re-enter that kind of world won't be let down either!Story - While perhaps not the most deep story ever written for an RPG, it certainly wasn't bad. It had, to me, plenty of depth for the length of the game as a whole. It also had a good amount of all the story elements one would look for. While it wasn't necessarily evoking particular emotions for me, it might for you. I give the story a solid 8/10.Audio - The sound track for the game was particularly good, which caught me by surprise. I never found myself thinking ""Man, this track is annoying..."" and muting the sound. Do you remember how Chrono Trigger's amazing sound track really set the atmosphere for the different areas in the game? Skyborn does the same. I give the audio a well-deserved 10/10.Visual - Again, this game takes me back. There's nostalgia everywhere. With that in mind, the graphics, sprites, artwork, etc. don't let down. Very pleasing to the eye, in every area of the game. I can't think of an area or situation in which I thought something looked like it could have been done better. The different artwork and visual effects all fit in their respective areas, and paired with the music really brought everything together. Visuals get a 10/10 from me as well.Gameplay - Here's where I get really nitpicky. There are a few things here that could be done better, so I'll list them in no particular order:1. Mouse controls - During battles (which were handled great! no random battles!), I found myself accidentally clicking on an option I didn't intend to. For example, a few times I misclicked and ended up ""Guarding"" on a turn that I needed to do something else... because the curser was ""stuck"" on the icon beside it. It's kind of hard to describe, but if you're careful it isn't too much of an issue.2. DEBUFFS - This one is a major gripe for me. You can track buffs/debuffs on your party with a visual alert in the upper-right corner of their portraits. Enemy debuffs, however, you have to deliberately watch for ""-DebuffName"" to appear in text near the bottom of their image when it wears off. This can be very, very debilitating to your plans if a necessary debuff (Majesty, for example) falls off without you noticing it... which is very possible if the enemy uses some form of buff that either removes it, or grants them all kinds of buffs and your debuffs just happen to fall on off that turn anyway.For future games, I would most definitely recommend some kind of visual aid for enemy debuffs, if possible. Granted, there was really only a few situaions where it was of dire importance that I had to keep track of enemy debuffs, but it meant a party wipe (no joke) if one fell off and I didn't notice.3. Difficulty - Not necessarily a gripe, but also not necessarily something I can comment on entirely. The game has 3 different combat difficulties: Easy, Medium (Normal?), and Hard. I played through the game on Normal, and found it to be far too easy in parts. I haven't played through it again on Hard, so I can't comment on Hard mode; however, given the resources available to you, ""Normal"" difficulty becomes a little too easy. (Except for a few parts, but I'm not going to spoil anything here.)4. Game Length - I put in 15 hours to this game before completion. This is with about a 99% completion rate. While 15 hours is a far cry from the 50 to 60 hours a game like Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy 3 (6) had with a similar completion rate, it was pretty generous for this game. Also note that about 4 of those hours are me back-tracking in the damned forest.With those small issues in mind, I'm going with an 8/10 on the gameplay. It had everything I liked, a little more, but also a few issues I feel could have been handled better.VERDICT:Over all, I give Skyborn a 9/10, and a high recommendation to anyone who grew up with the great RPGs from the SNES era, who are looking for a piece of nostalgic greatness. A true diamond in the rough, I really hope to see more like this from the developers. (Even a sequel would be great!)			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: If I (the reviewer) have played a game that has less than 1 hour of gameplay and is not recommended, means that I did not enjoy or it did not live up to my expectations! Think twice before rating or giving out a comment... Sadly, I cannot review this game properly. Why? Because sadly there is a glitch where the screen flickers like mad if you play it in full screen, this glitch does not happen if you play it on a small window, I don't know if this is a glitch in the game or of the engine that they used which is the RPG Maker VX/VX Ace engine, and sadly you cannot fix this issue, and I'm sorry, I cannot play games in a small window.But, from what I have played, it seemed interesting. But sadly, for modern day computers, I'd suggest not buying it (bare in mind I got this for free from the PCGamer's giveaway) NOT RECOMMENDED :(  "

												Wonderful little game. Love my RPG's most of all and this one delievered while not being complicated. No map system tho. Makes the game a bit easy to fumble around at first with no sense of direction. Graphics are that of an RPG Maker game. Decent story and limited team/abilities. I give this game a 7/10. Fun and inviting. Yet you can choose your difficulty.			"

												-I just got finished playing Skyborn. Its a good, simple, game with a easy to follow story line and simple battle mecahnics. This is a RPG game for people who cant invest a ton of time into long games anymore but still want to play RPGs, It will take you about 9-11hrs to finish.-The only complaint I have about this game is the tiles that make up the terrain, in a few areas of the game, get kinda confusing. In 2 or 3 areas I was having a hard time telling where I was allowed to walk and where I wasn't.-I think retail on this game is $15 right now, I paid MUCH less, but In my opinion I believe it's worth about $8.00, maybe $10 at most			"

												Tidy little RPG. 100%'d on Hard Mode in about 15 hours. Early game didn't impress me, but the characters and art were enjoyable enough that I stuck with it. Glad I did. Late-game provided delightful tactical challenges, and the story, while not particularly complex, was solid.Took actual effort to complete the optional bosses and defeat the final boss—effort, not just time. There is no grinding in this game, since there's a finite amount of enemies. They don't respawn. You can't farm.The balance was just right for it, though. Even when I was slightly over the power curve, enemies in most areas were still able to present a tangible threat, and as noted, the final boss was a real challenge even after completing optional challenges. I had to optimize my resources very carefully in order to avoid retries.Oh, and you get to retry a fight you lost instead of just falling back to your latest save, which is nice. Saved me a lot of time against some of the tougher enemies.Come for the steampunk. Stay for the characters. Leave proud of your accomplishments.			"

												If on sale worth it to buy, but I wouldn't pay full price. The game is good but not amazing - a good story though not terribly unique and the characters are written very archetypically. The game is a bit short, though once again if on sale a good length for the money. I wasn't a fan of the level up system which left absolutely not customisation options except for the two class changes/selections.My main gripe with the game is simply I found it too easy (played on normal) until the very last boss which I can't get past. Obviously I need more upgrades but if I was going to struggle so much on one fight I should have at least found the others difficult. I went from defeating enemies with ease to trying 10+ times and not even getting the last boss below half health.			"

												I guess I'm now about 4-5 hours into this game, and I can say that I'm really enjoying it. This comes from one who has almost given up on RPG maker games. Skyborn is a game well done. While I don't anticipate it being very long, I think it should be just long enough. The story is good. The fighting system is good. The music is great. The level of polish is great! At this point, the game has given hints of secrets and things to keep the player busy well after the main quest. There is a coliseum in which I died on my first fight, a whole series of shops reserved for high level people in the Coliseum. I also believe there is probably a bonus dungeon, based upon things the NPCs say. The maker of the game has put a lot of effort into this game. While I would assume the RPG Maker program has it's limitations, at moments, I simply forget this is a RPGM game. The game does not have random enemy encounters. Instead, there are a limited number of on screen enemies. This puts a limit on the experience and gold one can earn. This puts grinding to a minimum and makes the player figure out how to use the system to beat the bosses. The only negatives I can mention is that nearly ALL RPG Maker games have moments of slowdown on my computer for some reason. I can run Skyrim at good FPS, but I think the performance problem is rooted in RPGM and my hardware. I can't fault the maker for that. The other thing, is that despite this game having what seems to be a pretty straightforward crafting system, I have no idea what I'm crafting and how much of each material the thing I am crafting takes. It says, ""200% more ore"" but doesn't tell me exactly how much of what. Perhaps I've missed something early on in the game. Other than that, I can gladly say that this is a great game. There are moments when the story, the action, and the music all come together to a near final fantasy level moment. Since then, I now have Deadly Sin and Deadly Sin 2. I've also got my eye on Echoes of Aetheria. One last thing, I believe I picked this game by either Humble Bundle or one of the bundle sites. If it were not for that, I never would have heard of it. I am glad I came across this gem!			"

												A review from a very casual gamer.Just finished the game on ""Normal"" and I'm quite impressed. My previous RPG experience was FF12 on PS2 and while this isn't on that level, it was a very enjoyable game.  The story is good, moves forward nicely. The battle mechanics are quite tidy and not as simplistic as I expected.  I completed nearly all the sidequests, found about 95% of all secrets, areas, etc and finished the game in about 17 hours.   If you take the time to find most everything, kill most everything, and upgrade and ""augment"" alot near the end you should level up quite a bit and finish the game without much difficulty.Definitely worth the $2.50 (on sale) I paid and though it does feel a bit short it's still satisfying to complete and I in no way feel shortchanged.  While I probably won't go back and play through on ""Hard"" I definitely hope they come out with a sequel. "

												Protagonist is a Steampunk Mechanic? Check.Protagonist is female? Check.Protagonist is awesome? Check.Protagonist wears Glorified Hairband Goggles? Check.Amazing Character Development and humor. Claret Spencer is, in my opinion, right up there with characters like Lloyd Irving from Tales of Symphonia in personality as the lead protagonist.The Battle System is well done, allowing you to command the whole battle using a visible Threat system. You got a Tank? You can pretty much guarantee enemies will go for the Tank by keeping their threat up while pounding away with your other characters.Frankly I'd love to see more adventures with Claret. For an RPGMaker game, the world and the lore behind it are well done.Only thing that would make it better would be Claret as a redhead. ;) But... that's just me.Whatch and learn kimosabe!			"

												Skyborn is a turn-based RPG in the vein of old-school RPGs like Final Fantasy. You control a band of characters that are trying to save the world from the tyrannical yadda yadda yadda, you know the drill. It was all made with RPG Maker, but don't let that turn you off -- I'd say it's worth a look.I found this game rather charming. While the plot, music, and graphics aren't the newest and shiniest things ever, everything is good quality and holds together well enough for me to enjoy playing through it -- I even want to run through it again later. There are moments between characters to establish them more beyond ""insert hero person here"", and the world combines steampunk with a more standard fantasy setting in a way that's enjoyable, with more going on than is apparent at first. While there might not be a whole lot more to do than just the main story, there are some sidequests for players who poke around looking for extra treasure, and there's a crafting/augment system for people who want to micromanage their equipment a bit more.The battle system is pretty fun to work with -- each character has a threat level that rises as they do damage, and whoever has the highest threat will be soaking up most of the attacks. The key is to make sure the tankiest character in your group keeps their threat level the highest (easier said than done, at times!), and I feel it works fairly well. Most fights are fairly simple, though there are some trickier fights later in the game -- the final boss and bonus boss in particular are pretty darn hard to deal with.All in all, I'd say give this game a try if a charming little steampunk/fantasy turn-based RPG with fun characters and a neat battle system sounds interesting to you.

												Skyborn is probably the best RPGMaker game in the market, it is a fun RPG with lovely visuals and a great story that will keep you motivated until the end.Pros:  Lovely textures and character drawings.  Well made Steampunk world with an interesting society.  Unforgettable cast of characters.  Nice, fitting soundtrack.  A great story that makes the game more enjoyable.Cons:  The game is short, after 8.5 hrs I've finished the main story. This has a good side, you barely have to do any grinding so all your time in the game will be enjoyable.  Lack of secondary quests, the game is made towards the main story, I only found 2 secondary quests along the way.  The game resolution is locked to 640x480 so I had to play the whole thing on a small window on my 1080p monitor. (You can play it on fullscreen mode but if your monitor is 16:9 it will look stretched)Overall I really enjoyed my experience with Skyborn and would definitely recommend it, specially if you can get it on sale.

												First off the game is only about 7 hours long so if you wanted a game to go trhough in one sitting then this oculd be it.Sure it could be long if you do every single battle and every side quest but probebly only by like 3 hours more. Game play is your typical rpg maker game so there really isn't anything new here  other then the threat meter.Depend on what character has more threat that character will get attacked more. Story is actually pretty well written it kepts me coming back to it so it has that. Music is decent and as far as i can tell it is original. Most of these rpg maker games tend to rip off others but i don't think this one does.			"

												I guess I'm now about 4-5 hours into this game, and I can say that I'm really enjoying it. This comes from one who has almost given up on RPG maker games. Skyborn is a game well done. While I don't anticipate it being very long, I think it should be just long enough. The story is good. The fighting system is good. The music is great. The level of polish is great! At this point, the game has given hints of secrets and things to keep the player busy well after the main quest.

I also believe there is probably a bonus dungeon, based upon things the NPCs say. The maker of the game has put a lot of effort into this game. While I would assume the RPG Maker program has it's limitations, at moments, I simply forget this is a RPGM game. The game does not have random enemy encounters. Instead, there are a limited number of on screen enemies. This puts a limit on the experience and gold one can earn. This puts grinding to a minimum and makes the player figure out how to use the system to beat the bosses. The only negatives I can mention is that nearly ALL RPG Maker games have moments of slowdown on my computer for some reason. I can run Skyrim at good FPS, but I think the performance problem is rooted in RPGM and my hardware. I can't fault the maker for that. The other thing, is that despite this game having what seems to be a pretty straightforward crafting system, I have no idea what I'm crafting and how much of each material the thing I am crafting takes. It says, ""200% more ore"" but doesn't tell me exactly how much of what. Perhaps I've missed something early on in the game. Other than that, I can gladly say that this is a great game. There are moments when the story, the action, and the music all come together to a near final fantasy level moment. Since then, I now have Deadly Sin and Deadly Sin 2. I've also got my eye on Echoes of Aetheria. One last thing, I believe I picked this game by either Humble Bundle or one of the bundle sites. If it were not for that, I never would have heard of it. I am glad I came across this gem!			"

												Skyborn is probably the best RPGMaker game in the market, it is a fun RPG with lovely visuals and a great story that will keep you motivated until the end.Pros:  Lovely textures and character drawings.  Well made Steampunk world with an interesting society.  Unforgettable cast of characters.  Nice, fitting soundtrack.  A great story that makes the game more enjoyable.Cons:  The game is short, after 8.5 hrs I've finished the main story. This has a good side, you barely have to do any grinding so all your time in the game will be enjoyable.  Lack of secondary quests, the game is made towards the main story, I only found 2 secondary quests along the way.  The game resolution is locked to 640x480 so I had to play the whole thing on a small window on my 1080p monitor. (You can play it on fullscreen mode but if your monitor is 16:9 it will look stretched)Overall I really enjoyed my experience with Skyborn and would definitely recommend it, specially if you can get it on sale.

												After reading the synopsis for this game, I was unsure of what to expect. The story sounded dull, but I was looking for a new RPG to play, so I gave Skyborn a chance. In the end, I am very glad I made that decision.I was enthralled by the lovable characters, the gorgeous environments, and a surprisingly endearing story. Skyborn also utilizes a targeting system called “Threat Levels”, which results in very satisfying battles.Although the game can be completed in a short amount of time, in my opinion, it is worth the full price.  If you are looking for an excellent turn-based RPG to play, I highly recommend this game.			"

												I just finished this game, the save data says it took me around 7 hours, but it's probably less if you don't try to get everything and kill everything like I do. Sadly I didn't get what I wanted (some spade cards) but overall I think this is one of the best example of a story rich game out there.The gameplay ain't so hard, if you ever played any Pokemon game this will be like a piece of cake. The leveling and class change is almost too simple in my opinion, but I cared more about the story so that wasn't a problem.Overall I think it's just a very good game.			"

												Skyborn........ where to begin. I completed this rpg in about 15 hours and I must say it was well worth it. But as usual, I like to give my likes and dislikes with every review so let's begin.Likes:1. Compelling story, truly an innocative piece. The whole story surrounding skyborn is enthralling and worth discovery the aspects of what, how and when did they came to be.2. Characters are well thought out and utterly enjoying, had a few laughs and lead protanganist stoood out quite clearly among the others, however I must say all contributed to making the game enjoyable.3. Battle system is damn good for an RPG such as this, developers got this down. Skills were on point for each character and it was nice that they thought of an upgrade system as well.4. Augmenting system was verry good, love that aspect. did not use much of the actual making thing part of the game, but that was also well done.5. Grapppphics, the graphics of the game is astounding, this is the first 2D..I think, rpg with such beautiful graphics I was amazed. Cleaan and not overbearing.Seee basicallly, a recommended game from all of these points. But on to dislikes.1. Sometimes there was some kinda lag or drag...like a fps thing. I am rather confused why this happens since it requires limited specs to run.2. Difficulty, yes I played it on hard, so why the hell am I complaining if I got my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me. Welll....I defeated MOST of the bosses on hard, but the thing is once you defeat a monster, they dont respawn so you basically have a limited level cap from what exp points you gather. So the question is, how on earth I am suppose to beat something when you go from 1 to 1000 in the gap between one battle to the next. NUH MEK NO SENSE TO ME. But I digress I changed the difficulty in 4 instances because of this.3. Why no respawn of monsters,if you lack the necessary level to win then it would make sense to level up. Thats rpg, I dont like turing down the difficulty just to progress in the story, and YES I TRIED, and it impossibru. 4. What elsse.... could use just a little more sidequest, think it was only 2. Could have improvise more and still not compromise the quality of the game.Overall pretty good, I recommended...ooh wait yes.5. The price of this game is not worth 14.99 it is marketed for. Should have been priced waaay lower. Yes it is well planned and so, but the value does not equate the experience. But I bought it for maybe $6.99 while on sale.. and I think that is more deserving. But then again, I from Jamaiaca, wher my dollar is quite devalued and so it is hard to fork out soo much money for an rpg as this. But then maybe mi cheap, who knows...hhappy playing folks.			"

												The game is interesting, it changes the suroundings prety fast, so that You don't have to play in the same level over and over again, has it small puzzles, but rarely any sidequests. The story developes way too fast with only one optional choice You have to make in the game. It has many posibilities of weapons and armors and trinkets, and all of them can be augmented. I suggest this game to thos who are accustumed to this type of RPG. The characters develop realy slowly or they don't at all. few characters are shown their backstory, but 3 out of 5 times in a single dialog.			"

												I enjoyed Skyborn. I played it through with all the side quests completed and side areas explored, played the ending through twice to get an additional achievement, which adds about two hours to my playtime. I also meandered around a little, messing about with equipment and augments. I'm not particularly skilled at games, so I expect someone more experienced would take a shorter amount of time to run through it.I'm mostly interested in story and characters, so it was interesting to be caught up in a revolution, and I adored the main cast of characters. The game doesn't really have romance, although it was teased throughout, so the ending wasn't quite satisfying for me, and it opened up a fascinating possible plot thread that didn't really get addressed. Story-wise though, it was a good ending, with the main plot being wrapped up in a satisfying way.It's a fun game, though I would recommend getting it on sale.			"

""Among all the RPG Maker titles on Steam, Skyborn is one of the most solid entries for the genre.""The premise is simple; Claret Spencer, a genius mechanic and protagonist of the story, gets herself involved in a conflict between the Skyborn, a Dragon race who oppress the rest of the population, specially those who are hybrids, and a rebel group led by a mysterious individual that seek to free these citizens from the Skyborn's hands.The game features likeable, yet small, cast of characters, which are pretty well developed, considering the rather short length of the game. There are several ""tiers"" of equipment available during the course of the story, which can be enhanced with extra attack, hp, element resistances, and other bonuses. Grinding for a few levels might be necessary, but having the right equipment and upgrades is more than good enough (specially for the arena bosses, some of which are pretty tough without the right resistances).Overall, Skyborn is a fun game with a engaging story and more than decent characterization. Recommended for those who enjoy classic RPG's.			"

												8/10 Ladies and Gentlemen, Skyborn. Truly a hidden gem. Got it for free. No regrets, totally worth every dollar if you paid for it.[Menu/Video Settings/Audio]+ Simple save/load system with more than sufficient save slots if you want to try different team builds.+ Easy customisable audio (BGM, BGS, SFX)+ Amazing soundtrack (I especially like the Main Menu one)+ Text speed configuration (Saves you so much pain if you dislike slow text)+ Minor details such as window skin colour- Lack of resolution configuration, video quality settings (Well, okay, since it's kinda themed like GBA games)- No controller support (Would've loved it, for even greater feel of old style console games)- Really low frames that hurt when you run on a monitor with high res + refresh rate + large screen)[Gameplay]+ Great character development, backstories introduced slowly at appropriate times+ Final Fantasy styled combat system, giving a very strategic, engaging feel (Can't always rely on dumb luck)+ Overall mostly a good plot, although I feel kinda like there was much more to expect after the ending+ Good degree of flexibility to customise your combat style with 2 class changes per character (except last character)- Combat can get kinda repetitive at some points where the monster encounter density is too high- Replayability is not so much, unless you just want to try out new classes or finish the side questsJust a good game. If it's on sale for less than 10, just buy it already.			"

												This a must play game for anyone who likes Zalda/link games back from the NES era (Gameplay was very retro RPG). It also has the mix of older Final Fantasy feeling on how the battle system works.  Sweet and simple RPG game with nice story and great music.  The game on the normal difficulty isn't hard at all, especially if one doesn't shy away from these fights to maximize the character stats.Cons: - One of the dungeons is so long that it disrupted the game's flow, and made me more anxious to try to get through it as quickly as possible instead of explore it.- The shop interface does not compare the weapon/armor sold to what is currently equipped by the characters.you may see the whole gameplay on the YouTube Channel:

												This game was a very satisfying and quickly immersive new-age RPG. It had a feeling reminiscent of FF6 and Chrono Trigger for me, which was a big plus given my love of those games. The combat was quite addicting, and the different class choices, in addition to gear customization up the wazoo, made character progression very fulfilling. It is a fairly short game (I did 95% of everything, and I clocked a little under 20 hrs in my playthrough), but I loved every minute of it. The only complaint I might make is the ending felt somewhat abrupt, and I definitey ended up feeling like I wanted more.			"

												Skyborn is a short RPGMaker-made game that's very good looking (in the japanese anime classical style) and has great music.  It exposes interracial and social classes conflicts in a steampunk-fantasy sort of environment. The story is good but the arcs of the characters' stories are not very complicated and there are no important choices to make or crossroads where several endings can develop.Fights are not at every corner of an alley because you can visually choose (most of the times) if you fight enemies or you just ignore them. The story/fighting ratio is well balanced, but while some generic enemies are a piece of cake some bosses are a pain in the mouse's left button. By the way, while some enemies' design goes according to the world presented, some others seem to have been taken out of other very different projects.Gameplay is easy either with a keyboard or with the mouse, but the UI both in the character menus and in battle is a little bit of a mess and if you pause the game for a long time you will have to re-learn almost everything. Fights are repetitive and turn-based and the special effects are not outstanding but acceptable. You can upgrade your characters' classes and abbilities but even then some of they are left behind while others grow.I recommend Skyborn if you like classical J-turn-based-RPGs and you are not too exigent.

												While this game harkens back to what is good about console RPGs...character leveling; weapon mods; mathematics based combat; boss monsters...it barely builds up enough steam before the game ends. However, character leveling is missing skill customization and is automatic tacked on attribute points; weapon mods are very simple and is easy to get to the higher level wpns; boss monsters really aren't that powerful or add much story (and no good item drops) to the arena they appear.I've logged 15 hrs which is very short compared to the weeks I spent playing things like FF.

 ""Is a good/regular oldstyle rpg game""  Talking a bit about everything Has a good story, the graphics are simple and ""oldstyle"" probably your pcmasterrace machine won't use even 10% of it's power but for me is ok it really remembers me of the old games I used to play, I liked the music, the combat is really what you would spect, simple 2D images getting impacted by your attacks (like a pokemon fight, not pokemon go, just pokemon...). Good classic gameplay  I really liked this game, while I played it I felt very good, having a slow game with a good story is unusual this days but was really good to play it, every time I was stressed and no one was playing anything I just started playing this and in a short period of time I completed it. The price... I got it for free  According to the actual price of the game it costs $14.99 in my opinion this is a high price for this game, but probably (not entirely sure) the game during steam sales should be around half the price and at that point (around $7.5) for me it would be a good price, but if it is even lower than that I would grab it.

												A story of rebellion against an unjust dictator(s), of human integrity, and of magic vs technology.  There's also a random chick who threatens, emptily, to eat you but never tries.  Unless you let her (but for real, why was she in the game)!  You play as Claret, a mechanic in the upper level of human society who repairs airships and makes the occasional automaton who can beep.  She somehow understands perfectly because reasons.  In her life is her brother and some random dude.  Her brother ends up being an awful guy (for reasons you'll learn five minutes in), but only for the first 10 minutes.  After wards, he changes into a damsel in distress and then we forget he exists.  If you don't have character art/portraits, then no one cares about you.  Welcome to video games.  The game play is typical old school RPG affair: you go to various lands; a desert, a volcano (that has surprising soothing music), a forest, ruins, and a multi-layered, caste style city.  You meet various people from all background, five of which are usable in combat, and then save the world.  Combat is a bit different than many games.  For the first half it's, arguably, optional.  You can find shining dots across the map and use that to level-up which give more exp than the actual monsters (only early on).  They're pretty easy to see to don't worry about missing any, besides, there's always the actual combat system to level up on.  Once you get all five characters, the dots effectiveness diminishes and killing monsters starts to be rewarding.  Fortunately, the battles can be fun.  Each character has a set of skills they learn, and that depend on their role in your party and the class you choose from.  At several points in the game, you have the option (meaning it's also optional) to upgrade character classes and learn new skills and passively upgrade stats.  Here's the kicker, though.  All of the skills are useful through out all of the game.  We've all played games where the earliest skills becomes obsolete about 10 minutes after learning it but Skyborn isn't one of those games.  That level 1 skill is still useful throughout the entire game or, at the very least, becomes a bridge to the more powerful, expensive, skills learned later in the game.  This is especially true for the non-magical characters who use energy (EN) to attack.  These characters gain EN when using basic attacks, or 0 EN skills, and release the EN when using the more powerful skills.  Buff/debuffs are one or two of a kind and are useful at all portions.  There is also a threat system that works similar to MMORPGS where, whoever has the most threat, gets punched in the face.  There is a bar that says who has what and is only relevant to enemy parties.  You can still attack whoever.  You also have the option to play each character in a variety of ways.  Do you want your mage to do damage with in-hands or with their spells?  Do you one character to be the buff/debuff character or the straight DPS?  Which character do you want to the tank?  Even the gear add to this.  Late game, there are multiple options for equipment for each character.  Some raise INT to do more damage with skills, some raise STR to do more with in-hands.  There are some limitations but there are freedoms not seen often in Skyborn.  *Keep in mind, I was playing on easy mode.  Apparently, hard has more set restrictions.Characters are not on-screen in combat but the enemy sprites are.  Sadly, there is no animation but animation is hard and expensive for a small 2-3 people company.  Spell effects do exist and most are 32-bit pretty so there's something to look at while you shoot a “totally not a manticore” in the face.  There are no random battles and each enemy cluster is visible on the screen and only enters combat when it touches you.  The characters all have a definite personality and the developers did of a good job of trying to get you to emphasize with them.  There's the strong, independent female lead, the rich guy who actually just wants to be the hero, the good natured girl-beast who has been treated like an outcast, the sick of being pushed around mage, and the always questioning “superior race”.  When one character can no longer do a certain “thing” at the end of game, you feel bad.  When you find about the final fate of those captives, you're shocked and disgusted.  I was torn during the middle of the game when faced with the moral dilemma.  Alas, this is a liner game so the moral dilemma didn't fall into my hands but was played out as it did.  The game boosts an original soundtrack that is pretty good.  Nothing spectacular but nothing ruins the mood.  It's all very relaxing and worth listening to once or twice.  I'd get into specifics but I'm a bad musician and everyone has their own tastes so here's some streamable links so you can decide on your own:Spotify Web Player[open.spotify.com]iTunes[itunes.apple.com]Art Work is pretty.  I'm not familiar with RPGMaker so I can't say how much of it has been over saturated in it's games.  Typical retro style; look at the screenshots.  Overall, Skyborn was a fun experience and, since the game is often on sale, is worth the money spent and time “wasted”.  I got 16 hours out of it and I've seen the game sell for a few bucks USD and it's worth it on sale.			"

												I wanted to try an RPG style game for the first time, and this caught my eye as it has a female protagonist (a non-Mary Sue one at that!) I was a little skeptical at first, but the gorgeous art and soundtrack quickly won me over. There is no character in this game that is not at least understandable. The protagonists are likeable and relateable, and there were parts of the ending that I honestly didn't see coming. Fairly easy to beat, but really hard to get 100% completion, so good replay value. The humor is spot on, as is the pathos. All in all, a great introduction to the genre for me. Five stars easy.			"

												A story of rebellion against an unjust dictator(s), of human integrity, and of magic vs technology.  There's also a random chick who threatens, emptily, to eat you but never tries.  Unless you let her (but for real, why was she in the game)!  You play as Claret, a mechanic in the upper level of human society who repairs airships and makes the occasional automaton who can beep.  She somehow understands perfectly because reasons.  In her life is her brother and some random dude.  Her brother ends up being an awful guy (for reasons you'll learn five minutes in), but only for the first 10 minutes.  After wards, he changes into a damsel in distress and then we forget he exists.  If you don't have character art/portraits, then no one cares about you.  Welcome to video games.  The game play is typical old school RPG affair: you go to various lands; a desert, a volcano (that has surprising soothing music), a forest, ruins, and a multi-layered, caste style city.  You meet various people from all background, five of which are usable in combat, and then save the world.  Combat is a bit different than many games.  For the first half it's, arguably, optional.  You can find shining dots across the map and use that to level-up which give more exp than the actual monsters (only early on).  They're pretty easy to see to don't worry about missing any, besides, there's always the actual combat system to level up on.  Once you get all five characters, the dots effectiveness diminishes and killing monsters starts to be rewarding.  Fortunately, the battles can be fun.  Each character has a set of skills they learn, and that depend on their role in your party and the class you choose from.  At several points in the game, you have the option (meaning it's also optional) to upgrade character classes and learn new skills and passively upgrade stats.  Here's the kicker, though.  All of the skills are useful through out all of the game.  We've all played games where the earliest skills becomes obsolete about 10 minutes after learning it but Skyborn isn't one of those games.  That level 1 skill is still useful throughout the entire game or, at the very least, becomes a bridge to the more powerful, expensive, skills learned later in the game.  This is especially true for the non-magical characters who use energy (EN) to attack.  These characters gain EN when using basic attacks, or 0 EN skills, and release the EN when using the more powerful skills.  Buff/debuffs are one or two of a kind and are useful at all portions.

												This game is a short, but excellent blast from the past. Felt like I was a kid playing Final Fantasy again for the first time, but with a cooler setting and really great music. Definitely worth the few hours it takes to beat!			"

												It's definitely one of my favorite RPG Maker games on Steam. The characters are likeable, graphics are nice and the story is really good. Every battle brings a lot of fun. I definitely recommend it.			"

												Very fun, straight forward, clasic style rpg. Characters are interesting, plot is interesting, music is good. FOr an RPGM game, this is well done. Its not very pricy, i'd say its worth even the full 15 bucks.			"

												As for someone who dislikes JRPG's this was a refreshing change of this from a generic one, enough for me to not ALT+F4 instanlty. (that's how much i hate JRPGS). Would sya pass for someone who isn't into JRPG genre, but for someone who is, i'd say chech it out.			"

												Solid, short, fun. It's not exceptional, the combat isn't spectacular, and sometimes it can be a little mazelike. That being said, the score is ok, the graphics and portraits are really good, and the characters are great. The only real problem I have with Skyborn is that it feels almost cut-off. Like the game finishes two-thirds of the way through and doesn't have the time to build up to the climax and denouement. Instead everything finishes all at once very rapidly and feels somewhat unsatisfying.			"

												Skyborn is a thoughtful and modernly designed RPG, in that it allows for those of us who just no longer have the time or interest to devote to typical RPG trappings such as battle grinding and complex inventory management.It reminds me of Final Fantasy, there's not much difference between the two of them.If you like RPG type games, this one's a must for you!08/10			"
