Mayday, mayday, oh stuff it, HEEEEELP...You've crashed. On a planet. It's a planet made up of wierd and strange things, creatures that up until your arrival quite likely existed in peace and harmony, and then you brought yourself, your mass of crates which have scattered around the landscape, and the teleporters you so desperately need to get back to your now scuffed up transport ship to get out of dodge. Whilst on the surface the game is very much a case of guns blazing and murder everything in sight, as you dig into the lore and entries of the game, what you'll learn is that the planet was more or less *fine* until the ship crashlanded, spewed it's cargo all over the shop and you, in your size twelves and large caliber weapons, decided to cut a swathe through the landscape to get out.Congratulations, you are the risk of rain the locals keep talking about. Don't you feel just awesome?Tightly tuned, finely balanced, class based roguelite gameplay...Starting the game the first time gives you access to the beginner class - Commando. This class is a good place to learn how to deal with the game, and a balanced set of skills that should see you progress at a reasonable rate. All the unlockable classes are tailored towards specific styles of play, and generally require specialist approaches to get the most out of them. A good example is the enforcer, which is far slower and less mobile than the commando, but due to his riot shield, can essentially soak -ridiculous- quantities of damage from the direction he's facing.Later classes are even more specialised, opening up classes that work from afar, or specialise in deployables or traps, or have other means of dealing with situations. In short, every class feels unique, and has their own combos and specific ways to work things out. Furthermore, with the items that you can collect, every class will evolve differently based on the drops you find. The Enforcer in one playthrough will be an entirely different Enforcer in the next. Even if there are some items you'll ideally want to grab each time.The importance of good design and a great soundtrackThe graphics might be pixel art, which by this stage you'd think have been done to death, but on the contrary, the clear, concise design and the very well thought out vision ensure that this game always looks stylish and well presented. This is a game that revels in looking good, and always ensures that the player is in control of what's going on, even when there's a -lot- going on at once.Combined with the precise and well balanced combat, along with the great sense of atmosphere, is potentially one of the best soundtracks of recent times, going alongside things such as Don't Starve, Deus Ex : Human Revolution, and Really Big Sky. A good soundtrack sells the atmosphere, and in this case it's been captured perfectly, possibly one of the best soundtracks in my library.Deep replayability and a stellar atmosphere combinedRisk of rain was one of my top picks when I bought it, this has not changed and it still remains one of the greatest games available on steam. Along with the legends like FTL, like Dungeons of Dredmor, Risk of Rain should be considered essential gaming for anyone who wants to get their hands into the genre of ""Roguelites"" that contains things like Spelunky and co.Verdict : EssentialWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

Stop adding me without even saying anything. Jesus Christ have some decency serious review? serious review. Risk of Rain is an extremely addictive arcade style 2D platformer shoot-em-up with roguelike elements.Gameplay consists of dying a lot attempting to reach and activate the stage exit teleporter in each level, there are a total of 6 levels to complete per game before achieving TOTAL VICTORYOnline Co-Op, many characters with their own unique playstyle, randomly generated level layouts, and loads of items keep gameplay fresh and exciting so you can just get goat hooves and syringes and win instantlyGameplayTight, responsive controls and enough characters to pick a playstyle that you enjoy make this an incredibly fun and rewarding experience.GraphicsA charming, simple artstyle with smooth animations makes this game a treat for the eyes.SoundAn expertly done soundtrack brings a LOT to the table, sound quality is good, sound effects aren't obnoxious.StoryA very ambigous story, no definite answers are given, but clues are relayed through item logs and monster descriptions.Multiplayer?This game features both local and online co-op, the co-op system (especially online) is a bit excruciatingly buggy, but very fun to play with friends.Fun?The artstyle, gameplay, and unpredictability of this game make for an extremely enjoyable time.  Category Score   Gameplay 10/10   Graphics 10/10   Sound 10/10   Story 10/10   Multiplayer? Local and online co-op.   Fun? Yes!   Overall 10/10  "

I wish there were more Roguelikes that was on the scale of Risk Of Rain.What's Risk Of Rain?Risk Of Rain is a platforming rouglike with it's own interesting universe, easy to understand controls, and crazy gameplay.This is one of the few games that will help you feel like a god. The amount of power you can gain, from being a lowly survivor of the UES Contact Light that dies from a single bite to walking into rooms and watching the universe collapse every time you press ""Z"".Every character that you play stands out from each other, having their own attacks, look, and feel. Not ONE character feels underpowered or overpowered compared to the rest.Although this game doesn't have the absurd number of items like Binding Of Isaac has...what it DOES have is how every item is viable and doesn't completely topple your playstyle over if you get it. While this does mean there aren't many ""weapon changing items"", I find so much joy in even finding a common item, as it brings me one step closer to absolute destruction.That's the joy I find in this game, it's to get as powerful as possible and go as long as possible. There's a nice story under it all (and good reason as to why the items in the game are even there) and if you really think about what you're doing...You're the villain of this story, whenever you like it or not. The only way you could be somewhat good is if you blaze through the game as quickly as possible and killing as few as you can. The story's optional, though, and you can read about it when you kill foes in Rainstorm or Monsoon difficulties, since they drop logs at a slightly rare chance.Almost every level has a artifact hidden in it, but you have to be lucky to roll the version of the level that has it. Every Artifact changes up the rules of the game, and gives interesting changes to it. Like, the lower the health something has (including you) the faster you will run, everything exploding with a shower of Creamator explosions when they die, a random skill of yours locking every minute..there's even one called Command that tosses out most of the RNG of the game and gives you chest drops when you get an item. The chest color is the rarity of the items you recieved, and you can pick whatever item from the item table you please. It's balanced, though, that the window you select items is real time, and you cannot move until you pick an item.When I mentioned ""easy controls"", this game really does have simple controls. four buttons mapped for your movement, and four buttons mapped for your skills. You can even use a controller.This game gets interesting when you bring in your pals for co-op, while making it even more chaotic. The game's completely viable solo, but the difficulty becomes interesting in co-op. Do you let your friend take the item drop, or do you snag it for yourself?There's also a forced item sharing button, which balances out the items for players. Though, me and my friends agree this system is incredibly annoying, so take that with a grain of salt.The music of the game is an interesting contrast from the chaotic blitzplay of  the game. Even the most intense of the soundtrack is actually quite nice music to sleep too.

If you want my personal favorite piece from the game, it has to be Surface Tension. It's also a boss track, usually used for the Wandering Vagrant boss.The bosses in this game will be intimidating and will pose a threat, like any boss will, but as you become stronger, you may be able to start one shotting them..and..as you progress even further, normal foes will be replaced by bosses. Ever faced twelve giant magma worms, three overloading ones, six vagrants, and ten colossi at once?It's one hell of a good time!Despite all my praise for the game, though, I do have a gripe about the game. Though, it doesn't bother me too much.The levels and item count.The levels will soon feel repetitive, since you will learn their layouts pretty quickly...but at least the levels themselves have different setups. Though it doesn't help that the setups only change the minor places.The items aren't in a vast quanity, where you will always find new ones...but, hey. Every item is viable to helping you become stronger. I'd rather have this than several items that are ""considered"" low tier and useless. Overall, this game, albeit not a masterpiece or a gamechanger for everything that comes after it, it's a really fun game that's even one hell of a ride with friends.And you know what? That's all I want to ask every once in a while. For the fun alone, I'd highly reccomend the game. The characters are colorful and vastly different from each other (along with having a lot of them) the items you can pick up are ALL great, none are trick items or downgrades, the game chugs on to become blitzplay after you start slaying... It's worth the price.One more thing to mention. Every item in the game itself has a bit of story on it. Some of the Item logs are even begging for their own stories.I'd play this over Binding Of Isaac anyday.			"

												Beautiful, sophisticated, yet brutal. Yes, like your new girlfriend, Risk of Rain is a ball of wonderment and pain.In this rogue-like platformer, you run around each level trying to find a teleporter. Meanwhile, enemies spawn randomly; killing them gives you gold with which you can open containers with upgrades for your character. Once you find a teleporter, you fight a boss and ultimately move on to the next level.The catch? The longer you play, the tougher the enemies become! So speed is of the essence as well as quick reflexes and mob management.The artstyle for this game is pixel based, and it's wonderful how much character these little sprites have! The tiny animations are smooth, and watching an enemy explode into blocks of meat chunks is satisfying.The music is also fantastic; it's a hauntin track that sounds like a dubstep/trance hybrid one moment and a thumping bass the next.And the gameplay: oh boy, is this game tough! But you come out of it a better man (or woman) with blistered fingers and a beard on her knuckles (that goes for the women too).So this game comes highly recommended! There are a lot of achievements/unlockables including new items and classes, so the replay value is truly up there. Do yourself a favor and pick up Risk of Rain!			"

												Where do you begin with a game like Risk of Rain? It's so new and original, yet so classic and oddly memorable that we can all adapt to it rather quickly while not feeling like we're repeating something playing it. Most ""pixel games"" as they call them I see now are simply normal games... with pixel-y art styles. This is one of those games that actually blends well with the art style, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Let's talk about gameplay for a sec.Gameplay: Risk of Rain will kill on your first run. If this does not happen, you are probably a carrier of Jesus' will and strength on Earth, because it's pretty dang hard to pick up on your first go. But to help, I'll elaborate on just how NOT to die. You are given the Commando to start out with, and classes like the Bandit, Enforcer, and CHEF will be easy to get early on. Every character has 4 skills, kind of like LoL, except you don't have a basic attack outside of them - They're all you got. Most classes tend to have a movement-enhancing skill in their third slot, and a powerful skill in their fourth. The Commando is no exception. He has 4 basic skills which are very easy to learn and starts with above-average high health to help beginners.Unlocking Stuff: Unlocking stuff isn't as easy as you would think. You're probably going to start on Drizzle, the easiest game mode. However, if you're a wimp, the game won't save any of your progress (This includes item logs), and no monster logs will drop either. If you want 100% completion, you're going to have to step it up. Most characters are unlocked by doing special things or filling requirements. No surprise there. The Huntress and Mercenary are pretty hard to get, asking for 15 monster logs and 5 game-wins, respectively. But don't worry - You'll get there if you like the game.Items and YOU: Items are, without a doubt, THE most key tool you need to survive the night. When you start out, you will find items randomly from boss kills, chests, imp vases, shrines, and other places. Chests require money, imp vases require you to hunt down and kill a few frantic imps, shrines are like casinos, and bosses should be obvious - Kill em for good stuff. Most (Keyword - Most) items can stack. A few, like Thallium, can not. This is why the RoR Wiki is your field guide for items here. Items give you various buffs and bonuses, and have the power to make or break you depending on how you use them and your luck with finding items that suit you. Once you start picking up Artifacts, hidden items that you can activate to change gameplay once you die, quit, or win, can alter some things - But I'll let you figure that all out.Difficulty: There's two ways this game changes difficulty - One, by choosing your difficulty on the character-select screen, and two, by slowly raising it during gameplay at a speed dependant on what difficulty you chose. This makes for very adjustable learning curves that will suit you everywhere. Artifacts can also help or hinder you if you're good at using them or not, for example; The Glass artifact cuts your health to 10%, but gives you a HUGE damage boost (Used to be x5 damage but they nerfed it, I have no idea what it is now - Don't worry, it's still fun as heck if you don't get hit!). Remember to start and progress at a rate that you're comfortable with, or else you might not have as much fun.Conclusion: Oh yes, this is a game you need. Don't even ask why, just get it. It's 10 bucks. It's awesome. Once you know how to use and abuse the artifacts and characters, you'll pretty much be playing something like a God Simulator with every run, finding new ways to use your characters, match items, and have fun with MULTIPLAYER - That's right, MULTIPLAYER! Also, achievements in the form of READING AND KNOWLEDGE! Also, THE GAME LAUGHS AT YOU WHEN YOU DIE and gives SNARKY REMARKS! The art-style is AMAZING! The music is AMAZING! The gameplay is BONKERS RADICAMAZING TIMES TEN! Just! Get! This! Game!			"

												After crashing on a planet you're tasked with a simple set of objectives. -Survive -Find the teleporter-Survive some more-Eradicate everythingrepeat.  For most games this could wear thin and become repetitive rather quickly but that simply isn't the case with this game.When you first play, chances are you will die a bunch without really knowing what to do. You'll unlock something else though and it will get easier over time. Think of this as a survival/horde mode roguelike countra-ish shooter platformer that never gets stale.     Each play through will generally net you either a new power up or unique character class to eviscerate and dismember the various lifeforms of each planet and area. It has a Binding of Isaac feel in a sense that things are swapped and randomized with each play through but you'll always fight the same bosses and end boss/stage. Much like Isaac your power ups stack and you can have some really brutal and devastating combinations by the time you get to the end.   The different classes and characters you unlock all have different and interesting criteria to make them available for use and there is something satisfying in seeing that you have reached a new tier of badassery when you are now plowing through enemies with dual pickaxes or laying down your heavy shield and firing cover shots to keep the wave of enemies at bay.the starting class ""Commando"" is more than suited for the task at hand, especially playing at Drizzle difficulty, but it should be known that every character plays completely different from the next and has a dedicated skill set and pool of abilities.   The bosses as well as the native creatures populating the planet are all aggressive and will swarm you the minute you come within proximity of them. This game also gives you a sense of urgency to complete the planet by steadily spiking the difficulty as the little ticker in the corner continues to count. If you can handle it you can play as long as you want, you can even get all the way to end and start back from the first level with all of your power ups in hand. There is a flexible and open level of choice that allows for revisiting the game and trying different things time and time again.  Risk of Rain comes complete with a somewhat minimalist pixel art style and the characters would be moving dots if the view was pulled out any further but it also helps give the monsters a look of towering giants and puts you in David V Goliath scenario for the duration of your journey. All of this is backed by an amazing and atmospheric soundtrack that will constantly have you nodding your head or getting pumped in rhythm of the beat.   You can get as much as you want out of this game but if you put the time and effort into it, you can squeeze an amazing amount of time and play out of your 9.99. Overall I give this game an 8.8/10 and recommend it to anyone who is a fan of roguelikes, team co op, old school side scrolling platformer shooters, and indie games.			"

												Risk of Rain is an action-platformer with roguelike elements, with some interesting mechanics wich I'll try to explain the best I can.Even if you start with only one playable character, there're ten of them total, and each one plays differently, thanks to his own four attacks.As time passes, difficulty will increase and enemies will spawn endlessly until you find the teleport, wich makes you fight for one last endurance round; beaten that, you can advance to the next level. Like other games of this genre, you can find active/passive upgrades (like piercing shots, increased defense, missiles and so on), but you can level-up too by collecting experience. An interesting fact is that powerups do stack, so you can have increased effects by collecting more of the same.Once you've completed enough levels, you can choose between replaying them to gain more loot, or going to the final one; you can easily grind more powerups if you want to, but the game can be beaten in less than a hour in a good run.Bear in mind that this is the kind of game where things get bad pretty fast, and you have to start all over again.Pixelated graphics are really good, but sometimes the action on screen become a little too chaotic. Chaos apart, gameplay is overall pretty much solid and fun.The game's soundtrack is AWESOOOOOME, I love it.Also, this game has coop, playing with other people works well and in my opinion some classes are not meant to be played alone.Reccomended if these features caught your attention, and/or if you have friends to play with.I don't think Risk of Rain is a masterpiece, but it's a really solid game.

												Roguelikes have exploded as a genre lately, largely due to the number of indie productions out there exploring interesting ways to take an absolutely classic title and bolt new mechanics to it. Games like FTL, Rogue Legacy and Paranautical Activity instantly come to mind, taking randomised areas, crazy power-ups and eternal death as a basis and building them into something new and fresh.Risk of Rain takes the idea of an impossible Roguelike to new heights. The hook of this 2D action platformer is rather simple: it literally gets harder with each passing second. Immediately the player needs to make a conscious decision: do you grind out the game in the first few minutes when the enemies are few and far between, farming gold and unlocking passive abilities that will help you when you reach the ten minute mark and all hell breaks loose? Or perhaps you want to rush through as many stages as possible before the difficulty curve rises. Risk of Rain is all about risk and reward, and while it doesn't necessarily break genre conventions, it manages to provide a compelling twist on basic mechanics.Players are given access to a number of characters, each with four unique abilities that will aid them in combat. Each of said abilities has a cool-down timer after use, so learning which character fits your play style, and how they fit in with the rest of your team is imperative for survival. In the beginning you only have access to the assault trooper, but after multiple runs you will slowly unlock a cast of devastating characters that will help you see the game through until the end.Once you select a character it's game on. You are dropped on a hostile world, filled with enemies. Each enemy killed will net you some gold, which can be spent unlocking chests found in the level, or taking a gamble and spending some at a divine statue. Sometimes this will yield you amazing items, other times it will take your money and laugh at your tears as you received nothing at all. Each time you use one of the statues the cost goes up also, which often had me throwing money away at it three times before I realised I was broke.There are tons of items throughout Risk of Rain that will give you the upper edge, most of them offering passive buffs against your foes. There are a select number of consumable items you will find along the way that can be used to get yourself out of a tight jam, and there are also some helpful assault and healing drones that you can spend money repairing so they will follow you around and help against the onslaught of enemies. Just like any Roguelike, learning how to use these items in unison is key to survival, and after a dozen or so runs, you will begin to understand how it all fits together.Each level essentially has the same goal: find and activate the teleporter which will call in a randomised boss fight. The bosses are tough....really bloody tough, and they will definitely give you a run for your money. To make matters worse, the timer is still creeping up towards a harder difficulty, and regular enemies are still spawning into the world, which makes is a cluster of pain and misery. Once the boss has been defeated the enemies stop spawning, you are left to clear the last of them, and then you can teleport to the next level. Before you leave however, you better search for any chests you may have missed, because each time you teleport you will lose your gold.Risk of Rain keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time, simply because that ominous timer is always ticking in the upper right corner. Slowly but surely you see the difficulty status rise from easy to no chance in hell and the sweat starts forming on your brow. You want to make sure you survive the game, but you also need to do it as quickly as possible. It's an impossible task, one that is truly captivating and kept us coming back for more and more.While Risk of Rain supports solo gamers, the true core of the game lies with the four-player co-op. When you're tackling the beasts of other worlds with three of your best friends, each playing a different character and you are all working in unison, the game really shines as something special. If you're not likely to play the game with friends, I'd almost recommend skipping it all together; that is how integral the multiplayer truly is.Risk of Rain manages to pull off the pixel look with style and flair. The characters are enjoyable, the enemies are ghastly, and those tunes are fantastic. If you can swing a few dollars, definitely pickup the soundtrack from the website, it's right up there with Fez and Monaco in terms of great indie game albums.Highly Recommended "

												It's hard to say something about Risk of Rain that hasn't already been said in the reviews already, so I guess I'll tell the story about how I came across it:     To start off, I'm a musician. You may be thinking to yourself now: ""Why is this guy telling us this, and, more importantly, why should I care?"" Well, I'll tell you. A few years ago, I went to a music camp for the summer, and one of my favorite things to do was to go out into a nearby field with a small speaker and go stargazing after our performances. We'd find some chill music to pull up and just talk about our lives. One night, this guy suggested we listen to a soundtrack he had, from a game called Risk of Rain. I was intrigued, as I love video game soundtracks, so I told him to plug it in. I was immediately hooked on the music, and I decided to go investigate the game. I played a gameplay trailer, and it looked interesting enough. I was a fan of roguelike games, and the pixelated art style was always something I enjoyed.     A couple weeks later, I went and purchased the game and gave it a go. Being a pretty experienced, I felt ballsy and started on Hard mode... That was a mistake. I was murdered within about 15 minutes. However, after switching down to the normal difficulty, I started playing through, and I loved every second of it. Before I realized it, the difficulty was no longer increasing, and the timer read 150:00. You know you've found a fun game when you can invest two and a half hours into it while having it feel like a matter of minutes.    A couple of days later, I had every class unlocked and just enjoyed myself. I told my friends about the game, got some co-op games going, and just felt happy. The combination of a fun and challenging game is something that I've always enjoyed. The simplicity, and yet precise technicality of the game, was made perfectly. And of course, the music. The soundtrack of the game is just beautiful, and matches the tone and setting of the levels perfectly. If you wanna give it a listen, here's a link:

     Anyway, that's the story of how I found this game. So, if you want a fun game with infinite replayability, and an overall great experience, buy this game. It was worth every penny for me. ;)			"

												ThisgameisAMAZING.The mechanics are well-oiled (especially after the last updates; now, it flows smoothly). The OST is simply beautiful. The graphics create a unique atmosphere: the gameworld is dark-toned but not lugubrious; you feel lonely, but never properly desperate, and the scenarios are always enjoyable (even after countless hours of replay). Also, the storyline of sorts is gradually revealed via item logs and monster logs you acquire after some time playing - the game starts  in media res. You don't need to know what's going on to enjoy it, but it surely adds to the flavor. I particularly like this form of storytelling: a very good game becomes more and more fascinating once you start realizing (well, perhaps not exactly) what's going on after some exploration. It reminds me of Diablo II in this point.Most important, though, is that it is PURE FUN. Very challenging and very rewarding, it leaves me wanting more every time I play. Actually, I sort of developed an emotional attachment to this game; when I started playing it, I was somewhat distant from videogames (after 24 years of being a total videogame nerd), not really willing to play too much. This game (along with Papers, Please and some others) helped me ""feel the magic"" again, sorta like falling in love once more with your boyfriend/girlfriend after a period of strain and doubts.tl;dr: FUN, rewarding, beautiful, challenging, cool, buy the hell out of it			"

												This is be a great game with loads of (sort of unexplored) potential. I mean, the retro graphics are amazing and give the game a nice feeling, the different classes are really fun to play, the soundtrack kicks ♥♥♥, it's 100% worth the 70+ hours I've spent on it.But the only problem is that this doesn't have ""matchmaking"" multiplayer or a in-game server list. You'll have to either use portforwarding or programs such as Hamachi or Evolve.I don't blame the devs for that, though. They are college students, not Bethesda or Ubisoft. They've got actual problems in their lifes to take care of, and this is just their little experiment that turned out right. They still release bugfixes from time to time, though.Anyway, 9.99/10 would slice magma worms with kitchen knives while hiding between a 100-feet-wide electric shield and 2 stacks of alien heads on my face again.EDIT: As of January 2016, the site that had a useful list of servers I posted here doesn't work anymore! You can still try searching for people to play with in places like Steam community forums, Evolve, Reddit or whatever, though.			"

												Risk of Rain is possibly one of my most favourite games ever. I mean it. This is an absolute beast of a game. I am majorly addicted to this. You start off with an basic character with no equipment or upgrades, starting out slowly killing a few bad guys at a time to collect more money, and in turn you open chests with the money you have earn, each chest will have a new piece of equipment which is randomly selected, making each run through completely different to the last. When you reach level 20ish you are completely kitted out in equipment, upgrades and power ups, you can walk through hoards and hoards of bad guys using different techniques. There is nothing wrong with Risk of Rain, at all. To me, this is a perfect game.			"

												How awesome is risk of rain?It's so awesome, it is one of the eight fold paths to gaming enlightenment. Right up there with speed running super Metroid, breaking 150 actions per minute in star craft and getting through all of half life with nothing but a crowbar.  It breaks you first. Makes you accept that there is no hope and forces you to re-assess why it is you need to try again.  You realize you are not playing for the win, you are playing for the playing.  Your inner pixel art lotus flower opens up and only then will you make it to the end.			"

												The longer you stay on this hellhole of a planet, the tougher things will get.But you're stranded. So. Please start moving.The inherit challenge of Risk of Rain is to balance speed with thoroughness. Dwell any particular region longer and you're bound to discover (and be able to afford) an array of random weaponry which stacks together in clever ways, turning your hopeless vagrant into a prayed-for messiah. But there's that catch ... the longer you dwell in one zone, the more infernal the next will be. So as you fight simply to survive, you'll also be gauging time and charting hypothetical routes through the mysterious wasteland ... hoping to come across the right combination of moneys, chests and sacrificial totems in efficient order.Aside from the planet's devious armory, your years on the frontier have supplied you with a certain set of skills. Regardless of your profession, these core skills usually take form in a weak-ish basic attack, a middling form of crowd control, some type of evasion, and a signature ability (think of this as the one that won you all that money on The Universe's Got Talent: Killing Edition). Each time you use a skill - beyond the basic attack - you'll have to wait a few seconds before you can use it again. As that one random monster crab is quickly joined by every casual acquiantance from his apparently quite-social life, those seconds can seem like an eternity. But you'll need to use those skills with abandon - conservation is for another time and place.Again. Don't stop.As your deaths accumulate, Risk of Rain becomes a game about learning the ins-and-outs of an alien frontier while constantly pushing yourself to discover new corners of its relentless universe. Your only choice of profession at the start is a fine-tuned but vanilla-bean commando. But just as you begin to master your skills, you'll unlock a new, entirely unique character to possibly nudge your game progress further. Trust those who have come before: The new characters will often feel useless on the first playthrough. At some point, you'll wrap your brain around the death-delivering potential of each. And as you pour gallons of acid across shadowy plains or single-shot the entire health bar of one of the game's gargantuan bosses, you will learn to feel invincible ... for a minute or two at least.Each of the planet's progressively elaborate environments includes a familiar basic layout from play to play, but its random generation makes each play just uncomfortable enough to force you to make decisions on the fly. Level talk is boring, but do note: the surprisingly elaborate final stage is reward in itself.Risk of Rain is a game that requires skill and cunning ... but not so much skill and cunning to be abusive. It drops a torrent of challenges on you ... while giving you delightful ways to overcome them. To this survivor: It's earned a place in the Roguelike Temple of Elders.Be sure to visit.Just remember to keep moving.			"

												This late in the game, it may be pointless to review Risk of Rain, but I figured I should since I have a kind of a rekindled love affair with it.  Keep in mind, however, that most of my playtime has been on the Vita/PS4 and I am now faced with the daunting task of unlocking everything on my PC copy.  So take this as you will.Released in 2013 (holy crap, that long ago?), Risk of Rain is an indie action platformer best characterised as rogue-lite and quite frankly, it is a total blast to play.  When I got it, shortly after release, I put a little bit of time into it, but admittedly, I didn't -get- it.  When you first fire up the game, you have only one character available (the Commando) and after a little intro detailing some dude destroying your cargo ship and your drop-pod blasting down to the planet below, you're left to your own devices.  The drop-pod shows only the Commando available to choose with the promise of several others to unlock in the future and the promise is exciting.  But when I originally started playing, I had no idea what to do, what I was doing, or really why I was doing it.It was fun, but it didn't capture my imagination and I didn't give it the time it needed.  The game was out to kill me and it was doing a good job.  I wasn't doing very well at all with the Commando and I was desperately hoping to unlock some other kind option (to this day, I still don't like the Commando).  Like I said, I didn't get the game at all.  It was weird, it was alien, yet it was so beautifully-rendered and fascinating that I at least wanted to give it a go.  I didn't understand what these chests and jars were for, or why so many enemies seemed to have the upper hand on me.  After about an hour (keep in mind, at that time my runs in the game were probably no more than 10-15 minutes at a time), I had unlocked nothing at all, so I moved on, thinking perhaps this was one game that I wasn't going to meet for coffee later.  Yet something about it spoke to me.It wasn't until it appeared on PSN that I thought, huh, you know what, with such short runs, this makes the perfect hand-held game (for the record, it is the perfect hand-held game until you start beasting and having 30-60-minute runs), so I bought it yet again because of that -need- to understand the game and why it had always sat in the back of my head, sort of like how my first experience with Demon's Souls made me put it down, but it always called back to me.  So it was on the subway as I was blasting away at purple lizards and smokey mushrooms that the game finally clicked.  I had that ""a-ha"" moment like when you're struggling with something in class or at work and suddenly it all makes sense.At first, the game is merely about survival.  You will be minding your own business when suddenly mobs just start spawning in front, behind, above, and below you.  They hit, and they hit hard.  Worse yet, there's this difficulty timer on the screen that is slowly creeping up, almost mocking you as you die on ""Very Easy"" (for the record, I like the level named ""I SEE YOU"").  As it goes up, more things spawn; stronger things; scary things.  You die.  You retry.  As you practice - and let's be frank, you need to practice - the game starts unbuttoning its shirt for you, one button at a time, teasing the prize underneath.  You've noticed that the things you're picking up appear at the bottom of the screen in rows, all of them bestowing some kind of ability, some kind of assistance.  You're living a little longer.  You're braving the levels now, with a sense of purpose to get even MORE stuff to carry, each new item making you last that much longer, making you that much stronger.  You've maybe got a healing drone or some turrets following you to make life a little easier.  You've unlocked a piggy bank thing that allows you to buy even more chests to open.  Eventually you are marching across the maps, unburdened by the equivalent of a warehouse strapped to your back, an indestructible god of violent chaos and at your command, you can unleash a missile salvo or fire off the weapon that you stole from the boss whose face you now wear stretched across your head.  You reach the final boss and show him just what you've become and you relish that moment as the credits roll when you realize that it was all about the journey, not the end.But wait... you've hardly unlocked a thing.  You maybe have only one or two new characters now.  You don't have any monster logs.  Your item collection is missing a whole lot of boxes, some of which you can't even fill because you don't have some ability you've never seen before.  What's this row of artifacts that I can't choose?  Ah, that's what that cube of meat does?  I see, I see.  The purpose has now changed - it's all about discovery now.  The game has clearly told you that it has a lot of secrets to uncover and it whispers, ""Come find me."" You stop just surviving and now you're actually -looking- and the game is telling you that it's always been there in front of your face; a jump that's -just- a little too far, or a hole that's never been there before.  You start asking, ""How do I get there?"" and over and over again, you unravel a little more.  So you do it again.  And again.  And again.  And again...			"

												Risk of Rain is a mix of light 2D platforming, exploration, progression and combat. Each standard playthrough consists of up to 6 worlds the player can explore and fight their way around. Each level has one or two possible versions, and each version has one or two variations. You explore a pretty-looking environment to find the teleporter that takes you to the next level. While you roam around, different kinds of enemies spawn around you and try to give you the business. Killing them grants gold and XP, which lets you progress your character. XP levels you up, but the process is automatic so you really don't need to think about it very much. Gold, on the other hand, plays a much more impactful role, as it allows you to purchase items in a few ways. Every single source of items has a random element to it, even the ones that give you choices. Once you find the teleporter, you have to activate it then survive for a period of time while a boss and a ton of smaller mobs try to ruin your day. The boss always drops an item (sometimes an item you can't get anywhere else), though obviously randomized. The second to last teleporter also offers you the chance to warp back to stage one, albeit with all your items with you and the difficulty level maintained. What does that difficulty part mean? While Risk of Rain does have 3 difficulty options before you start a run, they don't act like you'd expect. Instead they affect how quickly difficulty rises within the game, among other things. Each playthrough starts at Very Easy and goes up as you take longer to finish the game. Each new difficulty level increases enemy spawn rate, how often elite versions of enemies spawn instead of regular ones and how often actual early-game bosses spawn instead too. This exists to give a player reason to not just camp one map for an eternity. Sooner or later, depending on their item RNG and skill, they will get overwhelmed by the silly number and strength of the hordes that spawn in to murder them. The last difficulty level is actually called ""HAHAHAHAHA"", which is just the best.Functionally, the game is pretty smooth. The sound design and music are enjoyable, fitting for the alien world atmosphere they set out to create. The art style is simple but vibrant, with a lot of pleasantly contrasting color choices. Flashy combat scenarios occur naturally throughout the course of a run. The controls are very simple and responsive, so it's easy to get into the game mechanically. I don't remember encountering any bugs, at least in singleplayer (more on that later). The player character occupies only a small piece of the screen but is big enough that it's very clear what's happening, at least until you wander into a horde of different enemies and they all start attacking, which can overwhelm you visually. The user interface very clearly displays all the information you need while playing, and I've never had problems with the in-game options.Next, there's a lot of item and character variety to be enjoyed. Item effects range from basic stuff like ""Increases overall movement speed"" to more noticeable boons like ""Enemies you kill turn into ghosts that work for you"" or ""A ridiculously huge laser appears every once in a while and slaughters everything caught in its path"". The harder the game gets, the more chances you get at scoring the really insane items, but it's still fundamentally a luck-based system, which obviously may turn some people away. Character choices actually affect your playstyle, as each fighter has different strengths and weaknesses. Some of them deal with small groups more easily, others move around more efficiently, others can one-shot bosses with a good item set. Every character has 4 abilities, the first of which is their basic attack. Usually a standard shot or punch. The other three tend to be more character-defining. One character can completely block damage from the front at the cost of movement speed, another has 3 extra movement options, some of them spawn allies to help, etc. All of this adds up to a considerable amount of replay value. Another feature that helps is Artifacts, which are treasures found in obscure corners of the maps or awarded after completing sometimes really vague challenges. These artifacts are unlocked as gameplay modifiers after you first find them and can completely alter how a run is played. From making enemies explode on death to letting you actually choose which items you get to spawning only elites, plus they can be combined. The artifacts are activated BEFORE a run starts so you don't mess up your run when you find one, and you're always given a choice of whether or not to use them. So what are the game's problems? The first depends on personal preference, but the game is filled with enough random elements to probably turn away people who hate not being in total control. If you can't stand the idea of even singleplayer games having things you cannot influence (except with that one artifact, which arguably makes the game too easy), Risk of Rain might not be for you. It doesn't help that some characters are much more item-dependent than others, like the Mercenary. Second, last I checked, multiplayer was a bug-infested hellhole of insanity. I played it with a friend, and whenever one of us would die, their UI would disappear forever until the next run. Not enjoyable, and that's just one issue we encountered.The third problem I see is with how fall damage is implemented. Yes, fall damage in a platformer might be counter-intuitive to some, but it has a place in games like this, since they value careful exploration and tactics. Thing is, you don't take enough damage. In my 80 or so hours of playing, I have never encountered a situation where I'm actually afraid a fall might kill me. Couple that with how falling into pits doesn't actually end the run right there and you have an element in the game that seems half-♥♥♥♥♥. Finally, the game's replay value doesn't stretch out as long as you'd expect when you see how many items and characters it has. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of reasons to keep playing the game after beating it, and I mentioned this above, but it likely won't keep you coming back for as long as something like Binding of Isaac could. This is partly because most items don't immediately completely change the run, since their effects are usually only minor alterations to how you normally fight or move, through procs and mildly increased mobility. Extreme versions of some effects often require multiple acquisitions of the same item, since they stack. Artifacts help out a lot, but even that well dries up eventually and you may be left wanting more content. It would be nice to see more bosses and basic enemies added, or some sort of infinite survival mode with more maps tossed in, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Still, I consider Risk of Rain well worth the asking price. If you can snag it up on sale or as part of a bundle like I did, even better!			"

												Great fun and super addicting. Fast paced platformer and roguelike that makes you fight with increasing difficulty the longer you stand around. As you take longer to finish areas the difficulty increases adding more powerful enemies and upgraded bosses the longer it takes. It has a very similar item system to Binding of Isaac, in which you must unlock items by completeing certain tasks before they are available in the game. While there aren't achievements for ALL of these, the game has a listing in the menu telling you what you must do to unlock them, and the item pages give a short description over the padlock as well to show you what you need to unlock certain items. Starting now with 100 items to unlock and use, I am hoping we get a major update similer to Wrath of the Lamb and I suspect we will!The worlds are randomly generated as well, but I am not sure if this is infinite, or they have a finite nuber of designs at the moment. It is a 2D sidescroller instead of the overhead view of Isaac, but uses a lot of the same concepts. The game also adds a bit of lore to it with unlockable monster profiles that give you a great background on them and some funny dialog. The items also all have their own item cards with interesting infor and funny comments about them. You unlock several (10 total) new playable characters with completely different skills and abilities to play through the game giving it very nice replayability. While in Isaac you start with basic tears and small stat differences, each character in RoR has its own unique weapons and weapon abilities to start with regardless of what items you grab. The items enhance your character in many interesting and unique ways. Graphical style is very simple and may seem offputting at first, but it works fine and the pixel art is perfectly good. Don't disregard the game based on this!The only issue I had early was the default controls, which seemed to be designed for left handed players, but fortunately they ARE able to be rebinded to our preferneces and I did jsut that so I felt more comfortable. This is the next great Indie roguelike that is highly addicting, and totally worth the buy. I highly recommend it to fans of Binding of Isaac!The game has Achievements and trading cards. The Achievements I feel are a bit underwhelming, however and don't give the same sense of completion as the ones for Isaac did. Hopefully they will address this with further updates to offer more ideas and challenges with them. Not that it needs them to be a good game, but it expands the challenge having new ideas and challengs to achieve.			"

-Quick Review-...aaaaaand today's forecast is; a chance of explosions, with a side dish of pain, a little bit of agony, a whole lot of fun, and a Risk of Rain.Risk of Rain is an platform indie game with many rogue-like elements. You unlock new characters and items, to help you through the game. The game is very fun and challenging, but if you want to make it to the end, you need to play smart and use your time wisely. -Detailed breakdown review- Story:  There's not much to say about the story in this game, the description text explains that ""You are the sole survivor of a space train wreck"", however that is not the case if you're playing multiplayer; then you can have *four* survivors, but I digress. Game Play: There is a lot to say about the game play. Firstly, the controls are pretty simple, you have several attacks (all of which are different based on the character you're playing), you move to the left, right, and jump.There are numerous unlockables throughout the game, new characters and items. There are actually unlockables that you can only get with certain characters, so that keeps you playing and trying out new things.The game advertises itself as ""full of rogue elements"" and to a degree it's quite right, but there are some consistent factors: the first level is always the same, time continues to tick... the longer you play = the harder the game gets. Achievements: There are 15 achievements for this game. I suspect the reason I haven't written the review for this great game yet, because I... shamefully... haven't been able to unlock the last 3 achievements I need. (at this time: 4/16/15)There are only a few easy achievements that you unlock just by playing it, most achievements you will need to do something very specific. Be it, find a new character to unlock, or use a specific item on another specific item/NPC. Price:  Risk of Rain goes for $9.99, I personally waited for a sale (much to the frustration of my real life friends who wanted to play it with me)... but in the end that's a fair price for this game, based on how much time I've spent playing it. Conclusion: I've mused to myself in the past thinking ""I wonder if these older indie games will age differently then console or ROM games"". It seems like many indie games age well because they have unique-addictive-artistic-theme's to them.I absolutely recommend this game, it isn't one of those ""Rack up to 100 hours"" games for most people, but it is a fun change of pace from the other types of games out there. One final note: this game shines when it comes to multiplayer, playing on your own gets old, playing with friends feels like you're playing a classic arcade game with friends.			"

												Risk Of Rain is called the sidescrolling version of The Binding Of Isaac and it kinda is. But Risk Of Rain gives you multiple characters (all except one need to be unlocked first, however) and many skills to use, and more variety in its levels. And it can become quite challenging real fast. Enemies randomly spawn in the levels and you can use your skillset to take them down, earning you experience and gold. Unlock chests and buy items on your way to keep yourself from dying, because you *will* die. It's just a matter of time really. The items you find are randomly generated and are always useful. They have no negative effects (if they do it just depends on the total number of enemies walking around and the sort of level you are in). So the goal is to find as many as you can. Each level ends with a boss fight (or fights) which you, obviously, have to defeat. Once defeated you have to take out the remaining enemies before you can teleport to the next area. But, once you teleport you 'bank' your money, so you start from scratch again (your items will remain with you, of course). In the beginning you will probably last just several minutes, but once you unlock better items and characters these sessions will increase up to 45-60 minutes I guess. I haven't mentioned it yet, but you probably were already aware of it, and that's the fact that if you die, you have to start completely over. I love it !So, if you're into roguelikes give Risk Of Rain a try. It's definitely worth the risk.[Rating: 82/100]			"

												Can be turned into a hardcore Super Mario Brothers with enough headstompers and jetpacks10/10 - Would Grind more Headstompers.Okay, now seriously. This game is an 2D platformer shoot-'em-up with loads of Roguelike elements, and to tell the truth, it's an addictive hardcore game, and after over 100 hours, I still find myself enjoying this game (boy, what an year)The hours of dying may get you mad sometimes (Damn you Jellyfish!), but that it is purpose. Once you get used to the difficulty, you will find yourself enjoying this game much more, and it doesn't get old. I think it is really worth your time. There is even a online coop mode, where you and your friend go all the way trying to beat the game (even with all the bugs), and with the artifacts, you can turn the game into your own challenge. It is really that good, just like The Binding of Isaac.The game consist of you trying multiple times to reach a teleporter and advance to the next level, collecting items (usually randomly generated, if not for the use of one of the artifacts), which will eventually help you on your quest through out the game. The game also keeps you into it with unlockable characters and items, as well as the randomly generated levels. If lucky enough, you could turn into an rampaging god of death, killing every single enemy that come into your face, which I got to admit, it never gets old. The satisfaction of being so powerful and sort of unkillable just makes it more fun, and with a certain artifact which turns enemies into elite mobs only, it can turn into a very fun and hardcore challenge. I deeply recommend the game, as it's controls are easy; the game itself is easy to play, but hard to beat; A very worth and thought soundtrack; a simplistic but yet enjoyable and nostalgic artwork; High replay value; A good game to play in your free time, or to spend a weekend trying to beat; This is Risk of Rain, and welcome to your possible doom.Just buy it. You will have a good time.			"

												Risk of Rain might appeal to gamers who thrill over the challenge set forth by games like Demon’s Souls or FTL: Faster Than Light, but the uninitiated will find Risk of Rain hard to approach.Risk of Rain is a survival shooter featuring interesting mechanisms, where you will have to make quick decisions.The game is a lot of fun. Though it is held back by its technical faults , it has the right stuff to elicit the ""just one more run"" response that roguelike games are known for. With a little more polish, it could be truly great.Incredible work went into the design of almost every element of Risk of Rain, shame that the gameplay couldn't have been more inspired. [In the interest of accommodating it all, the awful maximum resolution and the tiny sprites are just about excused.			"

												Punishing, but really enjoyable little rougelike with emphasis on fast paced action and easy to learn but difficult to master classes. Each class has it's own set of skills which will significantly change the way you play, but unfortunately only one (out of ten) is available from the start. As with most rougelikes; levels, items and enemies are procedurally generated and permadeath is enabled but game never feels unfair, since every playthrough offers something new. Due to it's difficulty and random nature it will require speed, precision and adaptability. Luckily there are a lot of items spread out around the level that will provide passive and active bonuses like increased rate of fire or various status effects, as well as more interesting ones which I'm not going to spoil since discovering new item and monster log entries will be your main source of accomplishment in early stages of the game. However as you unlock more drops and get familiar with each class, things will get easier. This is the point where time becomes your biggest enemy (well...besides all the other big enemies). Game implements a timer in the upper right corner that will gradually increase difficulty as time passes, forcing you to find a balance between becoming more powerful and just getting to the next level with all your bits intact. It provides a nice compromise, keeping a challenging gameplay, but still providing the feeling of controling an unstopabble killing machine. There are some problems on the technical side, like the occasional but gut-wrenching crash that will erase your progress and leave you sobbing, unresponsive controls in menus (especially if you're using gamepad) and problems with online co-op conectivity and Steam achievements. I would also be amiss not to mention brilliant sountrack and appealing pixel art.All in all, in a sea of rougelikes this one manages to stand on it's own, providing responsive shooting mechanics, hordes of different enemies and items and a great balance between frustrating and adrenaline-pumping gameplay. A great value  for money.			"

												Don't let the old-school ultra-simple graphics deceive you, the gameplay is very modern and so are the mechanics (even if you can only shoot left and right and not up, etc). The game takes place on different planets, you are simply trying to get home. You must fight your way through thousands of alien/monster creatures. But how? There are a multitude of power-ups that you pick up and stack along your journey. You do feel more powerful and powerful in time but that is the downfall, as soon as you become comfortable, you will make a grave mistake and the game will eat you alive.I haven't played co-op yet, playing single player is lonely until you get a companion drone which helps heal you or shoots enemies with you. The game is hard to put down, it's simple and easy enough to understand but hardcore at the same time. At first I hated how small and far away everything is but I have grown to love everything about the game. Strange, creepy soundtrack fits the sci-fi unknown space theme.Clever. Very clever little indie game.			"

												Risk of Rain is a fun action platformer with roguelike elemented Game.There are several optainable Items in this Game. If you see a item and if you have enough Money, buy it. You can have hundreds of items at the same time and get op. But only in your selected Difficulty. If you change the difficulty it gets hard. Really hard.It gets worse, when you dont have ""Drop Luck / ITem Luck"" and just get Trash.Its more fun when you play the Game in Multiplayer / Co-op. Game is pretty tough and huge. Bosses can be a challenge. :)You can even can unlock new Characters to play (Sniper for example)Its funny!*RECOMMENDED*			"

												One of the best Indie Games i ever played.Its a rogue-like game with a simple and short Story.You have a Cargo Ship which get shot,crashing on a mysterious Planet with one Survivor,you.At the beginning i didnt understand what to do,i was running and running,killing monsters till i got it.You start with one Character and find various Items with different effects.Theres alot of Items and Characters you have to unlock by doing tasks (killing enemies,collecting specific things or by simply finding them).The Levels are changing thanks to the rogue-like elements and so is the Experience.The longer you play a map,the more items you collect and the longer is the Run.Sometimes a run can go up to 2 hours or longer,it depends on you.You can set the difficulty by adding Relics which affects you,the maps and the enemy.I can recommend this game for any casual player or bored one.I bought this Game due a Sale,i dont regret it.

												8.5/10Pros:- Amazing gameplay- Unique playstyle for each character- Every item is unique in abilitys, effects, effects, and can change the outcome of a run- Every time you play this game, it's different.  This can vary by what character you select to what items you are lucky to get in the beginning- IT HAS MULTIPLAYER.  SHOOT THINGS WITH FRIENDS.  ♥♥♥♥ YES.Cons:- While this game has great replay ability, using the same characters causes for it to become boring.  Most characters are quite diffucult to ""get use to"" and are boring to play with at first.- You get bored of the bosses after awhile.  There are not many of them.- Most people are forced to look up guides to unlock characters.  I wish they had it to where the game could drop hints and give clues to how to unlock characters.  Overall, this decreases the enjoyment and reduces reasons to explore the stage.			"

												I like this game, a lot. I know it’s not as polished as it could be. I know sometimes it glitches and you fall through the world. I know that having pixel for pixel really messes with camera placement and allows you to see past where the level was really meant to be viewed. I know it’s not perfectly balanced, and has ‘easy win’ strategies. However, I like this game. It’s challenging, it’s fun, it’s addicting. Playing as the different characters increases longevity, challenge artifacts increase longevity, and achievements increase longevity. The soundtrack has a very nice sound to it, it just exudes a kind of charm that I enjoy. Coming back to play a game or two every now and again is fun, I do recommend it if it looks like you'd enjoy it.			"

												First you die fighting ocean bugs.Then flying robot bugs.But after 50 hours, your greatest enemies are the bugs in the code.- Bugs/10 -On a more serious note, this game is one of my favorite rogue-lites. A very fun and challenging game, though you *might* have to deal with some annoying bugs, including:1) the occasional crash2) getting stuck in the ground until you mash enough buttons to escape . . .These glitches don't seem to happen to everyone, but be mentally prepared just incase.I think this game is worth $10 but it's often on sale for $2.50, so I highly recommend it if you're into the genre.

												Highly addicting platfomer roguelike game ! The attention to smalest pixel details put into this game is awesome. You see from the animation of it especially the characters.*Character OptionsThere are different options of character that you can play and unlock along with your progress in game. Different character has different style of owning the game.*LootingLoot is the main element in this game, as you progress you can unlock even more loot. More and more until you become a demi-god , or not at all and you will die is shame.You die once and you start over from zero, while actualy you only need to finish 6 level ,which you will only be able to get through by dying over and over again until you can beat the game. And you can never have enough of it. Trust me.*AtmosphereThe music is good . It suits well with the game experience and overall character. The atmosphere of foreign planet and the mood of playing space-alien like game.*DificultiesAnother main aspect of this game is also that the dificulties will increase along with the time you play the game from the begining. So if you are not fast enough to gain level or loot, and the dificulties increase , be ready to have a really hard time.*Co-opThe good thing from Co-op is that you can owned the game with your friends. As much friend as you can , but the cons is that you have to share the amount of loot you get and that means you have to share your strength that you usually get when you play SOLO (where you can greedily have your own loot). But anyway playing this game with friends is really addicting.I am really hoping to see another sequel of this game if it were to be made . And i believe everybody will feel the same too.			"

												As one of my favorite games, Risk of Rain is highly recommended.Most modern gamers will be confused by the graphic, but honestly if this game is built 2.5D in Cry Engine your game will crash so bad, my point: the gameplay is the most important part you should be looking at. Risk of Rain can be very addicted, everytime you start from the beginning with default data and you work your way to become a badass and with the new (kind of new) artifacts system, this game generate so much varieties that I can not count. Basically you chose one of the unique characters blaze through every stage and stock items, level up and build up your character and the objective is to beat the final stage. One of the main features is the game's difficulty, it grows as the time pass. A decent gameplay management is required as the game can be tough to beat for a new player. RoR will keep surprising you with new contents (characters, items) that you will unlock, varieties tend to increase as you explore more. Which keep a well loop and create a high 'replayability'. RoR also contains several small secrets waiting for you to discover.I have seen people complaining about the multiplayer experience, which was tough to me as well. Since the developers of RoR are independent developers, a server can be luxury indeed. Simply learn how to port forwarding will be enough to host. No hamachi required, I can prove it myself but who ever is hosting need a decent internet efficiency. Despite lack of official server (some people actually host servers look it up), RoR is a pick up and play, rogue like action game, with very intriguing item and character design, and it is constantly updating. I can't illustrate how frustrated I feel when the game beat me and some ironic words pop out mocking my failure, or how awesome and satisfied it can be, when I beat the game with tons of items I collected. In other word RoR provide really nice difficulty options where things can get nasty require you to pay some attentions in order to beat it, or you can just sit back, relax, enjoy the show.If you are available to play co-op, co-op is not too different from single player, which just add some additional chaos on your screen. The soundtrack in RoR is another feature to enjoy, musics in the background certainly polish the game into a another level it is simply astonishing and perfect. You can find all the little details proving that there are people (devs) who care about their games, and it is tons of fun when you are relaxing and reading some introductions of the item you've been using in the game, as well as the monster logs. Sometimes the game can crash if data overloaded (because it's the nature of the game), or some minority bugs happen to get in your way but overall RoR is a must-have game, and trust me you need to go deeper to witness the sorrow of the rain.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 2016/11/24It has been years when this game released. I really hope for a series or a huge update, from the bottom of my heart I wish these devs don't cool down this game. At last I hope RoR can get a reward.			"

												After getting 100% achievement completion, I still feel like I suck at this game.This game is hard for all the right reasons; you may feel limited at first (given how everything in this game is in-game achievement locked), but the game starts you out with the easiest-to-use character and a basic set of simple items that help ease you into how things work. The game says that it won't save your scores on the easy difficulty, but what it doesn't tell you is that you can still unlock things on the easier difficulty. Use this to your advantage and play on easy until you think you've gotten a feel for how the game handles (as well as unlocking a few things in the process), then put the game back on its regular difficulty setting and proceed to get obliterated in a brutal fashion. For extremely skilled players (or masochists), there's even a hard difficulty setting, as well as collectible 'artifacts' that can be toggled to make the game even harder (or easier in a few cases). This game is completely playable without a guide. However, should one feel inclined to seek advice (which is very likely), there are many helpful guides written by other players that go in detail about combat strategies, how to unlock things, and even just general advice for beginners and veteran players alike.In conclusion, Risk of Rain is a 2D platformer where you're constantly fighting for your life while scavenging the land for items that passively improve your combat abilities in every way, ultimately reaching the end where the final boss is the only thing standing in your way between you and freedom. Good luck.			"

												Risk of Rain, a great rogue-like filled with action packed fun that gets harder as time progresses. Each level has different kinds of mob spawns depending on the region/map type. Difficult , but not impossible, to beat solo. Great co-op play. The artifact system brings you back and alters each playthough heavily.Pros:-Runs on potatoes (lower fps on co-op due to explosions/extra rendering)-Great soundtrack-Great controlls-Large character selection and unlocking new characters-Replayability is good, but semi repetative if you're bad at unlocking characters.Cons:-More expensive than your mom-Difficult to stay alive as certain classes (Git Gud)-Co-Op doesn't have servers to connect to, making finding a co-op partner slightly harder.Graphics/Artwork: 9/10Sound/Audio: 9.5/10Controlls/Mechanics: 8/10Replayability: 7.5/10Overall: 9/10 gud game.

												Like the stages of meth:1) the rush- you buy it on impulse and play2) the high- the satisfaction that comes when you finally don't die in the first 20 minutes3) the binge- the massive amount of runs that you've played over the course of 200 hours to get that satisfaction again4) tweaking- once you reach the skill cap, game becomes easy and you play it out of habit5) the crash- you realize that all your time is being eaten by a stupid indie game and that it's preventing you from playing other major releases, like a controlling spouse blocking out your friends6) the hangover- you feel empty without it and thirst for it7) withdrawl- the two weeks before you relapse, when you've tricked yourself into believeing that you overcame your addiction and value your dignity more than the game8) relapse- go back to step 2			"

												Risk of rain is a simplistic yet intruiging indie game with a lot to it. It's minimalist approach to a rogue-like is unique. Risk of Rain's seemingly simple exterior leaves you with a burning passion to explore every thing this piece has to offer. It's cruel, that's for sure, but this game is extremely fun, especially when you pace yourself and ensure that you're taking your time to get everything right. There's a number of playable characters, each offering their own way of playing this gem. Some of the unlocks, however, aren't the clearest on how it is to be done, leaving you with the shame of having to resort to the internet to find out what's next. Overall, Risk of Rain is an austere piece of somewhat savage software that'll lure you in with it's gorgeous art style and strike you with it's moderately high difficulty curve. For any fans of the rogue-like genre, this is a definate pick-up.			"

												I highly recommend Risk of Rain - very fun roguelike featuring several classes with four abilities each, difficult scaling up based on time played per run ( do I collect loot and make next level harder or rush to keep the last level easier ) , up to four player co op, wonderful art style, and killer sound track. My only note of warning is that it takes a little getting used to on the keyboard vs a game pad.  To expand a bit on the class options, here are three examples:Commando: First class everyone has access to, others are unlocked as you play and progress, find them in levels, or unlock achievements. Basic attack is a ""double tap"" shot with his pistol and other abilities are: piercing knock back burst of bullets, a roll that lets you escape / pass through enemies quicikly, and his ""ultimate "" ( longer cd then rest ) ability is a rapid fire of abilites that stun nearby enemies.Enforcer: Very stocky character. His basic attack is a short range shot gun blast then he also has a shield slam that knocks enemies back, a defensive stance that blocks all damage from a certain direction, and his ultimate type ability is a stun grenade.Bandit: Basic attack is a normal rifle blast. Has a dynamite toss ability that does aoe damage, a smoke bomb that stealths him and stuns when he comes out of stealth, and his ultimate is a big headshot that does oodles of damage and resets his other abilities if it kills an enemy.It's a really fun system to me rather than Rogue Legacy where your abilities are like magic and auto attack. Some of the other classes include a sniper, engineer fellow with turrets and missiles, an acid beast, and more!			"

												I honestly can't say much about this game. It seems to be more of a niche game because if you like it you love it and if you don't you hate it. The game requires you to either be good right off the bat, which I doubt everyone will be able to be, or it requires you to run through the game several times before you can actually play it. The game uses an unlocking system similar to the binding of issac, except there are not as many items in risk of rain which leads to a problem of item balance. Because of the 30-60 Items, I don't honestly remember, the ones near the end add a lot of power to your run, however the ones near the beginning are rather basic, and don't get you very far. you also do not unlock the characters ight away which leaves you to only play as the Mercenary to try and unlock anyting. which in my opinion is the worst to play because you can't move and shoot like some other classes.The game has a frustrating starting system but endgame its very enjoyable to play.Personally if I was back at the start I would download a 100% game file and play it, although you won't unlock anything it would be like playing an arcade game for a higher score, with the sort-of-random worlds it won't get old fast.Music is great (if you can get it to work common bug where the music will not play at first, when fixed it's fixed forever though.)Difficulty scale is great.Etc etc. /RantStory: X/10 (Is there one, I haven't noticed.)Gameplay: 10/10 Presentation: 10/10 Soundtrack: 9/10 (good not great)Replayability: 6/10 (it might happen. one day. offline.)

												I went into this game knowing absolutely nothing about it other than the name, the cover art, and that it was an RPG rougelike. I've now invested over twenty hours into it and after I finish this review I'm probably going to go play more. Risk of Rain is addictive. That's the word I've found myself describing it most as. It hits the perfect sweetspot of challenge, luck, and skill. There's a visceral sense of empowerment- every time you collect a new upgrade, you actively feel stronger. All the visual effects that pop up coupled with seeing your inventory stack along the bottom creates this really unique sense of progression, as eventually- with a bit of luck- you can reach a point where absolutely everything you touch is obliterated in a miasma of fire, metal, and spirituality. The upgrades are all nice and varied, every single one having a unique effect such as adding a new type of damage or a chance to fire an additional projectile or a new way to heal yourself. It's not like other rougelikes such as Binding of Isaac where there are a lot of items that drastically change how you play- all of them just add effects and bonuses, making you into a walking powerhouse that just gets bigger and badder as time goes on. A typical run will be about an hour if you're going for straight completion to several if you're like me and go back to replay the earlier levels and stack as much gear as possible. The game gets crazier and crazier as you level up, and if you make it that far I recommend trying it at least once. I also recommend playing with a controller- the keyboard controls work for the early levels, but once things pick up it's too cumbersome to recommend. The levels do get a bit bland, as the layouts are reused and the environments are pretty but don't make much difference. The soundtrack is solid and atmospheric, and the art direction is absolutely top-notch. The writing is worth note, too- the descriptions of the items and monster logs have a personality I wasn't expecting. I got excited every time I found something new because I couldn't wait to read up on its history. And any game where I can feel a serious, grave attatchment to a protagonist who just weaponized a ukulele can be called a literary success. If you like RPGs, buy Risk of Rain. It's dirt cheap, and has that special feeling of leveling up in spades. All the characters are wildly different and change up the core strategy in really unique ways, and there's tons to discover and unlock. It's some of the most fun I've had with any video game lately and I'm absolutely smitten.			"

												Ever feel like you have time to kill? Got something downloading in the background that's taking longer than it should and you are in need of entertainment? Watched all your favourite channels new vids on youtube? Tired of seeing bottle flip compilations and need something else in your life? Well, my friends, I think you've found a good investment right here.Risk of Rain, a rogue like, combat based platformer which pits your character on a planet as they scrape together junk in attempts to fight for their life. Now, sounds strange from my generalisation, but theres more to it.You don't get to determine what gear is thrown at you, the game picks for you, and you have to deal with it. (without in game modifiers, that is.) Each playthrough on vanilla settings is completely different, as the items you recieve can change how you approach the game. The items provided lean toward either offensive or defensive gameplay, by either granting you increased damage, lifesteal or gold income, or providing damage reduction, ""overshield"" or an aura of barbed wire, because why not. Utility items are also included, which are things like increased movement speed, auto gold generation, and increased amounts of jumps. There are plenty more different stat augments that I will let you discover for yourself.A thing I mentioned earlier, modifiers. These can be found in each of the levels Risk of Rain provides, usually requiring a puzzle to be solved, or a jump course, or maybe even just extreme cheese strats. If vanilla is getting rough, or maybe too predictable, turn some of these on, and you can find yourself mowing down everything in your path while only being allowed to take one hit maximum, or make it so the game hates you entirely. Another thing which I think is particularly interesting, is the difficulty mechanic. Risk of Rain has no set difficulty, but instead, a system based on how long you take in game. The difficulty increases the longer it takes you to find your way around, and the rate at which this increases can be adjusted in the form of three difficulties on the character select screen. No matter which setting you pick, the game will grow more challenging as you take longer to get through.TL;DR A great game to kill time with, and even something to spend a decent amount of time on as you mess around with different playthroughs as you pit your luck against the random drop system. The different characters and game modifiers allow you to see what kind of crazy things you can achieve, ranging from running around at the speed of sound, jumping up to asgard itself, or decimating anything that takes a millisecond to look at you. Extremely worth the money while it's on sale, and even when it isn't, I'd say you can find enjoyment out of it. The soundtrack is also nice. Give it a go, won't you?EDIT: forgot to add that if you want to play multiplayer, you will need LogMeIn Hamachi or a similar program. LogMeIn Hamachi is a free download, but it is true that there is better software out there, so you might want to explore a bit.			"

												This used to be one of my favorite multiplayer games. I've purchased multiple copies for friends, who have in turn purchased copies for other friends. Unfortunately the current version (1.2.4) is near unplayable due to the presence of a zillion bugs that were introduced when the developers updated the engine. The devs have been all but silent since 1.2. The last post on the development blog was over a month and a half ago.Current bugs include (but are certainly not limited to):*If you are playing online mutiplayer and get to the last level, all clients will crash.*All abilities are supposed to do random amounts of damage, and little random ""damage numbers"" pop up over enemies' heads, but as you can see by watching boss's health bars when you attack them, the numbers are lies and you are actually doing the exact same amount of damage with every shot.*Sometimes you will get stuck one pixel below the platform that you are supposed to be standing on, and you'll never be able to move again.If you want to read more horror stories, simply check out the Risk of Rain forums at http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?forums/general-discussion.88/ , where pretty much all the discussion right now is centered on ""Why is this game still being sold while it's so broken?"" and ""Where the hell are the devs?""I'd love to support this game again. It was a lot of fun. But right now it's sort of scammish that it's even being sold.			"

Risk of Rain could have been just another action rogue-like. What truly sets it apart is the inclusion of a time-based difficulty meter, which turns it into a rather intense survival game.The goal of every level is as follows: look for a giant shiny red teleporter, then trigger it and survive waves of enemy spawns for a set amount of time (90 seconds on Normal mode). After the timer runs out, kill any remaining opponents and you can finally teleport to the next level. When you've completed five levels, you're given the option to teleport to the final stage or to revisit the previous ones.This simple concept forces you to constanly find the right balance between rushing and exploring: you want to make the most of every level in terms of upgrades, but hang around for too long and the ever-increasing difficulty meter will make you pay. A typical playthrough can last an hour or more; and if you happen to die, no extra lives or continues: you're starting over.The rogue-like elements are on point, with dozens of interesting items to discover and unlock as well as twelve character classes with very specific gameplay twists. Once unlocked, you can also choose to enable up to ten artifacts which alter the gameplay in a significant way. While not fully randomized, each stage has several different possible layouts which ensures every playthrough feels somewhat different.A huge selling point for me was the option to play the game in local/online coop. Couch coop is great fun and quite playable, only requiring the players to stay relatively close to each other. Online coop gives the players more freedom and, for the most part, works very well; however, certain items (Chargefield) and possibly characters have a tendency to cause game-ending crashes.This brings me to the flaws of Risk of Rain: a somewhat less polished technical side seems to be causing consistent problems for some users. Aside from very minor issues, it has been totally fine on my end (and the same goes for my friends), but I would definitely recommend testing the game as soon as you purchase it, and being ready to request a refund if you can't get it to work. A couple other nitpicks: the interface is rather bland and the platforming - not a huge part of the game, thankfully - can be infuriating. On a more positive note again, the pixel art is quite decent, and the lore that unfolds through the monster and item logs paints a convincing universe. Last but not least, the soundtrack is amazing - whether you end up playing the game or not, you'll definitely want to check it out if you enjoy nice things.tl;dr: a great blend of (hardcore) rogue-like and survival to enjoy on your own or with selected friends. Excellent replay value for the price.			"

												Action Platformer + Rogueliike elements = Risk of Rain, ""Time consuming yet rewarding, keyboard/gamepad smashing fun!""Pros:-To start off the classes are all different which makes them unique, picture this ten different classes that each provide a different way to take on your journey through your fight on a mysterious planet. -Now throw in a bunch of items (100+) which mix up/throw off your game? Sounds interesting, doesn't it? Depending on which items you get you could have a easy time playing or a difficult time playing.-A whole new game every time you click that start game button on the menu screen.Cons:-Some of the achievements for both the characters and for steam require some bit of coop (makes it difficult for those who don't have a internet connection)-Coop is a bit weird (requires an outside program to host servers for example: evolve, hamachi)All in all, Risk of Rain is a very time consuming game that rewards the player for their handwork and struggle through the mysterious planet. I must say that for the price it's listed at currently $9.99, it is totally worth it and I would recommend that if you have $10 lying around to pick it up and give it a try!			"

												Risk of Rain is a wonderful game about destruction, and annihilating everything in the player's path.Your goal is to simply kill and grind your way to each level's teleporter which will spawn a challenging boss, so you can go onto the next level, rinse and repeat.It's a slow start, but once you reach the third level (which proves to be quite difficult for some, including myself) you become a demi-god. Watch as each bullet releases 15 homing missiles, which set your oponent on fire. As your enemies die they might become a ghost, only to fight by your side, releasing magical orbs that disintegrate the next.Personally it reminded me of the oldschool Ratchet and Clank games, arriving on the planet, Kill everything with big guns. Good times.I giv dis gaem 7/10. A good passtime, and repititive if anything.			"

												Disclaimer: Not everything in this Review is said on a serious note. Some things are jokes and I hope these are obvious enough.Risk of Rain fails for me as a actual Rougelike. Not that it cannot be classified as one, but the feeling overall just does not fit. If you are here and expect a game that is fast and deadly, dont buy this game. This game relies purely on you, how you react ingame and how fast you can spam the jump button. Risk of Rain, is a platformer based on the roguelike concept. Your main task is to find a teleporter to reach the next world. And this task continues in said world, until you reach the end. In these worlds themself you will have to fight aliens that teleport in, sent in by the villain (or at the very least that is my theory as to how they get there).  These aliens then drop experience and currency. Currency which you can use on the various crates and shrines. Even random cryostasis chambers are there to provide you with items, should you have the currency for it. And if you should find a broken drone, it can be repaired with your currency just as well.But of course that is not all to the game. The crates, shrines and stasischambers contain items that, similar to ""The Binding of Isaac"" give you passiv and active abilities. Some allow you to gain health while damaging your enemies. Others  will make your overall health grow as you kill. Then again another ability grants you a double jump. And here comes the best about this: The abilities can stack when you find the same item you carry with you. A double jump transforms into a triple jump. You gain more health when you damage enemies. You get more max health when you kill. But of course, these are just the buffs. There are items you can use activly in combat. One of my personal favorites is the saw-blade. It does a massive amount of damage and can kill entire lines of enemies in one shot, in the earlier stages of the game.But now the game gets hard. Actually, it is hard from the get go. You look at the little bar on the top right and you see your impending doom slowly but surely rising to the top. Why? Because this game does it differently to others. Of course, you can choose between easy, medium and hard. But these only depict as to how hard the enemies are to kill and how many of them will spawn (and how fast they spawn). And this only gets worse the longer you play. As the longer you play, the difficulty rises. It begins with a stroll in the park and ends up in hell. And there is no way to avoid it, unless you do a speedrun of the game. Which is also not that easy as the teleporter is randomly generated on the pre-set worlds. Knowing how the world looks may help, but not knowing where the teleporter is, does not. And in the end it is a literally a maze where one turn can let you end up in a place that throws you out and you need to continue to search for the right path all over again.And as if it wasnt enough already that the game gets harder by the minute, that the landscape is kind of like a maze and that the teleporter spawns randomly, there are bosses as well. And they are not easy to kill. They can move and attack, just like the regular enemies can. Some are easy to cheesy (or in other words; Some cant get up a ledge and can be killed from above without being able to attack you.) and others will simply fly towards you to get the kill. Others have an AOE to make sure that you are not safe on that elevated platform of yours and others again will be able to teleport towards you to kill you right quick.But if you have done it all, gotten through all the teleporters, you will end up in the main ship. The one you were dropped off of in a capsule. And here is the main villain as well. But how do you reach him? Do the same thing you did before, but this time a bit different. Instead of finding the teleporter, you need to find the keypads infront of the doors. This will then again spawn in a bunch of enemies and at this point in time, surely a few bosses as well. And if you made it through all of it: The grand finale awaits.- Authors Note -Why did I say that this game fails as a Roguelike for me even if it can be classified as one?I experienced Roguelike games, and love them dearly. But one aspect was very important every time. And that little aspect is: You are never safe. But of course this is way to broad so let me explain:In the very flagships of Roguelike, which are ""The Binding of Isaac"": ""Enter the Gungeon"" and ""Nuclear Throne"", you could die as quick as you began to play the game, if you were not carefull enough. Die and lose it all, at any given point in time. The gameplay was quick, had you on your toes at all times possible and killed you as fast as it could. One of the most important things was that it didnt, unless you had found an ability or a health pack, give you any health back. A little detail that makes the games much harder and challenging.But in Risk of Rain this does not stand true. The very first thing that makes a roguelike, a rougelike is that you are never safe unless you cleared out the room or floor. In Risk of Rain however you can activate the teleporter, let the enemies spawn until its done and if you feel overwhelmed you can rope up and take a break and wait until your health returns to charge right back into battle.And that is what bores me about this game. I played all three of the mentioned Roguelikes and I have been frustrated. The more I played them, the more I raged. The more I failed, the more I wanted to wish hell and death on the devs for creating this piece of garbage. But after I calmed down I loved every second of what I experienced it. I guess I am a gaming masochist but still. And that is something, this game does not provide.This game is a stroll in the park no matter how high your difficulty is. You can get out of every situation with literally every character. The first one is actually the easiest. A dodgeroll helps you get out of the situation with immunity frames, you go up the rope and Boom: You are safe. But in a true Roguelike, you are never safe. You are never free from simply dodging damage unless it has to do with you actually dodging the damage. Which is absolutely possible in a 2D topdown roguelike. But not in 2D platformer roguelike. Only if you actually spam jump or dodgeroll, you can get out with no damage at all.So, do I think that Risk of Rain is a good game?- YesDo I think that Risk of Rain is a good Roguelike?- NoShould you buy it?- Yes			"

												Let me just start by saying that this game is AWESOMEAt it's heart, the game is an action platformer with a very old school feel.   There a few new school elements, the most obvious one being the item system.  If you have played Binding of Issac, this will be immediately familiar to you.  You acquire items that passively make your character more powerful throughout the game by using currency and defeating bosses.  This system is incredibly well done:  Almost all the items make an impact, yet there is nothing that feels overtly broken.  Even items that do not have an immediate, obvious application are revealed to be very powerful when paired with certain other item combinations or characters.The genius of the game really reveals itself as you unlock new characters.  There a few that feel like they are there as a novelty, but outside of those one or two, they are very well made with distinctly different feel and strategies.  The characters function similarly to ARTS characters with different base stats and 4 distinct moves all mapped to a different button.  Once again, it was shocking to me how much the game changed when using different characters.  It seems strange to say, but I was not expecting that level of depth. A lot of people will play the game for the carrot-on-a-stick nature of the unlocks, and the siren call of actually trying to beat the game.  Even after these tasks are accomplished, however, the game never really loses its appeal.  Having an amazing run and going through the entire game (which usually takes an hour or so) is just as satisfying the 10th time as it was the first.  When you start off, the notion of getting to the 3rd level can seem daunting, let alone beating the game.  The games learning curve can be somewhat steep, but when you come over the rise of competancy, you will really appreciate how robust the pacing, item system, characters and scaling difficulty of the game is.   Was an absolute joy ride from start to finish. 8.3/10			"

												This one got under my skin, especially once I discovered a character that resonated with my play style.It's a hard game, and you'll spend a lot of time failing. Sometimes due to lack of skill or coordination, and sometimes due to randomness working against you.But when it works, and especially when you find a character that you enjoy playing, man...it'll take you far.

You get money from killing mobs and with that money you can buy random generated items or open chests for items to get stronger with unique abillities. The game gets harder the longer you're playing it so don't slack off and get going!			"

												Risk of Rain is a frantic, fast-pased platforming/action game with a relatively short story and a HUGE degree of random variance. Playing as one of several characters (all ""crew members"" of a crashed delivery spaceship), you fight your way through mobs of enemies, relying on both skill and powerups scattered throughout stages to survive. These powerups are insanely random, each granting you an often-ridiculous bonus. Some are crazier than others, and many are so powerful or stupid that I can't even begin to describe them here. What's important, in my opinion, is that they're all fun to pick up. ...and you'd better be picking them up frantically, because the game's difficulty scales with time. The longer you take on a stage, the longer you dawdle trying to find treasure chests or shops with powerful items in them, the more powerful enemies will be on this stage and the next. The longer you spend fighting, in other words, the tougher the fighting becomes.A successful game of Risk of Rain usually lasts anywhere from about 40 to 60 minutes. The powerups on any given level vary wildly between playthroughs. The levels themselves can have multiple layouts and multiple styles. All of the characters--even the immediately-unlocked ""Commando""--collectively provide a large number of different ways to make it to the next teleporter or die trying. In the end, the game is a crazy race against time to acquire powerups, kill enemies, and ultimately (hopefully) fight the final boss with a nonsensical menagerie of gear. This is without a doubt one of the most addicting games I've ever played. I highly recommend it.			"

												To call this game ""2D Binding of Isaac"" is to only scratch the surface, to get a vague grasp of what this game has to offer. Yes, it is somewhat like The Binding of Isaac in that there's things trying to kill you and items that make them less able to kill you, but  in my opinion, that's where the similarity ends. There's no unfairness or fake difficulty; much like Dark Souls, every death is your fault. You didn't move fast enough, you didn't time your dash skill, you didn't w/e. Every death in this game is a learning experience as you struggle for life on the hellhole planet you're stranded on. There's always something new in each playthrough, new nuances to learn, item combinations you happen upon, set in a constantly frantic, desperate struggle of you vs. the hordes.By far one of the funnest games I've ever played.

												:DISCLOSURE:  I received a copy for the purpose of review. That in NO way affects the outcome of this review. If a game is crap IMO I will say so. Thank you Steamified.Risk of Rain is an intense rogue like. The game play is fantastic classic 8/16 bit platformer action. You have four abilities to aid you in the journey of survival. Twelve different characters you can play. Three game modes that scale well, the easiest of which does not allow the saving of progress. Combine all this with TONS of items that offer passive and on use advantages. The item combos can get crazy, like in The Binding of Issac. AND if you get more than one of an item it will stack. This game is great if you have only 15min to play or 5 hours to play. Easy to pick up and get the hang of, but difficult to master no doubt. If you are new to rogue like games this is a great intro to the genre. Overall I would rate this game 8/10. It is a must play for any rogue like fan.			"

												Risk of Rain is a 2d platform rogue-like shooter with an increasing difficulty level that goes up according to time spent while playing: the longer your session - the harder it gets.Prepare to die. A lot.The game is not as easy as one might expect.Right off the bat you are put in a situation where a space cargo ship, UES Contact Light, in which you happen to be in, crashes on a hostile planet.You have 12 characters, all of which require you to do specific objectives ingame (beat the game on the hardest difficulty level, kill 3 specific bosses, obtain specific item combination.)Each character packs a four pack of abilities (So you will find the one that suits you)At the begining you have your first, already unlocked character - The Commando (My favourite of the whole shebang).A very versatile character that can handle most situations flawlessly.While playing, you collect items, scattered through chests that fell off the ship and shrines, that can require either your health or your money.Every item is a unique game changer. One can place fungus that heals you if you stand still for a few seconds, one amplifies your shots with bonus explosive damage, one can stop time when your health goes to a critical level and one item even gives you a second chance in case you die.The more items you get, the more powerful you become, and if you stack up items ( get more and more of the same one) the effect and amplification level increases (although some items have a limit on how many times the effect will improve).At the end of the game, each character has a different outcome. (They are really spine-chillin if you think of em afterwards) Here's the one of the Commando:""...and so he left, with everything but his humanity.""The game also has multiplayer (online and locally).It can be a pain in the a$$ to get it working (it requires hamachi or tungle to work) but once you do, it is a whole lot more fun to beat the game with friends and die together :)P.SThere are artifacts, hidden throughout some levels, that change the game completely.One can give you the ability to choose a specific item of your choice instead of getting a random one, one will spawn a specific boss every 10 minutes and one will spawn only one random enemy type per stage. Great for making the game more customizable and can help you unlock characters. (But don't overuse them or the game loses the fun behind it) Overall Scores: Gameplay- 10/10Story - 8/10 (requires you to collect monster logs and even then it is mosly lore since characters do not speak here)Replayability - 10/10Multiplayer (once set) - 9/10  Final Verdict:  9/10


TLDR:
2d rogue like dark souls in space.

Risk of Rain is a strategical Indie arcade-style shooter in which the player endures a constantly increasing difficulty of enemy forces while gaining experience to level-up, purchasing items and upgrades, and searching for a teleporter device that forces the player to survive a boss fight. The game shares an intriguing element with other titles in that the further you go and the more time it takes to get there, the more progressively powerful the endless waves of enemies become.Here are several reasons to give Risk of Rain a run while running for your life in-game:Leveling System - What was originally a foreign element to me now retains some clarity. I will be honest, I did not notice the fact that characters had a level when I began my first trek into the Risk of Rain world, especially since I was so overly focused on surviving the merciless onslaught of consistently spawning hostiles. It was only after my first few playthroughs that I truly noticed the leveling system’s effect on the game’s entirety, as it acts simply as an in-game marker on how well that run’s character was sustaining, and even acted as a gauge for comparison to the play time to see how the player was progressing during that particular playthrough. This is not to say, however, that the leveling system is a useless ploy. When a character levels up, they receive bonuses to health and damage, which is definitely useful throughout the game. What I mean to say is that the leveling system is unique in that it is not something the player has to focus on, though it can sometimes signify that the player has to either spend more time in defeating enemy forces or has time to find the teleporter due to the amount of work they put in.Character Selection - Each of the twelve characters in Risk of Rain has a completely unique playstyle to master. For instance, the Commando is a more tactful starting ally who is equipped with a pistol the deals medium damage and has a long range to which requires no cool-down for its use, a canon-like projectile weapon whose shots connect with multiple enemies within its line of fire, a basic combat roll which negates all damage within its arch, and a submachine gun burst that momentarily fires on both sides of the Commando player within a straight line. The Enforcer, however, is a close-range gunman equipped with a slow-firing short-range shotgun that has a slight knockback effect against enemies, a shield bash that is close-ranged and stuns all hostiles upon impact, a stance change in the form of a one-way shield block which increases fire rate for the given direction and redirects virtually all incoming enemy damage from the Enforcer’s front-however, the Enforcer cannot turn around whilst this mode is toggled-, and an explosive projectile launcher with a longer cool-down rate that has a decent knockback effect combined with explosive damage. There are eleven playable characters to unlock-with the Commando present from the game’s start-, but each requires a considerable amount of time to acquire, and even more time to master.Time-Based Increasing of Difficulty - As previously described, Risk of Rain utilizes a time-based difficulty system as well as the “Easy, Medium, and Hard” modes you would find within other titles. What sets this approach apart from the usual is that it completely and consistently influences the way you play. It is suggested that the player act quickly by locating the teleporter device upon spawning, but this requires said player to evade enemy forces persistently, subsequently causing them to be weaker when the end-stage boss fight does occur; on the other hand, because the enemies become increasingly difficult over time, grinding and exploration is somewhat limited to a shorter duration. This chaotic paradox raises a call to action within the player, in which the fast-paced gameplay is heightened to the condition that critical decisions must be made promptly. This system heavily drives gameplay, and this has been a favorite approach to gaming for me as well as a worthy mental and emotional adversary.Collectible Drops and In-Game Achievements - After countless deaths, the player should feel as though some sort of progression has been made, and the collectables found through each world achieves this satisfaction. A percentage of this progression comprises not only of how far one proceeds through each run but also of which upgrades the participating player unlocks during the playthrough. These, as well as collectible ‘Monster Logs,’ can be viewed in a catalogue from the main menu of the game. The in-game achievements create a sense of progression as well, and even allows the player to unlock additional items such as upgrades and additional characters by completing certain goals.TL:DR - Risk of Rain is one of those games that can be a chaotic mess and still retain its charm, which for some games is inaccessible. It is one of those games that you play as if it were embedded within an arcade cabinet and you have infinite quarters, without fear of failing. It is one of those games you just play: do not degrade yourself for not defeating an end-of-world boss because of a single mistake, do not worry about being a completionist while driving yourself mad just because an item did not drop when you needed it to. Risk of Rain is one of those games that deserves its claim as an Indie Gem, and that one should just play to play. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews?

												I have played this game a lot and I have to say its amazing if this game is on sale buy it if it isn't on sale buy it.This game is fairly easy once you learn the controls and how to prioritize your time because when playing on harder difficulties time management becomes important because as you spend more time in game the difficulty increases and if you spend too much time grabbing items you will eventually die. But once you get to a certain point you can literally stand go pop some popcorn grab a coke (or some Mtn Dew if U MLG) and watch as your enemies fall before you and you start raking in the dough. One thing that I do not like about this game though is the local co-op. While it is fun to play the screen doesn't split so when you try to go away from your partner you can't see yourself. So I would like to see a dynamic split screen  where when go farther away from your partner  the screen splits in half between you and when you get close enough you share the same screen (kinda like the new lego games). This small adittion and being able to see your items while playing co-op would make the game much more fun to playTLDR: This game is awesome buy it			"

												At first, I didn't get it, the game seemed boring, and I couldn't keep up with the increasing difficulty, so I played other stuff. After some time I decided to give it another try, and you know, it turned out pretty good.The gameplay is slow-paced at the beginning and winds up quickly. Your character is clunky and weak, but you won't notice as they become a rocket spitting hybring of a wrecking ball and a shredder. You also won't notice as time passes by, as you're already an hour in game, flying around and greedy for more power-ups. They are fully random, so your progress may be easier or harder from session to session - all depends on your luck. I also have to note the soundtrack. It's really beautiful and charming, one of the best game soundtracks I know, and it fits the game just well. Though I usually play with the music of my own choice, which is mostly assorted metal "

												Binding of Isaac and Terraria had a baby, Spelunky and Touhou had a baby, and those babies had a baby. This baby, through sheer chromosomal luck, has none of the bad qualities of its parents.That's right. With a Binding of Isaac unlock and generation system, Terraria's combat with a level-up system, Spelunky's sheer difficulty (and to an extent mechanics), and Touhou's blatantly colorful spam, I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good 'ol Nintendo hard experience. Easily becoming one of my all-time favorite games as I play it more and more.

												You want a hard as balls platformer with genuinely fun gameplay, as well as Binding of Issac style pickups and unlockables?  Buy this game.It has thoroughly beaten me up and taken my lunch money on more than one occasion.  It will punish you, and you will enjoy it. Because you will restart, determined to do better than the previous attempt.  It is extremely addicting, and as such, is fun as hell.Every class has a unique style to them. Each has a TOTALLY different method of traversing maps, taking advantage of terrain features, and destroying enemies in your path. I love it. A LOT of unrecognized love was clearly put into this game, and a lot of love has already been recognized.Get bored of the game for a bit? Burn out?  Read the enemy and item descriptions as you unlock them.Graphics: 2D. 9/10 for the little details, love'm.Sound: 8/10.  Some sounds are piddly, most are pretty great.Music: 10/10.  The music in this game will pull you INTO this game. It's repetitive game music, but it still has made some games intense as all hell.Story: Uh... there is a story... right. 2/10, I forgot about it, but it is relatively unimportant to the gameplay to be honest, which is never something I thought I'd say.Gameplay: 10/10. Your mistakes are your fault.  If you die, it is because you have not yet reached the appropriate level of 'git gud'. Your mistimed jumps, misfired shots, and hestitation can and frequently DO get you killed. This is quite a skillful game, and is a lot of effort to actually stay alive.Learn the characters, find out which one you like, then forget about it because you need to use all the characters to unlock all the things.  I fell in love with this game very quickly, and it is a great way to spend either five minutes, or an hour, depending on how lucky you are that time.Pro Tip:  The Engineer is the best class. ;)			"

												Risk of Rain is a beautifuly made game with 12 unique classes that all have different play styles.Along with many secrets this is also a completionist's game as there are many items, monster logs and achievementsWould HIGHLY recommend those who enjoyed the Binding of Isaac (also rebirth) and/or shooting/platformer games with perma-death and rogue-like elements.But this is just my opinion... Don't let me be the determinating factor in your love/hate for this game.			"

												Play it, but above all, play it with friends, because when you would spend for the first time you wanting more. With the device to select objects, it becomes a new game since you can devise your 'builds' to advance through the worlds. For me it is a 'must have' for indie games. To complete the icing would have been great to incorporate more maps over time or its release is still totally frantic challenge that can not be accompanied quit playing a long time. 9/10			"

												Ever seen a man get chased down by crabs and torn to limb from limb? I have. ♥♥♥♥'s horrifiying yo. First thing to go it's the dude's sense of cool, he hits the ground running and starts to panic. When he realizes he isn't fast enough to escape on foot the second thing to go is his sense of gravity. He starts pounding the jump key like it was his lover in the doggy-style postion. When he runs out of room to jump he lets out a primal chimp scream and jumps headlong into a hoard of hungry crabs, guns blazing. Welcome to Risk of Rain, buddy.The objective is simple. Find the teleporter on each level, flip the switch, hold the line until the timer counts to zero, then make like a tree and get the ♥♥♥♥ outta there. But there's a catch! If you decide you want to perform the ol' five knuckle shuffle just cause you've killed every enemy on the level you'd be making a grave mistake. This game gets harder with every minute that passes. Kind of like your uncle Jerry at your middle school play of Annie. If you die, that's it, no second chances. This isn't Super Mario, son. If you aren't on a full adrenaline-pumping-frenzy working your way through levels at redline speed you're next year's history lession. And that's the truth, Mac. Lucky for you that you've got some help. You can find items hidden in chests around the levels that will help you clear the levels. These items aren't used the condoms you find around your local park, no baby these are Evil Dead 2 Ash's chainsaw arm levels of cool. You can also use the online multiplayer if you can figure it out with friends to fight through the hoards of monsters waiting for you. This turns out less like you and your commando squad of badasses tearing through everything like you were Rambo's children and more like that one scene from Aliens. You know the one.You can get eaten as up to 12 different characters! That's a lot of flesh and metal for the monsters of the planet to sample so try to unlock them all!			"

												I had been meaning to write this review for a long time now, but I couldn’t stop playing this game long enough to do it. Roguelikes and roguelike elements have been trending lately, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Risk of Rain houses a great challenge and addictive gameplay. Risk of Rain requires skill, reflexes, and luck to beat. Every character feels very distinct and they are all fun to play. Each character has four skills, three of which have cool downs, which you have to manage in order to survive. Damage comes in percents and the numbers get high.  Along with number crunching, the randomized items are an essential part of the game. These stackable items provide a number of bonuses, passive and active, that make survival possible. It is hard to describe what makes this game so intense and rewarding.  Difficulty increases as time goes on, so it becomes a tradeoff between risk and reward. Fully exploring a level could result in multiple boss spawns and death by elite level creatures, but rushing through the levels could leave you underpowered and lacking items. Your main objective is to find the teleporter in each level, but its location is randomized each time. Your starting point, chest placement, bosses, items, and overall location are all randomized as well. The intensity of the game never lets up because of the increasing difficulty, and it will take the right items and movements to beat the game. However, every playthrough feels like it’s teaching you something different: you will start to learn the layout of levels, the quickest routes, the main teleporter locations, and so on.If learning isn’t reward enough there are also plenty of unlockables. Besides the nine characters that need to be unlocked, there are a ton of items as well. These are all unlocked in a variety of ways that can make for some interesting challenges on top of the base game. Playing by yourself is great, but this is also a great local or online co-op experience, because teamwork is essential. Outside of the base game there are some logs and statistics to look through. While the item log seems to be less serious, the monster log provides some neat insight into the monsters of the game. The statistics page on the other hand, provides interesting insight into yourself and how much of problem this game has made out of your free time.Risk of Rain is hard to put down. The art and music are both really great, and the game feels solid and rewarding. "

												Risk of Rain is an excellent addition to any game library. I would say the diverse gameplay is more than addictive it is interesting and fun it proves that which intuition suggests to us, when gameplay is the focus rather than graphics in the creation of a game that the gameplay will be highly satisfying at every step of the way. If you have 1-3 good friends who you enjoy playing games with, I highly recommend this game for local on online play. "

												Risk of Rain. What a game. At first I was skepticle to try this game out being that I assumed it was just your average MOBA with some sort of twist to it like most games are nowadays. What you get is a lost soul stranded on a mysterious planet fighting for survival against a army of creatures that want nothing but your death. This game is intense, sweaty hands intense. You play as one out of eight character who's only like, 10 pixels tall against giant monsters that absolutely tower you while trying to fight off a horde of smaller monsters as well. You really do feel a sort of pressure on you while you play when you remember that the monsters only get stronger as time goes on, so you're left with the decision to scour the level for items or to just continue on before you become overpowered. This game is hard, it does not forgive and death will force you to start over, and I wouldn't have it any other way. This is a game for the skillful and the strong, anyone who can't face a good challenge will not survive long in this planet.I love the game. Since the game randomly generates the level to be different every time, you're contantly left guessing where the teleporter is. The wide assortment of items to attain is amazing as they all have different effects that help you in your survival, such as mushrooms that provide speedy healing or a rocket laucher that fires a barrage of missiles at your enemies. There are just so many possibilties that it you're constantly left playing the game over and over again because it's impossible to get the same playthrough twice. That leads me to another thing I love about the game, it's infinately replayable. Since there are so many items and characters you can unlock, it gets to be addicting as more of the game's content becomes avaliable.The Multiplayer mode is a complete blast. You would think that with teamwork, the game should be a breeze, but no. The more people are together at once, the more monsters come to rip you down. It's so much fun to combine you are your friend's unique abilities (assuming they all play different characters) and to coordinate together to survive as effectivly as possible. I always thought it was hilarious how sometimes your friends would get so desperate for items that they dive for every possible chest. Multiplayer adds a new layer of challenge as you now have decide to distrubute the random items evenly, or to have one man become the strongest and carry the rest of the team to survival.Now it's time for the bad.While it's fun and absolutely crazy when you're trying to fight off the hordes of them, after the big masses are dead, you're left with a few stragglers hidden somewhere in some corner of the map which becomes a chore to hunt them all down. One complaint I have with the game is how luck based it is, which I suspect isn't unreasonable considering the nature of the game, it's frustrating to spend your limited resources on a chest only to get some item that wouldn't help at all. There is very little incentive to use the shrines as they have such a high chance for failure, I would only use them if I had excess money on my way to the teleporter. Multiplayer is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to set up. This game uses the system where you have to connect to a friend via IP address. This system is very outdated and has only been nothing but a pain to get working. I cannot open my ports if my life depended on it which leaves me utterly unable to host games, leaving me to depends on my friends to play multiplayer, it becomes quite an inconveience to type in IP addresses for every person. At the very least, there should be an option to copy paste.Aside from those issues, this is an absolutely terrific game that deserves to be played at least once. It offers so much for the moddest price of $10. It's a real bargan to get so much play time from this game. Get it now!			"

It's rare that you come across games like these anymore - games that have a soul - which are the result of careful, creative thought, mixed with a refreshing and playful attitude.The butt-kicking soundtrack for this game does nothing but enhance the eerie and alien atmospheric quality of the game, all while keeping you engaged and rockin' along.

												Currently it is the best game I have played yet. I have seen many other games of this genre, yet this trumps them all in my personal opinion. The playability of this game is great: 4 player local, 50+ players online.. if your computer can handle such a large amount of players, but even at that you do not need a strong computer to run this, this can run oh so smoothly even on a weak computer. The game is chaotically fun for the whole group. It wont get boring because of the fact that you can increase the difficulty level as the time increases. If it's too hard though, try to unlock artifacts that may make the game easier or harder, try combinations of artifacts. I have bought about four nine copies of this game for my friends to play with me*, and I highly recommend this game to anyone willing to try it out.*(this does not mean I will buy it for everyone, but if you have it I will happily play it and help you)			"

												A lonely atmosphere. A struggle to survive. A breathtaking soundtrack.These are things to expect from Risk of Rain. I personally haven't experienced all there is in the game, but I've put enough time into it to confidently say that this game is something special, something we need to see more of.The story is found throughout the world and through the items you find. Nothing's completely concrete, and the speculation can be fun. At least, I find it fun.As a roguelike, you're punished on death, forced to start anew every time. The different classes and randomized map rotation, as well as some variables per map, allow the game to never quite be the same with each run through.The music, though? Glorious. That's my special word for special things. This game touched all the right notes for the soundtrack and has launched itself into my top favorites. And that's tough.The gameplay itself is hectic and fun as hell. Each class can handle each situation differently, although some can do so better than others. I personally like to use the Sniper. It's all about finding the right class for you.Overall, the game was done very well with just the right amount of everything a game needs. Platformers your thing? Roguelikes your masochistic desire? What the ♥♥♥♥ are you waiting for?			"

												This game is always fun to play no matter what you are doing. Supposed to be studying for a test? Play Risk of Rain. In class? Play Risk of Rain. At a funeral? Play risk of rain.In all seriousness, Risk of Rain or RoR is a 2D side-scrolling rouge-like game where you fight unlimited and countless enemies to uprgrade and customize your character to survive the crazy world. There are multiple different classes of characters with unique abilities that set them apart from eachother. The world is always different through every play through of the game so it never gets old.There are random chests placed throughout the world that you open with money earned from killing enemies that give you upgrades or items that help you survive. The twist is once you die you die forever. You have to see how long you can manage to live and possibly beat the game if you are good enough but the game is VERY challenging.There are also acheivments and leaderboards in game and on steam that help you keep track of how good or terrible you are at the game.The game also offers an online co-op mode that you can play with up to four friends to help against the harsh enemies and worlds you explore.Conclusion: RoR is a rouge like adventure game that never gets old and is very addicting to the point were it can ruin your life.I would buy this game at full price so if it is on sale it is definitely a steal.

												Risk of Rain is an indie platformer with a strong focus on fighting against large mobs of enemies, and some rouge-like elements such as unlockable characters and items. It's unique characteristic is that difficulty isn't tied with level progression, as the game allways becomes harder and harder as the clock ticks away.Art, soundtrack, hard difficulty and different playstyles for different characters are it's strong points. Perhaps you will enjoy being swarmed and being forced into kiting tactics rather than brute force or skill upgrades (there aren't any), perhaps not.Despite not being story-rich, the world is memorable, the soundtrack is one of the better ones (and one of my favourites), and the pace and progression is spot on for my tastes.The game is highly recommended if you're on the fence. If you dislike platrofmers or rage easily, probably avoid. Looking at the game on Twitch and YouTube, it's not easy to see what's so good about it. I had a *very* poor opinion about it, until i was convinced to try it. Immediately, my opinion went from utter dislike to surprised enjoyment.You kinda have to love games where you gotta move fast and react to chaotic swarms of enemies and projectiles rather than stalk things quietly and plan ahead (for most characters anyway, Sniper does it sligthly differently). If you enjoy very difficult, breakneck speed gameplay then this will satisfy you thoroughly. The game is very easy to play and very hard to beat. Beating it feels tremendously satisfying.The style, soundtrack and overall mood is somber rather than guts n' gore or slapstick. Like a weeping willow with a minigun, things get very violent but rather than being a hero or villian you're forced to fight as hard as you can just to survive.The story is largely ambiguous, told in bits and pieces of journal entries or item logs. Whatever the reasons brought you there, it's going to end in a lot of death.Items are numerous, humorous and range between very mildly useful and overpowered. With items and command artifacts it's possible to tweak gameplay difficulty and make the game nigh-on-impossible to beat. If you're into that sort of thing.The main gimmick of increasing difficulty as time goes by is executed very well and it's possible to win either by taking your sweet time and hoping to acquire as many useful doodads as possible or by rushing as fast as possible in order to clear later stages before the difficulty increases. It will make the first few attempts pretty hard but the game stays challenging longer that way. And as i've mentioned before, beating the game is an acomplishment!I've also mentioned the soundtrack being excellent but i'll mention it again!There's some bugs. The game engine was upgraded post release and as a results some old bugs were fixed and some new ones appeared. The level generation can occasionaly bug out and co-op play can suffer from port-forwarding problems or disconnects. Other bugs are pretty rare and minor but they get patched out occasionally.As a single player game Risk of Rain is almost a classic. As for multiplayer, well it's got a few problems and it's difficult to get it working until the bugs get fixed.			"

												The risks are high in Risk of Rain, where the risk of danger and the imminent risk of dangerous alien life increases the risk of survival. It's a risky business made riskier when you account for the risk of time, which will gradually increases the risk to die as the game becomes more risky; a risqué move by the developers, but it was a risk worth taking.If you're a risk-taker that can enjoy the riskiness of a good riskily-made risk that is this game, than take a risk and buy this game; you'll run into the risk of having fun.

The enemies can seem cheap, but once you get used to the game, it can be quite easy to figure out how to evade and survive.The only problem this game has, is after you get used to the game it can become a little too easy.

												A lot of people say co-op is the way to play this game, but I've been having a lot of fun with it solo.  It's very deep and engaging, and once you've put some time into it it'll get its ""one more run"" hooks into you deep.  The problem is it doesn't put its best foot forward and it doesn't really teach you what to look for.  The starting class, the Commando, is straight forward but his dodge ability takes a lot of time to really master.  The second class, the Enforcer, is great for multiplayer but a little too slow and plodding for solo.  I've found that the most interesting classes unlock through random event spawns in the later levels, but they're either out of the way or blend with the rest of the scenery so that you need to be right on top of them to get the button prompt and realize they're actually gameplay elements.  If you want to have fun solo with this game, my recommendation is that you set it to easy, unlock all of the classes, and then play it on normal.			"

												I would recommend this game for the upgrade system alone. There are around a hundred items which are randomized, the interesting part being that they all work with each other and can stack with each other. This means that every playthrough, your style of fighting and main source of damage will change dramatically.One time you'll be rapid-firing a machine gun which has a chance of doing double damage, inflicting bleeding and fires faster the lower health you have - the next you'll be staying at a distance, firing the same machine gun on the same character but with mortars and rockets being launched at the same time, causing enemies to combust and leave pools of fire on the floor.The huge combination of items as well as the unlockables and large variety of characters and playstyles mean that not only is this game fun, but has a hell of a load of replay value. The main downsides for me are the lack in truly randomized levels (the layout itself stays the same, but the loot locations change) and the lag at later levels.A definite recommendation nonetheless, and a great game.

												Risk of Rain is a level-based, rogue-like platformer that is several large boats full of action-packed fun. You land on an alien planet, perform diplomacy incredibly poorly by shooting everything you see until it explodes into the planet's currency, buy random loot, kill bosses and move on. Each runthrough is nicely randomized based on the loot you pick up and the character you select, and each character is well rounded with a MOBA-style 3 moves and 1 ultimate ability to help you get sh*t done. Platforming handles beautifully, all non-tank characters have movement abilities to make traversing the desolate environments flow nicely and last but not least, playing with friends is fantastic.Yes, It's a good game, 10/10 would reccomend, but it isn't perfect. The main issue I have with risk of rain is the time limit. Let me elaborate by saying that RoR doesnt really have a time limit; it simply gets harder for every 5 minutes of playtime. ""but a game would be boring if it didnt get harder as you progress"" I hear you bleat. Of course difficulty curve is important, but RoR literally gets harder the LONGER you play, rather than the further you get. You are rewarded for finishing the level as fast as you possibly can, which effectively penalizes exploration of the level. The more you d*ck around, the less likely you are to win. I, personally, do not consider this fun. The entire point is to prohibit players from collecting every possible upgrade and stop them from screwing the difficulty curve by farming early levels for gold and experience, but since experience increases exponentially as you progress and you lose all your money when you go up a level, I still fail to see the point of this gameplay tactic. I don't enjoy feeling rushed when I sit down to play a game.The only other major issue with RoR is that some enemies take WAY too much firepower to bring down. This small annoyance is compounded by the fact that you're on a clock. Playing this game, you will come to resent the tanky enemies so much for screwing up your perfect run. They aren't a challenge, they're not HARD to bring down, but you still need to and doing so is a CHORE. Eventually, as you play, you'll unlock a ""relic"" which allows you to start a new run with -90% health and 10x damage. This feels like the way the game was MEANT to be played, and when you get this extra the game becomes so unbelievably more playable you'll wonder aloud why it wasn't available from the FREAKING START!Risk of Rain is one of the better rogue-likes on the steam market, and I highly reccomend that you give it a go. Good luck trying to get multiplayer to work though!			"

												Should I get this game? How does it play? Does it keep me entertained? How about the music? The effects? Are those good too?Yes, yes they are.I didn't know about Risk of Rain until very recently, and its a damn shame I didn't find it sooner. This is without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played, and that's no exaggeration. The combat, the items, and the levels all feel just right. I can't describe it in any other way than just ""right"" but you'll see if you decide to spend your money on this masterpiece. The progression system is very nice. You start off with only one class, and that's the Commando. If played right, he is probably the easiest character to beat the game with, and again, that's something you find out very quickly upon playing. Through playing, you can unlock the other nine classes, The Enforcer, The Bandit, The Huntress, HAN-D, The Engineer, The Miner, The Sniper, Acrid, and The Mercenary. Each of these classes has skills completely unique to them and each class also has its own stat progression, such as health, armor, and damage. Some classes are definately more powerful than others, but not so much more powerful as that you feel the need to only play one class. Personally, I think that the two most powerful are The Mercenary, who you get for beating the game five times, and The Huntress, who you get for finding 15 monster logs, which drop at random. The multiplayer is still a work in progress, and is currently extremely difficult to get working properly. I can't wait for the final product to be released and enjoy co-op with ease. Risk of Rain is a very refreshing title that comes at a nifty price tag of $10, although I wouldn't hesistate to pay $30 or more for it. It is utterly flawless down to the very last pixel, and for that, has earned its place among my personal top 10 games list.Final Score- 10/10			"

												I previously didn't like this game that much, mostly because it ran at a glorious 5fps and it took over an hour to finish a single stage. The recent patch has made the game run at constant 60fps, even on my terrible dualcore/integrated graphics laptop. Completely loving the experience now that I can properly play it. Also, holy crap is it ever difficult now that the game is no longer played in super slow motion.If you're looking for a game to put pressure on you, challenge you, but do it in a controlled and fair way, that you can replay endlessly, Risk of Rain is a sure thing. Especially if you also dig games like The Binding of Isaac and are looking for something more heavy on the action.			"

												Really fun to learn with a friend, dying horribly over and over until you finally crack the game and begin to slowly climb towards that magical moment when you reach god tier and DESTROY everything on the screen. Extra characters can be unlocked during play, although the starting character is one of my favourites. Theres tons of items which may be confusing at first, but you eventually figure out which ones are useful.Some may find the gameplay repetitive, and it kind of loses its replay value once youve exhausted all possible item builds - also known to be a little buggy at times. Still a lot of fun especially coop, and an awesome soundtrack!			"

												Amazing and witty descriptions are behind every item and monster in this game (You certainly can pierce the heavens).Epic music orchestrates behind you all through the game (Except when you freeze time).Monsters on this planet hate you, a lot. And you just might be the bad guy...But it's fun.In Risk of Rain, I wasted over 200 hours screaming into the unknown that is this superbely atmospheric pixellated world.The updates are done, the community is all but dead, and I've long since uninstalled. But that doesn't stop me from rating this 9999/9999. Just don't use Glass and Command more than once, it's like console commands in a Bethesda game.			"

												This was a game I thought for sure I wouldn't be caught up in.I received this as a gift from a friend and upon playing it - it reminded me of Liero from back in the day due to the game mechanics and pixelation sort of graphics. But I got caught in a concept which the game follows. I was beaking my buddy the whole time about power ups and how they were nice in this game but it was lacking physical power-Ups like double jump's. Low and behold two minutes later I get two double jump power ups and my guy is literally jumping across the map. At that point I was in.The game play itself is good. The concept is you get one life, you run through the levels killing enemies first and fore most to get money to therefore in turn open these chests or ""luck"" statues for power Ups or items. As you kill you gain experience to level up. Power ups range from being able to double jump, to jumping further, to shooting faster, to shooting through everyone every fourth shot, cool-down time faster, every time you shoot maybe something explodes... literally I don't have enough space in this review to write every single power up out. The player starts with a ""commando"" character unit first and as you progress throughout the game or the more you play, the more character units you unlock. Every character has their set abilities (four of them) that cannot change but every character has different abilities. Items also have a cool down period just like the weapon abilities characters have, and the nice thing about items is that they are REUSABLE! What makes the game even better is that there is local multiplayer enabled (fakin' rights bud) and online multiplayer (ohhhhh faaakk yeah bud). So I definitely have to give it up to the guy who made this game because he tried thinking of it all. Oh yeah.... and it's controller supported :) (xbox controller as well as Logitech gamepad). Graphics are graphics as you can see in the preview of the game. To me they look like old Liero touch up's which is perfectly fine but my friend put it better : ""This game reminds me of playing the original nintendo"". After he said that - that's pretty much what I see now. The impact effects, the multitude of varying enemies with each their own power or attack and health, the backgrounds, the different levels all are nice and easy on the eyes, maybe even appealing to some. So I've talked quite a bit about this game, and mostly positive as it rightly is. Does it lack anything? Maybe for some. After unlocking a handful of characters I have to ask myself after being able to play for an hour every time I start a new game, what am I playing for? My stats aren't getting saved (I'm not sure if it's supposed to be saved every time you die or every time you simply start up the game) which sort of is irritating considering people like to see their stats. The game pretense is nice, it's all good but there is just that something more missing. Being able to build buildings in game? Maybe perhaps an RPG element where you can choose certain abilities? I think if this game had steam work shop or maybe some free add-ons to add to the game it would be perfect.I really want to give it my standard rating of 8 which I consider a rating of a good game, however I will have to give it a RATING 7.1/10.Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability B- Overall  B-I feel the rating is fair because once you play this enough, you'll start wondering where is the motivation to play again. Unless of course a friend comes over or wants to play.Any chance of Risk of Rain 2?			"

												Risk of Rain is a somewhat Roguelike platformer. The game consists of five stages. Each stage is selected at random from a choice of ten to fifteen maps per stage, with the maps being variants on two or three actual landscapes. For example, for the first level, you will find yourself either in the Ancient Forest or in the Dried Lake, and each one of those has several variants.Throughout the game, enemies spawn and attack you, the type of which are determined by the map you're on, and the number of which are determined by how far the game timer has progressed. It starts at Very Easy, Easy, Medium, and Hard, and eventually progresses to I SEE YOU, I'M COMING FOR YOU, and HAHAHA.At around HAHAHA, you might start having two or three boss monsters spawning with the normal enemies at random.As if this isn't bad enough, you're pretty fragile and horribly, horribly outmatched by the unending waves of enemies you face. Your weapons are laughably weak in comparison to your foes' attacks, and the fact that there are Elites and Phantasms which ramp the power up to even more ludicrous heights only makes the game more inherently unfair.You kill enemies to collect currency and experience. Experience gains you levels, with the usual ""make everything better"" that comes with levelling. Coins can be used to unlock treasure chests or sacrificed at shrines.The items you gather will make your life a little easier. Not much. Sometimes, negligibly so. But enough negligible boosts can really stack up after a while.This game follows the Goldeneye model of achievements. Each achievement you earn comes with an in-game unlock - some will unlock items that will be able to drop from thereon out, some will unlock new characters, like the specialized and challenging Sniper, or the adorably toxic Acrid.All in all, I have ground my face against this game for hours and hours, have only won a handful of times, and have loved nearly every minute. This is not for the Facebook Games generation, this is for the motherfudgers who thought Contra was a good time, even if they never could get anywhere without the Konami Code.			"

												Risk of Rain? Pfft, more like Risk of PAIN. Because, you know, you'll die a lot in the game.Actually, it's not as much of a risk as it is a certainty. Hold on, let me try again.*ahem*Risk of Rain? Pfft, more like Certainty of Pain. Wait, no, that's crap. Hm, synonyms of certainty...inevitability...destiny? Destiny of Pain? That sure sounds dark, though. Although I guess it fits with the game...where was I going with this again?Dammit, okay, so Risk of Rain is about an interplanetary cargo ship that gets attacked by aliens over a deserted planet. The ship crashes, and you, playing as one of about a dozen different classes, have to, with the help of the cargo you find scattered across the planet, defend yourself against the native creatures and find your way back to the ship. It's a 2D jumpey-shootey platformer that is kind of sort of roguelike-ish; the areas you go to are more or less random, with the locations of the teleporters and items - and the items themselves - being fully randomized, but each area has only a couple of variations. This is not a bad thing - once you play through an area enough times, it's easy to figure out the general layout, meaning that it's potentially easier to find the teleporter to the next area. This saves time, and in Destiny of Pa Risk of Rain, time is not on your side.The longer you spend in the game, the harder the game gets. More enemies spawn more rapidly, the enemies become stronger and tougher, and at higher difficulties, boss enemies can spawn in the middle of a level, instead of only at the end. This not only keeps the game's difficulty up, but it also forces you as a player to keep moving forward. Do you farm enemies and search for items, or head straight for the teleporter to prevent the difficulty from rising any higher than it needs to?The game also features both local and online co-op, which is great, but sadly both methods have their own problems. Getting online co-op to work requires more than passing knowledge of computers, and local has every player sharing one screen, which makes exploration difficult. When it works, though, it can be a blast - exploration and monster-killing become much easier with multiple people, and working in a team allows the more specialized classes, such as Sniper and Enforcer, to shine.Risk of Rain has good controls (the game is perfectly playable with either a keyboard or a gamepad), plenty of things to unlock and discover, and a punishing difficulty level that keeps it from getting boring but is never discouraging. Even though you start with one basic (albeit well-rounded) class, the Commando, getting the other classes offers a nice challenge on top of the gameplay itself, and each class plays very differently from the rest. The game is a ton of fun and you should buy it.			"

												Risk of Rain is damn hard, you will die a lot in it, and these deaths will be unfair. It will require every ounce of attention, time management skills, and luck. The difficulty ramps up over 40 minutes, and after that the game is laughing in your face, throwing everything it has at you like Freddy Krueger doing his one joke stand-up comedy routine, and his one joke is having you drown in a vat of snakes and bugs.But the reason for my recommendation is at the point of the game where you're so buffed that no monster, big or small, can touch you. The part where kills gain you extra maximum hit points, and you're taking out four of these ♥♥♥♥ers every few seconds or so. The part where you have so many drones you're raining bullets into faces and watching them all go down, firing frantically while the horde is held back by your absolute, undeniable firepower, being showered in gold, health, and experience, knowing that you cannot be stopped and that their absolute best is going to have a hell of time killing you.And then you get ganked by some horrible little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you didn't see in time to deal with.If you're not that much into Roguelike-type stuff, maybe skip this and come back to it later on. If you're looking for a co-op game, it requires port forwarding and is not as much fun as doing it alone. Other than that, it's glorious and frustrating and compelling.			"

												Risk of Rain is a fun rogue-like game where you gain experience and gold from killing the endless waves of monsters on every level until the boss is found and destroyed. You will find items that have unique powers which will make you more powerful with each one you find, however time is against you; as time goes on so does the difficulty of the monsters. That is the risk on every level while trying to explore every corner to make sure you get all the items, however the monster density increases and so does their strength. There are a ton of items to find and numerous of different characters you can unlock which each having their own playstyle and ability. The game also has multiplayer (use Hamachi) which adds to the chaotic fun. The graphics and the music in this game are really good as well; if you want to try a rogue-like game this is one of the better ones to start off with.			"

												It's hard to judge a platformer with only 10 levels to offer, usually one would say that it is lacking in content. However, when you factor in the 16 possible combinations of the first 4 levels, the myriad of variations each level has, and how item drops are completely random that gives passive buffs to the player, plus the inclusion of 9 unlockable classes and 1 default class.. You have this roguelike platformer where no 2 play throughs are the same.The gameplay is really fantastic, lending itself to real frantic action with tons of tough enemies and impossible bosses. It has a unique mechanic of cranking the difficulty up as time passes, and so it becomes a wild race against time to get as many items as possible in as little time as possible to keep you alive. There are over 100 items to pick up with more than a handful of them being deployable during the game for added effects.It's not just the gameplay that is great, the 2-D spritework and the forlorn-sounding music complete the experience of playing this game. It looks great, it plays great, there is a lot of depth and challenge to be had. I would say that this is one of the best Rogue-likes to come out in 2013. Go pick it up.			"

												A fast-paced and unforgiving 2D platformer-shooter with 8-bit, pixel graphics.The storyline is rather thin, but solid enough to relay to the player who you are and what you're doing. A stranded pilot on an alien planet and trying to not die, respectively.The gameplay starts off nice and easy, but gradually picks up the pace, ramping up the difficulty exponentially. Apart from 2D platforming and shooting things, this game can very well be categorized as a rogue-like. With permanent death, unforgiving difficulty and a lot of randomized items to aid you in combat, fans of rogue-likes and fast-paced action alike will appreciate Risk of Rain.There are 10 classes to be unlocked, each with 4 distinct and unique abilites. The variety allows for an amazing amount of play styles and strategies. Combined with the at times randomness of items and shrines to waste your money on, players will need to hone their skills and rely on luck as well, if they are to escape this hostile and indomitable planet.

												Risk of Rain is a roguelike action-platformer...I guess? Really I can't keep up with all these crazy genres/sub-genres anymore. Mainly the game works like this:1. You crash land on a planet filled with hostile alien life-forms.2. You must seek out the teleporter.3. You have to survive for 90-120 seconds while killing these aliens and the stage boss.4. You acquire items that unlock additional abilities.5. You can either escape the planet or continue searching for items to become a God of alien-destruction.6. You never get a normal night's sleep again.7. You You You You You You You You You YouHonestly I'm not sure why I enjoyed this game as much as I did. I'm usually not a fan of roguelikes. While I understand and appreciate the work that goes into designing a game in this style, it just seems like 80% of indie titles are some variance of ""get stronger...but don't die or you'll lose everything!"" Risk of Rain however, it really clicks with me, and I've barely scratched the surface.Let's start with the difficulty. RoR can be a challenging game, especially when played on the harder setting, using particular artifacts, and imposing restraints (not acquiring particular items, tougher class, etc). There's a lot of flexibility that goes into this game. Through experimentation and practice, you eventually hit the ""How could you ever die?"" level, that's a good indicator to change things up for your next play-through. Despite the limited number of stages and aliens, the game maintains its freshness on subsequent play-throughs. This is attributed to good scenario design. Actually I take that back, since scenarios are usually created through a combination of artifacts and randomness. Still, a lot of what makes each stage great is what can happen, and the items you find leading to subtle changes in your overall strategy. Surviving is important, but you also have to kill everything. Sometimes aliens/bosses can be ""herded"" by allowing them to spawn on platforms. Teleporting elites can mess with this strategy however.  It's also possible to get trapped by a swarm of aliens, forcing you to make the most of your limited invincibility moves to get away/chip at the crowd. Then there's the immense satisfaction of when everything comes together. You're shooting enemies with lasers, rockets, bullets, missiles, and a bunch of other random crap all at the same time while viewing a parade of numbers. Taking out 40+ enemies at once with a huge attack is also quite amazing. I especially enjoy playing as the mercenary. He has a couple invincible moves and a spin-slash that works sorta like a jump. Eventually I get the cooldowns so low I can mash the invincible moves every second, and constantly spin-slash through huge enemies while never touching the ground. I could go further, believe me I really want to, but I have to get my life back. Risk of Rain devours my free-time, and I still have several hundred other games to play (plus a job and some other stuff that is probably necessary). This game might click for you as well, which would be both great and terrible.  "

												I admit. I was a bit reluctant at first to pick up this game. But once I did, I instantly knew that it was an incredibly good decision on my part. I fell in love within the first few minutes. Imagine a game that takes you, the player, into a cakewalk. You find a cupcake here and there and maybe one or two spoiled ones. Not so bad, right? Then suddenly, the cupcakes turn into bricks. You wonder, ""Wait, why did these cupcakes suddenly get hard?"". You go around finding brick after brick, wondering when you'll find another cupcake. Then to your delight you find an entire damn chocolate cake. And not that cheap crap, either. This is the premo stuff imported from a five-star in Germany. You go to town and dig right in. Afterwards, you realize there's someone behind you. You turn around and what do you find? None other than the dark lord of hellfire and cats, and he's got a legion of pitchforks behind him that are going to be stuck somewhere; and there's no way in hell you'll find any cupcakes now. Now imagine that every five minutes that same dark lord clones himself and his legion threefold; those pitchforks ain't there for decoration, either.That's what it's like playing Risk of Rain. An amazing experience of continuously being challenged against an ever increasing difficulty and number of foes. And that's on the single-player, too. You can invite three other friends with you so that you're not the only one being stuck by pitchfork-wielding cats.The cool thing about this game is the wide-range of character selection, as well. Each character is its own experience to be played, along with their own pros and cons. Most of these characters must be unlocked by completing a certain achievement, making quite a few of them difficult to unlock.You can play as:A drug addictA masochistA hoarderA poacherA robotA nerd with turrets for friendsA gold diggerAn assassinAn animalAnd a guy who likes swords(Respectively: Commando, Enforcer, Bandit, Huntress, HAN-D, Engineer, Miner, Sniper, Acrid, Mercenary)If you haven't already, then pick up this game. Seriously. Ignore the 78 metacritic score; it's complete bull.This is a game that will give you hours and hours of entertainment with extreme amounts of replay value. I got RoR during the Steam Christmas sales, but I would gladly pay $10 for it. I know that as soon as I pick up the controller and launch Risk of Rain, I'm going to be stuck for hours at a time. And I wouldn't have it any other way.On a scale of one to ten, I rate this game: HAHAHAHA			"

												Risk Of Rain is a brilliant platformer/rouge-lite, the main thing with this game that pulls me into this game is how easily I can switch from being under-powered to over-powered and then back again in split seconds. (mostly from getting too cocky when I have certain power-ups. :P) It's genuinely a hard game and I love it for that reason. The music is a selling point as well, sort of a rocky/electronic/ambient thing.The difficulty scales just right for me, it gives me a good 2-5 minutes to do what i need to do in each level, so I can do either a quick pick-up-and-play run or i could do a good 40 min run to (rarely) get to the last level. Plus this game actually makes me want to collect every single power-up and monster log just for the little storys you get alone.The only gripe I have with it is how complicated it is to connect with friends, when I want to connect with a friend I have to use a program called Evolve[evolvehq.com] that gives me and my friends a temp IP address, and even that fails some of the time.All in all, this is a solid game that rates highly on my games list.

												Fun Action-Platformer with some mild rogue like elements. There is a random selection of Arenas, but the overall maps are consistent. Enemy, Item and Teleporter spawns are randomized and depend in part on your unlocks and playtime as the game difficulty increases over time for each run.Controls are tight and work best on gamepad. Difficulty goes from challenging to really, really hard. A run might be short-lived in the beginning but will probably not be much longer than an hour, at that point you either reached the final stage or the game difficultly will have outpaced your character's ability. On that note the final boss is aggravatingly annoying and the reason why I will probably not play this game any further.I enjoyed all the classes I unlocked and had a good time in coop. After 5 hours there are still plenty of items and class combinations to explore, along with some good upgrades in difficulty. Overall great game with a poor designed final stage.			"

												Risk of Rain is an addicting action-based platformer with a healthy dose of challenge. Solo or Co-op, the game is a blast because the game gets progressively harder as you play it! With the idea of collecting power-ups and perks in a struggle to get more powerful and balance out the constant rise in difficulty, you and your friends will find yourselves getting constantly bombarded with more and more enemies and bosses until you die or beat the final stage.    It has great replayability due to the multiple characters to unlock (each with their own very unique playstyles!) and the ever-growing random buffs and perks you unlock by doing challenges! It also features fluid pixel art and great soundtrack to boot. Gameplay is smooth and easy to pick up, but has a decent amount of depth in terms of timing your skills right.    If you like the sound of any of that, I definitley recommend Risk of Rain :)			"

												At first, I was sceptical about this game. Indie 2D platformer with roguelike elements and pixel artsy visuals - how original is that, am I right? Still, I was kind of drawn to it.I got it as a gift from a stranger some time ago, and it was basically just sitting in my library ever since. Recently, I've been looking for something new to play and I've decided to give it a go. I learned very quickly how wrong I was…What is it about?   Storywise, there's not that much to talk about:  Your character somehow survived the explosion of the space cargo ship. You crash landed on an unknown planet, which is bad enough by itself. Unfortunately, the whole place is swarming with all sorts of strange, deadly creatures. As you can probably imagine, none of them is what you'd call ""friendly"". You need to get out of this place…   Leaving the planet is not as easy as one would hope. There are 6 (somewhat) randomly generated levels, each harder than the previous one. To get to the next level, you need to find a teleporter, activate it and then survive another 90 seconds, during which you fight the boss and waves of enemies. Only after killing everything, you can progress to the next level and repeat the same procedure.   Other than your 4 basic combat skills, there are many different passive and active items to be found  These can be bought with the money you've earned by slaughtering monsters native inhabitants. However, it takes a while to get those $$$, which is unlucky, because the game is getting tougher over time. That means you have to decide pretty soon whether to grind for a few minutes and become as OP as you possibly can, or just try to speedrun the whole thing with only a few items. It's your call.What's good...   Even with multiple attacks, controls and the whole combat model is really easy to get into. I've played with a controller most of the time, but it's absolutely fine with keyboard too.  It feels nice and fluid. Chaining attacks is fun, but it also requires a bit of a planning to pull off, so it's not just downright brainless button mashing. Also, difficulty increasing over time is a nice little mechanic and takes the game to a whole new level (heh). Same goes for collecting and stacking different items. All in all, the game actually requires quite a bit of tactical thinking.   Next, I love the amount of content they've put into the game. There are about 100 items total and it takes a while to unlock and find all of them. More than that, you can unlock 11 additional characters. All of them have their unique skill set, allowing for different playstyles, meaning very different experience. Thanks to this, and randomly generated levels, the replayability of this game is insane.Besides, there are diary logs, describing some of the monsters you've encountered, and also ""shipping details"" for all of the items you've found so far. These add more little details to the story and enviroment, making you more invested into the universe you still know nothing about. Moreover, the atmosphere is just wonderful. Pixel art style is spot on and the soundtrack by Chris Christodoulou is just stellar (I'm done with puns now, I promise…).    While it can start to get a little bit ridiculous after 20 minutes or so, I enjoy that. Not being able to see your character through the mix of enemies, health bars, damage values, effects and particles may be stressfull for some…but making it out alive is veeery satisfying, cathartic even. When thing go wrong (and the frequently do), I always feel like I know exactly how I screwed up, despite all of the chaos and randomness. Don't get me wrong, this game is REALLY HARD and will kill you again and again and again… but it still feels more fair than any other rogue-like I've played.On the other hand, beating this game for the first time was one of the most rewarding gaming experiences I think I've ever had…What's not so good…   There are only a few little problems, but I feel like I should mention them anyway.First, the Steam overlay doesn't work at all with this game, which surprised me. That means no screenshots on Steam. Obviously, you can still use the OS's built-in print screen function, but it's a shame that you can't share it with you friends that easily and basically support the game more. Not sure what to think about that. Also, full controller support and Big Picture mode support would be swell. That's pretty much it, nothing else to complain about.Conclusion.Risk of Rain is rock hard, yet fair and fun to play. It combines several interesting mechanics in a very cool way, and the amount of content and replayability is amazing. The world of RoR is eerie, strange and beautiful at the same time, thanks to it's visual style and great soundtrack.If you're a fan of rogue-likes, or hard games in general, you should just buy this game right away - it is definitely worth of both your time and your money. If you are short-tempered however, I would advice you to reconsider.			"

												Risk of Rain is a 2D platforming shooter that puts you on a hostile planet full of alien creatures. The enemies are randomly added and spawn in. While the game has random levels, after 7+ hours of play, you start to recognize that there are random levels with extra frills on them to make them feel as if they were generated. The object of each level is to make it to the teleporter that is randomly placed somewhere on the map. Once you activate it, you need to survive for 90 seconds. A countdown clock appears and soon after a boss emerges and you get swamped with enemies that spawn into the area. A lot of times they spawn on you. Once the 90 seconds are up, then you need to kill the remaining creatures including the boss before you hop in the teleporter to the next level.Along the way you'll find plenty of items and power ups that do some interesting and fun things. Some give you a chance to make enemies freeze, bleed or slow down. Others help with regenerating your health. Another will a barbed wire shield around you while others turn dead enemies into ghosts that will fight for you. There are dozens of these items. You don't just keep one, they stack, so you can end up with a dozen on you and not just that, but if you get the same one on the same play through they increase the effectiveness. Two feathers means you can now jump twice in the air instead of just once.Its more than just passive items, there are usable items that will do things like shoot a cluster of missiles, replenish your health or unlock all the treasure chests on screen. These items have a very long cool down timer, usually around a 45 - 60 seconds. You can even spend money to repair drones that either shoot bullets, lasers or heal you with a green beam. They're so nice to have, especially two of them.You'll find these items from beating bosses, in treasure chests, stores, imp statues and chance statues. The stores give you a choice of three items. Once you buy one, all three disappear. The treasure chests give you a random item and cost gold to open it. The chance statues and imp statues also cost gold. As you get to higher levels, the amounts increase. The chance statues are just that, a chance to get an item. Sometimes these statues cost you health. The more you try, the higher the price. The imp statues release five imps that simply run away from you and you need to kill them all to get your prize. These are all ways to keep the game interesting.The controls are simple, you can move left and right, climb up and down on ladders and jump. Each character has four abilities. Three of which have cool downs. So you have unlimited ammunition, just a timer before you can use them again. To start, you've got a standard fire button that shoots a short burst each half a second. Its not like a machine gun, but at least you can hold down the trigger. Rapidly pulling the trigger will shoot faster, but only if the gun animation has gone away. So not all characters will shoot faster. Depending on the character you have all sorts of range and damage output.From there, you've got a defensive move. The commando has a combat roll to go through enemies.  The enforcer has a shield that he will drop down making him incredibly slow, but protected  from the front. The Bandit has a smoke bomb that makes him invincible for three seconds. Enemies stop chasing you and so on. There are 9+ other characters, but well after 7+ hours, that's all I was able to unlock. These different characters really feel a lot different from one another.What I really don't like is a few times if I want to quickly turn and fire. I'll turn enough so my character will start moving the other way, but when I fire, he will turn around to shoot, then keep running the way he was directed. It seems to happen pretty consistently, especially as the bandit. Even dropping the guardian's shield he will turn around to drop the shield. It is just odd. It has cost me lives and wasted abilities, not to mention special weapons that I need to wait 45 seconds to reuse.You have a good amount of health and it regenerates very slowly over time. Of course every enemy has a good amount of health too. This makes weapons feel pretty powerless. It takes several shots to take down lesser enemies and with larger enemies that have more health, I found myself sitting there just waiting. Perfectly safe, but waiting far too long for my character to kill them. Luckily there is a leveling up system that will give you more health and damage output, but as the clock ticks away, the enemies get stronger and more powerful. Its just really dull having to kill a clump of five strong enemies all batched together. I could put a rubber band on my 360 controller and walk away for a minute. The game just feels like one big grind. You can always get items that add a chance of homing missiles or a chance of mortars, but even then it doesn't help all that much.The game feels slow getting from point A to point B. I'd dread knowing that I'd have to go back somewhere. The character feels like he moves slow, the weapons feel powerless. Its not quick action like Contra or Mega Man. Its all deliberate to prolong the experience. You have a nice wide view of the area, so you get a better sense of where to go, because your character is so slow that if you zoomed in on the action, it would take that much longer to find where you're going. I'm just happy that the experience and gold that falls from enemies automatically flies to you from wherever it is. Having to pick it up would be painful.Like in the real world, you only have one life. When you die, that's it you need to start over, but hopefully you've made it far enough on your previous play through to unlock new items that you'll find in future play throughs. It always drives you to keep going like oo a new thing. Now all I need to do is play again and hope to randomly find it somewhere.The enemies are pretty brainless, that's what allows them to just let me shoot them. I think because they all have so much health they need to be brainless. There are some enemies smart enough to jump up onto platforms to follow you and chase you around, but they're not smart enough to jump over gaps. Floating jellyfish will seek you out, fly through platforms and dart toward you at some point. The bosses are pretty iffy as well.When you get to the teleporter and enemies start transporting in, I found myself getting randomly overwhelmed, because the foes would spawn in on top of me. So then I'd have to run away and keep moving for the 90 seconds or I'd quickly be dead. You don't get brief invincibility when you get hit. Enemies can keep right in you attacking unless you're fast enough to run away or use one of the defensive tactics like roll, smoke bomb or drop a shield. Even if you get good at running away, at some point, there are enemies that can teleport straight on you. Just poof, they're now in you. Do you shoot left or right? Well you occupy the same space, so your guess is as good as mine.As for the music and graphics, both are great. The music excels at being something spacy and other worldly. The graphics look small and old school. I think these two came together to improve the experience I had and made me want to stay in game, because I know it was a struggle against the grind.If you want to play cooperatively, you'll need to have a friend with you, have a LAN connection or an IP address. There is no play through Steam. I'm not sure if I enjoyed the game. Even playing with a friend, it wasn't that fun. I hate to be the only person that didn't enjoy the game. I don't feel like I had fun playing the game, when this game should be right up my alley. I like random stuff, I like good combat and somewhat random levels, but I just feel like I would have enjoyed it more with a faster pace.			"

												Risk of Rain could stand a little more optimizing, but for a game made in Gamemaker of all things it's surprising how engaging it is. The art style is consistent and manages to look great even when your character could be rendered on a digital watch. Combat is fast, constant, and feels good, character progression is a constant motivation, and the soundtrack is top tier. The multiplayer is absolute ♥♥♥♥, a total ordeal to set up which I assume is a limitation of the engine, and unfortunately I haven't been able to get it working. Despite that, Risk of Rain is closer to the traditional rogue-like with randomly-arranged stages, distinct character classes and randomized loot from a very large pool of options than most games professing to be ""rogue-likes"" on steam today.

												This game does what it wants to do properly well. It has it's flaws, but all in all, it's well executed and presents challenging gameplay with great difficulty balancing from easy to hard.The game does NOT handle well internet lag. It's supposed to be synchronized between the players, but with pings of around 300 ms, monsters started desyncing and, due to that, completing stages was only doable by the host, as I could not kill 'all enemies on screen'. The content that the game offers is worth it's price, but I would have definitely paid more money if it offered double the content. It's got 100 items and 7 classes so far, which isn't bad, but gets a little repetitive after a few hours. The key to making the game fresh is, instead, placed on the many classes you can unlock and play with. The soundtrack offers great tunes that motivate the players to keep going. It's very cinematic and complements the scenery in a really classy and well done way.Needless to say, this is much better enjoyed with friends, as all class combos offer great variety in strategies. The game's difficulty is much better adjusted for teamed up players, as different classes complement each other against certain monsters.No need to mention that this game is really hard. REALLY hard. Beating this on Hard difficulty is not a feat for the faint of heart.6/10			"

												Absolutely amazing OST and sound effects!Gameplay is great, especially in two player co-op mode which works flawlessly, but make sure to look out for each other as one might not keep up with other one in later levels if not leveling/powering up alike. One thing to point out however is that game at first feels like it should be played slow and with some tactics in mind, but after a while you realize that it has a totally opposite pace, which isn't bad, just different from what you thought it was at first.What isn't great or at least could be improved on is the overall game and level design which are somehow procedural generated, but fails at some spots completely. From what I have read game was done by one programmer, one designer and one composer so it is absolutely amazing from that perspective, however I wish they had put a much more content and polish into it as game engine and overall feel of the game is superb.Maybe a sequel?Get it if you are looking for some rad co-op shoot-em-up to kill half an hour in the evening!

												This game rules with a cold-iron fist. Do you want to blow up hordes of monsters with an ever-increasing pile of ridiculous abilities that make you into an unbustable death incinerator? Great! You'll do that after you spend lots of time being chumped on the first map by tiny little lizardmens, or popped like a saggy grape between the titanic clapping hands of a robot who is happy and he knows it.""Minimalist"" is a term used to describe some of the art, sure, but in this case it's super evocative. Sound and style combine very well here, and I'm impressed with what cool sci-fi locales they are able to create. Sky Meadow in particular is just wonderful.Play after play, you unlock new items and classes to go all rain a-risking, and you'll do so much unlocking that Jill Valentine will call *you* master. The classes all play differently, I don't know that I can really be the authority on which ones are trash and which ones are god tier, but some of them are certainly easier to own with than others. Ok done talking about the game, gonna go play it some more. "

			Risk of Rain is a hardcore Rouge-like killing fields game available on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/248820/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing:...		

Risk of Rain is a roguelike with some minor platforming elements, andan option for playing in co-op mode.  The game comes with difficulty levels thatoffer a wide variety of challenge in gameplay, as well as artifacts that canunlock more difficulty options.You play as a character stranded on a planet, trying to escape byreaching the teleporter, then stay alive during the 90 seconds it takes toteleport to safety.  The more time you take to survery your area, the harderthe game gets.  Surviving in the game comes down to a combination of luck andusing passive abilities strategically.  That being said, the longer you take,the harder the enemy gets, to the point where the quantity of passive abilitieswill make no difference.This is not a game for those who have never tried roguelikes before;  ratherif you are looking for a challenge, this will entertain you, and even humble youas you go through the game.  This game respects your time, and Ienjoyed playing it.I have no problem recommending it.This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you towatch if you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												Insanely addictive platformer with a lot of rogue-like mechanics. Even though the graphics does look bland at the first sight, the game mechanics are flawless. Replayability is extremely high (local and online co-op included): there's a lot of unlockables, such as new boosts, new playable characters (possibly, a lot more than that, but I'm just getting started playing the game). The levels are generated randomly each time you start a new game, which increases replayability furthermore. Absolutely worth it's money. I'd rate this game 9.0 / 10.0.			"

												Risk of Rain is a platformer/sidescroller/survival game that puts you in control of one of a few survivors of a crashed spaceship. You will have to fight enemies and earn money to purchase upgrades and progress to the upper levels. The game's difficulty scales with the time, adding an incentive for players to use their time efficiently. In each individual ""run"" - or single playthrough - there are six levels, each with harder monsters and more expensive upgrades. Boss monsters appear at the end of a level or sometimes in the middle of a level if the difficulty is high enough. Risk of Rain will require several playthroughs to fully explore what all of the upgrades do and how to play each of the survivors.Read more for an in-depth look at Risk of Rain.This game's story is largely told in the beginning and end cutscenes, as well as in monster logs - information about enemies that randomly drop when you defeat one. Some of the descriptions in the item log also hint to background story events.Risk of Rain [ROR] is a 2D pixelated platformer game. The art is excellent and each of the characters and enemies are unique. Each of the survivors has 4 unique abilities that are fairly balanced. Each one has their own forte and shortcomings, so experiment a little with all of them to figure out which one suits you. You only start with one character unlocked (the Commando), so you'll have to unlock the rest.Items/upgrades are found in chests which unlock for a price. Monsters drop money and experience when killed, and both can also be found in small amounts within canisters. There are four ranks of upgrades - white (common), green (uncommon), red (rare) and orange (use item). The first three ranks are items that are either passive or triggered by events, while the fourth are items activated by the player. All use items and skills (except for the primary basic skill) have cooldowns. There is also an artifact hidden within each level. Artifacts do nothing in the run they are acquired in, but after that playthrough a new artifact's effect can be chosen in the character selection screen. Each one adds a different game element (only elites spawn, 500% damage but 10% health, etc).ROR also has an incredible soundtrack, merging genres from electronic to trance to ambient to rock. Each level has its own exclusive background music, giving it a unique atmosphere. The sound effects are very believable and yet are alien enough to convince you that the planet you are on cannot be Earth.Risk of Rain is an incredible platformer with solid gameplay mechanics, excellent replay value and an addicting arcade-style structure. Online multiplayer is also available. A solid game all-around. Definitely worth purchasing if you enjoy a good thrill.			"

												Brilliantly-made roguelike platformer from the guys behind Starbound. While superficially similar to games like Binding of Isaac or other action roguelikes, there's really nothing that FEELS like Risk of Rain out there.The essentials: you are a survivor from the crash-landing of the UES Contact Light, which was hauling extremely questionable cargo when it was downed over an incredibly hostile alien planet. Play as one of eight different classes, pillage the wreckage that rained down from the sky as the ship crashed, and try your hardest to survive long enough to reach the Contact Light and get off the planet. This is a shallow summary, of course.The basic gameplay is an action platformer reminiscent of Bionic Commando, but there's no grappling hook shenanigans: instead, every class has a completely different style of play, with four abilities. Every class has one basic attack, one crowd control power, one ability that improves mobility, and one very powerful attack that leaves them somewhat vulnerable but is tactically crucial. These range from the basic Commando, who is a classical sidescroller Dude With Gun What Shoots Mans, to stuff like HAN-D, a hulking janitor bot who punches things and launches drones to attack and heal himself, to the Bandit, a space cowboy assassin with a lever-action rifle and dynamite, to even weirder and kookier options. Every class is completely unique compared to every other class, and there's a ton of variety to be found for any kind of playstyle you like. Beyond your class, you've got one slot for an active item and a functionally unlimited number of slots for passive items that improve your abilities or stats in some way. If you've played Binding of Isaac, you basically know how this works. Where a lot of the fun comes in is the sheer variety of items you can find and the way they interact with your character, as well as the intriguing and funny backstories behind each item, displayed in the game's Item Log, which is presented as the shipping manifest of the Contact Light. As you collect items, you'll eventually build a picture of exactly what the Contact Light was up to. The game similarly features monster logs for stuff you kill, which are random pickups.Difficulty in the game is complex; while the game has three difficulty settings(Drizzle, Rainstorm, and Monsoon), it isn't immediately obvious what these do. What they primarily affect is the game's scaling difficulty, which is based on your in-game timer. As the difficulty meter ramps up, enemies get progressively tougher, more aggressive, and more numerous; at the max end, it can even spawn bosses as regular enemies.In each level, you're looking for a teleporter which will take you to the next stage; activating it summons a boss, and once you've killed it and all remaining enemies in the stage, you can progress. You can either beeline for the teleporter straight off, or stay around for a while and try to slaughter enemies to earn money and experience with which to buy items and become stronger, but waiting TOO long becomes a risky gamble due to the ever-increasing difficulty. Too fast, and you'll be underpowered; too slow, and your foes will be insurmountable. Skilled play thus becomes a balancing act between progression and increasing your capabilities.The game is simple to pick up and learn, but is staggeringly replayable, and this is helped by the beautiful aesthetic and wonderful music. For ten bucks, you are getting a LOT of game, and it's certainly worth your time to stand out in the rain for a while.			"

												Risk of Rain's crescendo'd challenges over time provides an interesting dimsension to the Rogue-like game genre. While detailed exploration of maps is possible in Easy mode, progress is not saved unless you are at least at Normal difficulty. The ambient and atmospheric soundtrack provides a perfect complement to the challenging-yet-not-rage-quit-inducing platformer.  A good buy at list; a steal on sale.			"

												This is one of my favorite games the gameplay is really good and I have fun every run. I remember thinking this game might not be for me when I got it from a bundle on humble bundle. I didn't try it until a year later after I got it and now I kinda regret that. This game is baller and I can recommend it at full price however the multiplayer has a few bug still. So if you want it purely for multiplayer then a sale might be a good idea. A lot of things was fixed in the last update so there's quite a bit less crash in multiplayer but there are still a few crash notably it seems to happen more if you edit your file to host more than 4 players.

												This game is challenging at first, but once you get through the learning curve, you can easily breeze through the game if you are playing a class you know well.The multiplayer is simple and painless, and makes the game simultaneously easier and harder. Having two or more people obviously means that you have extra firepower, but you have to share money, exp, and items, providing a difficult balancing act.I would highly reccommend this game to anyone who is a fan of difficult games like They Bleed Pixels or Dark Souls, along with anyone who likes action platformers like Cave Story.

												This game is a fresh take on the rougelike genre.  This game is great to pick up and play for a while with no real commitment.The more you play this game, the more in game powerups you will unlock, which will give the game more depth.  The game has a random element to powerups, so some runs you will get destroyed, and others you will simply dominate.  There are also a handful of unlockable playable characters, each with their own unique play styles.I love games I can just pick up and play, and this game is great for that.  It gets tough at times, but for the most part you will be destroying wave after wave of enemies, which is very satisfying.  If you are looking for something more than an hour here or there, this might not be your game.  For ten bucks, I say its well worth it.			"

												Against all previous statements and assumed beliefs this game is in fact neither a weather application or a simple game. It is actually a time machine, but due to chucklefish dropping development on all their games half-way through it can only send you forward in time. It acheives this by making you perform simple tasks, killing enemies and making your character survive as long as possible, but in reality you are coordinating the complex controls of this machine, quickling sending you anywhere from thirty minutes to well over an hour in one sit down. I found myself playing right after breakfest only to realize shortly afterwards that it was the next morning. Use this game with caution or else you will find yourself losing all grasp on time.also screw toxic beasts "

												Risk of Rain is a very challenging pixelated game with RPG elements for a fast paced gameplay for you and your friends featuring a whole lot of unlockables, items and characters. When playing for the first time, even the easiest difficulty feels like a big hit. Great and forwardening soundtrack that always keeps you on your toes. High replayability in combination with great difficulty and items to unlock that won't let your fingers off the game for a good amount of time.Though, after the first finished gameplay you realize it could use a view more levels to lengthen the game. For the current price the game does not really satisfy in regard of content.The game is not optimized well in terms of performance and visualization on the screen. When things are getting too cluttered, a low- to mid-end PC often hangs on a view strings and slows down to a unplayable state. The final level always lagged on my older notebook, regardless of hosted or being the host and the monsters on the screen.A huge let-down is the handling of lag when playing in multiplayer. The game often ended up being unplayble as the player with a high ping did not synchronize with the host, not being able to teleport to the next level.All in all I would recommend Risk of Rain when it is on sale, otherwise it feels like it is missing content and polishing.

I once played this game for 2:25~ hours straight. Didn't regret 1 second of it (except the time i died and the game ended)This game has tons of fun and replayabilitiy, which is one of the first things i look when i play a game. But that's just me. First of all, the game might seem boring. But if you advance further you realize how many different stuff you can get. You have many items to collect while playing and each one of them gives you an unique ability. Also they are separated in tiers;
White, Green, Red and Orange (usables) And around 80% of the items can be stacked, making them stronger and stronger as you collect more of them. But some have stacking caps.The game gets harder and harder as your progress. And if you play long enough, you might encounter the ""overloaded"" bosses. They take some time to defeat. Also most of the regular enemies turn into elite enemies. Them being elite lets them have special powers (depending on the color, if im right) and they have much more damage & health. I don't know if it counts as a spoiler or not so i will just say this: be prepared for the last boss. It's pretty hard to beat.(Updated)I cannot i believe i missed the 2nd best thing i like about this game! The amazing soundtrack by Chris Christodoulou! He did an amazing job on every track and i enjoy them everytime i play the game. I set my music volume to 100% just to listen to them.
I highly recommend this game. It is worth every penny. Get it on sale or just buy right now & get a refund if you are not amused one bit. "

												Risk of Rain is a rogue-like game, set in a science-fiction setting. If you die, you'll have to start again, but on your way to the next teleporter you'll collect lots of passive and active items and xp, helping you to survive the enormous numbers of enemies wanting to kill you. Also you should hurry, because the longer you play, the harder the game gets.It is a good game for people who like rogue-like games, e.g.  Binding of Isaac, although I think RoR is better.I got this game as a gift and was surprised how addictive this actually is. There are lots of positive points:+ lots of different items, enemies and bosses+ is extremely addictive+ sweet soundtrack and overall atmosphere+ some cool hidden stuff like artifacts and different characters you'll be able to play.+ good and precise controls+ quite cheap and you'll be able to play local coop or online coopRegarding the graphics, I quite like them, but you should like the pixel graphics style.So this isn't a pro nor a con, because it depends on your taste of graphics.As this game is quite awesome, it isn't perfect- while you can play this with a keyboard, I feel like you should play it with a controller, which makes life way easier for you- when starting the game, it is hard as hell, but you'll get a quite op character from time to time, making the hordes of enemies later in the game rather annoying than challenging- the last boss is a real oldschool son-of-a-♥♥♥♥♥ endboss. Although it would have been a strange feel to get an easy endfight after you struggled through the earlier levels, it is almost ridiculous, how difficult and long it takes to beat him.When I reached him, I already played around 55 minutes and it took me 25 minutes to beat that mofo. He is op as hell, but it is absolutely possible to beat him. I did, but found it annoying how long it took.- there are a few minor bugs, but nothing what should stop you from buying and playing this gameOverall, this game is an absolute gem you'll get for a quite cheap price, also during a sale you should probably get a four-pack for all of your friends. Of course there are some minor things I didn't like, but I think they shouldn't stop you form getting this one.Overall I'll give this one85/100			"

												Risk of Rain. Stupid game that crashes every once in a while, isn't even 150 MB, features permadeath, has some of the worst graphics ever...and is so addicting. Who needs sleep when your commando's basic double shot becomes lasers that proc missiles, missiles, mortars that deal over a hundred times your shot's damage, lifesteal per shot, electricity procs, every 4th shot penetrates an enemy...blah blah blah. 11/10 would spam Z again.

												Solid buy, and you can get it for very cheap - although I would recommend paying the full price because its developers definitely deserve that. Good intense action in singleplayer and even better with friends in co-op. I remember having slight issues in multiplayer but it was so fun and addicting nevertheless that it didn't matter.			"

												Impossible to unlike it, when you like rogue-like games. Great characters, doesn't end after few plays, secret artifacts (love them), many actually challenging challenges, every new game is better than earlier one, harder with time, really many items.You really need to be stupid to not like this game. It is perfect. And get's more perfect when played with friends.Totally recommended. 10/10.			"

												This game is awesome. Buy it if you have friends or enjoy rogue-lites.  The reason this game is awesome is because it is perfect for an hour of entertainment if one day you feel bored and don't have the energy to play anything else, but you can also go full achivment hunter and go on the grind to unlock ever single character,steam achivment, and item in this game and spend hours doing that.Now the best reason to get this game if you have friends and they are willing to play a rouglite with you or enjoy getting there ♥♥♥ kicked in a game.But be prepared to yell at your friends for sucking or having them yell at you for sucking.Speaking of sucking be prepared to do that, a lot.

												A really fun rogue like game that gives you many unique ways to play. Every play through gives you different items so that each time you play it feels a little different. Though as a player you do have some choice when it comes to the items that you can buy to better fit your play style. The game also has many different classes that you need to unlock. Some can be unlocked quite easily while others will take multiple play throughs as well as needing to complete specific challenges. The only negative I feel is that sometimes high HP monsters will spawn in the early stage of the game making the game feel quite tedious until you find some items to increase your DPS.			"

Risk of Rain is a sci-fi platforming roguelike where you pick a character and run through levels while collecting a massive selection of (stackable) items to make yourself stronger and more likely to survive long enough to find a way home. The catch is that the more time you spend alive, the more numerous and difficult the enemies become, so there is a trade-off between mining levels for items and speedrunning. Any fan of Spelunky will appreciate its extraplanetary equivalent, but there are a few less-than-desirable traits which should be of note.Unlike Spelunky, Risk of Rain has a diverse set of classes from whom to choose. However, I believe they could be placed on a bit more equal footing. Where many games of all kinds, from TF2 to The Binding of Isaac, make sure that different classes are well balanced, Risk of Rain has certain characters which are clearly far worse than the others (no matter what one's individual strategy may be). Contrary to the achievement name, you will find the Robot Janitor, and you will regret it. Classes like the Enforcer or the Robot Janitor are simply too slow to stand any chance against mid-game swarms of enemies. They are, indeed, powerful classes, but the level difficulty ramps up too quickly to avoid the swarms (whether you choose to search for items or speedjogataleisurelypace). If you do not quickly find several of the same very specific items, you will die more frustrated than entertained. The other ""weaker"" classes have some method of teleporting or defense-rolling to safety, but there is no health pool large enough to save you from enemies too numerous to kill and too fast for you to run away. That said, playing as the other classes yields a roguelike challenge with items and enemies worth the time and money.Overall, Risk of Rain is a good game with uniquely designed aesthetics and gameplay mechanics. This sci-fi roguelike poses a challenge which, though sometimes frustrating, still maintains considerable replay value.8.5/10			"

												I like hard games with rogue-like elements. When you die, you ♥♥♥♥ing die. Risk of Rain is terribly difficult, and there's always the choice of either getting strong or (trying) beating the game fast to prevent it from getting even harder. Because in Risk of Rain, the longer you take, the harder your ♥♥♥ is kicked by the million of constantly-spawning mobs.I've played a lot, and have unlocked most of the characters, but still can't beat the game even in normal difficulty. I think I will, but not today. Dying is fun as hell, though.			"

												Risk of Rain is a game you will try and fail in. Then try again and get a little further. Then try once more and get not quite as far as the first. There's a lot of elements to this game that are random. The biggest of which is the item drops. The quality of the items, the rarity and quantity are randomly generated. That not only makes Risk of Rain feel random, but also makes it challenging. For some reason I'll get further and last longer with worse items. Makes me think I'm on my game! The randomness can feel frustrating or unfair at times, but it adds major replayability.There are a lot of pros and cons, but just know... Risk of Rain is a fantastic game. There are different characters you play as and unlock. You also unlock droppable items through achievements and tasks. The characters all play incredibly different. I believe there's 10 different options. In the game you'll spend the majority of your time dodging and platforming - trying to trick the AI into not being able to get to you. The difficulty also ramps up for every 5 minutes you play (up to 60mins). So ideally you'll clear the level, get all the items and kill the boss all in one sweep. That's usually not the case, since you have to kill enemies to gain money to unlock a chest.A major flaw I've seen is the multiplayer. It has huge potential for a fun multiplayer experience but they missed it just a bit. You can play with 4 players in one screen. That screen does not get split. You must travel CLOSELY with your companions. I'm uncertain if online multiplayer allows you to split off. That's not the flaw, however. The upgrades are how you get more powerful. Only one person can pick up the upgrade, and upgrades are not shared. So you can either choose to split the upgrades between you and your buddy/ies and all be weaker, or have one person pick up every upgrade and have the others feel useless. This can also add some tactical measures to the game as well. If you know the upgrades well enough, you can give the ideal upgrades to the different classes and maybe be stronger as a unit then you would be with one godinator and 3 scrubby nubbies.I'm tempted to say this game is ALMOST too challenging, but it wouldn't feel like an accomplishment if it were easy to make it to the end, now would it? I've played maybe 30-40 runs and completed once or twice. Damn it felt good when I beat it. Play this game. Beat it with every class. Be my hero.			"

												Really drags you in once you try it. I couldn't help myself and just went on playing with the purpose to reach 100% achievements, however stopped at 97% with few monster logs missing. It has an enormous replay value, which sadly ends once you unlock some artifacts (Kin, Glass, Command, Sacrifice) and items (infusion, chargefield generator). Once you get them, starting on a lemurian map, grabbing early infusion and stacking on barbed wire soon makes you and unstoppable ball of death and after 30 minutes of farming you always beat monsoon regardless of the character choice. That kinda killed the fun for me, as I couldn't just go back to the regular style of playing after trying that. All in all though, the point where you can possibly roll through the maps every time you play start after you've played for some 20 hours or so already (if you are fresh new to the game), probably less if you've played it before or read the wikis a lot.Before that I still had lots of fun, trying to survive, which is not always that simple. If you play it the regular way, your every gameplay will be different, some items will make cleaning the levels a breeze, while other sets will push you to change your strategy in order to prevent your painful death. The graphics might be a little archaic, but I think it synergizes well with the game overall and it actually looks pretty neat. The background music is prefect as for a space survival game, it fits well with the atmosphere of being on another planet, alone. Another great thing about the game are the monster logs, which I found very well written and enjoyable to collect and read.RoR doesn't escape few minor bugs like item containers (the always come in three and you can buy only one item) sometimes spawn all in the same place, so you can't even really see what you might get or some items not working properly sometimes (looking at you Imp Overlord's tentacle), but it's nothing gamebreaking. For me, the most annoying issue was the FPS rate in later stages of the game, I mean, I don't really have a gaming rig (yet), but for a game that doesn't involve any too complex graphics, I think it should run smoother rather than lowering my details to the minimum and the FPS rate dropping to 20-30 (which also affects the clock, so the in-game time is not the same a real life time).Still, for such a low price, this game is well-worth buying. It costs like 3 euro, when there's a discount running, which is a funny price for the fun I've had, especially with the AAA games having 5-10 hours of gameplay with no replay value at the cost of 40 euros. I recommend it to everyone who likes games with roguelike elements and is a completionist freak like me.			"

The game is very poorly optimized and while this will rarely be an issue many people have problem with halved (30 instead of 60) framerate on the last level, which means the game runs at half speed (not just half framerate, one second in the game will last for two second in real life).

												Risk of Rain is an amazing 2-D platforming game. The story is about a guy destroying a ship and killing everyone but the Commando. Your job is to find a teleporter while killing randomly spawned enemies. Btw dont even think of camping cause the more you camp the harder the game is. Difficulity goes from Very Easy to HAHAHAHA trust me you do not wanna be in HAHAHAHA cause that is the hardest video game you will ever experience.As you progress through the game, you get money for chests and items, items to help progress through the game and also they stack so make sure any item you see just GRAB IT cause it is important.The Multiplayer is OMG AMAZING. You can play with up to 10 players. The money and XP is shared so if you kill an enemy, the money and XP scatters to the players.Also the music is just amazing. Thank you Chris Christodoulou for that awesome music. The game may be in around 8-16 bit but the music is just gorgeous.i give this game 9 out of 10 due to the difficult and the lag if theres too many players or if theirs too many enemies cause if your in a area with no enemies, your FPS would br around 60 which is good.

												I love this game. Even though, I don't know why the game is named Risk of Rain. Oh well.Like: A 2D Action Platformer with addictive gameplay and alot of items to help you survive. The game gets more difficult over time. With 12 characters to unlock, each with their own abilities, strengths, and boosts.Meh: I didn't exactly like the quality at first, I think that maybe the same quality in the character selection screen could be for gameplay aswell, but it doesn't really matter. The gameplay is what keeps me happy.Dislike: Sometimes when you spawn into the world, you will keep falling down through the ground, and you are gonna need to return to the main menu and start it again.Also when you die in multiplayer, your HUD is just gone when you respawn.8.7/10			"

												Risk of Rain is a ""Rouge Lite"" platformer developed by two college students under the name Hopoo Games. In the game you control one of twelve total characters, marooned on a strange and unknown planet, each with their own abilities, stats and uses. You traverse the multiple levels attempting to get back to the ship you crashed on the planet with, facing enemies and bosses of increasing strength and gathering the lost cargo of the ship to make you more powerful along the way.This is a 2D action platformer, where, as previously stated, you attempt to get to the final level and escape the planet you were marooned on. As you play, you unlock more characters and items in a similar way to The Binding of Isaac where as you play and make progress, you gain new items and characters. The characters are all different and have different abilities across the board. The default character, The Commando, have a high fire rate and deals moderate damage, but high knockback, making him a good crowd control character. On another end The Sniper has an ability that guarantees critical hits on stronger enemies, making him much better for bosses or singular targets.The goal of each level is to reach a teleporter to, you guessed it, teleport to the next level after fighting a 90 second long wave of enemies and killing all the enemies before you can progress. There's a unique difficulty mechanic in this game, it becomes more difficult the longer you play, what I mean by that the seconds that you spend in each level increases the difficulty, adding a sort of risk reward system when you have to decide if you should farm the level more or check for items that you missed,Overall, Risk of Rain is a high quality game that I'd recommend to people who are looking for a challenge or a good game to play with friends, did I mention this was Co-Op? Yeah, it is. Risk of Rain gets a 9/10 from me.			"

												This is absolutely worth the buy, addictive, a real good replay ability and one of the most fun games i have ever played.Of course, its always based on the players taste, i will recommend this game for ALL medium players, new people should wait a bit to play this game, because it is quite hard and you will regret getting it, get a bit more of experience in video games and then you can enjoy I know i may not have played it alot, but i know i will.Multiplayer: a very good multiplayer with easy hosting, no need to open an individual dedicated server and configurate it until it works, either port forward it or play in LAN, host a game and have fun! I have not yet tested playing online but from what i have seen, people with bad internet will not lose game experience, it is still as playable.Combat: I have found myself mashing all the buttons when i first played it, with a German keyboard that changes the Z and Y i almost thought the first skill didnt work until i noticed it, after i found out that there is an first skill i got a lot more strategic, you cannot only stand in one place and PEI PEI PEI, you need take advantage of the enviroment since birds that can fly through walls will eventually come get you.Every character has a different skill list, i found every character that i have unlocked so far very unique. The starting class, the Commando is still my favourite and i love to play as a strategical shooter.Unlockables: This game has an HUGE ammount of different and unique items, 10 classes and it will take a while to 100% this game.Every class has a different way to be unlocked, some may be a challenge and others you will just eventually unlock them.What has surprised me the most about this game is how much items there is, and what every one of them do.I have no idea how many items this game has but everytime i find a new one it doesnt a bit like the others, one of them does something special and unique, you can also hold all of the items you find through the game!There are also ""Use items"" that serve like a 5th skill, you can only hold one and i find it hard to choose which one is coming with me, mostly the ones that the bosses drop because they are the strongest and help alot.How does it play: As the trailer says, the game gets harder as you play, it gets harder with the difficulty you choose and its already hard by default. This game is a real challenge, but the challenge is what makes it fun. While you play the game the game count for how many time you have been playing it, it will be filling a bar at the top right corner of the screen and it can get pretty stressful, you always get scared of exploring the world because you will be losing time and fears that the game is getting harder, its like someone is following you.Apparentally the game has many different levels for the stages, there is a variation of teleporter locations and levels that you will get, the map may never be the same.tl;dr: you a patient and skillful player? get it, you new to video games and not patient? dont get itvery funny thanks guysi will be playing this gamerightnow			"

												Frustrating? Yes, at times, but the rewards of playing are always there.Difficult? Yes, at times, but it becomes a question of, ""what can I do better next time.""Items? Each unique, different item, with their own little charms, backstories and effects, giving a nice depth to the game.Artifacts? Difficult to earn, each one providing a deeper level of play, often a double-edge sword perk, but some are just downright cruel.9 Artifact Run? ""ded"" -Risk of Rain10 Artifact Run? ""rekt"" -Risk of RainPossible to do a run in under 40 minutes? Sure. You'll probably farm some gold on each level, so you can access all the shrines, chests and other available objects, but otherwise, should be beaten in under 90 minutes per average game.The game will taunt you.The game will laugh at your misery.But the game is rewarding, there is a small learning curve, but it's the difficulty curve that is your greatest challenge.Overall 9.5/10; minor bugs and stuff that doesn't really matter, it's a really good game.Soundtrack 9/10; extremely fitting for the game, decent playlist for listening to while not playing the game.*Some users have reported some difficulties with Multiplayer, but isn't that normal with anything online?10/10 would get ""rekt"" again.

												Great game if you love pick up and play games, but if you can't stand the ""one-life"" concept, then this game is not for you. It requires a lot of patience if you want to unlock all the characters, kill all the bosses, and collect all the items.Rating: 9/10 Strongly recommended			"

												I am terrible at this game, and havn't played it nearly enough, but it is a ton of fun and really well made.  It's a rogue-like action platformer.  The game gets more and more difficult the longer you play.  Unlock characters, all with unique abilities and playstyles, as you make your way through the game fighting hordes of enemies, and massive bosses.  Collect a massive amount of items too, all with their own benefits (or disadvantage).  This game can be played single player, as well as with a lot of friends.			"

												This game is difficult in the beginning. I am not going to lie. It will kick your ♥♥♥ down into the ground, then rub your face in the dirt. It will make you want to scream in frustration, having really good items, then dying for some stupid reason. It will make you want to quit. But I implore you, please do not quit, all those bad runs are made up when you get some of the few that beat the game. Then it's like all the other failures never existed. No amount of deaths afterword can get you off the high you achieve from beating this game.Unlocking characters? Even better. You know that after you die on that run, you can play as a whole new person with new abilities. It's truly the best feeling.Don't even get me started on the multiplayer, just goofing off with friends is hours of entertainment. I highly recommend this game. It will beat your ♥♥♥... but lovingly. It wants you to get better. And you will.			"

												Oh my god this game is amazing for the price you pay... it's so friggin' addicting! You start off all weak and normal, but as you go on you can level up from XP that enemies drop, along with money they drop that you can spend on chests and shrines across the map that give you random items that buff your character. There's a HUGE sense of reward with this game... like every item you get is a small step in the right direction. When you're feeling powerful enough, you can try to find a teleporter located in a random area on the map. When you activate it, a boss will appear and you have to survive for a minimum of 90 seconds. After that, you have to finish off the boss and all the smaller enemies around it. Then you can teleport into the next level/area and repeat the process from there. A+/10, buy this game.			"

												I've reched the end of the game! WOW finally!...yes, after about 2 days after i bought this game I finally reached the end of the game. This is NOT just another rogue like game like the others. from the character selection screen you choose what kind of game you are willing to have.Want to tank? ok take a tank Want to have a balanced game ok take a balanced character.From that moment you must pplay with a certain playstyle to reach the end of the game.It took me 98 minutes to reach the end of the game. And you are probably thinking , ""Well that is not so long""thats true, but ive been playing the game for 10 hours the past 2 days just to get good enough to get to the end.I give this game a 9/10 because sometimes you fall trough the level, or you cant move etc. those are game breaking bugs.

												Risk of Rain is a game in which you truly feel adversity with every step you take. It's an incredibly difficult game, but that tends to come with the rogue-like territory. The characters all feel fun to play as, and it's always incredibly satisfying picking up yet another new upgrade to add onto your already extensive pile of upgrades. This is a game that I've lost so many hours on, and not a single minute feels wasted. It can be very frustrating at times, but it's all worth it when you finally become a virtually invincible godslayer, ripping even the most terrifying monsters to shreds.			"

												RoR is a very agressive, colourful pixel orgy of side-scroll platforming, run and gunning. You crash on a hostile alien planet and need to get away from it or the wildlife will get to you. You survive by mowing everything down, getting expierence, gold and collecting/buying powerups. There are 10 characters you can play as (Although you start with just one, others are unlocked by progression or other objectives) each has their own unique set of 4 skills. E.g. Shooting at mobs from multiple directions, charged shots, leaving behind a trail of bile that hurts mobs but boosts other players or temporarily invisibility.The powerup items you can find are passive or active; some of the more simple passive one's will increase stats like the % damage and health you regenerate and active items can be used during combat. Missle launchers, saw blades, minefields, a jar filled with the vengeful souls of monsters. All very fun to try out. The strength in what keeps making you play this game is that the items are randomly generated and chests or shrines you can find them at are also randomly scattered across the levels you play in. (Of which the order of 4 out of the 6 levels are chosen randomly too) The mobs hit really hard and while in the beginning of the game you need skills to time dodging attacks, luck is a big factor in getting the right items to make you powerful enough to beat the game. As time passes the mobs increase in quantity and power, dealing even more damage. In the heat of battle it is easy to lose sight of your character Playing online co-op has to be done through Hamachi which isn't too much of a hassle and playing with a controller didn't go very smooth for me, it doesn't recognize my 360 controller unless I use a controller emulator. Once you have those things set up it's a blast. You won't need an umbrella!			"

												There is a lot of variety here, great replay value, and it's down right addicting. You start out with little to no knowledge of what you're doing and where you're going but after a few deaths you'll find out how to succeed. Even more hectic with friends when you play on multiplayer. There are many unlockables in terms of classes/characters (my personal favorite being the Huntress) and items to find and use when playing. The music isn't bad either, definitely a distinct score. It gives you that alone feeling, with everything coming to life around you just to eat you alive :)			"

												This is absolutely worth the buy, addictive, a real good replay ability and one of the most fun games i have ever played.Of course, its always based on the players taste, i will recommend this game for ALL medium players, new people should wait a bit to play this game, because it is quite hard and you will regret getting it, get a bit more of experience in video games and then you can enjoy I know i may not have played it alot, but i know i will.Multiplayer: a very good multiplayer with easy hosting, no need to open an individual dedicated server and configurate it until it works, either port forward it or play in LAN, host a game and have fun! I have not yet tested playing online but from what i have seen, people with bad internet will not lose game experience, it is still as playable.Combat: I have found myself mashing all the buttons when i first played it, with a German keyboard that changes the Z and Y i almost thought the first skill didnt work until i noticed it, after i found out that there is an first skill i got a lot more strategic, you cannot only stand in one place and PEI PEI PEI, you need take advantage of the enviroment since birds that can fly through walls will eventually come get you.Every character has a different skill list, i found every character that i have unlocked so far very unique. The starting class, the Commando is still my favourite and i love to play as a strategical shooter.Unlockables: This game has an HUGE ammount of different and unique items, 10 classes and it will take a while to 100% this game.Every class has a different way to be unlocked, some may be a challenge and others you will just eventually unlock them.What has surprised me the most about this game is how much items there is, and what every one of them do.I have no idea how many items this game has but everytime i find a new one it doesnt a bit like the others, one of them does something special and unique, you can also hold all of the items you find through the game!There are also ""Use items"" that serve like a 5th skill, you can only hold one and i find it hard to choose which one is coming with me, mostly the ones that the bosses drop because they are the strongest and help alot.How does it play: As the trailer says, the game gets harder as you play, it gets harder with the difficulty you choose and its already hard by default. This game is a real challenge, but the challenge is what makes it fun. While you play the game the game count for how many time you have been playing it, it will be filling a bar at the top right corner of the screen and it can get pretty stressful, you always get scared of exploring the world because you will be losing time and fears that the game is getting harder, its like someone is following you.Apparentally the game has many different levels for the stages, there is a variation of teleporter locations and levels that you will get, the map may never be the same.tl;dr: you a patient and skillful player? get it, you new to video games and not patient? dont get itvery funny thanks guysi will be playing this gamerightnow			"

												Risk of Rain is a rogue-like game, set in a science-fiction setting. If you die, you'll have to start again, but on your way to the next teleporter you'll collect lots of passive and active items and xp, helping you to survive the enormous numbers of enemies wanting to kill you. Also you should hurry, because the longer you play, the harder the game gets.It is a good game for people who like rogue-like games, e.g.  Binding of Isaac, although I think RoR is better.I got this game as a gift and was surprised how addictive this actually is. There are lots of positive points:+ lots of different items, enemies and bosses+ is extremely addictive+ sweet soundtrack and overall atmosphere+ some cool hidden stuff like artifacts and different characters you'll be able to play.+ good and precise controls+ quite cheap and you'll be able to play local coop or online coopRegarding the graphics, I quite like them, but you should like the pixel graphics style.So this isn't a pro nor a con, because it depends on your taste of graphics.As this game is quite awesome, it isn't perfect- while you can play this with a keyboard, I feel like you should play it with a controller, which makes life way easier for you- when starting the game, it is hard as hell, but you'll get a quite op character from time to time, making the hordes of enemies later in the game rather annoying than challenging- the last boss is a real oldschool son-of-a-♥♥♥♥♥ endboss. Although it would have been a strange feel to get an easy endfight after you struggled through the earlier levels, it is almost ridiculous, how difficult and long it takes to beat him.When I reached him, I already played around 55 minutes and it took me 25 minutes to beat that mofo. He is op as hell, but it is absolutely possible to beat him. I did, but found it annoying how long it took.- there are a few minor bugs, but nothing what should stop you from buying and playing this gameOverall, this game is an absolute gem you'll get for a quite cheap price, also during a sale you should probably get a four-pack for all of your friends. Of course there are some minor things I didn't like, but I think they shouldn't stop you form getting this one.Overall I'll give this one85/100			"

												Risk of Rain is an amazing 2-D platforming game. The story is about a guy destroying a ship and killing everyone but the Commando. Your job is to find a teleporter while killing randomly spawned enemies. Btw dont even think of camping cause the more you camp the harder the game is. Difficulity goes from Very Easy to HAHAHAHA trust me you do not wanna be in HAHAHAHA cause that is the hardest video game you will ever experience.As you progress through the game, you get money for chests and items, items to help progress through the game and also they stack so make sure any item you see just GRAB IT cause it is important.The Multiplayer is OMG AMAZING. You can play with up to 10 players. The money and XP is shared so if you kill an enemy, the money and XP scatters to the players.Also the music is just amazing. Thank you Chris Christodoulou for that awesome music. The game may be in around 8-16 bit but the music is just gorgeous.i give this game 9 out of 10 due to the difficult and the lag if theres too many players or if theirs too many enemies cause if your in a area with no enemies, your FPS would br around 60 which is good.

												Risk of Rain is a Indie/Platformer with rogue-like elements. In Risk of Rain you fight through hordes of Enemies that spawn on the level your in and they keep spawning more over time as you try to go through the level, collecting items, killing the Enemie waves, and trying to find the teleporter/exit. You get Gold and Exp. through killing the Enemies that you can use to unlock chests or pray to shrines to get access to items that help you through the game. When you get to the teleporter you have to fight through a 90 sec. spawning wave while trying to kill the boss of that level. The game gets harder the longer you play. It starts off very easy and it can go to the hahaha difficulty if you survive a long enough time. The point of Risk of Rain is to survive as long as you can while trying to get a lot of items that can help you throughout the game and to help you kill the final boss....if you can survive that long that is...Mwahahahah.

The only problem I experienced in-game was the multitude of bugs ranging from trivial annoyances to ones that break the momentum of your gameplay, as they literally 'break' the game by either closing it down themselves, or rendering the game unplayable due to extremely slowed down frame rates.Even with all that, I believe that this game is a lot of fun, and even more so with friends to play with.

												I had had my eye on this one for a while, and when a friend asked me if I wanted to play I impulse bought it on the spot. It turned out to be not only one of my best sale purchases this holiday season, but one of the better games I have played in a long time.It is essentially a hardcore roguelike styled action platformer, shortform and with huge amounts of replayability due to colectables, quite a wealth of characters with 4 different abilities each and a plethora of items to unlock and pick up.- Story: There is not much of an initial story except for the opening cinematic, but as you unlock more characters and monster logs through the game more of the story is filled in. At no point was there a moment where I had to stop and look at the story so far, as it is an action platformer ultimately rather than some long winded fantasy sci-fi epic, but the way the devs have filled in bits of story via logs and such is quite well done.- Sound: Music wise, the developers have chosen quite apt styles of music for the different stages, while creating an atmosphere that suits the gameplay and themes quite well. The sound effects are something else though; each enemy has an attacking noise, as do the weapons and powerups you accrue, and eventually you get to know the sounds of each. This doesn't sound like much, but in a game such as this these sounds are both well fitting and incredibly useful to keep track of enemies in your vicinity.- Gameplay: I think of this as a side scrolling version of Binding of Isaac meets Super House of Dead Ninjas, with an added layer (or 40) of difficulty.Each playthrough is different and items per each run can make or break it for you, as they can in BoI. However, the mechanics and verticality are far more similar to SHoDN, with things being frantic on the screen most of the time. All of this combined makes the game quite fun to play through, and I highly recommend it.As always, it is perhaps best to watch videos of the game before buying, and it is rather difficult alone. If you have a couple of friends to play with it is an absolute blast, and after you unlock a few things playing solo is also quite doable. As of yet I have not gotten to/beat the final stage/boss, but even after I have I will keep playing to unlock more items that become available. Definitely a recommended purchase.This was my first reviews as well, hope it helps someone out there!			"

												Risk of Rain is a spectacular game that I wish I had known about long ago. It is easily one of my favorite games considering its replay value, difficulty, and the absolute carnage in-game. The gameplay is really fun, especially since you are annihilating hordes of mobs with class specific skills and items found in the zones you explore. Risk of Rain starts out fairly easy, but as the timer increases, so does the difficulty. This means a 90 minute game will have bosses, elite units, and waves of other enemies swarming you as you try to reach the endgame. All of this and it has multiplayer. In my opinion the best parts about Risk of Rain are the numerous items you can find on each level and the high skill cap that may be intimidating to new players at first. But fear not, as this game is really fun once you figure out your playstyle and strategy to advance through the zones and reach the final boss. Risk of Rain is a fresh breath in the world of 2D Coop Tough-as-Nails rogue-like indie action shooter-platformers with a great soundtrack, so buy it.			"

It can be a pain to set up the multiplayer mode, but it's fun when you get it to work and you start trying to make up team dynamics.Some classes are harder to unlock than others, some are just outright better than others. Some items you pick up are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and others make you a demigod, but you'd come to expect that from a rouge-like-like.For a dev team of two dudes plus a musician, it's darn good, and worth it if you grab it on sale.

												Woot! Having a ton of fun with this game so far. It's fast, frantic and completely chaotic at times. Since the game's difficulty scales with time spent versus character level, it forces you to keep up your pace or risk falling beneath the power level of the monsters. One of my only complaints for this game is it can become difficult to tell what's happening when particularly large groups of monsters (or groups of particularly large monsters!) and attack animations are going off. Definately the sort of game that you can play in a half-hour stint, or a four hour binge. There is a large variety of meta-game unlockables (including new items to find in-game and new classes) that keeps you wanting one more round. Co-op is tons of fun as well! Local works perfectly, and while I ran into a few (mostly minor graphical) issues with the online co-op it was still incredibly fun and didn't detract much from the experience. Recommend!8.5/10Pros:-Multiple difficulty settings for rookies to vets-Unique unlockable character classes-Crisp, fast-paced action-Play alone! Play split-screen with friends beside you! Play online with friends everywhere!-Cool soundtrack/art style... + explosionsCons-Minor issues with online co-op-Action can become obscured by... the action			"

												This game man, this game. Its the better version of spelunky, its the new binding of isaac. The one thing i love about this game-more than the fact that you can play it over and over again without getting bored, and that there are a seemingly infinite number of items that you can unlock- Is that you can play with your friends. Another thing that is FANTASTIC about this game , is that it has a new and unique system , time = difficulty. As time progresses, the game gets harder. Not only does this put a pressure on the player to hurry the F*** up, but it also gives a strategic choice to the player, wether to farm or to go to the next level and try to fight the boss ASAP. Overall this game is fantastic, not only is it just AWESOME, has great pixel art, and a great replay rate but best of all you get to play with friends.

												★★★★★★★★☆☆Really fun rogue-like platformer. It's a difficult game to begin with, but as with games like this, the more you play it the better you become. There's a diverse range of enemies, bosses and unlockable characters to play, but the pick-ups recieved aren't all that different as they mostly modify a property of your health or damage. It's not all that noticable, but certainly is something to consider.The levels aren't randomly generated, but the locations of objects within the level are. At first it seemed like this would get tiresome, but it allows you to become familiar with each map layout, exploting different points with different characters.Pros:  Fun yet difficult, lots of bosses, classes and enemies, randomly generated objects on the map.Cons: Somewhat similar pick-ups when looked at as a whole.8/10.

												Risk of Rain is an action platformer rouge-like with a pixel art aesthetic. Before any of you say ~nu uh shut up~ I realize it isn't ""like rouge"", its a platformer, but genre definitions are a ♥♥♥♥♥, so it's a rouge-like. Deal with it.Risk of Rain is amazing. Its pixel-art is some of the nicest and most detailed I've ever seen, and some of the few pixel aesthetics games that don't strain my eyes and give me a headache. Its combat is very well done and very varied. It has an item system similar to Isaac only they STACK, and a timer which makes the game progressively harder the longer you take. On one run you could feel totally powerless and on another, very similar run, you could feel like a total badass who can't be stopped. Every variable is a wild-card and everything is very well balanced. You never feel like an obstacle is insurmountable. When you die you know that somewhere up the line you screwed the pooch, either by not taking the time to scavange for items or taking too much time and ramping the difficulty way up; both usually happen on level 3. The unlock system is put together nicely, too. Whenever you find a new item or monster log, you get flavor text that really sets you in the world (Mars isn't a nice place, be glad you aren't there). The ""plot"" is kind of non-existant, but the atmosphere is fantastic.All that being said, this game has one major, glaring flaw that really sets the whole experience back leagues. If you know how most rouge-like-lite-ish-esque-jimminy-crickets go, you'll most likely picture a 30-60 minute venture into a few set evels to find random loot and hopefully become over-powered enough to emerge victorious, and Risk of Rain is no different. However, a main mechanic in making a successful rouge-like is to make everything that happens somewhat fluent. To use Isaac as an example, while most vets spend 5 minutes on the first floors, 10 in the middle, and maybe 15 on the final floors in they're crap at it. This is where RoR is flawed, and to elaborate I'm gonna have to spoil something, so turn away if you cared about the story past ""You crashed, shoot worms"". The final boss is KOOKOO BANANAS ♥♥♥♥ING INSANELY LONG. My first fight with the guy went around 18 minutes. Thats about as much as the first 2 levels combined. And not only that, but its BORING as hell. There maybe once in the entire thing where I felt slightly threatened, and that was towards the very end of it. The rest of the entire fight was me running back and forth and occasionally turning around to spit at the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There was no engagement, just frustration that it wasn't over yet. And what makes matters worse, is that the 1rst and 3rd phases are THE SAME. The only difference is that the 3rd phase adds a clone that you can't attack to damage the boss, so it just makes the running parts way longer and the spitting parts fewer and farther between.This one part of the game is a huge blemish on an otherwise fantastic gaqme. The visuals are great, the atmosphere is great, the combat is great, and the end is a pile of horse ♥♥♥♥ tied to the back of a deranged chimpanzee's pickup truck being driven through the tundra where the snow is replaced with bile. Despite this, I still great;y recommend this game. You should buy it right now. Just skip the end. Or at least make sure you have a portapotty or a coke can near by because you won't be going anywhere for a good while.			"

												Ignore what Steam says, I've been playing the game for well over 60 hours.If you want a challenge, Risk of Rain does not disappoint. Although the concept of getting to the teleporter at the end of each level is simple, and there are only 6 levels in any single playthrough, it just doesn't get old. Ever. After dying 2-3 times I looked up at the clock and an hour and a half had passed. The incredibly addicting gameplay and a near endless amount of items give this game a very similar feel to The Binding of Issac.It's hard, but not unfair.Difficult, but rewarding.Sometimes makes you rage and throw your computer, then pick it back up again and give it 'one more go'.There are tons of unlockables and achivements to test your skill. Beating them unlocks more items and characters as to help you make it further in your next run. Like I said, there are only 6 levels in any one playthrough, but the first four can be switched at random, leading to a total of 10 areas and more to explore. Different stages spawn different enemies, and your teleporter, chests, items, and idols won't be in the same place during your next run. Heck, the same bosses won't even show up. I'd been playing the game for 2 days and found a boss I'd never seen before. Beating the game requires both skill and luck to get the right items. And since no two playthroughs will ever be the same, you can't just expect to get the items you've been hoping for, but you make what you get work.If you like tough games, lots of variety, and simple gameplay that just doesn't get old; Buy Risk of Rain.Also, I can honestly say this game has one of the most fun and just downright enjoyable (yet difficult) final bosses I've seen in a game, which has also become a personal favorite of mine.There isn't much that this game does wrong. 9/10			"

												What happens when you leave a couple college students alone in their room with Gamemaker studio and a plethora of games from their past to influence them? Risk of Rain happens. A genre bending, wait...make that a blended indie sweetheart who made it through the trenches of the Steam Greenlight program. Cross a roguelike with metroidvania, sprinkle on some 4 player co-op and dangle a tasty bunch of useful collectibles in front and you’re left with one of the best co-op games I’ve played this year.For a game where I’ve died more times than survived, it feels weird recommending Risk of Rain. I usually warn players against overly difficult games unless they know what they are getting into, but I can’t express how important it is to experience Risk of Rain. The variety of items, enemies, and environments gives it almost infinite replay value. Players are free to experiment with team combinations, item loadouts, and classes. The unlockable items and challenges will keep even the most hardcore busy, but it is really all about grabbing a group of space travellers and dying over and over again.			"

And theres a captured sex slave pixel monster guy and that is like weird or somethingOh yeah it gets harder the longer you play it, that's kinda cool I guess. And you gotta farm and stuff and then go to the next level after you've successfully planted 8 tomatos and waited 3 hours (or paid to speed them up.) It's quite a simple game with cool music and stuff. Theres a ♥♥♥♥ ton of items and stuffies which help you murder innocent pixel monsters because you crashed. Interesting plot.Buy it. Or buy it for me so I can have more copies. Game is cool. "

												 You wouldn't expect much from the game when it's graphical fidelity is so low, but oh boy, if you enjoy the rogue genre, such like FTL, you will not get dissapointed.Fast action paced and a good variance is brought by the unlocks you gather over time as well as the different difficulty's.I can certainly recommend it for anyone, oh and the music is god damn awesome as well.

												One of my all-time favourite roguelikes. Characters are actually worth unlocking. Local multipayer is fun, but will be a little hard unless you have a gamepad. No huge problems with the game. I've been playing on and off ever since I got the game, and I never get tired of it. The game should seriously get some more recognition, the art, music, and gameplay are far above average.			"

												Risk of Rain is definetely a hard one to review for me.  I find it a rather frustrating game that I continually return to playing and I was left having a hard think on why that is, both in terms of the frustration and in terms of why I keep returning.  Risk of Rain has been something of a mixed bag for me.Someone looking at my other reviews - Teleglitch or SotS: The Pit - will see I'm no stranger to roguelike games and I quite enjoy them.  I don't really find them usually too frustrating and they haven't really seen any ragequits.  But Risk of Rain has.  Why is that?  I think it basically comes down to the fact that the feeling I get from the game is very much that the random nature of the game is such that if you do not get favourable drops pretty much fairly all the way through you're going to have a very difficult time even at the normal difficulty.  This wouldn't be so bad if the easy difficulty didn't penalise you for using it - your progression is not saved when you use the easy mode.  I'm of two minds when it comes to that difficulty.  One one hand, the difficulty is one of the definete genre staples of roguelikes.  On the other hand, other roguelikes I've enjoyed had an element of definete skill to them whereby even with a poor random seed you can still get by if you are really, really good.  Risk of Rain definetely feels exceptionally unforgiving in that random aspect.  It's something to bear in mind.  If you're looking for a more ""rogue light"" experience, Risk of Rain is definetely not what you are looking for, but if you enjoy a challenge, I think you will probably find that attractive in Risk of Rain.  It definetely has that in spades.Speaking of difficulty, one of the more unique mechanics in Risk of Rain is the idea that the difficulty level increases across incremental levels as time elapses, whether or not you are active.  This creates a paltiple tension and as much as I have my difficulty with the random aspect, this particular aspect is something I really like about the game.  There is no rest break in this game, you have to keep going or something will murder you horribly, and that much definetely is a very roguelike thought indeed.  I quite enjoy that part of it.The biggest strength of the game lies in it's audiovisual style however.  It has a very strong and fairly unique aesthetic that is well executed.  I'm actually kind of sad there isn't a soundtrack DLC as I'd buy it in a heartbeat: the soundtrack is utterly captivating and very well composed.  The game itself uses a very ""retro"" pixel art style, but pulls it off well, and the art in some of the monster logs available through the menu are very well-done examples of that particular style.  I just adore the aesthetic of the game, and when I sit and consider why I keep coming back, its to delve a little more into that world and the lore that surrounds it.  It's strange for a roguelike but I get a definete feeling of exploration in learning the environment and it's lore.All in all, it's a very difficult game so if you're looking for a more casual experience, I couldn't reccomend it, but if you enjoy a challenge to your game, Risk of Rain does indeed offer a challenging and carefully-crafted experience that you would be very silly to at least not give a spin.[edit]: Fixed some typographical errors.

												One of the few roguelikes I have legitimately loved. Part of what sells this one for me is that you can unlock alternate characters who play quite differently, as well as artifacts that greatly affect how the game is played. The game becomes surprisingly replayable. Perhaps my favourite mechanic is that each level has a risk/reward of ""Do I stay and get more items and let the difficulty rise or do I rush to the next level"", which greatly adds tension. Fantastic game alone or with friends.			"

												A solid (and nicely priced) game, Risk of Rain is fun and the perfect introduction for newbies into the genre of games with roguelike elements. It's easy to jump into, controls are simple, lots of hidden unlockables for replayability, and the gameplay is straightforward. The straightforward gameplay has its pro's and con's. Personally, I think that it limits the game somewhat, because it does seem more repetitive than say, Binding of Isaac or Spelunky. The randomized levels don't make much of an impact here than it does in Spelunky. And the loose-nature of RPG-styled combat makes battles less intense compared to Binding of Isaac. But the lack of complexity, IMO, is what makes multiplayer possible and enjoyable. Now... if only there was matchmaking for the online.			"

												I wanna write a legit review for this game, cause 90% of my reviews are troll ones that somehow get people offended. (via comment war) OTHERWISE let's get into it.This game is difficult. know that and know it well, You're gonna die a lot. So if you get frustrated easily...glhf.Risk of rain is a 2d shooter which has some of my favorite kinds of things, Items with effects that help you ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ upyes, that's right. ♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥. up. Not only that the game gets super fun when collecting more and STACKING these items, so let's say you stack x3 with a item that makes you go fast, guess what? you're apparently the ♥♥♥♥ing flash now. (<- good)Like the binding of Isaac it gets difficult the further you go, however in this game, it's way different. There are three main difficulties you can pick, Drizzle, Rainstorm, and Monsoon. (wow rain!) This is the base difficulty, I'd recommend Drizzle if you're new just to get the mechanics of characters down really.But difficulty does not stop there. You're difficulty INCREASES by the amount of time you spend, so don't go pickin flowers son. It can get to the point where the difficulty bar literally laughs at you. ♥♥♥♥in demonic ♥♥♥♥.You start with the Commando, first character and a personal favorite of mine. From there you start unlocking more characters, I'm not gonna list them all cause there's guides to  tell you all about the characters and shiz like that.So now comes the question, SHOULD you buy it? Is it worth your money? Yes. If you like challenge, this is one hell of a challenge. or if you like 2d shooters, go for it. oh and multiplayer is wonky at times soo keep that in mind. otherwise tl:dr - fun shooter that is difficult.

Consider me very pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying not just the story, but the art style, the gameplay, and even the way the updates offered new content - y'know, back when it was constantly updating.It's still buggy, it still needs a bit of optimization, and it would greatly benefit from going on sale and getting updated more often, but even now it's still a great game I can't help but want to see more people play.

												Hello, I am here to tell you about Risk of rain, a sidescrolly, itemy roguelite that has a trailer so confusing and uninformative that I wouldn't have picked it up if I hadn't heard about it before. -Important Sidenote! I am not critiquing the game, merely reviewing it.-In Risk of Rain you are a traveler on a space courier ship that's attacked by a mysterious... thing. Causing you to fall to the ground of an unfamiliar alien planet, where you fight for your life. Picking up items dropped by the ship and ultimately finding your way back to the fallen ship to fight the menace and leave the planet.When you first go into the game, you walk around the landscape and monsters will start to spawn, though slowly at first. You will then kill them, as they threaten your life, picking up their gold, which you then use to buy items out of the chests that have fallen down with you. When you first start playing, you will only have a small selection of items to find, but as you play more, you will unlock more, and these are persistant across lives. The difficulty increases over time, making monsters tougher and making them spawn more often, until you either die, or finish the game.  So, is it good? Hell yes. It definitely is fun to play. It has a nice growth curve towards the start, both with unlocking items through ""achievements"" -eg, kill 20 golems in one life, or activate the third teleporter without taking damage- and through increases in player skill, both with the game and with it's myriad of classes. Classes that, are unlocked through slightly bigger and harder versions of the achievements for items. -eg, kill 3 bosses or activate 40 drones in total.- It also has nice gameplay, that although slow towards the start of a game, gets progressively harder and faster paced as time goes on.Expect to die in your first few runs.The items are fun to use, with most of them providing unique effects that are not just simple stat bonuses. It's really refreshing. Having good items for your class is another challenge the game throws at you, as they all have different movesets with cooldowns as you use them, and different items will complement different classes much more than others. But of course, this all depends on what strategy you are using.Though there are complaints to be had.Risk of rain has a nasty thing called randomness, this can be good or bad, depending on your viewpoint. Some runs will be really easy, since you got good items from the -mostly- random chests, but others can be sabotaged by bad drops. Although I find that this can be overcome by player skill (and slightly balanced by the stat leveling system the game employs) this is a quirk of the genre that  can be good or bad. It makes the good runs stand out, certainly, but putting it the time to get there, at least initally, can be a slog. (I personally like it... now).The game is also short, but very high quality. Being a completionist, I have put a disproportionate amount of hours in. -More if you count the fact that I did most of the early game offline. It's not a big immersive rpg. It's a short sharp game you will play for, a week maybe, and will have you utterly hooked. it provides a unique blend of elements that makes it stand out and provide an experience like no other. You can keep coming back to it, sure, but it's not going to change much, and you will get bored of it eventually.UPDATE.Recently, however, there was an update the added artifacts that can change the game significantly, this can make the round you are playing unique to you and anyone else playing with you. This adds a new level of replayability to the game, making it last for much longer.I hope I've provided some insight.			"

												All the other reviews on the store page will tell you its genre and gameplay mechanics, so you already know all about how awesome those are.  Instead, I'll tell you about what will happen after you obtain this game and try it out:First, you'll be a little overwhelmed by the enemies and quickly advancing difficulty.  But, you'll figure out a good strategy or two for taking on some enemies, and feel pretty good about it.  ""Perhaps this wasn't a bad purchase,"" you'll think.Second, you'll begin to realize that several hours have passed and you have started over a few times.  You have two full rows of items at your disposal and you're going back through the first level for the second time.  You'll wonder if perhaps you should go to bed.Third and finally, you'll experience a burning desire to play this game when you have some free time.  You'll listen to the soundtrack regularly because it's so delicious, and you'll see little item or teleporter outlines when you close your eyes at night.  You'll be able to identify and name all the items you see by icon alone, in no time.It's really a wonderful game!  I had no idea, until I got sucked in.			"

												It is not uncommon for human beings to find themselves bored with the monotony of regular life. Day after day we find ourselves experiencing new things, yet we still long for something. We feel as if we need an escape from the world in which we find ourselves. This need has given rise to a plethora of movies, books, and games, among many other things, to distract us from our life. It is with this same feeling that I decided to embark upon such a distraction.Leaping forth to immerse myself in a new world, I was excited at the new possibilities it offered. Although my character's landing had been rough, I was optimistic for the future. What never before seen wonders would I uncover. What beauty that had yet to grace the sight of man would I be blessed to lay my eyes upon? The imagination of man falls short in the face reality and I knew not what I would come across. The wonderous awe I felt as my feet touched the ground of this new world would be torn brutally away. Naïvety soon wears out its welcome, as did I apparently.What followed was a quick and horrifying descent into madness. As I gazed upon the flora of this new world, never having seen comparable beauty in Earth's, I was soon greeted with the fauna. A surprising variety of creatures met me with death in their minds. I fought as hard as I could, killing many, but the longer I lingered, the more arrived and the more dangerous they were. An endless flood of enemies assailed me, precious little time was I safe.Worse still were the monsters who were so much greater than the others. Towering beasts of great strength and tenacity hunted me down. Desperation seeped deep into my bones and I began to savour those rare moments when the creatures of a new area had yet to discover my presence.I would watch as the many different beings who so oft fell dead before me lived. They went about their bussiness, so similar to the animals of Earth. Realization struck me, I was the alien in this world, the terrifying invader. I represented an outside force that, if I was being totally honest, would in all likelyhood destroy this world's life for greed.It allowed me to take a step back and gain a new perspective on my existence. 'My' fight for survival, humanity's fight for survival, comes at a great cost. What right did I have to murder so many, just so I could continue on? In what way can I justify so many lives lost for my own? The same can be said for us as a whole. We slaughter our way through countless animals without a second thought. We do not visit new land, we destory it. We do not give to this world, we take from it. It's an eye-opening experience in which everyone should partake. This game is no mere escape, it is a wake up call. Scared and confused by my new outlook on life, I was in a daze. My only consolation whilst traversing this desolate virtual land... it never rained.			"

												When I first saw this game I didn't know If I was going to like it. . . I'm weary over games with graphics like this and side-scroller shooters. . . now I am Hooked. . . The game is hard. Really hard, yet very simple in design. This is one of those games that it is ok to die for the game is fair and as you play you unlock tools to help you progress.The rewards are high and the replay-ability is quite high.  The game changes up every time you play and you can let the game become harder as you feel fit. The achievements, when gotten feel like you have really earned that achievement. All and all one of the best games I bought thus far.I'm very happy that this game came as a pleasant surprise.I will say a few things on the other side.Sometimes the controls do seem to derp but not often.The game can cause some levels of frustration but I do like that some might not.I do recommend playing with an Xbox controller. . but can be ok with playing with a keyboard.If you get it have fun.It may look like it's a small package but it is huge and the images don't really let you know how fun this game can be. .. it is fine solo and awesome with a group. ..

												Risk of Rain is a great action platformer game.With an 8-bit look like graphics, but still beautiful environments, the game challenges you to stay alive as far as possible. The more you live, the harder it gets.It has a lot of power-ups, many characters to play and the enemies are all random, that means you can play each time a very different game.The soundtrack is just fantastic, it gives all the action atmosphere you need to try to stay alive. I could listen to it all day.The gameplay is pretty simple and it works very well. Easy to learn, maybe hard to master until you find your favorite character.Of course, there are some complications: the online game is a little bit tricky, you must give your IP and select a port to work, but aside that you'll have a lot of fun with this game.I strong recommend if you like platformer / action games.

												9/10Overview: 2d Rogue-Action/Platformer The Good:+10 characters each with their own unique attack and abilities. +Randomized levels every time you start a new game. +Over 100 items ensuring lots of variety+Plenty of things to unlock. You first start out with only one character: the commando and a handful of items. As you play and complete challenges, you unlock more characters and items making it easier to get to the end of the game. +Every good rogue game I've played has a nice sense of pacing. What seems like an impossible task in the beginning slowly becomes easier once you start understanding the mechanics. Making it to the last boss is a very satisfying feeling. + One of the main premises of the game is that as time goes on, the harder enemies become. This creates somewhat of an interesting balance to the game. Normally you may think that you should just complete each level as fast as possible however this may leave you underpowered in the next level. Take too long in a level and you may find the enemies too hard to defeat. Finding the right balance between killing enemies, collecting as many items in a level and staying above the difficulty curve is part of the strategy. + I love the music. Fantastic soundtrack. The Average:Although there are 10 character to choose from, some of them are not that good compared to others and some were designed with multiplayer in mind. Online multiplayer community is dead ConclusionThis is one of my favorite rogue games on steam. It has an addicting quality to it. Playing each character, getting rare items and having a good run is one of the hallmarks of a great rogue game.			"

Each item makes a difference and all are useful.The game is hard. At least at the start.

												Is for games like Risk Of Rain, each i day think Indies are the future! In Risk Of Rain we did crashed on weird strange planet full of monsters anf loot to find and the teleporters you so desperately need to get back to your now scuffed up transport ship to get out of dodge, and in order to do that we need to survive a wave of 3min and kill all the monsters! It features beautiful pixel art and a awesome soundtrack. Besides Single Player, you can enjoy it in local or online co-op mode, witch can be much harder. There are 10 classes to choose from but only 1 is available at start. The other class you will unlock when you complete some task (some can bit a hard), but right from the begging you have the Comando Class, witch is nice class to use, it has a nice set of skill and you can easily complete the game with that.All class are good in their own way, a quick example would be the Enforcer, since it has a shield can take more damaged. But it lacks in one thing, the replay value is good but after a while gets boring because the world are always the same, i would wish if we had more world to explore and kills those monsters.  But with the awesome SP, COOP and the lovely OST this game is must! ~ 9/10			"

I got it out of curiosity, and because an old friend recommened it a long time ago. I'm very bad at it right now, but something about the game makes me want to get better at it.

												Similar Games:Super Smash Bros, The Binding of Isaac and to a lesser degree TerrariaThe Good:A fun mix of a roguelike action platformer with boss battles thrown in.The artwork, while sticking to the retro trend, still manages to be impressive.The item variation is well-designed with unique names and artwork for each.The timer element definitely increases the tension as well as the excitement as the game progresses.Similar to The Binding of Isaac, the items you find can make the difference between “a good run” and a fairly quick and brutal death.Levels are quasi-randomized, adding to the unique feel of each run.Multiplayer is a ton of fun (although with a caveat – see The Bad).Higher difficulty levels/later stages get just plain crazy with the amount of carnage on the screen (again, with a caveat – see The Bad).The playable characters vary greatly, with the unlockable ones requiring a fair amount of skill to play.The game allows you to beat the game in a “straight run” or revisit earlier levels to farm items before attempting the last boss.The music fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly, although after a couple playthroughs you’ll be wishing there was more than a handful of tracks.The Bad:The jump timing is a bit off. More than a few times, I’ve missed a simple jump because the game couldn’t process that I was hitting move and spacebar simultaneously.Multiplayer is more fun than single player, however…Multiplayer has a number of bugs: 1) If you die, sometimes you can’t switch between spectating the remaining players 2) The boss timer tends to display different information to each player, e.g. I’ll see the timer has finished while the other player sees 15 seconds, etc 3) A fairly cryptic error message will sometimes appear in the upper left corner of the screen, then disappear.The multiplayer lobby needs a few tweaks, such as leaving the IP visible, letting players re-select characters, showing character names/abilities, etc.Once you reach higher difficulty levels and/or the final stage, the game lags horribly due to the amount of items on-screen at once.A game running on Steam in 2013 requiring a direct IP connection makes no sense.This game does not like alt-tabbing.Sometimes the game just crashes for no apparent reason.The Writing:Most roguelikes skimp on the writing, but Risk of Rain actually has a fair amount of quality writing contained in the item log. Aside from that, the writing is limited to randomized one-liners when multiplayer participants die, half of which sound like they were written by someone either in middle school or from ♥♥♥♥♥.Did I make time to complete it?Definitely – although The Bad may seem to outweigh The Good, this game is still one of my top games of 2013. I’ve played Risk of Rain since the beta, and the full Steam version for over 16 hours.Recommended Purchase Price:This game is *easily* worth $9.99 – I’d pay $20 without hesitation.or200% of current retail value of $9.99Reviewer:Mudlabhttp://www.gamersglance.com "

												Activate the teleporter and hop in to proceed to the next level. A timer will be shown once you have activated it and need to survive spawning enemy waves for 90 seconds before the teleporter can be used. Defeat enemies, farm their gold and open chests with it for items. Items will give you perks. The problem I have with this game is the lack of balance. There a 2 scenarios possible. You are lucky and farm good items and become godlike or unlucky with item spawns in that you are unable to proceed further. When you have farmed good items and become godlike (there is no item cap) it involves zero skill and all you do is kiting and let perks do their job of killing mobs. The game throws so many enemies at you later on that it turns into a kite fest and most characters and their abilities become useless. There is no mechanism that prevents you from getting overpowered and still able to tackle enemy mobs without kiting. The game clearly lacks any balancing from mid to late game. You are also unable to play this with two controllers in local coop which doesn't make sense. Great concept and potential but ultimately falls short by design issues.			"

												This is in no way a bad review, this is only a warning to those buying the game with friends, hoping to play it right after the instalation from the get go. There is set up required on the hosts end and if you're not up to the task don't expect to play with friends.Game is great, love the game. only thing is setting up port forwarding is sometimes not an option and on top of that, the game is more finicky about it even when you've port forwarded correctly and still able to host a Terraria server or a Starbound server. There could have been a better way to do online for the game. At the very least an easier way.			"

												A fun and challenging 2D sidescrolling rogue-like in which you can get a demi-god adrenaline rush by stuffing many powerful artifacts down your space trousers and making hundreds of dudes face the wrath of your explosive fury. Start as one dude, unlock many other dudes with varying abilities by doing certain things, like beating the game, etc.The difficulty of the game slowly increases as time goes on, so you and probably at least one other friend should split up, and balance between murdering space dudes, getting their exp, gold, items, collecting items from chests by spending money you've collected (because videogame), and finding the teleporter in a timely manner which initiates a gauntlet for about 90 seconds and spawns a boss which you must then destroy. After the gauntlet is over and the remaining enemies are dead, any player can use the teleporter to proceed to the next level.Rinse and repeat several times until you get to the final level, and kill the final boss who wants you and your comrades incredibly dead.In short:> Explore, shoot things, collect items, find teleporter> Hold out, shoot more things, enter teleporter> Repeat, reach final level, beat snot out of final dude, probably unlock more dudes> Repeat> Go mad with POWER!!!!!!!

												Risk or Rain is an absolutely amazing game to purchase. It's very addictive and interactive. Absolutely worth the $10.00 I paid. It does get a bit hectic though. Hectic to a point that some lower-end computers will get some lag issues (but in my experience, if you farmed a bit, you should have at least a bit of lag by the end level). It does have a bit of issues with multiplayer too. The replay value of this game is absolutely phenomenal. I've replayed the game countless times and it's still very fun to play, both singleplayer and multiplayer. The amount of different scenarios that arise are almost endless. I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes rogue-like games or a game that really grabs your attention. :) :)			"

												Risk of rain is fantastic! The game has a very simple yet detailed pixel art style, and interesting monster, weapon, and character designs, each masterfully animated.The music seems to be inspired by retro game beats, yet feels fresh, and oscillates from being adreniline pumping, to calm and relaxing, it's a good, fun, varied sountrack. The simple yet deep gameplay, offers various characters to unlock, each offering very unique movesets that all have been perfectly balanced, so one should be able to find one character that fits their playstyle. While the game is hard, it never feels so due to monsters having an unfair advantage, however several artifacts can also be unlocked to alter gameplay so it either ends up easier, or more difficult. Additionally three difficulty levels can be selected, so you can cater the challenge to your own tastes.The gist of the game is to fight off a neverending wave of enemies, that become progressively more difficult the longer the game is in play, over the course of 6 levels. Each level is completed by first finding a teleporter, then fighting off against a boss, and surviving a time limit wherein serveral enemies will spawn to attack the player, after successfully doing so the player will be transported to the next level.A lot of work went into the design of the game, from the easy to navigate menu's, to the environments available, and amount of enemies you can come across, to the games ostensibly simple story that reveals more depth as you dig into the lore. Along with the many secrets, hidden areas, and unlockables to discover.Multiplayer is a blast, but unfortunately very difficult to set up with others...Risk of rain is fun on all levels, and an excellent addition to the indie genre, that should keep one entertained for hours!Score: 4.5/5 -0.5 due to the difficulty in setting up a multiplayer game.Sincerely,- Celx RequinWebsite: www.cancer-cinema.comTwitter: www.twitter.com/cancercinemaSteam Game Page:

												Risk of Rain is an enjoyable Rogue-Like action focused platformer with a great soundtrack. Although it has slight problems with game life and multiplayer, I suggest buying this game. Now we shall go onto the specifics of the game. Risk of Rain is a Rogue-Like platformer that has 10 classes; each of these classes has 4 different skill sets allowing for a very diverse game experience. There are 11 different areas in the game, each with a few different stage layouts. Not every session the player plays will actually consist of all 11 areas. Most sessions, players will only see 5 stages. Each stage is laid out very well that isn't confusing nor unfair for combat. The combat of the game is very strong. It also can remain diverse because of the different classes. Each class possses a different skill set that can be used for different situation. The Commando, being the starting class, is the most all around class in the game. The Sniper, being an unlocked class, is the most situational class in the whole game being that it is a boss killer.Like FTL and Rogue Legacy, the game can get tiring faster than wanted. I played about 3 hours on the day of purchase because of its solid gameplay. As the week continued, the desire to play the game and the amount of time spent started to dwindle. I found that after the intial high of the game, I really didn't have a huge desire to play the game. That doesn't mean that Risk of Rain is a bad game. The multiplayer can easily increase the life of the gameThis brings up another problem with Risk of Rain. The multiplayer is not very simple to set up. You have to go through and get your IP and open ports up on your computer. The hardcore computer gamer should be capable of doing this with no problem, but that doesn't mean that the process is not annoying. Dying in multiplayer can also make it a very boring game if playing with someone who is much better. There is no way to revive your friends; all you can do is beat the level or die. All they can do is watch and hope you die. To conclude the review, Risk of Rain is an enjoyable Rogue-Like action focused platformer with a great soundtrack. Although it has slight problems with game life and multiplayer, I suggest buying this game. Now we shall go onto the specifics of the game.			"

												Interesting action rogue-like with a varied group of characters to play from. Great fun in multiplayer due to the size of the levels and the amount of enemies coming at you. Only major downsides are that I wish there were more levels and things to unlock. And multiplayer is currently only direct IP connection which is a pain. If they can at least fix the latter, it would make the game so much better.			"

												At first glance, you might think paying 10 or even 7 bucks for this is too much. Well, I thought that as well, but I soon realized I would pay double what I had if I knew it was going to be this fun! First of all, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing! Very exciting, entergetic, atmospheric at times and well..it's just beautiful! It can be a very unforgivng game. The longer you play, the harder it becomes. You can't stay in one area for too long or you will get the shaft of a thousand suns! It challenges you to think fast and survive. I still haven't beat it, but I can't get enough of it!In some ways it reminds me of The Binding of Isaac. The items are interesting and provide strategies. You have a health bar and once you die, you gotta start back from the beginning. BOTH ARE VERY ADDICTIVE!!!I know I'm not the best reviewer yet, but just take my word for it. Buy this game!!!			"

He has four skills, like you would see in a game like DoTA 2 or Awesomenauts.So you play as the Commando, die a few times, kill some bosses.Then, right as you think you get bored, bam.You reach the third level, and unlock a new character.Or you kill 3 bosses and unlock the Enforcer.Or maybe you even beat the game and unlock the Sniper.Then it gets really, really fun. You start exploring different characters, unlocking more items, and completing challenges.Bring a friend along locally, and the fun just gets funner. Play online, and the same happens.I have not gotten tired of this game after 24 hours. That doesn't happen often with me. 60% of games that have straight,  forward objectives get boring for me after a while.So really, all in all, Hopoo has done an amazing job.(Plus, Hopoo said PvP might be a thing in the future, so that makes it better.)TL;DR:The more you play, the funner it gets.11/10.

												Risk of rain is a very enjoyable little game.The gameplay is good and there are a lot of different items, which all offer new mechanics. The game strikes a great balance between permadeath and progression by allowing you unlock new items as you advance.This is one of the few games which distance themselves from the 'collect everything meticulously to grow strong' trope. It's certainly a breeze of fresh air in that regard.With it's many items, characters and mechanics, this game can offer many hours of varied gameplay.			"

												It's good.It's hard and items are random. Kind of like Binding of Isaac, you might have some trouble with unfavorable starting items before you get better.As you kill stuff and get better at the game you unlock new items to randomly drop and new characters, so gameplay stays reasonably fresh.I got a little burnt out from playing it too much but every once in a while I can come back to it.This is all a lot more than I can say for most of my games.

												Ah, Risk of Rain. Risk of Rain, Risk of Rain. This game. I don't even know where to start, really. It's an almagam of insanity, part platformer, shooter, bullet hell, whatever-the-hell a rougelike is, and oh so much more. The difficulty curve is absurd, to start. All powerups and upgrades are delivered through pure chance, in such a way that ensures that, while you will always get at least some sort of powerup in every level, the actual item is almost impossible to accurately predict (think Binding of Issac; you can get another friggin' speed boost, you can get an item of little use to your particular class, or you can get something that turns you into what amounts as an invincible hellbeast). However, almost none of them are absolute game winners, and regardless of the Items you get, you'd damn well better know how to use them. The music is absolutely fantastic, the controls are some of the tightest you'd ever encounter, and the varied classes to chose from allow for a massive amount of control over how the hell you're going to survive all those monsters (Hint: You probably won't). It gets harder as time goes on, with the difficulty increasing every 5 minutes. (There's also the base 3 difficulties, easy, medium, and hard. The difficulty still scales with them, but on a different amount for each, so Impossible (about 45 minutes) on easy is still doable, meanwhile Impossible (Still about 45 minutes) on Hard, is, well... Just that.) The catch is that the luck factor requires time to be spent on levels in the first place, so it's a dangerous decision to make. Time Vs. Chance of getting an item. However, despite all these things stacked up against the player, it's quite rare to feel that a death wasn't your fault (Chain of awful item drops aside). I never felt that the game was too hard, rather I felt that I died due to a lack of skill. All in all it's a wonderful game that you should probably buy, because it has multiplayer as well! The downside of the multiplayer is that it doesn't seem to balance with the amount of players, so you can reasonably overwhelm the enemies with your force of multiclass destruction with minimal loss of life (Someone will probably die, however...)

												Got this game while it was like 75% off. -Started it up.-Died-Decided I loved dieing virtually in this game-Continued to die -And die-Obtained items through chests and was awarded new items-Got addicted-Decided I wanted more power-Got to boar Island -Item wh*red the s**t out of the boars hence renaming it ""Whoar Island""-Achieved 10,000 health and around 400 items (mostly same items stacked)-Decided it was time to go-Ahnilated everything in my path-Got to the final level -Still almost die to the boss since I'm such a newb-Then realize I was on the easiest difficulty -Cry because I'm a failure D:And yet still haven't managed to try the hardest difficulty because I'm scared. But finally there is a game out there that actually challenges you. What ever happened to these games! It seems like all producers ever do in games now is lead you through the whole game assisting you in so many ways when you don't even want to be assisted. Cheers to this game and its producers for taking a step in the right direction and coming up with a classic style game that should definitely be considered fun not just to people who have played games like this in the past but also to this generation of gamers. I said earlier that I got this game when it was around 75% off after playing this game I would definitely pay full price for it, I'd even pay double the amount of full price. So yes I'd definitely reccomend this game to all types of gamers out there new ones, old ones, fps players, moba players, rpg players, whatever it maybe! This game is just awesome and it gives you a taste of what games used to be like kind of back to the days of the metroid series or the zelda series or the mega man series, Whatever its a good game just buy it all ready why are you still reading this damn review the good part was over a while ago JUST BUY THE GAME ALREADY ITS WORTH MORE THAN THE 10 BUCKS.

												It's still a tiny bit buggy, but for being developed by one person in their spare time, this game is phenomenal. It's easily worth twice what it's listed for. The music is great, the graphics are sharp and interesting, the gameplay is clean and tight, and it's deeper than the ocean. The game could survive on the strength of the first playable character, but each newly unlocked character adds a whole new dimension to the excellent co-op experience.

												Oooh, boy. This game. It's... Definitely something.Here's my analogy of the game: You start off sucking at the game, and love it.You get decent, lose sometimes, win sometimes, and it's fun.Then... Well, once you get good enough, the game is just... Too repititive to enjoy easily.Somehow, I see some people have hundreds of hours in this game, and, well, good for  them. If you can be one of those people to enjoy this game that long, good on you! But, in my opinion, the game is fun for a while, but not too long. I recommend this game, but I highly recommend getting it on sale, as only 40-50 hours from 10 dollars, is, well, decent, but not the best.Overall, I'd give Risk of Rain a... 8/10. Maybe 8.5/10.			"

												Risk of rain is fantastic! The game has a very simple yet detailed pixel art style, and interesting monster, weapon, and character designs, each masterfully animated.The music seems to be inspired by retro game beats, yet feels fresh, and oscillates from being adreniline pumping, to calm and relaxing, it's a good, fun, varied sountrack. The simple yet deep gameplay, offers various characters to unlock, each offering very unique movesets that all have been perfectly balanced, so one should be able to find one character that fits their playstyle. While the game is hard, it never feels so due to monsters having an unfair advantage, however several artifacts can also be unlocked to alter gameplay so it either ends up easier, or more difficult. Additionally three difficulty levels can be selected, so you can cater the challenge to your own tastes.The gist of the game is to fight off a neverending wave of enemies, that become progressively more difficult the longer the game is in play, over the course of 6 levels. Each level is completed by first finding a teleporter, then fighting off against a boss, and surviving a time limit wherein serveral enemies will spawn to attack the player, after successfully doing so the player will be transported to the next level.A lot of work went into the design of the game, from the easy to navigate menu's, to the environments available, and amount of enemies you can come across, to the games ostensibly simple story that reveals more depth as you dig into the lore. Along with the many secrets, hidden areas, and unlockables to discover.Multiplayer is a blast, but unfortunately very difficult to set up with others...Risk of rain is fun on all levels, and an excellent addition to the indie genre, that should keep one entertained for hours!Score: 4.5/5 -0.5 due to the difficulty in setting up a multiplayer game.Sincerely,- Celx RequinWebsite: www.cancer-cinema.comTwitter: www.twitter.com/cancercinemaSteam Game Page:

												Risk or Rain is an absolutely amazing game to purchase. It's very addictive and interactive. Absolutely worth the $10.00 I paid. It does get a bit hectic though. Hectic to a point that some lower-end computers will get some lag issues (but in my experience, if you farmed a bit, you should have at least a bit of lag by the end level). It does have a bit of issues with multiplayer too. The replay value of this game is absolutely phenomenal. I've replayed the game countless times and it's still very fun to play, both singleplayer and multiplayer. The amount of different scenarios that arise are almost endless. I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes rogue-like games or a game that really grabs your attention. :) :)			"

												It's like you took Just Cause and some Platforming and sidescroller shooter games and mixed into a game...Great to Play alone or with friends.-Each Character has their own unique fighting style-Plenty of Achivments and tasks to do-Do the tasks and be rewarded with new items,item descriptions and characters!-So many items to choose from-Special artifacts that can alter the game in the menu once found in the actual levels-With so many items the item combos can be so crazy its like your breaking the game-Replayability not just in general but in a run you can choose to redo the other levels you went through instead of going to the final level for more items or look for the artifacts or grind! ;3The only complaint i really have about this game is that you need to set up your own server in order to play with friends and such like with Hamachi or something. But when you do its a blast to have. My Rating9.9/10 Master Piece.			"

												A really good time!  I've obviously put quite a few hours into this game, although the lack of a save+quit feature means that I spent only 50 hours actually playing the game, and the other 40 hours were spent in the pause menu, so I didn't lose progress when I had to stop mid-game.Lots of interesting enemies, abilities, and items.  The difficulty curve is quite steep at first, but once you've died a dozen times or so, you'll have unlocked a few more characters, and some useful items.  The 'story', as told via the Monster Logs you collect from enemies, is straightforward and simplistic, but the world-building/detail about the monsters and their lives is nice.  The item log is also pretty fun, since all the items are cargo, scattered when your ship crashes, and come with little descriptions detailing their sender, recipient, and generally a 'letter' accompanying them.Very much worth the $10, and it seems to go on sale fairly regularly if that's still too much.  Good for filling a spare 20-60 minutes, very replayable.  One issue with the multiplayer is (allegedly, I haven't tried it much/only played local) fairly poorly implemented when it comes to game creation.  No server lists, so you either need to have friends who own it, or organise a game in the steam forum.  The actual multiplayer gameplay is very fun, since you can get some good synergy between characters that you just can't have playing solo.			"

												Fun and addicting game, often found that I lost track of time while playing.  You kind of get that Super Smash Bros feel with the unlockable characters which drives you to play more and each character has their own unique stats and skills to further increase incentive to get them.There's plenty of replayability however I don't feel the game is worth the full price of $10.  There is simply not enough content to market this game at that price since there are only 10 characters and once you have all of them unlocked your only reason to play is to unlock the other power-ups that have a chance of spawning or Monster Logs for some lore on the monsters you're fighting.I recommend this game only if it's on sale.

												I very much enjoyed Risk of Rain. When I first got the game, with only the Commando as a playable character, I found it harder to enjoy. The difficulty curve from the start put me off, and I didn't know (and still don't) how to play the Commando well, so I put it aside. After a while, however, I came back to it, and started to unlock more and more characters, which is when I realised that the sense of satisfaction as you climb through levels and acquire a veritable armory of items is very rewarding. I feel that, skill aside, some characters are simply more effective than others, and that some of the in-game unlockable achievements are unrealistic (Activating the third teleporter without being hurt once just seems unrealistic for a more casual player), but those are the only negatives I can think of. The art style is perhaps left to preference, but I very much enjoy the simplicity and elegance in well-done pixel art, and find it very appealing.Each character feels unique and plays unique, the simplicity of four skills combined with varying attack and movement speed lending to a completely different playstyle for every character, something that I feel is often lost in current games. The items, some more useful than others, all feel like they have distinct bonuses and different, from the Guardian Hearts to the Jetpacks and the Wicked Rings, and finding a higher-tier item feels rewarding and can immediately change your playstyle.The levels are, perhaps, not that high in variety, but due to the adaptation in playstyle from each character and the multitude of items, they always feel like they play different. However, once all the characters have been unlocked, and all (or most of) the items, repitition kicks in: but this could be said for any game, so I won't count this as a negative.All in all, a very enjoyable time waster, allowing for both quick games and intense playthroughs, the mechanics are rewarding, and utilising only four skills per character, they all feel and play wildly different. Definitely recommended.			"

												Got this game while it was like 75% off. -Started it up.-Died-Decided I loved dieing virtually in this game-Continued to die -And die-Obtained items through chests and was awarded new items-Got addicted-Decided I wanted more power-Got to boar Island -Item wh*red the s**t out of the boars hence renaming it ""Whoar Island""-Achieved 10,000 health and around 400 items (mostly same items stacked)-Decided it was time to go-Ahnilated everything in my path-Got to the final level -Still almost die to the boss since I'm such a newb-Then realize I was on the easiest difficulty -Cry because I'm a failure D:And yet still haven't managed to try the hardest difficulty because I'm scared. But finally there is a game out there that actually challenges you. What ever happened to these games! It seems like all producers ever do in games now is lead you through the whole game assisting you in so many ways when you don't even want to be assisted. Cheers to this game and its producers for taking a step in the right direction and coming up with a classic style game that should definitely be considered fun not just to people who have played games like this in the past but also to this generation of gamers. I said earlier that I got this game when it was around 75% off after playing this game I would definitely pay full price for it, I'd even pay double the amount of full price. So yes I'd definitely reccomend this game to all types of gamers out there new ones, old ones, fps players, moba players, rpg players, whatever it maybe! This game is just awesome and it gives you a taste of what games used to be like kind of back to the days of the metroid series or the zelda series or the mega man series, Whatever its a good game just buy it all ready why are you still reading this damn review the good part was over a while ago JUST BUY THE GAME ALREADY ITS WORTH MORE THAN THE 10 BUCKS.

The music is great, the graphics are sharp and interesting, the gameplay is clean and tight, and it's deeper than the ocean. The game could survive on the strength of the first playable character, but each newly unlocked character adds a whole new dimension to the excellent co-op experience. Be prepared to be frustrated, be prepared to die unfairly, be prepared to make the wrong decision and end your run early, but most of all - be prepared to love this game to death.			"

												Risk of Rain is a lot of things.It's primarily a roguelike-ish sidescroller/platformer with addictive fast paced gameplay. It is also fun. It is also incredibly challenging. It is also somewhat new. It also very, very fun.You have to unlock most items and classes. The class you start with is very balanced, and while it might get repetitive to play it time after time until you start unlocking more stuff, it certainly pays off as you'll find an entertaining and diverse cast of playable characters, each with their own distinct playstyles and roles.Multiplayer is downright amazing. It can be bothersome to decide who gets to keep each item sometimes and much like most co-op games, someone who doesn't carry their own weight could easily cause your doom, but regardless, when you get a well coordinated team, or at least one with a minimal amount of synergy, it becomes the sort of experience that many co-op games strive to achieve.If you dig roguelikes, and/or games to play with your friends, you should totally check this out.

I want more content. This does not mean that the game does not actually contain a lot of stuff, because it does. I just can't get enough of it! It did take me some time to complete it 100%, including all achievements, so it's not because I haven't got the €9 of gameplay that I payed for. Because in my eyes, that's a freaking bargain!Anyways:Short version: For €9, this is a bargain. Much gameplay. Amazing game. I WANT MORE! 10/10 "

												Fantastic game, if you are a fan of games such as The Binding of Isaac, Paranautical Activity, or even Spelunky, you should really take a look at this game. With a variety of characters to unlock, randomized levels, numerous bosses and an assortment of items to pick up, the game is packed with hours upon hours of Rogue-lite fun. Something I found quite interesting in this game was the ability to stack multiple of the same items, to the point where you're zapping everything in sight by jamming on your Ukulele or have enough regen to shrug off most any attack, should luck be on your side. While Risk of Rain is a blast to play solo, the inclusion of a multiplayer mode going up to 4 players (Local or Online) gives this game just that much more staying power. Playing solo or with friends, this is a must buy if you are a fan of Rogue-lite games with just a hint of platforming.			"

												I really wasn't expecting this amount of fun.  It has an almost perfect balance of skill requirement, a good difficulty curve, and the reward of unlockable content and the feeling of accomplishment when you succeed, with a dash of luck required to spice things up.The artstyle is interesting and each creature and item has it's own entry in a log accessed from the main menu, so if you're not playing the game you can look at some interesting background for it as well as some cool artwork of the enemies/bossies, provided you've picked up their log in-game.There's also enough unlockables to make you want to continue playing, if the gameplay wasn't enough for you, and a number of unique(ish) classes to change your game each time.  Throw in a few buddies and you've got a great co-op adventure.Finally, the music sets the tone perfectly - I'd buy the soundtrack if it becomes available (it may already be, I should go check...)

												Fun and addicting game, often found that I lost track of time while playing.  You kind of get that Super Smash Bros feel with the unlockable characters which drives you to play more and each character has their own unique stats and skills to further increase incentive to get them.There's plenty of replayability however I don't feel the game is worth the full price of $10.  There is simply not enough content to market this game at that price since there are only 10 characters and once you have all of them unlocked your only reason to play is to unlock the other power-ups that have a chance of spawning or Monster Logs for some lore on the monsters you're fighting.I recommend this game only if it's on sale.

												I very much enjoyed Risk of Rain. When I first got the game, with only the Commando as a playable character, I found it harder to enjoy. The difficulty curve from the start put me off, and I didn't know (and still don't) how to play the Commando well, so I put it aside. After a while, however, I came back to it, and started to unlock more and more characters, which is when I realised that the sense of satisfaction as you climb through levels and acquire a veritable armory of items is very rewarding. I feel that, skill aside, some characters are simply more effective than others, and that some of the in-game unlockable achievements are unrealistic (Activating the third teleporter without being hurt once just seems unrealistic for a more casual player), but those are the only negatives I can think of. The art style is perhaps left to preference, but I very much enjoy the simplicity and elegance in well-done pixel art, and find it very appealing.Each character feels unique and plays unique, the simplicity of four skills combined with varying attack and movement speed lending to a completely different playstyle for every character, something that I feel is often lost in current games. The items, some more useful than others, all feel like they have distinct bonuses and different, from the Guardian Hearts to the Jetpacks and the Wicked Rings, and finding a higher-tier item feels rewarding and can immediately change your playstyle.The levels are, perhaps, not that high in variety, but due to the adaptation in playstyle from each character and the multitude of items, they always feel like they play different. However, once all the characters have been unlocked, and all (or most of) the items, repitition kicks in: but this could be said for any game, so I won't count this as a negative.All in all, a very enjoyable time waster, allowing for both quick games and intense playthroughs, the mechanics are rewarding, and utilising only four skills per character, they all feel and play wildly different. Definitely recommended.			"

It IS a roguelike, so you will be more at ease if you're familiar with The Binding of Isaac and even more so with Rogue Legacy, but with three difficulty settings it will suit you whatever your skill with these games. Is it hard? Incredibly. Is it fair? Absolutely. Is it rewarding? Immensely. Is it fun? You bet your ♥♥♥ it is.All of this already makes it a must-play, but the fact that it has 4 player coop, local or online, is so awesome.

												Risk of rain is a side-scrolling shooter with perma death and items you can buy from currency you gain from killing monsters. The longer you play the harder the game gets. It's simple, but rewarding. You start off with one character to choose from and start unlocking others with each having their own unique skills. As you play through the game you unlock new items.Risk of Rain is pure genuine fun without all the excess bloat that games seem to forget these days. Especially triple A games that seem to pad out too much story and excess content that drain the enjoyment that could be had. Risk of Rain is different and it emphasizes gameplay amongst all else. I can't recommend this game enough. It is an amazing roguelike-like and its one that i'll continually comeback to.			"

												Well, this review is a bit late, but I'm going to type it up anyway. Risk of Rain is a rogue-like platformer/shooter/arcade-like game. There's no single genre to describe it (in my personal opinion). I shall now continue to focus on different parts of the game.STORYDon't buy this game for the story. The story is almost nonexistant, but still does feel like it has a weight to it at the end of the game. Regardless, you don't want to focus on the story for buying this game.GAMEPLAYThis is where the game shines. You get to choose from several characters (unlocked over time) to defeat aliens and collect loot. Once you feel as if you have collected enough loot and gained enough levels, you can attempt to go on to the next level. I say ""attempt"" because to get to the next level, you have to fight off a seemingly never-ending horde for 90 seconds until you can leave. Also, this game has a very special mechanic. This game focusses highly on TIME. If you take too long to get to the next level, you might become overwhelmed with higher level enemies. As time passes, the difficulty is upped. This allows for tension and the feel of having to make decisions (do I stay to get all the loot, or should I get out of here and risk dying?).REPLAYABILITYFor someone like me, who plays games a lot and wants a lot of unlockables and such to keep him busy, this game does not disappoint. It definitely isn't easy to get everything either. There are 4 sections of unlockables: Characters, Items, Logs, Artifacts. All characters have a different playstyle and you can always find one that suits you. Although, the characters aren't very well balanced. Certain items are allowed into the pool to be drawn when you open a chest once you complete specific achievements. This makes you want to go back and see if you can get that item that you feel could get you to the end. Logs are little tidbits of info about monsters you've killed through your journeys. It's similar to how Nintendo's ""Pikmin"" addresses it. It's very similar. However, there isn't a definite chance that a monster will unlock the log. You may have to kill it a lot (it's a random drop). Finally, artifacts aren't something I can talk a whole lot about as I haven't unlocked any, but as I hear it, they change the game dramatically.NOSTALGIA?The feel this game has...is undescribable to be honest with you. It makes me feel like I'm playing an old game (arcade, NES, Genesis, and the like). It is incredibly difficult and not very forgiving. I can't exactly talk about this category a whole lot, but this game (for some odd reason) makes me think of arcades. Not sure if that's a selling point, however.FLAWSYou didn't think I was going to address any flaws? Think not! This game has them! As I stated before, character balancing is just one flaw (not a very major one, however). A majority of this game runs on 2 things. Skill and luck. And a majority of the time, it's rare to get a run past level 3 with a fresh installation (no Steam Cloud. Another flaw). Oh, and there's no saving mid-game.FINAL NOTESOverall, this is a fantastic game, but if you can't deal with the flaws involved the paragraph above, I would stay away from it. But if you can, you are in for one of the best feeling games I've ever played. When you finally complete this, you are going to be overjoyed.9.5/10			"

												A wonderful rouge-like game where you land on a planet and fight for surivival to the final level or go into an endless like mode where you repeat all the previous levels at harder difficulty. You complete achievements, unlock new characters, and recieve many randomized items from various chests and item-givers. It can be a little buggy at times, more noticable in multiplayer, although its not usually anything game breaking and you can still have a great time.7/10 for fun-factor but isn't currently updated often at all to fix annoying bugs.

The <time=difficulty> mechanic is unique and keeps the game exciting because it causes farming to become progressively more dangerous.Ten characters, four unique skills each, three difficulty levels and over a hundred items.

The music is great, the graphics are sharp and interesting, the gameplay is clean and tight, and it's deeper than the ocean. The game could survive on the strength of the first playable character, but each newly unlocked character adds a whole new dimension to the excellent co-op experience.

												Great, if you like rogue-likes. It's hectic, but not overwhelming. It's a lot simpler than the trailer looks. It'll take a while to play, even one run takes quite a lot of time, on average I spend around half an hour on only the first level. The ""It gets harder over time"" is genius, as you try to go fast, but at the same time take your time and grind to be ready for the boss at the end of the level. As much as it has the elements of a platformer, It's a minor feature, and it's not a thing you should be really thinking about when you decide to purchase. It's a ""Rogue-like platformer"", but at it's heart it's a Rogue-like. Oh, one last note, the music. Ohhhhhhhh, the music. Wonderful.7/10, Good, but... I dunno, it just, could be better. Maybe I just haven't tried the multiplayer yet. I'll update this if I get the chancne to try that. All in all, buy it if you feel like it's you cup of tea. Otherwise, find something else.			"

Every unlocked character offers a complete new playing style and learning curve. Good music and fans of pixel art will smile at graphics. Goals and achievents are very hermetic, which can be annoying, but I guess that´s the point -- I recommend you check some game guides after getting used with the overall gameplay.

												Risk of Rain touches a sort of sweet-spot for me. It's made with beautiful low-res pixel-art, it's a game of survival and exploration in a hostile environment, it's Sci-Fi and it is incredibly well thought out and written, despite having an intro sequence without any dialogue and characters with hardly any background save for their names and appearances.In Risk of Rain you start out with one character, the Commando, surviving a transport ship crash on a hostile world. Your tast is to find a teleporter, activate it and hold out while it charges, before finally moving on to the next area, and then the next, and the next. I'm sure there is an end to it, but Risk of Rain has a very steep difficulty curve, so I've only managed to get to the 4th level so far, running my play time for that session to 40 minutes or so.The faster you get to the exit, the easier the enemies you encounter, but on the other hand slowly exploring the world will yield more experience and better equipment, so there are at least two key play styles you can pick from: hard and fast or slow and steady.Throughout the game you will unlock items, each of which has a special description text written out for it, explaining where it came from and where it was going before it crashed on the planet. Additionally all of the monsters have written descriptions that will help you understand them, the world you are in as well as your own motivations beyond surviving.All in all, Risk of Rain is a well executed and truly addictive experience that provides short adrenaline-filled bursts of gameplay, that I cannot help but heartily recommend.Playtime: 10+ hours (ongoing)Ratings (1-10)Visual: 9Audio: 8Story: 10Gameplay: 9Overall: 9			"

You WILL die.Once you beat monsoon 3 times or so, you get a feeling that you're good at the game.Then you play again with the honor artifact and you die.Overall, I think Risk of Rain deserves more attention (It's not like theres 13,000+ reviews already) and is one of the greatest rouge-likes every created.

The gritty pixelated visual style conveys perfectly the sense of almost-overwhelming struggle as you grind your way through hordes of monsters to escape the planet. The music is epic, blood-pumping, and catchy, imbuing the player with a sense of awe and urgency. Unfortunately, the level generation features only a handful of different layouts per zone, which makes each playthrough feel very much like the last. Varied enemies and classes break up the monotony very well, but, like playing with different action figures in the same sandbox, one begins to tire of the surroundings. The zoomed-out field of view and slow player movement give combat a sense of grandiosity and scale, but after a few hours of play that can easily transform into frustration of pace. Most characters and achievements can be unlocked on ""Drizzle"" (easy) difficulty, which de-incentivizes playing on the harder difficulties. The types of items you find can also make or break a run, meaning that later levels are often either tedious (as you slowly chip away at enemy health) or boring (as you steamroll over them).  Risk of Rain is definitely a fun game, but for long-term enjoyment it stagnates as many small problems coagulate into a somewhat unrewarding experience. It is definitely recommended however, for its unique feel: the production is exemplary, with gameplay and atmosphere bound up seamlessly into one experiential package.			"

												Risk of Rain is an amazing game that never gets boring, as it's always bringing something new to the table in every single playthrough. The only problems i have with it are the multiple bugs that occur while playing on multiplayer, but other than that, pretty solid. Definitely worth every cent and more.			"

												Pixely roguelikelike with light platforming where you play a tiny dude collecting the scattered loot from their cargo ship and shooting their way off a hostile planet. Great looking pixelart style, fantastic music, controls are quick to grasp, every class plays completely differently, the game is generally hard as balls without being obnoxious or unfair, and you're going to love it when you reach the point of vomiting secondary damage effects and projectiles with every other shot.There's also a ukelele and the gunslinger dude wears a cowboy hat on top of his e-suit helmet.It's great both solo and in co-op, play it.

												Ok, so this is going to be a verly decent length review of Risk of Rain, I have about 60 hours in it. and I have beat the game countless times. So, lets begin. As a I will be writing ""RoR"" as a  anagram for Risk of Rain.Risk of Rain is a sidescrolling 2-D platformer with co-op the sub genre of rogue likes, This means that every playthrough while can seem similer they will be 90% of the time different, also rogue likes are know for their brutal difficuitly RoR is no exeption to this rule though this game has a unquie mechanic there is a timer in the top  right coner as the timer goes up the game gets harder tougher enemies spawn this creates a great risk and reward feeling ""Do I stay to get better items/level up or do I leave now with weaker enemies for the next level"". With a amazing soundtrack that I can only describe as electronic orchestra and a 8-bit grapics style  that is pretty to look at. Like I said before the game by all means is a platformer though it as a emphasis on combat. The game has eleven playable characters most of which you unlock by a varity of ways, each character has a unique playstyle from the others.  as a example the acrid is a creature that uses acid to attack by either leaving it on the ground or shooting it at enemies  to do a damage over time effects.  Like mention before the game is quite hard on the default difficulty, while fighting your way on a  planet you crash landed on you find items and and dodging and kill the inhabitants of said planet. While you're in any said level you collect gold to buy items at shops that give you effects like for example, the Guardian's Heart it gives a shield that recharges after not taking damage over a period of time, the ukulele which gives a chance to do Area of effect electric damage on your hits. As you move along the 2d map either if its climbing upwards or to just going left to right you need to find the teleporter to move onto the next level, once the teleporter is activated a boss spawns with a timer, the timer counts down till you can teleport to the next level though you can only teleport once the boss is dead, once dead it drops a item, Once time timer hits zero and teleport but it also stops enemies from spawning on that level so you can quickly go buy something and head back if you choose no worrys about dying. The game has 6 levels of said 6 level  there are 11 map themes though the maps are partly randomly generated. Once you beat the fifth level you get a choose, go to the final level or go back to the starting level (though harder bosses and enemies spawn now to keep it intersting) and keep grinding items.  The game has amazing replayability with over 100 items! and being quite challenging this combinded with having co-op as a option in the game just results in a blast! Plus the game is quite cheap with it being eleven dollers flat. It also does a great job of saying ""Game maker's engine can make good stuff as well guys!""I love this game, and enjoyed the time spent with it so much.  The game as amazing soundtrack solid gameplay that is satisflying/fun and a ton of replayabiltiy solo or multiplayer you're sure to have a blast. The game earns at least a 9/10.

												Wow, this is quite the little gem. A very, VERY hard little gem, though!Imagine Contra combined with Binding of Isaac and some Rogue Legacy and you'll have a basic gist of what this game is about.You start the game with just 1 class but as you do special events and just plain find the new classes hidden in the levels you'll unlock more. Each class has 4 unique abilites with different lengths on their cooldowns though most classes have 1 spammable ""basic"" attack with no cooldown.  Examples of some abilites are the Commando's Suppression Fire that has a 5 sec cooldown but blasts for huge dmg and stuns enemies and then there is the Engineer's Thermal Harpoons that fires 4 heating-seeking missiles for great damage! The classes really are cleverly designed and balanced and they offer a sometimes totally different play style.And then we have the loot.Oh yes, like Binding of Isaac there are many unlocks you can have fun getting plus just tons of items from the get-go. Items are crazy such as a shoulder mounted missile launcher, a cursed mask that turns killed enemies into ghosts that help you, at least 6 different kinds of drones that follow you and auto-attack enemies, magic mushrooms that sprout up and heal you super fast if you stand still for a few seconds, a tesla coil that chain zaps many enemies that get near you... I could go on and on.This game also has multiplayer co-op if thats your thing though you do have to fiddle with port forwarding or Himachi.All in all its a great lil game for only 10 bucks if you love action roguelikes/platformers!

There's a variety of levels and enemies, and an enourmous amount of items and unlockables (including a vast number of characters with very different playstyles), so it really feels like there's a lot to get out of this game, and a lot of replayability.It just generally feels well-built, and the soundtrack is exciting to match the pace of the rest of it.

												Warning, Sliiiight Spoilers.Risk of Rain?This is an amazing game, extremely worthy of purchase.When you first play, you are offered one character, the Commando. He has four skills, like you would see in a game like DoTA 2 or Awesomenauts.So you play as the Commando, die a few times, kill some bosses.Then, right as you think you get bored, bam.You reach the third level, and unlock a new character.Or you kill 3 bosses and unlock the Enforcer.Or maybe you even beat the game and unlock the Sniper.Then it gets really, really fun. You start exploring different characters, unlocking more items, and completing challenges.Bring a friend along locally, and the fun just gets funner. Play online, and the same happens.I have not gotten tired of this game after 24 hours. That doesn't happen often with me. 60% of games that have straight,  forward objectives get boring for me after a while.So really, all in all, Hopoo has done an amazing job.(Plus, Hopoo said PvP might be a thing in the future, so that makes it better.)TL;DR:The more you play, the funner it gets.11/10.

Kind of like Binding of Isaac, you might have some trouble with unfavorable starting items before you get better.As you kill stuff and get better at the game you unlock new items to randomly drop and new characters, so gameplay stays reasonably fresh.I got a little burnt out from playing it too much but every once in a while I can come back to it.This is all a lot more than I can say for most of my games.

												Risk of Rain touches a sort of sweet-spot for me. It's made with beautiful low-res pixel-art, it's a game of survival and exploration in a hostile environment, it's Sci-Fi and it is incredibly well thought out and written, despite having an intro sequence without any dialogue and characters with hardly any background save for their names and appearances.In Risk of Rain you start out with one character, the Commando, surviving a transport ship crash on a hostile world. Your tast is to find a teleporter, activate it and hold out while it charges, before finally moving on to the next area, and then the next, and the next. I'm sure there is an end to it, but Risk of Rain has a very steep difficulty curve, so I've only managed to get to the 4th level so far, running my play time for that session to 40 minutes or so.The faster you get to the exit, the easier the enemies you encounter, but on the other hand slowly exploring the world will yield more experience and better equipment, so there are at least two key play styles you can pick from: hard and fast or slow and steady.Throughout the game you will unlock items, each of which has a special description text written out for it, explaining where it came from and where it was going before it crashed on the planet. Additionally all of the monsters have written descriptions that will help you understand them, the world you are in as well as your own motivations beyond surviving.All in all, Risk of Rain is a well executed and truly addictive experience that provides short adrenaline-filled bursts of gameplay, that I cannot help but heartily recommend.Playtime: 10+ hours (ongoing)Ratings (1-10)Visual: 9Audio: 8Story: 10Gameplay: 9Overall: 9			"

												Risk of Rain is an incredibly fun and addictive game. It's a ridiculously fast paced action platformer where you can face dozens, if not hundreds, of enemies at once. Earn money by killing monsters and use it to open chests and shrines to obtain items to increase your damage and health or give you more abilities and skills. There are dozens of different monsters and even more items that make every game a unique experience. Single player is good but coop mode with friends is best. Ridiculous pixelated fun. Highly recommended!!!			"

The game features you, a survivor of a crash, exploring and taking on a planet of hostile monsters. Every time you think you are done with the game a new mechanic or item or charecter gets unlocked.

												First off, it's a roguelike - permanent death. Each play is a race against the constantly increasing difficulty timer, and whether you win or lose is heavily influenced by what the RNG decides to give you. Lots of characters and items to unlock via achievements, some easy, some stupid. If you want a game that rewards practice and learning, roguelikes are a good genre. And this is a GOOD Roguelike. It doesn't have many level layouts, so you can soon memorize them, but that works out well. Mostly the gameplay comes down to items, and the characters - each class plays differently, and this is a rare roguelike that plays well in multiplayer. I've been playing it quite a lot, and I really hope there can be more people playing this, that I can play with :D			"

												If you miss 90's platformers, Risk of Rain is all you need. It's extremelny difficult and unforgiving, but when you finally manage to finish it, the incredible feeling of satisfaction will repay you for all the anger you experienced before. And it only gets better after that. Playing with your friends makes it even better. You think that they will help you somehow? You're wrong. Their attempts of beating the game will turn out to be as pathetic as yours. The feeling that your buddies are as useless as you in the brutal world of Risk of Rain shouldn't really make you feel better, but somehow it does. And it's great.Risk of Rain is one of my favourite platformers ever. 10/10 "

												Sidescrolling SHMUP meets Roguelike. You're a member of a cargo spaceship which has crash-landed on a remote and forbidding planet. Your mission: Survive, and reach your crashed ship.

But finally there is a game out there that actually challenges you. What ever happened to these games! It seems like all producers ever do in games now is lead you through the whole game assisting you in so many ways when you don't even want to be assisted. Cheers to this game and its producers for taking a step in the right direction and coming up with a classic style game that should definitely be considered fun not just to people who have played games like this in the past but also to this generation of gamers. I said earlier that I got this game when it was around 75% off after playing this game I would definitely pay full price for it, I'd even pay double the amount of full price. So yes I'd definitely reccomend this game to all types of gamers out there new ones, old ones, fps players, moba players, rpg players, whatever it maybe! This game is just awesome and it gives you a taste of what games used to be like kind of back to the days of the metroid series or the zelda series or the mega man series, Whatever its a good game just buy it all ready why are you still reading this damn review the good part was over a while ago JUST BUY THE GAME ALREADY ITS WORTH MORE THAN THE 10 BUCKS.

												Risk of Rain is an utter joy to play for fans of roguelikes and tough-as-nails action-platformers. It's also a game that reveals itself to you in layers, forcing you to hone your skills with each attempt to navigate the game's six randomly generated levels.Don't be fooled by the charming lo-fi pixel graphics and soundtrack – you will be steamrolled by the game's punishing difficulty your first time out the gate. A little perseverence pays big dividends as you unlock more sci-fi-flavored characters and gear (and learn how to contend with the always-increasing difficulty timer). The inclusion of local and online multiplayer adds to RoR's replayability, making this a must-buy.			"

												It's still a tiny bit buggy, but for being developed by one person in their spare time, this game is phenomenal. It's easily worth twice what it's listed for. The music is great, the graphics are sharp and interesting, the gameplay is clean and tight, and it's deeper than the ocean. The game could survive on the strength of the first playable character, but each newly unlocked character adds a whole new dimension to the excellent co-op experience. Be prepared to be frustrated, be prepared to die unfairly, be prepared to make the wrong decision and end your run early, but most of all - be prepared to love this game to death.			"

												Definately my favorite rogue lite to date... At first you will die a lot, but after some time you'll get the hang of it, unlock further items and characters to play with. Characters are quite varied with many different special attacks and powers, some will definately fit your type of playstyle. This is were the game gets fun. You shoot / hack / crush / fry your way through endless counts of enemies, collecting items, growing stronger and stronger, which is even more enjoyable, when playing with some friends... Great concept, art style and especially outstanding soundtrack... I find myself listening to it every once in a while.Highly recommended! Great game for a ""quick"" run now and then, whereby ""quick"" can last you up to an hour.			"

												Risk of Rain has some interesting mechanics. One of them is hoarding many various items in order to survive, which seemed appealing and awesome to me.  And my oh my, was I right.You start as a stranded, fragile and little (in comparison with other monstrosities on this planet) human. On your first playthrough you will most likely die before 10 minutes pass. Actually, you will die a lot. But with each and every playthrough you'll get better and better, collect more items, learn monsters. Eventually you'll get a good run, and this where the fun begins. You can repay the deadly fauna, mowing it down in many fashions. You are the master now.I hope that made some sense, but it's hard for me to describe this feeling. You got to feel it for yourself.I've played many games, but this is one of the few that capture the feeling of satisfaction really good. I strongly recommend trying this game out.			"

												Really great game. Fast paced action roguelike semi-platformer. Challenges in the game unlock new items to drop and characters to play. Collectables can be found and activated to change the game experience making the game harder or easier, depending on which ones you choose.While there are three distinct overall difficulties, the game's primary mechanic is that the longer you play it, the harder it gets (to a point, but it's a pretty crazy point). Rushing through isn't good unless you know how to do it right, because you'll not get any items and will be too weak later down the road. Slowing down and grabbing every chest, however, will ramp up the difficulty and make the game harder too. The skill is to do both. Harder global difficulties make this in-game difficulty clock speed up, among other things.The game has six stages, ten levels, and at least twenty level varients. Each of the first four stages can be one of two unique levels. Each level has two or three varients, one of which will contain that level's unique collectable (every level has one) After beating stage five, you can keep looping through (levels and varients can change). The sixth stage is the final stretch to the end boss and the credits roll (but it ain't easy).In each stage, you must find the teleporter and start charging it up (90 seconds in the first two global difficulties, 120 on the third). During this time a boss will spawn, enemy spawn chances are increased, and enemies are more likely to be elites. After time is up, remaining enimies must be mopped up. You're then free to activate the teleporter and move on to the next stage.Each character (ten total) has a unique ability set, similar to LoL or DotA. The first always has no cooldown, the last has slightly longer cooldown. Enimies drop the cash you use to open chests which contain a random item. Most items are passive, and you can hold an infinite number of them (most of them stack, usually at a reduced effect). Like usual, whites are common, greens are uncommon, and reds are rare. Oranges are usable items, and you can only hold one at a time.Full support for up to four player co-op, local and online. You respawn at the start of the next stage. Some items apply to all people who proc them, not just the one holding it. Money is shared, no additional chests spawn, and experience is duplicated. Everyone gets XP and cash for every kill, no matter who does it.Complaints:No servers for this game exist, you'll need to port forward.Game speed is tied to framerate. This is not usually and issue, as it's not an intensive game. Only if you play for upwards of an hour in a single game (a really long time) will you start to see some issues, and only then if you're computer is lame.Game is very RNG, (it's a roguelike) so if that puts you off then this game (the whole genre, really) isn't for you.You'll probably need to use the wiki.

												Very addictive, vaguely resembling Rogue Legacy for its caracteristic improvement of the character, although here all boosts are lost when the game is over. Frentic and beautiful, with plenty of different classes with totally distinct abilities, which makes the game very replayable. It offers local multiplayer in the same PC or online multiplayer, altough I would strongly reccomend hamachi for a comfortable and quick setup.

When it gets to the final difficulty and you're heading into the final stage, you somehow feel both absurdly powerful and hopelessly outgunned against the enemies at the same time. I kept feeling like there was no possible way that the game was going to step itself up further, but it just kept throwing stuff at me.

												I would recommend to anyone whos likes a challenge and good things. Insanely fun and addicting. The soundtrack of this game is submersive and ominous, but the game gets really intense listening to your own music. Sound effects are retro but not annoying, you can almost feel the explosions hitting your enemies and the sounds of bullets hitting their flesh.I have never enjoyed the idea of perma-death but this game has opened up that genre to me, it does a great job of making you feel like ever playable charcter is different, and the speed at which the difficulty, as well as your own strength, on each playthrough provides for excellent fast-action that is really addicting. And on top of everything its online an local multiplayer!The atmosphere and small shreds of story we get from this game are excellent builing blocks for a game that question the human vs. nature relationship, this is built from assumptions incredibly sparce dialogue, and the tormented thoughts of a lone survivor adrift a hostile planet. While these intriguing elements of story and atmosphere are present, they are not so ""in-your-face,"" rather, appearing in monster and item descriptions, these small attention to detail is immersive, interesting and not at all distracting of the core game. A perfect balance of incredibly strong replay value, and a good incentive to keep playing to unlock this worlds story, which we end up caring a lot about.The graffics are very charming and pleasing to the eye. No matter what of the 10 characters you play, your are always a small  pile of about 30 pixels. Not to say that they were lazy at all, no. Rather, the simplicty and smallness of your charcter is great to look at and really makes your feel small in a world of things trying to kill you. The monsters are the same way, though they are larger than you(some very much so), they feel like true inhabitants of the world youve landed in. Bosses feel and look powerful and their deaths are satisfying. Graphically the world around you looks amazing, like the remnants of an ancient alien civilization. They really put you in concern with your characters need to survive.Overall, I give this game a 9/10. The reason not a perfect score is the only could use some tweaking. The difficulty, graphics, upgrades, items, collectables and secrets keep me coming back for more everytime I sit down to my computer. Never, have I put so many hours so quickly into a game that was inly $10. It was worth every cent twofold			"

I don't have much time played on it, but given the nature of the game and how there's so much to collect, I'll definitely be playing it for a while.Every item seems overpowered, but there's so many that you really can't stick to one overall play style every time you play, which adds to the fun because instead of the game adapting to your play style, you have to adapt your play style to what you're given.There's also a wide variety of enemies with many different levels of difficulty, and also overwhelm you at times, which add to the overall feel of the game by giving it a sense of urgency.To restate the thesis, I definitely recommend this, and it's worth the money spent.

												One of the best games I have played.The absolute best rogue-like game I have ever played.If you want:*A Fun challenge of progression for every death*A Ton of unlockable items to unlock*A Variety of 10 different classes (2 more arriving soon enough according to their website)*A fast-paced, action-filled and thrilling gameplay, of being afraid you will get destroyed within the next 5 seconds, which makes you focus even harder- and not to forget*An absolutely outstanding soundtrackthen I can only say that, Risk of Rain is a game for you!Oh... and I almost forgot about the artifacts that are hidden throughout the different maps, which just changes the gameplay to something entirely different, and opens up for so much more content!I have one bad thing to say... I want more content. This does not mean that the game does not actually contain a lot of stuff, because it does. I just can't get enough of it! It did take me some time to complete it 100%, including all achievements, so it's not because I haven't got the €9 of gameplay that I payed for. Because in my eyes, that's a freaking bargain!Anyways:Short version: For €9, this is a bargain. Much gameplay. Amazing game. I WANT MORE! 10/10 "

												Risk of Rain is a very good and challenging Roguelike game, both in the singleplayer and multiplayer modes.The game consists of finding your way trough many worlds(finding a ""teleporter"" in each one) and reach the mothership to leave the planet.PROs :-A lot of characters and different styles of play to work with.-Lots of different enemies.-Good number of bosses and different drops you get by them.-A LOT of items, which give you buffs and such, and they have different raritys.-A leveling system(You gain XP by killing enemies, and increase HP and all)-Nice-looking pixel graphics and some funny writings in the game.CONs :-The longevity of the game is pretty shallow, so the game gets repetitive quickly.Vote: 8/10I suggest you to buy it when it's on sale (~3€ for example) and to play it in co-op, It's lots of fun!Edit: I had written that there was a bug with the multiplayer of the game, but now it's fixed.

												Although the game is difficult when starting off and hosting an online game requires a little work, Risk of Rain is a very fun and rewarding experience. Be careful though, you might end up sinking more time into than you had previously thought as ""just another run"" could turn into imminent God-mode.

												A very fun randomly generated rogue-like side-scroller. The ten different characters each have a different set of attacks allowing for different play styles, from long range single target damage to melee crowd control. Different items augment your character in a variety of way, from healing with each hit, firing missiles on hitting an enemy or raining meteorites down when you use it. Artifacts also alter the way the game plays once unlocked, allowing for extra challenge. The goal of each level is simple, find the teleporter, activate it, hold out against the spawning enemies and boss/es and get to the next level until the finale. As time goes by the difficulty increases, meaning enemies get tougher and bosses will start spawning randomly, this forces you to balance between collecting items but risk increasing the difficulty or go as fast as you can while losing out on items and not being as powerful. Combat-wise the game is simple but is not easy, careful use and timing of your abilities is key to survivng against the alien hordes.The game has solo play, local co-op or online co-op (The online lacks UPnP and so requires port forwarding). This is a great game, and is better if you can play co-op.			"

												Risk of Rain has some interesting mechanics. One of them is hoarding many various items in order to survive, which seemed appealing and awesome to me.  And my oh my, was I right.You start as a stranded, fragile and little (in comparison with other monstrosities on this planet) human. On your first playthrough you will most likely die before 10 minutes pass. Actually, you will die a lot. But with each and every playthrough you'll get better and better, collect more items, learn monsters. Eventually you'll get a good run, and this where the fun begins. You can repay the deadly fauna, mowing it down in many fashions. You are the master now.I hope that made some sense, but it's hard for me to describe this feeling. You got to feel it for yourself.I've played many games, but this is one of the few that capture the feeling of satisfaction really good. I strongly recommend trying this game out.			"

												I think this game strongly appeals to oldskool gamers, especially those who enjoy a challenge. This game has amazing graphics and a supremely amazing soundtrack. Add to that, a very interesting dynamic of time vs difficulty and progression vs item pickups (Items are extremely awesome, game changing, full of variety and there are MANY) and you have a fun, surprising and intuitive game. Add to that a wide range of characters that gradually unlock and dramatically change gameplay. Then there's the online co-op where you mix and match all these items and characters to your hearts content, and you have a lot of laughs and good times ahead of you. I highly recommend this game, especially if you have someone else to play co-op with (and you are prepared to learn how to forward ports on your router). It's action packed, and full of variety.

												I would recommend to anyone whos likes a challenge and good things. Insanely fun and addicting. The soundtrack of this game is submersive and ominous, but the game gets really intense listening to your own music. Sound effects are retro but not annoying, you can almost feel the explosions hitting your enemies and the sounds of bullets hitting their flesh.I have never enjoyed the idea of perma-death but this game has opened up that genre to me, it does a great job of making you feel like ever playable charcter is different, and the speed at which the difficulty, as well as your own strength, on each playthrough provides for excellent fast-action that is really addicting. And on top of everything its online an local multiplayer!The atmosphere and small shreds of story we get from this game are excellent builing blocks for a game that question the human vs. nature relationship, this is built from assumptions incredibly sparce dialogue, and the tormented thoughts of a lone survivor adrift a hostile planet. While these intriguing elements of story and atmosphere are present, they are not so ""in-your-face,"" rather, appearing in monster and item descriptions, these small attention to detail is immersive, interesting and not at all distracting of the core game. A perfect balance of incredibly strong replay value, and a good incentive to keep playing to unlock this worlds story, which we end up caring a lot about.The graffics are very charming and pleasing to the eye. No matter what of the 10 characters you play, your are always a small  pile of about 30 pixels. Not to say that they were lazy at all, no. Rather, the simplicty and smallness of your charcter is great to look at and really makes your feel small in a world of things trying to kill you. The monsters are the same way, though they are larger than you(some very much so), they feel like true inhabitants of the world youve landed in. Bosses feel and look powerful and their deaths are satisfying. Graphically the world around you looks amazing, like the remnants of an ancient alien civilization. They really put you in concern with your characters need to survive.Overall, I give this game a 9/10. The reason not a perfect score is the only could use some tweaking. The difficulty, graphics, upgrades, items, collectables and secrets keep me coming back for more everytime I sit down to my computer. Never, have I put so many hours so quickly into a game that was inly $10. It was worth every cent twofold			"

												Risk of Rain is a fun, incredibly difficult rogue-like. It opens with you crash-landing on an alien planet and the goal is to survive long enough to get back to your ship. Along the way you will encounter mobs that get more difficult with time, and plenty of items. The items are worth mentioning because you unlock the bulk of them by completing challenges through the game, and they can really make or break a run. This is also a downside, as sometimes you get a bunch of healing items, but I've never played a game where I felt like I was doing enough damage, and by 45 minutes into the game weak enemies will have 2000 - 5000 hp, but you are still doing 100 - 200 points of damage. The randomness of the items does make it fun, and some runs you will get a ton of helpful/awesome items. I have yet to tire of this game, having played for nearly 100 hours. The art is fantasticly done, the music is good, and the classes feel different and varied enough. I only have 2 complaints: The aformentioned item snafu mentioned previously, (seriously, sometimes the items you get in the first stage are so useless that you'll have trouble making past the first boss) and the lack of full controller support. Having to use the mouse to select things, including my character isn't a make or break for me, but it is unfortunate. I never tried the multiplayer, so I don't know if it is good or not, but the single player is a lot of fun and pretty addictive, especially if you don't mind playing for an hour only to die and have to start over. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a challenge.			"

It's extremelny difficult and unforgiving, but when you finally manage to finish it, the incredible feeling of satisfaction will repay you for all the anger you experienced before. And it only gets better after that. Playing with your friends makes it even better. You think that they will help you somehow? You're wrong. Their attempts of beating the game will turn out to be as pathetic as yours. The feeling that your buddies are as useless as you in the brutal world of Risk of Rain shouldn't really make you feel better, but somehow it does. And it's great.Risk of Rain is one of my favourite platformers ever. 10/10 "

												SKIP TO THE BOTTOM FOR PROS AND CONS (*TL;DR)This game is one I picked up off my first ever paycheck (for writing) for me and 3 friends. I really only played it with 2 of them, as usually one of their games would crash about halfway through. We had a blast with it anyways. I have 43 hours logged, and about 35 of those are co-op. I've found this game to be a overlooked indie gem, and I like it a lot more than some more mainstream titles.GAMEPLAY:This is where the game really shines, and if you intend on buying this game, this will be the reason why. At the start of the game, you can only choose one class. Once you've chosen your class, you're thrown into a 2D platforming playing field. From there, you have to run, jump, climb, and shoot your way through a foreign planets inhabitants til you find a portal to the next level. Upon reaching the portal, you activate it, and have to fight a boss. This proscess goes on for as long as you want, but you can't fight the final boss til 'Level' 5. However, through gameplay, you can unlock more and more classes. I never felt like one class was more OP than another though, every class is only as OP as your skill level with said class is. This makes it easy to get into a rut with just one class, and play nothing but that class. I personally made it a point to beat the game as a different class almost every playthrough. Playing as multiple classes is incentivized by the fact that every class has a different ending (Resulting in a very minor dialogue change at the end). Multiple playthroughs are incentivized mainly by unlockables, but this falls short when you realize that all you're unlocking is things to help you with more playthroughs. It's kinda like Ouroborous, with the ""Logs"" being the only collectible that's really worth playing multiple times for.I, however, was determined to squeeze every last drop of fun I could from this game. So I probably beat the damn thing about 10 times (Not exagerating). It's a short game, about an hour and a half to beat on a short run, but it never took more than three hours to beat if we were having good luck. Multiple playthroughs are kept fresh by Artifacts, and  random generation, more on Artifacts later. The random generation doesn't mean that the levels are 100% random. There are about 2 - 4 different area variations per level, (Not counting the last stage) this means predesigned levels. But all the spawn loacations are randomly generated, forcing you to search every inch of the map sometimes. You learn the map layouts very quick this way. But one thing that helps out, are the Artifacts. Sometimes the map layout you get will have a puzzle in it, weather it's an agillity puzzle that requires quick movement, or just figuring out where a special hole is, they all lead to one place: Artifacts. Artifacts are certainly an intresting way to keep the game fresh, with each one augmenting the game in some way. They also all balance out. For example, one of the artifacts I used the most gave you +500% damage output, but you start the game at 10% of what your base health would otherwise be. Since I was pretty skilled, I basically just got a 500% damage amplifier. However, some of these relics do nothing for you til the end, which was pretty dissapointing. Such as making enemies explode on death, but the explosion only damages you. On top of that, the sheer ammount of explosions sometimes would cause my friends games to crash, and I think I had a few crashes because of it as well. The game is prone to fits of crashes every now and then, and it sucks. Especially in co-op where you come to rely on items your friends have that boost you. Another thing: In co-op, there's no way to rejoin a game you have left. There is no drop in/drop  out system, making for a pretty annoying experience when things crash. On top of that, if you die in co-op, there's no way to revive you until the next level. Since you lose all your gold (Which does convert to XP at the end of the level, so thankfully you level up with everyone else) at the end of the level, you wind up helpless for the onslaught that is to come. You're basically baggage if you die one time! There should have been a way to revive friends by spending your money, or to come back from the dead by forfeiting something. It's a tad bit punishing, and while this is a rougelike, this feature just doesn't translate well to co-op.STORY:This is where Logs come in. Occasionally, when you kill a monster, you will get it's Log. A Log is basically a short journal entry written by your character about the creature, accompanied by some nice artwork. The story is nice, I guess. I can't really say too much, because I wasn't compelled enough to go out and farm for all the logs. I've read about half of them, and they were okay I guess. They aren't really a masterpiece but at the same time, it's not ♥♥♥♥. Story isn't the focous here though, so I'm not upset about this in the slightest.GRAPHICS:I personally loved the graphics. It's exactly what it needs to be, and nothing more. Simplistic yet intricate pixel art that perfectly captures the feel the developers were going for. The graphics do exactly what they set out to do, and I like what they set out to do, so therefore I like the graphics of this game.SOUND:As with most roguelike soundtracks, it tends to get repettitive. The songs are very nice, and do fit the mood of this game, they just aren't my cup of tea I guess. After a playthrough or  two, I turned them off and listened to other soundtracks in the background. I turned them back on towards the end though, because I really couldn't find a soundtrack better suited for this game.PROS:-Good solid and enjoyable gameplay-The game stays fresh for quite awhile-The graphics are really nice-Enough collectible to keep the game running on fumes for awhileCONS:-After a few playthroughs, you're artificially padding your experience-The collectibles aren't worth much if you've already beat the game (Besides logs)-Frequent crashing in co-op-Co-op is just very buggy, but still playable-The game gets slightly mundane after awhile (Although that didn't stop me from playing 43 hours)NOTES:-I found a lot of enjoyment in this game, and had a good time with my friends-Story takes a back seat to gameplay[B+] - Worth the buy, I'd say a got a little more than my $9.99 USD for this, and it's well worth that pricetag. You get what you pay for, and a little tiny bit more.			"

												I quite like Risk of Rain. A pixelly, roguelike feel and visual makes it a nice arcade-ish game. But it's not the visuals of Duncan Drummond or Chris Christodoulou's rad soundtrack that makes me really like this game, even if I'm quite a fan of roguelike stuff, or that I like the eerie, electronic (or even sometimes rock) music, which really suits the situation. But its the character development. It really feels like you're going from 1 to 9999, so you get really OP, while the difficulty tries to match your power (until it claims that ""it can see you"", and ""it's coming for you"", and it even laughs at you). It can be slightly rage inducing if the difficulty has beaten me, but that makes this game better. Also, play with your friends, so you can have a little company (maybe even to yell at). IT IS buggy though, just wanted to point that out, plus in Linux, or Mac, you will get a lot of crashes (that you can fix by yourself, of course) Overall, the game itself is awesome, the soundtrack is great, and it has ridiculous difficulty, which is a good thing.

												This game is something that needs to be out on the market right now. It is another very challanging game where yes you will die a lot of times, but you will always just come back for more because the combat in the game is just so damn satisfying. You always restart the game because you have that mentality in your head of ""If I can just do this a bit faster before the game gets harder and have the right items, then I can actually do it!"", and long behold you die again and rinse and repeat. And while you get your ♥♥♥ kicked by this game you will enjoy satisfying, action packed combat along with an amazing soundtrack composed by Chris Christodoulou to go along with the game. And to top off all of this greatness you can even bring along some friends and get all of your asses kicked at the same time and have a great time.			"

												This is a stupendously addictive and strategic platformer shoot-em' up that is easy to jump into but hard to play purely out of its difficulty. It has a kind of difficulty that reminds you that any death you have is purely your fault without any kind of gimmicky artificial difficulty garbage to frustrate you. The game features tons of items/upgrades that assist you on each playthrough and several unique and likable classes that you unlock as you progress. In terms of the game's atmosphere, it feels eerie and action-packed with just the right level of retro arcade style vibes. All in all, I highly suggest you play this as it is perfectly built and fun every time you pick it up.			"

This game gets progressively harder as the timer counts on, giving a sense of urgency to quickly level up and collect items to better combat the waves of enemies, and bosses.What's that you say?!  Level up?  That's correct, the enemies drop experience and money; giving the game an RPG element to its action.You unlock different classes of characters, each with their own specialities and skills.  Also its co-op, and thus the only reason I'm posting this review, so I can get my lazy friends to buy this game, when they'll just be like ""OH, Cpt.Monte, I buy these games you reccomend, and we play it for two days, and never play it again""just buy the game, guys.

												Its been a while since I have made a recommendation, and for good reason.  I only make recommendations when I whole heartedly believe the game is not good, but truely spectacular in my mind.  This game encapsulates the rougelike genre and seemlessly moulds it together with a platformer.  It adds its own spice by introducing more powerups to find in your runs as you achieve different feats.  And if you are careful enough, you might spot some of the secrets that hide some of the characters and items.  Its only downfall is the lack of variety in the level set up as it is not truely random.  But the first 25 hours of this game, I have had the time of my life, and I look forward to playing more of it.  Hopefully they expand this game further to have more levels and more level variation and it will be perfect.			"

												Extreme bang for your buck here. Basically a roguelike platformer/action game with fiendish difficulty. You can unlock a bunch of different classes that fit your playstyle. While you play you can find tons of passive abilities that make you stronger but don't waste too much time looking for them! The longer you stay in a level the higher the difficulty gets. You have to decide whether you stay fighting a never ending wave of monsters just to get stronger, or defeat the boss as early as you can to get to the next level. There is permadeath but surprisingly enough it never gets frustrating, it is always just the right amount of challenging. You learn more about the game as you play and get better and farther every time. Not to mention the beautiful art and atmosphere. Seriously one of the funnest games I've ever played. Oh yeah and it has freaking co-op for christ's sake. The only problem I have is that sometimes way too many monsters spawn on a small platform and it makes it near impossible to manuever normally while trying to kill them.

												Fun but if you want a game where you can just watch rain destroy everything, this is not the game for you.			"

												Another pixelated rogue-like game that does not disappoint!   This game gets progressively harder as the timer counts on, giving a sense of urgency to quickly level up and collect items to better combat the waves of enemies, and bosses.What's that you say?!  Level up?  That's correct, the enemies drop experience and money; giving the game an RPG element to its action.You unlock different classes of characters, each with their own specialities and skills.  Also its co-op, and thus the only reason I'm posting this review, so I can get my lazy friends to buy this game, when they'll just be like ""OH, Cpt.Monte, I buy these games you reccomend, and we play it for two days, and never play it again""just buy the game, guys.

												This is a stupendously addictive and strategic platformer shoot-em' up that is easy to jump into but hard to play purely out of its difficulty. It has a kind of difficulty that reminds you that any death you have is purely your fault without any kind of gimmicky artificial difficulty garbage to frustrate you. The game features tons of items/upgrades that assist you on each playthrough and several unique and likable classes that you unlock as you progress. In terms of the game's atmosphere, it feels eerie and action-packed with just the right level of retro arcade style vibes. All in all, I highly suggest you play this as it is perfectly built and fun every time you pick it up.			"

												Ive actually played this game for a decent ammount of hours to the point i can say that it is actually an amazing game. Personally my love for gaming was slowly dying, as all gamess seemed to be clones of another and there wasnt really anything new and orignal out there. Untill i came across this game in a humble bundle sometime earlier in the year at first i didnt feel like giving it a go as the way it looks simple but im so glad i did!  Risk of Rain a brillinat rouge-like Side Scrolling Platformer.  it can be as indepth as you want it to. fo example it can be a neverending loop, where you figure out that youve done a 7 hour sitting after dying. But you can also beat the game in an hour if you wanted to. The items are crazy, the game it's self is beautiful i love the art style of everything and the music is truly captivating. I find myself getting lost in the game with the music playing. With trhe ability to play with up to 7 players online and coop it really is a great game to bash with mates, Also the actual story behind the game is like i said orignal and you will find yourself re-playing to complete challenges unlocking artifacts, characters, little hidden levels and easter eggs that devs put in for a laugh. it really is one of my faveorate game i could talk about it for hours but i wont... i do STRONGLY recommend this game even if you die within the first 5 mins you'll find yourself going back for more as i do. :)			"

												now have played Risk of rain for several hours, so why not write a review.First lets get the cons out of the way:EnemiesThe diversity of the enemies are almost non-existent, you have pew pew enemies and you have melee enemies.I would've liked a few more enemy typesLevelsThe levels get boring after a while, not much else to say about it.Pros:ElitesEvery enemy has a chance to spawn as an elite, they get various abilities that range from shooting a rocket to healing allies.BossesThey're awesomeMusicSoundtrack is one of the best ever made, every level has a different soundtrackCharactersEvery character plays completely differentlyLevels (pros)Everytime you go through the portal to proceed to the next level you get to play 1 of 2 levelsthis means almost every run is differentItemsEvery item is useful, this means you're never sad when you get an item(This also means that you can beat the final boss in every run)TimerThe timer is really what makes Risk of rain original.The concept is really simple, the longer you take the harder it getsThis means you can rush to the boss and maybe leave some items, or you can get all the items in a level. It really makes the game interesting.HordesWhen you find the portal in a level you need to stand your ground(survive) for 90 seconds against a boss + waves + waves + waves of enemies. You can easily be overwhelmed in the normal/hard difficulty. I really like the chaos and the intensity of these 90 second boss fights.If you like rogue-likes you will adore this gameThere is almost nothing to hate, and for the small price of 9 euros (cheaper in sales) this is a must have.I would rate this game a 9/10 however I think a dlc would make this game a 10/10.

												Almost perfect game. Multiplayer is broken though. Like...completely. You MIGHT fix it with Hamachi...but no matter what anyone says, for some people with certain hardware configurations its 1000% broken. And there's no real fix for it. And the maker of the game stopped giving a crap.			"
