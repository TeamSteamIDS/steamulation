												Take my starting ship and do battle with the Spanish Galleons. 8 cannons vs 40 cannons.First 10 minutes of the game and you have one of the biggest ships in the game, dance with the governor's daughter, own your own estate and declare war on the whole Spanish empire.A full game purely for the 'Pirate' genre. Not some half ♥♥♥♥♥ wannabe.If you're not happy with any ships, pick a fight with them. Not happy because a port merchant ripped you off during trading goods, bombard the port and take it over. Governor doesn't want to let you see his daughter, control the port and change the governor. Unsatisfied because a country sunk your ship? No problem there, wipe their country off the map by conquering all their ports.This is a game where skills can beat brute strenght. Wind, ship size, upgrades, tactics and rum is all that matters. Arrrrr!One of the best, if not THE best pirate games of all time.			"

												This is hands down, no lies or embellishments made, the best game I have ever played. Perhaps my experiences are colored by a long lifetime of loving this game, but I have never found something that interests me more, that I can just sit down and play a few hours of and craft a life-story for my character, an entire persona. It's simple really, you are a pirate and the wide open world of the 1600's Carribean is yours for the plucking. The graphics are out of date, the controls are simplistic, and your crew will always get upset no matter how many famous pirates and ships you sink, steal, or scuttle. You can't win, mainly because there is no victory condition. You can save your family, you can get married, you can become the deadliest and most notorious man on the high seas, it's all up to you what you do, who you become, which beach you get marooned on, I love it, I've lived years loving it, I can't recommend this game enough. It isn't for hardcore gamers, don't come in looking to get the highest score, play to relax, it'll work, you'll love it, just, just play the damn game.			"

												I guess this game just tickled me right because I loved everything about it. It would be most accurate to describe this game as a collection of mini-games combined into a single experience. There's the land battle mini-game, the ship-combat mini-game, the dancing mini-game, and the fencing mini-game, all connected together by a sailing overworld. I hear a lot of people like the fencing and ship battles but dislike the land-battles and dancing. I liked all of it. And I don't often play musical rhythm games, either.I'll admit also that playing the whole game has a certain amount of nostalgia appeal for me as well. I played the original in the form of a demo when I was a kid, never got the chance to play the whole thing. Thus closes a previously unfinished chapter of my childhood here.			"

												If you’re an older gamer, then you are more than likely familiar with Sid Meier’s Pirates. It was one of the first games to give you truly open-ended gameplay – you were free to sail under any flag, change allegiances, be a merchant or a pirate … the Caribbean was an open sea for you to explore. The gameplay was pretty straightforward, but it had an engaging quality to it that would cause you to lose yourself in the game for hours on end. Now the game has received a much overdue update and its basic design has withstood the test of time – the game is just as much fun as it ever was, if not more so.The premise of the game is simple: you’re a young buccaneer captain out to make your fortune on the Spanish Main. You’re also out to avenge the capture of you family and rescue them from indentured servitude, but it is really up to you whether or not you want to pursue their rescue. The game will rate your performance more highly if you do, but you can certainly simply concentrate on becoming a feared pirate and leave your family to fend for themselves. The game does not oblige you to do anything.Politics plays a large role in the game as it did in the Caribbean in the 17th Century. The four nations vying for dominance in the region constantly shift allegiances and move in and out of states of war. As an enterprising captain you need to take advantage of this and always be on the look out for new opportunities.The animations are detailed and you’ll see your sails react to the wind as you tack or come about, the wake kicked up by your ship, and even dolphins who come to play in that wake. While sailing the seas you’ll encounter other ships and as you approach you’ll see the flag of their nationality and the ship’s class. Battles on deck are abstracted to a sword dual between you and the enemy captain. You can select a rapier, long sword, or cutlass with which to fight, each of which is a trade off to some degree between speed and defense. You have three attack moves to choose from and a defensive move to counter each.The cities in the game are for far more than sacking. As you sail the Caribbean you’ll see the relative size of each city and be able to tell its relative wealth from the condition of the flag that flies above the town.When in town you have several locations that you can visit. Each town also has a shipwright who can repair your battle damage, buy your captured ships, or in some cases provide upgrades to your hull, sails, or cannons to aid your ship’s performance in battle. Speaking of treasure, it wouldn’t be a pirate game without buried treasure. At the lower difficulty levels maps are always complete and well-marked and it is simply a question of going to the right location and picking up your prize. At higher levels things get a bit trickier as you often have to make do with map fragments and must search for specific landmarks like an arched rock or a clump of dead trees to find the buried booty.Overall Pirates has that hard to pinpoint addictive quality to it that will keep you coming back. Hours will disappear as you strive to complete one more raid or get your next promotion. It’s a magical quality that’s missing in most games, and one that will keep you coming back to Pirates as other games come and go.			"

												This is the best Pirate RPG I've had the pleasure of playing, and it's amazing in how it fools you desperately. You have this sort of ""drive"" to get a VERY good ship. So naturally, ""Size Matters"" kick in. You take your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sloop, attack a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ galleas and voila you think! Your ship can now house 32 cannons with a 200 man crew (I believe.) So you take your Galleas, you name it something like ""Josephine"" and drive it around. You keep your sloop with you or discard it, perhaps even sell it and you feel like Captain Jack Freaking Sparrow. Then you go into a tavern and the lovely barmaid informs you that there's a War Frigate out to kill ya, so you capture that. You now have 50 cannons, possible 400 crew, cargo hold of 128 ton and feel invincible. Then you drive your ship around and feel like the King of the World. That's how it usually is, and seems to be how most people play this game. It's the wrong way. You start out, you take your Sloop and find a War Canoe. They can be found amongst the savage natives of the Caribbean. You board it with your sloop and acquire it. The next thing you do is to go into town and sell your cannons and your sloop. And everything that's not food. You wont be needing it. You have your War Canoe. You then go to the tavern and recruit the 48 people wanting to join you. Voila, full crew. And you have your War Canoe. The War Canoe is in fact the best ship in the entire game. ""But Sir, what about when the English deploy a Ship of the Line to take me out?"" You board it. They shoot at you? Well guess what, I hope your Mother taught you how to weave, for you'll be weaving your way around the cannonfire into the Ship. You board it at once the fight starts. If it's too much for you or you take a hit or two, you're in the fastest ship in the game. Turn around, sail away. Nothing can catch up to you. Oh no you wont have cannons, who needs it? Sugar, spice, goods? With your crew of 50 whatever you plunder from the ships in gold is way more than what you'd normally be due. You take your War Canoe, which you'll name something like ""Arrow"" or ""Emma"" and ram that thing into whatever comes your way. It's the best ship. Here's why:-You can bypass ship battles. This means more gold for you. And I personally found them tedious-Boarding is more manly-Your ship is the fastest in the game. Get a quest to escort a Governor from Mexico to Florida? Takes you 4 minutes. -Hunting some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that keeps your family hostage? Like hell he can outsail you.-Smaller Crew means fewer mouths to feed, and more gold for you when you divide the plunder.-With a big ship, you'll either shoot something dead while taking damage or see them board you without difficulty. Why be the prey? 10/10 game would make my own War Canoe.			"

												I played the original Sid Meier's Pirates! on Commodore 64 in 1985.  I broke many-a-joystick trying to sail against the wind.  Good times.  This game brought back all of those memories in a massive flood.  I thoroughly enjoyed plundering all sorts of ships, I like the land combat, and the storyline gave the game something to work towards rather than just a blast-and-hack pirate game.  The nostalgia effect was strong, and for die-hard, long-time gamers such as myself, this is a must-have.  Best three bucks I ever spent.			"

												If you ever get the chance to buy this game at a reasonable price, for instance in the recent humble bundle sale or gamefly.co.uk sale, DO IT! This game is my childhood so perhaps I'm biased, but for the 2,50€ I paid for this game it's a steal.Although relatively short, you'll finish it in around 15 hours if you don't waste too much time, Sid Meier's Pirates! includes a variety of era's to play (1600-20, 20-40, ... , 80-1700) each with a different twist to it. As you progress your difficulty will be ramped up slightly if you want to, however for people who want a real challenge I dare you to try out swashbuckler without losing a ship.Good aspects:-Replayable-Variety of Ships to take-Ability to conquer cities and create your own 'world'Negative aspects:-Repetitive mechanics (Dancing, Fencing, Naval warfare)-No 'endless' mode available			"

												This game is surprisingly fun as hell. It's easy to control, easy to pick up and understand what to do and where to go. The only iffy part is that the game is mostly controlled by the numpad keys, which is weird at first, but you get used to it as you go on.The only part of the game itself that's also awkward, is the dancing segments you have to do to woo a Govenor's daughter. I would say definantly pick this up if you're itching to play a good pirate game that's been hard to find, and/or you're whetting your appetite for when Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag comes out in a few days.Seriously, go grab this right now, it's cheap as hell and worth the $10 (or rather the $3 I paid).

												Beyond the nostalgia I feel for this game, it is genuinely an incredibly well made game for its time. Open world (ocean) exploration, controll over your fleet and what kind of ships are in it, as well as multiple quest lines and missions to do (become the most notorious pirate, get with a governors daughter, save your long lost family etc). The combat is easy to get the hang of (it's basically just timed events, but with combos) but if you pick a more difficult playing mode it legitimately can be excruciatingly dificult, so you can't get bored with it really as long as you keep yourself on a game difficulty that works for you. I deeply recommend this game, especially when it's on sale.			"

												TLDR: I really liked this game, and it really surprised me. So I bought this game on a whim when it was on sale, a dollar or so. Added it to my steam queue figuring maybe I'd play it when I had nothing better to do. Fast forward a year later and lo and behold, I had nothing better to do, so I booted it up on a whim. I figured it would be a monumental waste of time. This was half right, however not the half I was expecting. This game is somewhat repetitive, sure. But it is deeply satisfying, and it took me a while to figure out why. You can play all kinds of naval war simulators, or sword battle fighting games that are much better than the mechanics of this game. But this had a depth come out of these simple mechanics that made the game a really cool experience. Moreover, this game fairly effectively makes you want to pursue non-combative game play. I'd never given much thought into wanting to dance in a video game before, but it was probably the most fun I'd had in a game, and it wasn't just the novelty. It's easy to make yourself feel like your character has a vested romantic relationship with the woman he is wooing and want to succeed in impressing her with your awesome button pressing skills. It kind of made me want to learn how to dance in real life.Also, did I mention that you get to be a pirate?			"

												Timeless game. Lighthearted fun that is still challenging.Have been a favourite game of mine since young.Amazing how it can still remain so relevant in the gaming industry despite it's first release.Has a high replay value as the outcome when you retire your pirate tends to be different.Diplomacy plays a part in this game and isn't that hard to manipulate to your advantage.And theres even a dating sim element in the game.Hope that future generations of gamers will still find this as entertaining as it is now for meMy only wish for this game is for it to allow my pirate to pass down his legacy to his kid and allow the game to continue indefinitely, but then again all good things must come to an end ( or so they say).

												It's the best pirate game I've ever played. It's also one of the very few pirate games I've ever played, so I dunno if my review will count for much. Surprisingly addicting open-world pirate game where you can go out and do random stuff, like rescue your family from this villain, go treasure hunting, attack other ships and/or settlements, acquire goods from one port and selling it at another port (trading), and even wooing (and eventually marrying) a random daughter of a govenor. There's fun mini games (although lots of people hate the dancing one) and you basically play until you grow too old to continue pirating. Keep watch of the morale of your crew at sea or they may end up deserting you!Only bad thing I found with the game is that the main character whom you play as doesn't look manly enough for my liking, and while I like the dancing mini-games, it tends to go on for too long. If it was a shorter mini-game, it would've been much better.			"

Sid Meier's Pirates! is a pirate adventure game. After a mutiny that put you at the helm of your own ship, you and your pirate crew arrive in the Caribbean to find fortune as you seek to avenge your family from those that did it wrong.Pros: Every tropes you ever saw about pirates are there: build your reputation and ranking with the four European factions, while also dealing with the clergy, the natives and the pirate community, compete against the most notorious pirates in history while using pieces of maps to find their buried treasure or the lost cities of gold, do ship-to-ship combat against raider, merchant, military or other pirate vessels, flirt with the governor's daughters by impressing her in the ballroom. The game is easy to pick up regardless of difficulty level, navigating, ship-to-ship combat and swordplay are simple. 27 different type of ships sail the sea, any of which can be captured, each with different storage and crew capacity, optimal wind angle, speed and turning speed. Ship-specific upgrades are available at various ports, capturing ships might get get you permanent specialists for your crew, a variety of items can be purchased in taverns. The graphics are bright and colorful and animations are smooth.Cons: The graphics are showing their age. Sid Meier's Pirates! borders on the casual game, as it's basically a collection of multiple mini-games: fighting, dancing, ship-to-ship combat, swordplay, city sacking, all mini-games with little depth. City conquering strategy is extremely simplified, and the game lacks any realism of the hardships of being at sea. Capturing ships will become repetitive after a few playthrough. The map is always the same, varied only by the chosen timeline or occasional city conquest of a rival European faction.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youOverall, this is a fun game, and that's all it aims to be: fun. It isn't a seafaring simulator, it isn't an action sword-fighter, it isn't a trade simulator and definitively isn't a strategy game. If you're looking for a nice, easy and fun game worth its price, then I'll recommend you give Sid Meier's Pirates! a try!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

It's terribly addictive and fun.Sid, please give us an update to this almost perfect game!I'd like to see the map expanded a bit to include more opportunities in America, a few more mini-games and side missions, and maybe a game ending mission after you've played a perfect pirate and ready to retire. But don't change much; the gameplay is outstanding, the storyline is great, the attention to detail unmatched. Sid Meier's Pirates just might be the most entertaining game I've ever played.			"

The soundtrack is just unexplainably brilliant.The only thing that bothered me a little was the dialogues. It is just subtitles. No voice-acting at all.Voice-acting does not matter when you are playing a game with such wonderful gameplay.You can choose to follow the storyline of  finding your kidnapped family members  or play like I do, sail the high seas, sinking other ships, taking down notorious pirates and attacking settlements.This game is very nearly perfect and my favourite game of all-time.9.5/10			"

												Don't let the low (or non-existent) play time fool you. I sunk well over 200 hours on this game back when it first released and it's constantly on sale for 75% or more off on Steam, and it's already cheap to begin with.Unfortunately, there hasn't been a better pirate game in the past decade that can rival this, despite there being three (!!) Pirates of the Carribean movies released after Pirates! came out. Which baffles me to no end.The only complaints about the game I can give is that it gets pretty repetitive after a few play throughs and there's not much of a modding scene to make the game deeper or more varied.  In addition, the game can't be played at 1920x1080 resolution (the maximum being 1600x1200 4:3 resolution).Why Firaxis makes constant Civ sequels and not a sequel to this (or Gettysburg, or Alpha Centurai, or Sword of the Samurai or...or...or... you get the picture) is beyond me. I blame 2K Games			"

												One of my all time favourites - one of the only games I would rate 10 without hesitation for it is one of those few games where every playing moment is different - the sea of caribea feels alive and has always ships to plunge, resources to sell, towns to invade, hidden treasures to seek and even attractive governors' daughters to date with! These and numerous other quests await - Ya'harr!			"

If you have never played this game, do yourself the favor and play this game immediately.  Simple but fun with a dynamic world that you influence.

												WOW. Sid Meier's Pirates! A true classic, in almost every way imagineable. I've played a lot more of this way back when.Gameplay:+Lovely fun.+The free choice of the game is awesome. Be a ruthless pirate, a mercenary, a trader, a romantic, a dueller, or all of them.+Faction system and promotions are very well done.+There's a ♥♥♥♥♥on to do, and I never feel bored.+Different ships for different playstyles.+2nd game has advanced startup.+Pretty large map.+The perfect amount of water.+Get married, own land, dance, essentially Capitalism Simulator 1660. Sort of.+-The easiest difficulty has wind always facing west.+-Non-customizable character, besides from items purchased from travellers, and that's barely customization. Mods, though.+-Sneaking into town is average.-You can't destroy enemy strongholds by sea by spamming the Spacebar.9/10Story:+It's alright, something out of a 19th century novelist or Hollywood.+Your family was captured, and, in the course of the game, you must rescue them and  find the man who wronged your family and essentially harm him.+Lots of side quests.+-Voice acting is suiting, but doesn't hit the right cords often.+-The health mechanic is interesting, but ruins a good game when you retire not fufilling a lot.7/10Graphics:+For it's time, great.+It has surprisingly aged well, for a game made 11 years ago.+The water looks nice, even on Intel graphics cards.+Intel Graphic Card friendly.-Some land spots look a bit... Meh.8/10Music/Sound:+Kickass.+There's music to dancing, swordfighting, naval combat, trading, the tavern... A whole bunch. And it's well done.+Sound is alright, too.+-Hero's voice.-The govenors sound like they're the High-Class Extrodinare, while true, somewhat annoying.7/10Concensus: I give Pirates! an 8.5/10. A gaming classic, that has truly aged well. Pick it up if you havn't.DayZ Review Gimmick: I was a bad dancer. The govenor's daughter turned me down. She laughed. I laughed when I sacked her town and gave it to the English. 8.5/10chuburn			"

												BEST ABOUT IT:  The open ended nature, sailing around picking on ships that outclass you, and managing your fleet and supplies. WORST ABOUT IT:  The quicktime event dancing and fencing scenes are downright awful and the mere thought of them is usually enough to prevent me from playing this game.GAMEPLAY:  You start by choosing a country to side with and a small sloop in that chosen country's port.  You can get some info and supplies from that port and then you're off to sail around the Caribbian.  The ship controls feel fantastic, working with or against the wind, and there is strategy in what type of cannon shot you fire, round to damage a hull, chain to damage the sails, and grape to take out crew.  You also need to buy or raid supplies to keep your crew from a mutiny.CONTROLS:  Steering your ship and firing the cannons is very satisfying.  However the UI and map screens are clunky and seem like from an age prior to when this game was released.  The QTE cut scenes are obnoxious and repetitive but they can mostly be avoided altogether.STORY:  You play as a young pirate who is trying to rescue his family and defeat some marquis villain.  This is a sandbox game so you’ll be creating your own story for the most part.  There's no way to customise your character other than your name and some stat bonuses (1 perk at the start and others with items), but you can captain any ship you can get your hands on and deck it out with upgrades.GRAPHICS:  The main graphics look Caribbean and still mostly hold up today and are certainly functional, but the cut scenes look dated.  You have to use your imagination a bit.  The highest screen resolution is 1152 x 864 and no widescreen.  It looks ok though, and there are ways to force the resolution if you want.PERFORMANCE:  Ran smoothly for me and I didn't encounter any problems.SOUND:  Excellent.  The sounds of the waves, creaking of the wooden ships, and shouts of your crew are some of the first things that come to mind thinking of this game.  I’m not a fan of the Simlish spoken dialect though.  The music is fitting and sets the cartoony pirate mood well.REPLAYABILITY:  Replay doesn’t get any better than this game.  However I haven’t actually finished the story yet, it's just fun to sail around and do your own thing.SIMILAR TO:  I don’t know, the Sims 2 mixed with Grand Theft Auto 1 and Port Royale?RECOMMENDED PURCHASE PRICE:  I don't see this on sale often but $10 is reasonable.Sid Meier’s PiratesFiraxis Games 2004 (remake of 1987 original)RATING:  75/100			"

												I downloaded this game with the Sid Meiers humble bundle. I wasn't originially very excited for it, because I had only bought the bundle for the civ games but after playing this game for a few hours, I'm happy it was included. The game is a little confusing at first, but after playing for a little it becomes a bit easier to understand. However, I still have no idea what the main objective is besides the fact that you're a pirate looking to save his family (that much is clear from the intro). As far as I know you don't have to follow the main quests or any of that really, you can just plunder riches or charm governors daughter until retirement. After about 3.5 hours, I'm still not bored with the pirate life. I still haven't fully discovered all of the game, but the parts I have discovered are what makes this game addicting. I fully recommend this to anyone who enjoys strategy or even just pirates.			"

												Yo ho ho! +Pirates+Sea Battles+Sword Fights+Hot Chicks+Raid Towns+Buried Treasure-Dancing-Ugly ChicksA great game, a true classic. Even this version is quite old now, but I remember playing Pirates! Gold for many, many hours back in the day. This version is on par with the older ones. Some aspects, such as the swordfighting, were better in the other ones. Other aspects like the overworld view and sea battles I liked better in this version. No matter which version you try it's simply one of those games you must play. It does contain a plot, but much like Skyrim it's up to you whether you follow it or not. You can choose to chase after your lost family or simply sail around looking for booty. It offers a wide selection of ways to achieve greatness, which makes it great.			"

												Do NOT be fooled by my 12 hours of gameplay. I used to play this game endlessly after it came out. If you love games that are all about player choice, then this is absolutely for you. Want to be a swashbuckling badass and go about destroying the caribbean in a hellfire of cannonshot and steel? Want to be a simple trader, escaping your past and aiming to lead a simple life of commerce? Want to be a hero, save your family, get the girl, and slap about the hapless spaniards? Do it, do it, and do it.Naval battles, sword fights, dancing, stealth, trade...it's all here and you can do whatever the b***h you like. The game's aesthetic is less ""reality"" and more ""disney cartoon"" which makes the atmosphere of the game that much more delightful to partake in however you please.Super replayable, full of player choice and a delight to both look at and immerse yourself in; this game has aged incredibly well. I want to join the throng that cries for an HD remake but...this game is a masterpiece as it is. No need for a newer version. TL;DR Player choice, high replay value, excellent and varied gameplay.

												This is a fun, casual game.  It is not, by any means, deep, but it's still enjoyable to mess around with.  You play the game as a pirate in the Caribbean pre-Johnny Depp.  You can play the game during various historical settings which basically have the effect of changing how much variety there is in terms of the different national factions.  The later you set the game, the more likely you'll see major French, Dutch, and English ports.  By contrast, in the earlier settings, it's far more Spanish-dominated.  This can have an effect on how you play the game.  With more factions, you have more ability to behave like a true pirate, sinking or taking vessels of various factions, and then doing the same to whomever they're at war with (and they're always at war with someone...).  When it's just the Spanish, you have to try playing a minigame where you sneak into the Spanish port, risking imprisonment.  Speaking of the minigames, they're generally good fun, if occasionally repetitive and annoying.  The dancing in particular can get tedious, but at least you're usually well rewarded.  As I mentioned, the game isn't particularly deep.  It's not as if you're running a wooden ship simulator.  The game's graphics are dated, but acceptable.  They were fortunately done in a ""cartoony"" style, so they age a bit better than supposedly cutting-edge visuals from the same era (2004), which now fall squarely into ""uncanny valley"" territory.  Anyway, it's a good game, and usually available on Steam for dirt cheap.  You'll definitely get your $2-5 worth out of this title.			"

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: The story starts off with the protagonist (Your name goes here) as a little boy, and his family is abducted by corrupt noblemen. Then fast forward to being full grown on a ship off for adventure... Then becoming the captain of that ship.BAM!Cut scene's are over, you are now in control over what you do. Will you save your family? Will you pillage every ship you come across, will you rise in ranks with the different nations, will you hit on every Governor's daughter's (Did none of them have sons?)... the choices are up to you. Maybe you'll do all the things like I did, or maybe you'll only do one of them and retire from pirating.Controls:The whole game is controlled using number pad keys. You can use a mouse or  trackpad if you're playing on a laptop, but the game itself recommends you use your number pad keys.Gameplay: There's a lot of layers of complexity for Sid Meier's Pirates!. I actually had heard about the game while it was still rotting in my steam library waiting for the day I would actually download and play it.I actually had only heard good things about it, and after playing through, I can totally see why people praise this game so much!Lets cover what you'll probably spend most of your time doing in the game: raiding enemy boats, and dueling enemy captains. Once you set out on the high sea's, you'll notice the boat tends to move better depending on your direction and the direction the wind is blowing.If I didn't attack the enemy ship from above wind, normally they could escape me (unless I was attacking with a very small ship which could travel fast... but I did away with that strategy for reasons I'll explain in a few paragraphs)Again, mind you that the controls are with the number keys. so you turn your ship right and left with 4 and 6, you can change your sails with 8 and 2... and you can toggle between three weapons: 7, 1 and 3. lastly 9 changes your view, but I rarely found a reason to use it.While engaged in a duel you can choose between three attacks: 7, 4, 1. and Defending against the attacks: 8, 5, 2. and naturally you can taunt with 6. (if it sounds compliment, don't worry, it's really simple, 7 will do a ""chop"" attack, 4 is a thrust, 1 is a slash. 8 is a jump defense, 5 is a Parry, and 2 is a duck defense.As long as you start out on an easy difficulty the game will help you know when to defend and what to defend with... Actually I suggest you start out on an easy difficulty in general, until you learn the basics, you can always increase the difficulty whenever you destribute the spoils in a city.

My Sid Meier's Pirates! Story:I started out by sailing the SS Anne, I saved my Sister and plundered many a ship. The SS Anne, she was a small ship, the first ship I took over when I started the game. I saw no need to switch flag ships because I could just sail into enemy ships and take the fight to a duel between captians!This worked well for me until that fateful day... The day I met Captian Kidd on his Brig of War... I sailed directly into his ship and discovered quickly I had bitten off more then I could chew, but alas, it was far too late, I was locking blades with the Captian, but only with a crew of 20-30 so men to back me up... up against Kidd's 100-150 men.

You see, the reason having a big crew is important, is because as you lock blades with the enemy captain, both crews slowly tick down. If you cannot defeat the other captain fast enough you lose the dual, regardless of winning status.In summary, I lost the SS Anne that day and was stranded on a desert island and later picked up by another ship in my fleet....Later I was to come back and defeat Captain Kidd, and steal his ship. I renamed it to the SS Sucker Punch and beat the rest of the game with it. Saved the rest of the family, beat the ""boss"" evil NPC, Married and English girl from Kitts, and retired from pirating to become a Bishop. (actually I still have the save, so I could go plunder a bit more if I want a higher score and to retire as a Governor...Conclusion: I've only scratched the surface of the kind of crazy stuff on this game. Unfortunately it has a terrible case of the PlayStation2 face, and doesn't support 1920x1080 (there are probably mods which can help with that, if you look around). That's really all that I have to say negatively about the game.After upgrading my ship and getting all of the personal upgrades I was started to get bored with how easy my game had become, so next spoil distribution I kept going up in difficulties until I realized I had to chose the dueling sword, and could no longer dance with the beautiful girls because there were no helpful light up cue's in the bottom right of my screen...Basically what I'm saying is, if you think the game is too easy for you, increase the difficulty and it'll add MORE features, more strategy, and more complexity to keep you interested focused and getting more.

Sid Meier's Pirates: Exclamation Point is an action-adventure game released in 2004, as a reboot to the original 1987 game. The player character is a pirate on the hunt for his family members who were kidnapped by a Spanish nobleman. You choose a nation to align with, be it the English, Spanish, Dutch, or French, and set sail to save your family, alongside plundering and pillaging, of course.One thing this game can tout is the amount of freedom in your choices. You can go along with the main plotline, saving your family members, or you can simply be a pirate, plundering merchant ships and pillaging cities and villages. You can also choose to avoid combat, instead being a merchant and sailing from port to port, buying and selling various goods. If you decide that's not your speed, you can ally with a nation, build up a fleet, and set out to take ships and cities from enemy factions, with a simple turn-based strategy land-assault on the cities. All of this is inbetween the sword-fighting with arrogant captains of the guard, courting and eventually wedding daughters of the cities governers, and building up your ship and her crew.The individual gameplay elements are varied, if a little bit simple. Sword fighting, for instance, is a small minigame with high, middle, and low attacks and blocks, where you try and counter your opponent and push him back. Courting the daughters of governers comes down to showing up to give gifts, participate in different events, and go to ballroom dances, which consist of a simple rhythm game. Ship battles are the most fleshed out, with direct control over your ship, three different ammo types designed to take out cannons, crew, or the ship itself. The ship can be destroyed and salvaged for goods, and the crew can be killed and the ship captured, either through one of the ammo types, or boarding and fencing with the ship's captain.The pace of the gameplay can be a turn-off; it's very slow, with travel between certain cities taking months of in-game time. The story itself isn't very focused and is more of a set up for your adventures as a pirate, with the saving of family members only really contributing to a final ""point"" screen. This screen is a fun little screen to me, it shows beyond the pirating part of your character's life, giving you a sense of how they do with what they've gained during the adventure itself. If you've played Mount and Blade, you'll be reminded of the retirement screen. But apart from this screen, the decisions you make don't seem to have a lot of impact. Everything from marrying someone to saving a family member is solely rewarded with points towards the end, and a cutscene.ProsThis game couldn't have more freedom if you had a bald eagle on your shoulder instead of a parrot.Sheer gameplay varietyRetirement screen adds more replayability, especially if you're the kind to want the high-score in games.Good ship to ship combatConsSimplistic storyMinigames are pretty basic, if somewhat addicting at timesLack of impact from character actionsFinal Thoughts:It's one of my favorite adventure games, easily up there with the original Legend of Zelda. If you like pirates, ships, and the freedom to play however you want, this is easily worth the buy, but if you like an indepth and focused story, you'll have to look elsewhere.Rating: 8.5/10This review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.

												One of my favorite games of all time. I played this version of the game back when it came out in 2004 and have had nostalgic memories of it since.It's a simple enough formula, you control a ship, and can sink other ships to acquire currency resources, and more ships. You can engage enemy captains in duels, dance with governor's daughters in ports, and there's some simple mechanics revolving around turn based strategy and sneaking into enemy towns at night. There's actually quite a lot of nuance to this formula as well such as rare items you can collect to improve your abilities. Dangerous criminals to track down, treasure to find, and a decent buy low-sell high in-game economy.All of this you go through with the intent of building as much wealth and prestige for yourself as you can, because eventually, you will have to retire from your life of piracy, and when you do, you want to retire with the most land, the most titles, and the prettiest wife.The downside to the game would be it's relative simplicity I guess. Although that's also part of it's appeal. In addition, if you put in more hours than I did, you may start to find the game being quite repetitive. It's a game where you have to set your own goals, and rewards players for taking that initiative.			"

												Best pirate game out there. The game is a remake of classic ""Pirates!"" and it is worth the title. While at first I had my doubts due to cartoonish graphics the game quickly won me over. It is a charming and addictive. The game consists of mutiple minigames (sword-fighting, sneaking into a city, dancing, sieging towns.) All of them are enjoyable even though they are really simple (not necessery easy though.) Your main goal is to travel around the carribean gaining wealth and prestige by acting as a coursair for 4 countries fighting over carribean. Additionally, you have famous pirates to defeat, family to rescue from cruel Baron SomethingSomething, hidden treasure to uncover and hidden inca temples to find. All added at the end in a score based system when you decide (or a forced at certain age) to retire.It is a game I return for more every once in a while.The only real problem with the game is its focus on using numpad, which you probably don't have if you play on laptop. External numpad might work but in my case (wireless logitech) it did not. You can change the keys in the ini file, but it is a rough start as you probably won't know what to bind it to without playing the game first.Also I want a sequel. Firaxis! Get right on it.			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates may be the first game I ever completed to 100%, and it may be the only one where getting there didn't seem to be a chore. I genuinely wanted to continue boarding, privateering, plundering, pillaging, smuggling, fencing, collecting bounty, and just sailing around the Caribbean until my character got too old to manage a happy crew or hold a Rapier. I, personally, wanted to find Buried Treasure, Lost Cities, Lost Relatives, Infamous Pirates, Decked-Out Ships, and whatever trinkets or wenches were waiting for me at the next port's tavern, I didn't need a Quest Log to tell me where to go next.

Bought it again during a previous sale just to reminisce, and its just as good as it was back then.One of the classics of Sid Meier's earlier days, brought forward to 2005, as whimsical and as rewarding as it was back then as it is now, only hampered by lack of more modern-day support features like widescreen, stability on more modern OS's, etc.+ Colorful, light-hearted portrayal of the Golden Age of Piracy, with art direction that holds up to today, 2005-era warts and all.+ Still-unique controls (using the numpad keys) make it one of the more unusual yet easiest to approach and play games to date. You can play this entire game one-handed if you wish.+ A truly open seas adventure, with only the barest of poking about the overarching story involving revenge and skullduggery. Combine this freedom with solid sea battle mechanics, sword combat, and dancing to impress the local governor's daughter and you've got something unique every run.+ In classic Sid Meier's style, many options to set player difficulty, including the option to ""ante up"" at each ""dividing the loot"" point after ever expedition with a crew.+ Yar har fiddle de dee you are a pirate~!- 2005 warts and all. No widescreen support. Lack of modern OS support (with some display issues on Win7 machines). May want to play this in a window and set your expectations of graphical fidelity properly.- Bit of a conundrum if you do not own a keyboard with a numpad.- Some would argue that the seas battle mechanics are a bit shallow, the sword combat can be difficult to get into, and the dancing is nigh impossible.- In classic Sid Meier's style, game can be haphazard in difficulty gaps between the given difficulties. - Not a ninja. Or a wizard. In space.			"

												I just put 17 hours into this game straight in the last 2 days.  I had this game back in the day and picked up the remastered version like 10 years ago.  This ended up in my library a few days back and I had to play it again.  The nostalgia is strong in this one.  This is one I revisit from time to time and EVERY TIME I do I get sucked in like it's my first time playing it.  I have played and solved a lot of games (like, A LOT of games), but this one seems to be one I can revisit.  The vague maps, the different mini games, the overall joy of just being a pirate and blowing the hell out of ships is just as fun today as it was when I played it years ago.Pirates, it's been a blast.  See you in a few years when I dust you off again.  Don't change!			"

												I remember playing this on my old Xbox Original as a kid and loving the hell out of it. Now after playing it as an adult I can still say the same. However it's not without some pretty evident flaws.The graphics are dated but that's to be expected. This game came out in 1987. Some 15 from then it would be ported to the Xbox Original where it was still widely loved. And some 20 years later it would end up on Steam. Still critically acclaimed. If you've made a game that's obviously dated but still super fun and memorable, you officially made a perfect game.The combat does take a bit of reaction and timing however once you get the trick down you'll realise how basic it is. It's still made plenty fun however by the neat little details in the battle. Sometimes you can pick up stuff from the stage and smack the opponent with it. And some of the victory scenes after each battle are very satisfying to watch. You'll laugh when the opponent get's side-swiped by a box. It's not all good news however as I've noticed there is NO POINT to using any other weapon other than the rapier. The other to weapons don't matter in a battle that requires speed. Kind of a waste sadly.Travelling the world takes some amount of patience, planning ahead and a bit of luck. You need to plan your arrivals into certain ports to keep your supplies in stock, your ship healthy and your crew satisfied. And you also need to be careful about what ships your ready to battle and what factions you want to please. It's not all about ""Find the treasure, get rich, die happy."" You have objectives you could do to give yourself a much better retirement. You have to find your family who were kidnapped, you have to get married to a mayor's daughter, You have to get rich, you have to really please one of the factions cause they'll give you more land which you'll eventually use to build your mansion and retire and ofcourse you've got legendary pirates to beat to become the no.1 most infamous pirate. This may sound like way to much to handle but don't worry about it, this game does allow you to tackle these things one at a time.Overall the game is fantastic. It may not be graphically pleasing but honestly if that's what you care most about then your probably a treadmill hypocrite. And no one likes hypocrites. Despite it's shortcomings it's still a fantastic game and I truly hope it get's a sequel or even a remake one day.			"

												This is a classic example of Sid Meier's style:- Do ""X"".- Repeat to infinity.And it works.He's a genious at making repetitive mechanics feel super addictive. The ship battles, the progression, the exploration... it all works perfectly. I would improve the game by tweaking the sword fights, the port UI, and the dancing. But aside from that, spot on.			"

												An entertaining and highly addictive pirate simulator. You won't believe how much fun it is.Most of the game is played in a top-down mode where you control a ship that can travel between ports buying and selling goods and engage in naval combat with other ships. Wind speed and direction play a role, but you can generally travel into the wind without the need for tacking. Your ship has up to three weapons which target the enemy ship's hull, crew, and sails. There are about 10ish ship upgrades, which you can buy at specific ports. You can capture extra ships and build a fleet, but you only ever control the flagship and the remaining ships just add extra crew and cargo.The rest of the game consists of a number of minigames and dialog trees.- There is a sword fighting minigame that plays like a very basic fighting game. You mainly play this against enemy captains to capture their ships.- There is a dancing minigame where you must react to a sequence of quicktime events in order to win the hearts of maidens. This is not much fun and is the worst part of this otherwise excellent game.- There is a buried treasure minigame where you walk about on land looking for buried treasure.You need to divvy up your loot with your crew periodically, at which point you lose your fleet and most of your gold and crew. You'll advance via the items you acquire and your quest progression, but much of the rest of your possessions will come and go over the course of the game.There is a plot about rescuing your kidnapped family, but this isn't really a story-driven game. Most of the actual gameplay is about capturing ships and searching for treasure.Yaar!View my other reviews here "

												This game is great if you've ever wanted to sail around capturing ships, being promoted, and beating other famous pirates. The different ships are quite interesting, though I haven't yet found a giant grand frigate or anything yet, it is still quite captivating. The various quests add depth into the game, and you will find yourself dueling for the win, litterally!The only drawback to all of this that I have found is the wind. You may find yourself going quickly in one direction, and slowly in another, while your crew may be near starving, or you are badly in need of repairs, or you're out of crew members. Also, some of the fights that i've done are quite annoying, as the computer will block your strike, and counter several times in a row, effectively leading to a loss. Aside from that, this game is great, and captivating for anyone who enjoys the era of being able to plunder the royal navies, or capture ports for another country. Nice job devs!			"

												Have you ever wanted to set sail in the caribbean, but you can't afford a boat.Boom!This game.In all seriousness, I love this game, because it doesn't force you into a twenty minute tutorial on how to brush your teeth. You start up the game, click twice, and BOOM! You're out on the open water, sailing a ship around. It's a true adventure game. Sure, you have a goal (your family got kidnapped or something), but the game never forces you to do anything. If you want to spend your days shipping spices to Tortuga and wooing the governer's daughter, you can!10/10 an actual adventure.			"

												While I don't have many hours clocked on steam for this game, I played hundreds of hours of it a decade ago. I basically bought it in case I ever have kids, or run into people who for some friggin reason haven't played this jewel. Aspects of it haven't exactly aged well. It's incredibly male-centric, you can't play some rockin pirate queen and romance the mayors of towns or their sons - and that's a shame. The game could use some basic mod tools to open it up for a new generation - especially since a ground-up remake is unlikely. STILL - the gameplay itself is perfect. Each aspect of the game is deep enough to mesh with the other elements, and it gets surprisingly complex at the meta level. Watch a gameplay video on youtube, if it looks delightful to you - buy it - at any price. If it looks like something you wouldn't enjoy playing, give it a pass. Regardless I consider this to be THE definitive pirate game. (as of 2015)			"

												Might be one of the greatest games ever made. I enjoyed it immensely as a child and I enjoy still as an adult. The game play is simple and fun. You are a pirate sailing the Caribbean. You sail, sword fight, capture ships, woo maidens, and dig up buried treasure; all while trying to locate and save your long lost family. No two game plays are alike, and I've never encountered another pirate game quite like this one... Lord knows I tried.Because I am 6, my Pirate is the notorious captain Tite Hassole. Captain Hassole is a proud duke in the Spanish armada, until it suits him. He then raided the city Margarita about 3 times and turned it into the Dutch Port of Margarita, because reasons. Tite was also a bit of a player and while he would beat a hasty retreat from any plain governor’s daughter, at least 6 times, Tite Hassole gave all the crew's money away to get a ring for a lovely lady or two. A constant issue for me is the repetitiveness of the sword fighting, and to top it off I'm not that great at it. It becomes essential to know how to sword fight well, especially in the late game, but I never got over my ""smash slash really quick"" routine.All in all a solid game, well worth the money and real nostalgia trip for me.

												This game is actually the reason I passed the Carribean portion of my World Geography class in high school. I'm not joking. I sank a couple of hundred hours into this over a summer vacation, and I do not regret it by any means.Pirates! is the second game by Sid Meier that I played. I picked it up on a recommendation from a close friend after trying my hand at Colonization, and I feel as though I made an excellent choice with the $20 I spent on the game over a decade ago. I'd have gladly spent $20 again for this game on Steam, and the price point of only $10 is excellent.The minigames can be a bit repetative at times, and the game does not work well on netbooks. Those details aside, the game is certainly a good combination of strategy and RPG. Open worlds have always appealed to me, and this game is one of the first open-world games I played as a teenager. The quests are fairly simple, but they are still engaging and presented in such a way that a player can easily lose track of time. The graphics are quite good for a game originally released in 2004, and they've actually held up fairly well for over a decade. The soundtrack is fun and thematic, and the bright colors made--and still make--the room I play in feel like the early afternoon, even when I've played late into the middle of the night.I'll take this over Port Royale or Sea Dogs any day.

												Sid Meier's Pirates! (slight spoilers) - A boy lived in a nice home with his family. As they were eating dinner, an evil man stepped in to kidnap them all, but the boy got away. He survived for years on end to eventually enter a tavern to join a crew. He had the choice of joining one of four nations: the Dutch, the English, the Spanish, and the French. This is where the player takes over and joins. Joining a particular nation only affects your starting ship as you can easily switch your allegiance to another nation or fight for no nation at all. Of course if you stay with one nation and rise through the ranks by sinking enemy ships and helping them with tasks, you will get perks such as free upgrades and repairs. Not to mention, all of your faction's towns have a governor with a daughter. They range from plain, to attractive, to beautiful. Plain and attractive women are easy to romance while beautiful women take skill. Skill in what you say? Dancing. It's actually pretty tough and I've noted that some people have ways to cheat it. You get various rewards for completing dances and can eventually marry. On your ship you can board other ships and make their ship your flagship, sink their ship, or take it to sell or keep. There are some nice ships to get such as the prized ""Ship of the Line"" crewed by the English. To get it you have to make the English hate you by taking their ships and assaulting their towns. Don't forget to pick up crew at a tavern, you'll need a lot to take on those bigger ships! Town Assault works differently from the rest of the game as in you take your crew to assault a town. It's kind of like a chessboard but it works quite differently. Other than towns, there are also Missions, the religious kind where monks live. They help you make friends with factions that hate you, and grow towns that you want to grow. There are also other types of settlements such as small faction towns, pirate havens. and indian villages. Other features include a top ten list of pirates, that you can kill and get good loot from their ship, as well as renown. You can also take their secret treasure by buying their maps. Remember your wife? She can give you a different map as well, a map to a secret city which will give you a literal ton of gold. The MAIN point of the game though is to rescue your whole family, so don't forget! I've enjoyed this game a lot though, so I'd give it a 7.75/10.   TLDR - It's a good game, buy it.			"

												So, I originally bought this game on sale during one of steams sales. I must say, I am very impressed by the game in a lot of different ways. Being from 2004, the game has aged well, and being a pirate on revenge in this game is still as fun from when I played on the Xbox years ago. I will go over pro's and con's of the game now:Pros:-Different countries involved in the game (English, Dutch, Spanish, and French).-Other famous pirates from history are in the game (Such as Blackbeard, Henry Morgan, Captain Kidd, etc).-Sea ship battles! (Why would this not be in a pirate game?)-Sword fighting!-Different quests (such as finding family members, finding lost cities, treasure hunting, etc).-And so many other pro's!Cons:-Daughter beauty rating (the game rates the governor's daughters off of their beauty. In my opinion, they should not be rated at all).-Crew unhappiness (this is tough to deal with in harder difficulties).-Dividing plunder (you shouldn't have to divide plunder several times throughout the game; I believe it should be a one time thing).-Getting to the city of Gran Granada (you should have to walk to get to this city. It should be accessible by water).As an overall, this game is a really great game and I highly recommend anyone who enjoys open world games and pirates to try out this game. "

												A joy to play. The main plotline is long and tedious, which is why you ignore it and go muster an armada to beat up the French. That's what being a pirate is all about!Pirates! is an experience, but don't go in with high expectations. Gameplay is a series of minigames, which are fun but ultimately shallow.

												Very good, this game combines the aging elements from fable and lets you be a pirate! The controls can be strange but otherwise it is very good, the quests are vast and will keep you going for a long time. Just make sure to get the men that kidnapped your family other wise you get a ♥♥♥♥ ending.			"

												If there was ever a game that needed another reboot, it's this one! The game is a fantastic trip down memory lane, but after a decade, Pirates! shows its age. A combination of losing my adolescent imagination and technological advancements means that the game doesn't feel anywhere near as immersive as I once remember it feeling. 12 year old me could play this game for hours on end and feel like a Pirate on the Spanish Main - 24 year old me can only take a few hours before I find myself bored.The truth is though, the ambitious Pirates! never was immersive. The game is fun, but the charm and novelty wear off far sooner than they should. Within just a couple of hours, you'll have likely done everything the game really has to offer aside from finishing the main storyline of finding your missing family members and eliminating the other pirates. For the price, you cannot go wrong. However, the game doesn't have enough diversity in its mechanics, is not at all challenging and simply doesn't offer enough to keep you interested for dozens of hours like other Sid Meier games do.

												This game has a very special place in my heart. I grew up playing the NES version for hours and hours, and I imagine I'll be playing this version in much the same way. While this 'new' version is well over ten years old it's still such a wonderful and exciting game that only a pirate game of the highest caliber would be able to take it's position as Admiral of the fleet.What makes this such an incredible game is the sandbox aspect of it. The player can really pursue just about any path that pleases them. Would you like to honor your selected nation by protecting its cities from invasion, boosting its economy by plundering other nations trade goods, and making the seas a place feared for anyone that doesn't fly your flag? You can. Would you like to cast all allegiance aside and plunder the nations of their gold and goods? Go to it. Want to become a master dancer, have a wife in each corner of the map, and become the Romeo of the high seas? Your ship awaits. If you want to create a massive fleet of warships and attack towns you can do that as well. Sid Meier's Pirates is truly one of the most incredible sandbox experiences available, incredibly replayable, fun, fast, engaging, and the best pirate game available. Highest recommendations for anyone that enjoys this period of history, pirates, nautical adventures, and ballroom dancing.			"

												Sid's Meier's Pirates! Has a place in my heart as being one of the first few games I have ever played on my old college laptop, I remember playing this game and having so much trouble getting it to run on a laptop (which doesn't have a keypad, everything was done with a mouse or scroller pad)Anyway about the game, what can I say, it's a simple and linear game, but that's what makes it so likable I suppose, it's a game where your quest is set out for you early on, and you decide how long you want to take to pursue those quests. However there is a time limit as you age in this game (yes you age)I have to say by today's standards, it's quite linear but for a game of it's age, I must say it certainly stood the test of time, and if you have some extra cash leftover, pick it up, simple clean fun that's just good for a casual gaming experience.I'd recommend it for sure, but only if you'd like to try something casual for a change. 6/10			"

												Very fun and addicting game, enjoyable way to pass an evening! I've played all the versions of Sid Meier's Pirates since the very first one and it is STILL one of my all-time favorite pc games. Not too easy or too hard for anyone with so many different levels of play to pick. There are also many ways to play the game, trading, privateering or full blown pirate. A lot of action gaming with some rpg thrown in along with a bit of simple war game strategy too. There really is nothing not to like, just go ahead and get the game you won't regret it!			"

												Brilliant pirate game, especially on a laptop on a slow day. Nice and simple.Well, I say simple. There are a number of mini-games and mechanics that you simply have to figure out yourself, but it is quite a simple little game. Less than a gig. The cartoonish art style holds up well and doesn't look any worse when you're forced to turn off Shadows to get your frames back. I've had a few hard crashes, and alt+tabbing out causes a runtime error, but the autosave is brilliant so it's not much of a frustration.Though, the base controls require either a numpad or professional level mouse response on an on-screen interface. I found a way to rebind some controls after a couple hours hunting through forumns across the interwebs, but it's not brilliant.So it's not perfect. But I'm having a blast with it and if you're even bothering to read reviews then you will too. I'd advise waiting for a sale, it's pretty bare-bones for any more than $10.			"

												You take the leading role of a Pirate Captain in the 17th century Caribbean. Get fortune and fame in an attempt to seize your rightful place as one of the most revered pirate in history. Test your skills as a sea captain exploring the high seas and exotic ports in a richly detailed 3D world like for game from 2004. Overtake the enemy and seize valuable booty. Engage in plank shattering broadsides in naval battles, and in duels with opposing captains. As your reputation and skills grow, so will the size and quality of your crew, and your ability to take on larger enemy ships, raid and plunder heavily fortified ports, and locate treasures. There's a whole cast of interesting and dangerous characters to meet, mysteries to solve, exotic island to discover, and powerful alliances to forge. Like with good old England or maybe Spain, even Dutch or French. It's your free will what you do.Game is old (before Steam) so yeah, good old times when games like this were marvelous.			"

												Even over a decade later, the remake of Sid Meier's Pirates! is still arguably the best pirate game around. Most of the main mechanics of the game have been copied over the years as flash games and freemium mobile games, but the 3D graphics and minigames in this version make it worth a few bucks if you like that sort of game. I wouldn't pay full price for it, but at $2.50 it's a good pickup and you're sure to get a couple of hours of fun out of it.Just as a side note, this game really wants you to use a numpad. It literally BEGS you to do so. I have been playing without, and while a little clunkier it isn't awful. The game has an onscreen numpad that you can click on to achieve the same effect. However, the game does turn on NumLock without telling you, and since my laptop keyboard doesn't have a NumLock button, I was very confused when my ""p"" key started typing ""*"". I had to pull up the onscreen keyboard to turn it off. Again, not a big deal, just be aware that this happens.			"

												Got this game when it originally came out on a disk, and then repurchased it here on steam, it's a neat and fun little game that can draw you in. Even if there isn't a great big storyline like a great big RPG, there is enough to keep you looking at this massive world that it's created, and most of the time, even if you have the strongest of ships, you'll still be able to find a challenge now and then, and there is always a buried treasure hidden around the corner. High replay value, and really good mechanics.7.5/10			"

												This game was my childhood. Although I have barely played on steam, I have spent hundreds of hours of my life in this.the game is easily one of the best pirate games around, except for maybe AC Black Flag. even getting it was a mission because it's not sold in my country. But I found a random dude in another country to buy it on my behalf. Good guy +rep.You embark on a personal mission to rescue you family from evil villain.Find the minion, find the map, find family member get more maps.Eventually you get all the map pieces and rush the fort.The sea battles are entertaining.the fencing and swordplay are fun.But the ballroom dancing, that is intense, especially on harder difficulties.It's also one of the few games to have aging as a mechanic for you but no-one else.You have a finite amount of time to win the game.Start as a teenager and when you are 70 or so, the dude who kidnapped your family, is still the same age and reallly hard to beat.Sail around, listen to cheerful piraty songs, dig up treasure and defeat famous pirates in laughably easy duels, depending on your difficulty.There are loads of different ships to capture and add to your fleet.And stingy methods to avoid paying your crew. (one of my favourite is to get most of them killed so that their share is really high and they don't get upset.)And when they mutiny agaisnt you, stealing your other ship and heading to port.There shall be no survivors.

												Short review: BUY IT! Heaps of fun, and lots of hours of gameplay. (my play time is under-represented as I own the DVD version). Long review:Sid Meier's Pirates brings a classic game to a new generation. I remember when the original game came out, and spent many, many hours sailing the high seas - generally ending up not much higher than a pauper in the original score board at the end. Make money pirating, loot towns, rescue your family - all while under commission from the Dutch, English, French or Spanish, becoming a Duke for all 4 nationalities if you pick your targets right.This remake has a few changes from the original that in my opinion improve the gameplay, though that view is not shared by everyone.The new dance feature adds challenge to wooing the governers daughters. The previous a simple dialog choice of polite conversation, flirting or marriage offers was replaced with a complex dance scene, which increases in difficulty based on skill level and attractiveness of the woman in question. If you have any musical background, this is not too challenging as all dance moves are 8 bar sequences so you don't need to look for every hand gesture once you learn them. Those who dislike this feature however will find it a huge obstruction to gameplay, as many special items, maps, and information can be obtained this way. While you can get everything elsewhere, it takes much longer.Open-world nature of the game means endless replayability - side with different nationalities, declare piracy on everyone, play in different eras when towns are hugely fortified or not - each choice effects the overall difficulty and your final wealth and happiness. Very addictive.Recommended :) "

												Normally I'm not big on remakes, be it movies, games, or anything else. However this is one remake that comes damn close to living up to the legend of the original. I used to spend hours playing this game on the venerable Commodore 64, then on the Amiga, and again on the old 486..First up, I will confess that I prefer the original, especially the Amiga and PC versions, but I still enjoy having a lash at this now and then. I actually bought this game when it was released, but the disc has since succumbed to bit rot, so when I saw this on sale the other day I had to buy it.The addition of extra subgames adds to the fun and there are many other small improvements such as being able to battle multiple ships at a time. The audio and the visuals suit the game well and the addition of cut scenes enhance the games charm.While it may be nostalgia that draws me to this game, I still heartily recomend it. I also recomend that people try out Pirates! Gold Plus (comes with the original 1987 game and the early 90's remake) so they can get a taste of what made the game such a classic, and why Sid Meier has long been considered a legend.4/5			"

												So I was bored the other day and thought I might try one of the old classic piracy games.  Port Royale has always been buggy (tbh I don't even know if it will work in Win 10 - I'll worry about that later) so I decided to fire up Pirates, forgetting that I had bought the remake and not the original 90's version that I used to play longer ago than I care to admit.Imagine my surprise when I'm seeing 3D graphics rtather than still images!  Detailed maps instead of pixellated blocks of green and blue!  A Jolly Roger that actually looks like a skull and crossbones!I was almost disappointed...  Until I started looting the Spanish Main and became the second most feared pirate in the Carribean.  Curse you Blackbeard, I'll have you yet!			"

												I saw this game and after a sale I picked it up.

There is so much to do and so many ways to play - it offers a ton of replayability.  It has all the ship combat, treasure hunting, town raiding, dark alley sneaking, and ugly daughter avoiding thrills I remember and they are just as fun as ever!A very easy to learn and use interface lets you get right into it and start buckling all the swashes you can handle!  I really can't recommend the game enough, especially if it is on sale (for $2.50 USD at the time of this review).  In terms of a game you can play for a few minutes when you're bored or spend a day with those swashes we just talked about, you can count on Sid Meiers Pirates! being there for you! "

												I guess your age shows when you actually remember the original Pirates game and the countless hours spent navigating the Caribian. First time i played the ""updated"" version i must admit it did not catch me as the original did - but it has grown on me - and the simplicity and straight forward gameplay refreshing. The only down side to this version compared to the original is that it seem to be to easy to just hang around one corner of the map/caribian and still get most of what you need - so unless you have the urge to get to all areas, then it is to easy to get caught just repeating the same area. But all in all - several hours of low cos tentertainment!			"

												I haven't played nearly as much of this as it claims. But with this game I found out why. It carries on as a running process after you quit out. so if anyone ever reads this and I have some silly number of hours playing this game it's because I forgot to kill the process in task manager after I exited the game. (Windows 10 Pro - this happened to me, it might not happen to you) Do I recommend the game, yes I do. Get it in a sale, it's old, but it's fun. However if your keyboard doesn't have a number pad it will make life more difficult.  "

												Sid Meier's Pirates is just a classic and a real treat for nostalgic gamer.You like the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" Movies or the TV serie ""Black Sails"", than this is your game.On a simple basis and good enough graphics you get to be captain of your own ship (later fleet) and cruise through the caribbean sea, getting as many coins and fame as possible.Through ship battles, sword fight and land assault you advance in ranks and fame. In taverns you get your crew, informations and sometimes maps and other gears. Charming the governor's daughter in the bigger ports is fun as well and chasing after famous pirates and take their gold just a sweet satisfaction.IMPORTANT:There are some issues with the program/software - like crashes or/and graphical problems - but through the great community there are ways to get it rolling. In my first attempt it didn't work (Windows 10) and I refunded the game, but got it again and after a short try and the help of the community and internet I got it to work.The game is just a blast and as good as the first pirates game (not ""Sid Meier's Pirates"", just ""Pirates"") I played in 2002.I can really only recommend it and wish you a great journey - Arrgh!

												This game is awesome in almost every aspect. The ship mechanics, including the speed of wind and speed based on what type of ship your using. I have spent maybe 12 hours ignoring the main quest and just pillaging gold and plunder of the spanish main. Im not saying that the main quest is bad, but its pretty repetitive most of the time like ""Defeat this guy, then this guy will give you a map to your family and do it all over again"". It is a lot of fun but the strong point IS NOT the main quest. I definitely play it for plundering ships, raiding towns, defeating historic pirate figures such as blackbeard, and finding lost treasures. I sometimes find bugs where even though the wind is fast the ship that the sails are in perfectly good condition still go extremely slow. The fun pirating system, plunderin, and raiding alike I overall rate this an 8/10 if the main quest were not that repetitive i wouldve rated it like a 9/10. "

												I honestly didn't think much of it even after seeing gameplay and the trailers and such, but I had like $3 to spare and the sale was on and I was like hey, there are so few pirate games I might as well own this one too.Man, that was the best decision I made during that sale. This is probably the best pirate game there is right now, and yes I've played ♥♥♥ Creed's Black Flag (And adored it) This game may be a bit old but it's aged like a fine wine. I thought it was just sailing around and raiding ships, but there's so much more. Tavern brawls, winning the hearts of governor's daughters, fighting historical pirates: It's even got frickin' stealth missions when you try to enter a town that belongs to a nation that doesn't much like you. There's even this mini RTT like mode when you raid a town which I enjoyed a lot more than I was expecting to. Worth it at $10, an absolute steal at $2.50 on a sale day.			"

												As other remakes of Sid Meier classics, like Railroads f.x., this game is a graphic rework with some new features and an attempt to get rid of tiresome features. Basic concept for these re-launches of old Sid Meier games seem to be ""look hard, play easy"", since it from time to time tend to lose its challenge. Compared to other games, I say this one is on the lower end as a remake, since too much has been basically ""dumbed down"", as for ship combat as one example. Alot of things is improved though, as the boarding combat, and some new implementations are present as well, as the possibility to win your loves heart by dancing with her at a ball. Graphics wise it's a huge improvement compared to the earlier version though, of course. All in all, as a time waste it's good enough, and there's some enjoyment in following up on the main quest of tracking down the evil spaniard Marquis Vatevahisnameis. For those who liked the original Pirates! I recommend this game.			"

												The greatest game of all time, no question. I've bought it 6 times over a span of 10 years, and I've never regretted purchasing it. This is a game I can keep coming back to year after year, even when my adventure ends and I stop playing I'll pick the game up in a year after I've forgotten about it and I'll relive the joy of sailing around the Caribbean plundering mountains of gold and winning the hearts of lovers. The game has some amazing features that were pretty much unseen in the early-mid 2000s, whenever you get hit your health gets damaged so the game rewards the player for playing well. The higher dififculties offer a real challenge and the game progressively gets harder as you age. Ships and civilizations trade and go to war without you intefering. Entire cities can change and the game will always be different each time you play. You can play the entire game as a merchant, trading goods from city to city or you can be a pirate that sinks any ship that passes by. You can work as a privateer and assist pirates and indians to demolish the cities of your enemies. The game hits the pirate atmosphere perfectly and the music assembles in a near perfect way to provide a casual enviroment that still makes you feel like a mighty pirate. The graphics hold up suprisingly well and even though they look cartoony they're still pleasant to look at and don't get tiring.Even though the game looks simple and casual at surface level, the mechanics go very deep. There are several hidden ships that are amazing if handled correctly (Indian War Canoe) and there are several ships which are nigh impossible to get (Ship of The Line). Pirates have certain mathematical calculations that determine their wealth and were they will be. It is possible to corner Baron Raymondo by watching his behaivor and seeing where he will go, famouse pirates also plunder cities and sink other pirates by themselves. Hint: Take out Vera Cruz and the other cities in Mexico, Raymondo and Montalban will only sail toward spanish cities.			"

From sinking ships aboard your boat, ransacking cities and charming govenor's daughters; there's adventure around every corner.

												Sid Meier's Pirates is a classic remake of a classic. The games legacy often speaks for itself, and while some aspects havent aged well, you are hard pressed to find a better pirate game on the market. Mostly because there are so damn few.The game is a bit bare in the gameplay and features department, even for 2004, it will get very repetetive very fast, and odds are you will see every minigame by hour 3.The minigames also have very few variations, dancing practically has none other than slightly different moves depending on nationality of the dancers, and around 6 swordfighting scenes, you will see each about a dozen+ times. I find them visually enjoyable, but in terms of gameplay they are just frustrating, the fencing in particular often feels like the enemy is reading your inputs, and the timing for defending/counter attacking is split second, early on you can just spam attacks and it will absolutely float you, but then you get old and slow, and having never learned to properly fight results in a lot of save scumming for certain fights.You have to forgive some flaws due to its age, and being a remake of a 1980's PC game forgives the lack of content, but it does have some flaws that are annoying even by 2004 standards.Travel speed is my biggest gripe, the game is time based, your character ages, and after a certain point you are forced into retirement (theres ways to keep going forever, but its not really ""intended"") and if you have to travel east...you just get to watch yourself get older just trying to traverse a small portion of the map. The wind is always blowing west, and unless you can take good advantage of it when it leans north or south, traveling east can be a snails pace, even with speed upgrades.My other big gripe: you cant remap keys, at all. I despise the control setup, particularly use of the numpad and mouse in gameplay, I hate having my hands so close together. Its a PC game, no reason it shouldnt have customizable controls.The game had some performance issues, particularly a flickering I experienced early on, though that can just be a result of old software running on modern hardware, nothing that made it unplayable however.The game also has one thing going great for it: charm. The art style, animations, its fun, cartoony, and gets you in the mood for swashbuckling.Sid Meiers Pirates, even today, is the second best pirate game I have ever played. (The first being Assassins Creed 4, if not just because its more modern, has more to do, and has damn good combat) Its still worth a playthough, even if its a bit old.			"

												I have to say, when I began playing, I found this game incredibly easy. But then I realized I had set it to easy. When played on at least ""adventurer"" level, this game can be quite challenging. When I want to just play something fun and not too mentally taxing, I play this game. When I want to play a pirate game, I play this game. When my computer won't give me good enough graphics to play a game from this century, I play this game.			"

												Although a bit different from the '90s original, this game is still so much more fun than a lot of the newer games that are out today. This remake is just as addicting as the original, and it's very easy to spend 4+ hours in a single session. From land and sea battles to politics and trade, Pirates! has something for everyone.			"

												Fun Game for all agesTips- Take all loot & ships you captureOnce in a town; ignore highest prices for goodssell cheapest food, goods & guns to move more freight from your hold; try to sell as much as possible;remember; typically; don't carry any more than 2-3monthsfood for your crew; as you will pick up tons more each time you take a new ship...After selling as freight (clean the merchant out wheneveryou can) next go to ship repair; repair all ships; alwayssell the smaller &/or least upgraded ships first. Upgrade any you don't sell; if the merchant offers upgrades; later whenyou sell them; you make it back; also; if something happens & you lose your main ship; you don't have to fall back to square1 with a ship that has no upgrades....Small well uupgraded ships are faster when attacking on the Seas Larger Upgraded ships are slower; but they are able tocarry more of everything; guns loot, pirates; when you capture a famous Pirate or Villian's ship;  these are bestoutfitted; some with up to 40 guns & already outfittedwith triple hammocks (carry's larger crew)...Unless you feel obligated by pride of  ancestry to chooseSpain as your national alingment; always choose another loyalty; it doesn't really matter much; you can attack ALLships if you do it right; however; there the game spawns more Spanish ships than any of the others; so there is an advantage to choosing an enemy that supplies you with plenty of targets.....

												The game is super addictive. First, you play it for the plot and fighting which is reaaallly amusing for quite a long time but at some point it gets repetitive because the quest remains the same in every playthrough. In spite of that, it's not the ""play it 5 times and then get bored"" type of game. That's mainly because not only can you do the quest but also you can engage in politics and economy which is also interesting because some of the locations are not fixed in the game; every time you play it they spawn in a different place. Another plus is that graphics as well as music are very pleasant. I'd greatly recommend it as a game that helps you relax after a busy day.			"

They provide a mix of things to do that keep each individual element fresh.The game play customizations give it a heads up on the competition.  True you play in the Caribbean, but you can play at different times for different groups of nations.  It also can be rather punshing on higher levels.			"

												This is a great game. Take on the evil Spanish, greedy Dutch, slimy French, or perfidious English for fame and fortune. The progression system is truly great. Your life is split up into voyages the dength depending on how fast you can accumulate gold and how much crew you have. After each voyage you split the loot and get to increase or stay at the same difficulty, at higher difficulty you get to keep a larger share. You also get slower as you age which increases difficulty in some aspects of the game.The attention to detail is also substantial. Every faction has their own feel to them and they send out ships of their own with special missions that affect which nations are at war, the wealth and size of towns, their defence and even their allegiance. You can intercept or guard these ships to affect wether or not their mission will be successful.It also feels that there is nothing missing, and I was surprised at how many different things you could do. You could just trade, or you could fight a war, and everything in between. Sink ships or capture them, loot towns in land battles and install a governor of your liking, woo ladies in every town and even marry, search for treasure, lost cities, captured family members and love interests. There are lots of different ships with different stats, pick which suits your style best or keep a fleet so you have many options. Upgrade your ships and buy rare items to boost your own stats. Even the sailing is a mini game in itself as you try to make use of storms and wind to get where you want faster. As I said there's so much to do but nothing is hidden in some obscure corner that requires reading a manual to experience.My personal best thing with this game is that there are never any ""fetch quests"" so common in other rpg's, instead you are totally free to do whatever you like. Once you have captured a criminal there's never that annoying unnessecary return trip to turn him in. Raising your military rank is done by simply helping your nation in any way you want. You don't need to talk to someone first, just declare what you have done to any governor and he'll promote you accordingly.There are a couple negatives though. No ship can sail very well against the wind this means the game can slow down from its otherwise fast paced tempo. This is also not very realistic as some of the ships in the game sailed better than this. The tretirement occupation you get is also kind of breaking the immersion as even though you are a duke with thousands of acres of land and plenty of money you may get something like farmer or innkeeper just because you didn't get revenge, found all family members or got married. Otherwise a flawless game.IRemember how civilization has the mantra ""just one more turn"" this game although not turn based gives you the same feeling: There's always just one more thing you need to do before you can save and continue later.

												It's difficult to beat a classic, isn't it?In Sid Meier's Pirates, you play as an unnamed man who seeks vengence for his wrongfully captured family. In doing so you get the chance to captain a ship in the golden age of piracy and plunder and pillage to your heart's content! That is, if you don't care for every nation sending their best to hunt you down. But let's face it, you only need to worry about that on the higher difficulties.Most of the game is spent sailing your ship between ports, and doing whatever you feel like doing in the process, whether that be pillaging traders, hunting pirates, obtaining proffesional and eventually noble ranks with one of four nations (or all of them if that's how you swing), trading (stolen) goods, finding treasure or romancing the governor's daughter. It's all there and ready for you to sink your teeth into.Some of the more exciting features include ship-to-ship combat, swordplay, dancing at the ball, besieging cities and of course spelunking. Although the naval combat is the most prolific of these, you'll likely also find a lot of enjoyment in besting the finest pirates ever to sail in swordplay and then digging up their buried treasures just to spit at their watery graves.As far as story goes, it's alright. The backstory gives you just enough to set out after the villain (whose name I shan't attempt to spell out for the sake of my sanity) and try to rescue your remaining family. Finding your family is like a treasure hunt in itself, only with a different kind of reward at the end.All in all, this is probably one of the best games I've ever played, regardless of genre. I might be slightly biased, since I used to own a physical copy of this game before Steam even existed, and played it so much that it eventually was scratched beyond salvation. Still it's a testament to its entertainment value that anyone would play it that much. And now I've got it on my computer once again...Well, reality is overrated anyway. So long everybody! :D			"

												Ahoy, matey! The objective of this game is to become the most notorious pirate in the Caribbean. Together with your band of pirates you will explore the Carribean, ransacking towns, wooing the mayor's daughters, fighting notorious pirates, and attacking ships for their gold, food, and luxuries as you work your way up the pirate ranks. This game REALLY provides a strong pirate experience.I didn't enjoy Sid Meier's Civilization games because even though I liked the macro management of the civilization anytime I would order units to perform an action, I wanted to be there in the action and not just watch a sim play out. I really love games that give you a macro management but let's you take part in the lower level actions. Because of this I was skeptical that I would like this game. But I can assure you, this game is NOT like that. This definitely feels more like an adventure game with a sim as a backdrop and several mini-games thrown into the mix. The game is completely nonlinear and really doesn't have an ending as you can keep playing as long as you like. The story is weak so don't expect a strong narrative. One annoyance I had initially with the game was that there are no keybindings setup and you can't set them up in the game, so you have to manually edit the game's configuration file to the keys you want, but once that's done I found combat and dancing much easier. I highly recommend using keys for the sword fighting and dancing. Pros:+ Nonlinear gameplay+ Strong pirate theme+ Good musicCons:- No key bindings settings in-game.I highly recommend buying this game. It's worth every penny even at regular price.			"

												8/10An oldie but a goodie.Easy to play but deceptively hard to master, this, in my mind, is the definitive pirate game.Not a very complicated game but highly addictive and very re-playable.The eldest child of a wealthy and prominent family from the Old World, you were celebrating with the rest of your extended family when, in the dead of night, the festivities were interrupted by a powerful and corrupt Spanish Baron. Bashing down the door, the Baron and his men storm into your family estate and, for reasons as yet unknown, takes your family hostage. You, as a child, are able to hide from the vile Baron and only you escape with your freedom. Growing-up on your own without your wealthy family's resources at your disposal, you learned to sail, swordfight, and have a natural ability to lead. But you've never forgotten the Baron or your family, still his captives. One day, though, you hear a rumor that the Baron has set sail for the New World and taken his vast fleet with him. Hoping your lost family is traveling with the fleet, you go to a local tavern and sign-up with one of the Carribbean's four super-powers.This is where the game begins. You create your character, define his name, set his profession, and choose a European nation to sign-up with. They each have their strengths and weaknesses and each will give you a different ship to start the game with. Your faction choice is not a PERMANENT one; you can change your loyalties as often as you like or even openly pirate everyone if you want.-England, whose small but well-equiped fleet has secured a number of well defended ports. Their fleet is smaller than Spain's but is the most flexible in the game; able to do everything adequately but nothing exceptionally.-France, whose strategic, but scattered, hold on the Carribbean leaves them in control of some of the most lucretive ports. Their hold on the Carribbean is tenuous when you arrive and they are threatened on all sides. With your help, though, France can grow into a power to rival Spain. Their ships are, generally, more formidable than England's but less flexible.-Holland, the smallest yet wealthiest Carribbean power. They have few cities but they are all extremely wealthy and give you access to some of the rarest goods, items and upgrades in the game. They, generally, have the weakest warships in the game and could be regarded as the hardest faction to start with but their cargo ships can hold immense ammounts of plunder and, if you're willing to invest lots of cash into upgrades, they can be turned into surprisingly formidable pirate vessels. If left alone, Holland will usually be ousted from the Carribbean fairly quickly because they hold so few ports to start with but, if you support them, the Dutch are very VERY good friends to have. If you're nice to the Dutch, they will give you the tools you need to turn nearly any ship in the game into a formidable warship capable of challenging even Spanish Galleons.-Spain, the dominant power in the Carribbean. They have more ports than England and France combined, the largest fleet and the wealthiest treasure ships. The Spanish are merciless to their enemies but can also be powerful allies. The slowest to trust, the Spanish are usually your primary target for piracy being that you'll encounter their ships pretty much anywhere on the map. At the start of the game, the Spanish will absolutely dominate all the other powers but, over time, they will become the targets of multiple wars and will slowly diminish. Eventually, near the end-game, Spain's military power will be a joke and, though they'll retain control of many cities, they will pose very little threat to the other nations by then. (Note: siding with Spain does NOT lock you out of the main storyline of pursuing the corrupt Baron as it is revealed that the Baron has gone rogue).Buy this game! It's cheap, it's fun, it's easy to play. Some of the game mechanics are contrived and get tiresome after a while (the ballroom dancing and the fencing, for instance) but the grand-strategy of the thing is worth sinking time and effort into. From managing crew morale to knowing when to divide the plunder, when to take down rival pirates and when to fight make deals and when to break them, this is a deceptively nuanced game. Beware, though! Your character is NOT immortal. The longer you play, the older he will get. If you're careful not to get arrested or marooned too often and buy medicine from taverns from time to time, you can extend your life but, eventually, you will grow old. Though it takes a while, your character will eventually enter fourties and you'll start noticing his reflexes dulling. When you enter your late fifties, you will become too old to continue your pirate career and retire from piracy. You have a limited time to accomplish as many great deeds as you can (gain promotions, mass wealth, marry a beautiful governor's daughter, rescue your family members, dig-up burried treasure, etc) so you don't have much time to rest on your laurels! Simple and fun. Just play it!			"

												Oh, joy! ""YOR MATAL!"" your pirates cheer after you capture a ship, whatever the hell that means (bless Sid Meier and his knack for inventing cutsey and timeless phonetic languages for all of his games) and your fist pumps and the gold flows. This is Pirates!, this is fun.You are Ingonito, young survivor of dastardly deeds and seeker of vengeance on the rum scented waves of the Caribbean. Your sloop, Revenge, is nimble and reasonably well gunned, and your pockets are light, your crew hungry for trouble. You have been to a town to recieve a letter of Marque from the Spaniards, the British, Dutch or French (did I miss anyone?) and now you course across the great blue expanse in search of bountious adventure.What ho! Dread Pirate Roberts has just issued from a port hidden amongst some jungled sand bars and he's telling you to watch out? Have at him!Launch flurries of cannonballs, but make sure you don't get stuck in dead air! Wheel around to dodge his projectiles while you try to maneuver your guns into position to hit his hulk - will you go for the ship's hull with cannoballs, go the masts with nunchuck-like chain-shot, or try to thin out his crew with grapeshot across the decks? No matter, this is all the prelude to the real combat - man-to-man combat with the dread captain himself on the heaving deck of his ship! Dodge blows, rain blows down upon thine enemy, chuck billhooks and drive him under a hail of swipes before eventually seeing him crash down - bloodlessly, of course - into the waves.YOR MATAL!!!!!Freaking awesome game. Lightweight, well made, endless fun, even the rinse-and-repeat gameplay doesn't get terribly old because of all the things you can do in towns, all the treature maps you can piece together, all the optional difficulty-boosts you can submit yourself to upon completion of certain waypoint objectives. Just a great, great game. And a great port, too.			"

												I first played Sid Meier's Pirates! on an IBM PC/25 with floppy disks (two of them, one for DOS and one for the game) with a greyscale monitor. I loved the premise, the fighting, the wooing and the general pirate behavior. It is all here, actually a couple of graphics versions are available depending on your taste. The overall story is that you were separated from your family at a young age by an evil Baron (is there really any other kind?) You take to a life of piracy and sail the Carribbean in search of loot, fame, your family, and the Baron (who is still evil). You can set your skill set to improve one skill, I strongly suggest fighting as you do a lot of it.  You can choose your nationality as Spanish (pretty easy as they sort of ruled the roost during the bulk of the time period), French, English (my choice as they start at a huge disadvantage port wise but they were at war with everyone so there are plenty of targets out there) or Dutch (also a good choice for a more difficult playthrough).  You get your letters of marque and off you go with a small ship and crew. Help your nation (or not), gain wealth and add to your fleet by taking ships (and crew). Visit ports and meet up with folks who can help or sell you map pieces to treasure or family members. Cuddle up with a barmaid or two or if you are lucky, a Govenor's daughter and find out about the goings on at port. Eventually, you will gain enough experience and learn the location of the Baron. Be prepared for a tough fight but if you prevail, you can retire with a high rank and lots of wealth.The game has several nice mechanics, your fighting skills drop with age and you may need more medicine to keep going. You also have to keep your crew happy and if you aren't getting loot on a regular basis, you may find yourself out of a job and out of luck. You can focus your efforts on your family or ignore them completely and still finish the game. The replay ability is fantastic as every game is different with lots of random elements (storms, ships you site, etc) so no two playthroughs will be the same. Your choice of nations and time period really do set different tones. You also choose how loyal you are (do you follow the Govenor's request, do you return criminals for trial, do you not attack the French when they are your ally?). By the way, the answer to the last is a resounding no.			"

Most specifically, it plays like an early version of Assassins Creed: Black Flag.Giant world to explore both in your ship and on foot. burried treasures to find, named pirates with unique ships to hunt down, open sea battles that transition into swashbuckeling boarding fights.It is almost unplayable without an intergrated numberpad though.

												I've been playing Sid Meier games since I was in college in 1992. Civilization served as my best time sink ever since. I didn't know Sid Meier's Pirates! existed until I saw it recently on Steam. I didn't think the idea for this game would work and figured that it was something I was wasting 2 bucks on. I was extremely wrong. The game is really fun, often goofy and still able to keep me playing when I should be doing things like sleeping or talking to my wife :p			"

												This game is pretty cool I don't have too much to add to what others have said. However, whilst it is fun, remember this is a 10 year + old PC game. So the interface is kind of all over the place and the controls are based around using the NUM PAD. If you are the sort of person who is very much set into the more catch all modern control schemes of games then I'd think about it before you buy it.			"

Rating: 8/10As a huge Sid Meier fan what isn't there to love about this game? The quirkiness of the game adds a environment of fun for all ages. Pros:	- Fast Pace Sailing- Stright Foward Barter System- Different countries to start from- More or less a choose your own adventure feel.- Ship combat is stright foward and addictive. - The cost of the game is $10- Great feelings of blowing up merchant and tax collecting ships.Cons:	- The game may get borning depending on the time you wish to spend on the game.- There is no tutorial unless you bump down the difficultly for tips during your play through.-  The game does loose its charm after playing for a few weeks.Conclusion:If you're a fan of Sid Meier and love Pirates then this game is a must have!

												First, I can't recommend this game any more, it's honestly really awesome! In search for some great pirate games (and sadly, there aren't many) I remembered this fun remake, which I personally never played the time it came out, but I remembered reading about. So my opinion is not based on nostalgia. It's no complex simulation, no it's a fun little game you  can always start over again because you have total freedom what to do and when. 2 - 3 days you might have finished one career with a playtrough, but I find myself starting over and over again a new careers, because there are so many different options, time settings and different styles to choose from. I really like the style of firaxis games, x-com is also a remake from firaxis in this style, and it's awesome. They also have this distinctive look and graphics which age very well, I think besides a low resulution compared to modern games, it still looks very good! So, sail a realistic big carribbean map, do what you want, do the main quest or don't and then start over again. For a really fun and perhaps casual game (in a good way!) it's still the best pirate game out there. A remake of this remake would be awesome. ;)			"

												Do you like pirates? Yes? Well then we have the game for ye matey!General: Sid Meier's Pirates!(I will refer to it as SMP! from now on) is a... pirate RPG... I guess? You take command of a young pirate and sail through the Caribbean in a strategy-ish POV. Your goal is to rescue your family from the clutches of gang of evil spanish dudes without dying. Now dear reader you will say well of course you shouldn't die that is quite obvious. Well it is not, in SMP! you only have a limited time to plunder until you are too old for the sea. That means be quick and find as many unique items that will prolong your life as possible.Visuals: SMP! looks due to it's sunny style and perspective quite good even for todays standarts.Audio: The sounds are not always synced with what is happening but are not bad enough for you to generally notice.Open World: The World feels incredibly alive as the differnet nations go to war, cities change their owner and missions are not as static as in other games.Gameplay: In SMP! you there are 2 kinds of missions, the ones that are directly tied to the story and side missions. Both however sometimes randomly collide as the Baron that kidnapped your family has also kidnapped your fiance.  Long story short: everything that you see in the world is something you ""can do"" and all of those activities are worth it, the Seas have tough spots and it all feels very alive. (Almost) Nothing that has to be triggered the old-fashioned way in a wacky sunny-pirate setting that reminds me of movies like ""Mutiny on the Bounty"".Story: While in itself the game offers a decent revenge story, the way the missions work make the game drag on.Basicly you hunt down those corrupt spanish guys to get information on the location of your family members(that look just like the day you lost them). However you will have to repeat this hunt multiple times to get to one of your family members. This is probably the only major problem the game has and even that is not that bad since there is more to do besides the Story missions.Final Verdict: Alive happy-go lucky Pirate awesomeness. SMP! is one of my favorite games and I can only recommend buying it especially if you like Pirates.~Captain AndGeo			"

												Please bear in mind, the following is my opinion alone. You may disagree with my opinion.Sid Meier's Pirates! is an old game, but still a good one.For starters, the map is huge. There are many, many settlements which means many, many ships. More ships means more conflict, which makes for a more fun game.The duelling system is good, however after about 10 duels or so it becomes mind-numbingly repetitive, and you just end up choosing the rapier and mashing 4 all the time.I like how there is no ""best"" ship - sure, the massive ships have a huge hull capacity and they can therefore carry more guns and more crew, but the massive ships are very slow whereas the smaller ships which have a smaller hull capacity and have less cannons are much faster and they can dodge their way out of ramming and situations with superior ships. They can even dodge cannonballs.Because logic.The graphics aren't very good, but give the devs a break, it was made in 2004.There are some cons, like with every game. There is a bug where when you go back onto your ship (when you have gone onto land) with the spyglass still in use, your ship moves ridiculously slowly and the spyglass is still there, meaning you have to go through the incredibly tedious process of turning around at 0.000000001 knots and landing again, then putting away the spyglass and getting back on the ship.And there is very little variation in the gameplay so after one or two playthroughs it becomes extraordinarily boring.However, while it still lasts, this game is worth buying. It's bad, but it's also very good.RATINGSGraphics - 4/10Gameplay - 6.5/10Story Originality - 1/10The Actual Story - 2/10Value for Money - 5/10Replayability - 4/10Length - Can't be rated, there isn't a definite point where the game ends, but you get bored after about 10 hours (counts as 6/10)Extra Special Feature - Balanced ships and huge mapMy Final Rating:6.8/10GoodMean Average rounded to 3 dp:4.071/10			"

												While my nostalgia clouds my jugdement of this game, I can really help it! This game was my childhood for so long.Even for a game as old as it is, it has aged quite well. The game is still very fun to play and really addictive as well as haveing some really good ideas for a game that some games like it today haven't done yet.It is not all sunshine and rainbows as even though I love it there are still some problems with it. Crew dissertion can seemly happen at random and is really annoying  when they take one of your good ships with them. You end up needing to retire and divide up the gold every few years or so to stopo them from killing you basicly.The hand-to-hand combat could be better instead of the little cut scene stuff you get.All in all, I would rate it:11/10 would make every port dutch again.

The quintessential pirate game, with the bare minimum of missing features and an exceptional amount of depth.Want to sail around and plunder Spanish Treasure ships? Sure.Want to find take down the 9 most notorious pirates in the Carib? Go for it.Want to find treasure map fragments and search around distant jungles to find them? There are hundreds.Strategy Minigame? Check. Stealth Minigame? Check. Dancing Minigame? You bet your ♥♥♥. Duelling mingame? Naturally.This game has everything, all fine tuned and polished, not a single bug to be found. The style is timeless, casual and silly but not lacking. If you thought that AC:Black Flag had a good pirate thing going, then you need to pick this up and be blown away.			"

												8/10For however long I have been playing this game, I can give a few things that I think would be helpful to someone debating on buying this. I bought this for like $2.50 when a sale was going on. The game is DEFINITLY worth at least $10.00 though...Goods:-Open world partly on ship, very little on land, some forced minigame, easy UI for movement.-Fun missions.-You get the sense of accomplishment for doing practically anything but losing.-Treasure maps are an entertaining game dynamic.-Take over literally ANY ship and use it as your own.-Raiding towns is fun.-Player items actually make a difference in a variety of aspects of the game.Neutrals:-Gameplay dynamics and reward increments revolve around difficulty.-Dancing can get more difficult as difficulties progress, and having to press 1 of 8 options in the fraction of a second based off of your partner's gestures is not very simple.-Crew is hard to keep happy unless all you do is what pirates would do even though the game gives you the ability to be 'good'.-Graphics match their time.-Winds heavily effect movement around the map.-You only retain your flagship when you give the crew members their cut.-Some ships will not engage in ship to ship warfare and instead will follow windward right into you and force you into a cinematic minigame.-Only about 6-8 ship upgrades.Bads:-Sometimes can be very repetitive.-Sailing down certain inlets can cause the game to continually ask you if you would like to anchor.-The Spanish own the entire south half of the Caribbean. (Not really as bad since it is pretty historically accurate. more difficult attacking vessels without upsetting the Spanish).-When escorting another ship, another WILL spawn and attack you at some point on the voyage.

												I got hooked on the Sid Meier's Pirates! series years ago and I was glad I was able to find this version on PC.Aesthetically the game isn't what most people are used to seeing these days but it is an older game and is very detailed in it's artwork. The period-centric music and sounds are great and while there is no actual dialouge, the gibberish word-sounding noises characters make can be hillarious in the right scenarios. The mechanics on the PC version work a little different so if you're used to the XBOX version like I was be prepared to retrain your and when you start dancing with the governer's daughter.It is a pirate game so you have plenty of booty and plunder to acquire as well as hidden treasures and lost cities and both sea battles and sword fight. Aside from the standard fighting and looting you find in most pirate games, Pirates! offers up trade goods to sell, daughters to be wooed and married to, and more importantly keeping your crew's morale high so you can stay at sea longer.

												The first time I heard or played this game was when my friend let me borrow his copy for the PSP, and I loved it. Naturally, I jumped at the opportunity to own the PC edition. Along with Assassin's Creed IV, this is one of the few games out there that simulate the life of an 18th century pirate in an open-world Caribbean Sea. Though the graphics are dated and the storyline is weak (this is a Sid Meyer game, what do you expect?), the game's distinctive charm makes every boarding/treasure hunt/etc. exciting, and the swath of hidden features to find (romance, turn-based strategy, and so on) will keep you up for hours.

												For everyone that has played the original, this game improves on almost every aspect of the original game while retaining the spirit and fun of the original.  I remember spending hours and hours on this game on the commodore 64 and I've already spent 25 hours on this game in a week (which is a lot for me!).  Highly recommended.  If you liked the original, get this especially while it is going so cheap on the Steam sales.			"

												Pirates is a good game. That is if we look at where it is in comparison with current games. In comparison to the games that were around when this was released it was superb.I am running it on win 8.1 with not problems whatsoever; OK, the graphics are dated, but not unplayably so; the sound is not the best around now, but again this is not a problem.I loved the original game and this rework is just as good. There is dancing, which I was always crap at and I expect I will still be crap at; the fighting onboard ship takes a bit of getting used to; I expect that will come back to me, (Already lost and slung in a French prison, just because I attacked a French ship and got too close and started a boarding action when I really should have stayed away a bit longer!) The naval battle mechanics are pretty good, not Black Flag but this is a game that is 9 years old!So, yes I do recommend it, I have had no problems getting it to run on 8.1, and it is a real reminder of the good old days! I got it in the winter sale, or perhaps that should be SAIL maybe? :-) and I have already abandoned one career in less than an hour. Not to self; always keep enough cash with you so when you escape from prison you can afford to repair your ship. (Attacking when your ship is damaged is not worth it, your victim can sail away!			"

												9/10This game is one of my favourite Sandbox Games that i've played in the last 2 years. Your family is imprisoned by an evil Spaniard, the Marquis Montalban! By this time, you are a young boy, who manages to escape imprisonment. 18 years later, you are a fully grown man, who decides to sign up on a ship (of your choosing). You decide whether to join crew with the Spanish, the Dutch, the French, or the English. Either way, you later mutiny against your captain with nearly the rest of the crew. After defeating the captain, the crew elects you captain. You are then allowed to do whatever you wish. Be that fighting for a certain nationality, being a Pirate and attacking everything in sight, raiding towns, attacking merchant ships, trying to rescue your long lost family, defeating the 9 best pirates in the game (Blackbeard, Henry Morgan, Stede Bonnet ETC) or just doing whatever you feel like doing.The game may take a bit of time to get adjusted to, but in the end, the amount of enjoyment and fun you recieve from playing this is just amasing! So overal, I HIGHLY recommend getting this game, especially when its on special sale thing (like the Steam Summer Sale ETC).			"

												I was actually extremely surprised by how good this game was. I picked it up during a weekend sale based on reviews by some of the other steam users. I couldn't believe that so many people enjoyed a game that's essentially for kids.Sid Meier's Pirates! puts you in the role of a buccaneer who had his family kidnapped by your traditional ""evil noble"". You sign up with one of four major empires--England, France, Spain or Norway--and sink ships, conquer cities, raid caravans and fight off rogue pirates. As a naval leader, you rise in rank from a simple privateer all the way up to the commander of the royal navy. You outfit all of the ships in your fleet and engage in sea battles for ultimate supremacy of the Caribbeans.Sid Meier's Pirates has a surprising amount of depth for such a simplistic game. It has political elements, economics, resource management, sword duelling and...dancing. Yes. There is ballroom dancing in Sid Meier's Pirates. Let that sink in for a moment.I think it has something to offer for everyone. However, there are some downfalls. The difficulty quickly dies down as you amass larger, more well-armed ships. The various game aspects become repetitive after the 8 or 9 hour mark, and the campaign--which is quite short--can be completed with almost no difficulty, especially after acquiring the Duke's ship. There is a lot to do, but it can be done in a short amount of time. I finished the game and most of the quests in about 3.5 hours. So, while it is a good game, it doesn't exceed its financial value in any way. You get what you pay for, plus a little extra.PROS++ Expansive map with a lot to do.++ Amazing ship battles; very engaging and fun!++ Many different activities and side quests to complete apart from the campaign.++ SWORD DUELLING! CONS-- Limited story elements.-- Main campaign is shallow and easy to complete.-- Not much replayability once the quests are done.-- The ballroom dancing. Blech. As a guy, that was cringeworthy.Overall, the game is worth about a 7.5/10. Definitely a good game and worth the money.			"

												Game of the year, every year. This game was fantastic upon it's rerelease in 2005, and it has yet to be matched. The quintessential pirate game, with the bare minimum of missing features and an exceptional amount of depth.Want to sail around and plunder Spanish Treasure ships? Sure.Want to find take down the 9 most notorious pirates in the Carib? Go for it.Want to find treasure map fragments and search around distant jungles to find them? There are hundreds.Strategy Minigame? Check. Stealth Minigame? Check. Dancing Minigame? You bet your ♥♥♥. Duelling mingame? Naturally.This game has everything, all fine tuned and polished, not a single bug to be found. The style is timeless, casual and silly but not lacking. If you thought that AC:Black Flag had a good pirate thing going, then you need to pick this up and be blown away.			"

												8/10For however long I have been playing this game, I can give a few things that I think would be helpful to someone debating on buying this. I bought this for like $2.50 when a sale was going on. The game is DEFINITLY worth at least $10.00 though...Goods:-Open world partly on ship, very little on land, some forced minigame, easy UI for movement.-Fun missions.-You get the sense of accomplishment for doing practically anything but losing.-Treasure maps are an entertaining game dynamic.-Take over literally ANY ship and use it as your own.-Raiding towns is fun.-Player items actually make a difference in a variety of aspects of the game.Neutrals:-Gameplay dynamics and reward increments revolve around difficulty.-Dancing can get more difficult as difficulties progress, and having to press 1 of 8 options in the fraction of a second based off of your partner's gestures is not very simple.-Crew is hard to keep happy unless all you do is what pirates would do even though the game gives you the ability to be 'good'.-Graphics match their time.-Winds heavily effect movement around the map.-You only retain your flagship when you give the crew members their cut.-Some ships will not engage in ship to ship warfare and instead will follow windward right into you and force you into a cinematic minigame.-Only about 6-8 ship upgrades.Bads:-Sometimes can be very repetitive.-Sailing down certain inlets can cause the game to continually ask you if you would like to anchor.-The Spanish own the entire south half of the Caribbean. (Not really as bad since it is pretty historically accurate. more difficult attacking vessels without upsetting the Spanish).-When escorting another ship, another WILL spawn and attack you at some point on the voyage.

												Sid Meier's Pirates is not only an interesting exploration into the world of necromancy but also an engaging PSA about recycling.The game is continuously stuck in some sort of tutorial mode from the first to third difficulty where it punishes you for trying to make the game harder by stealing all of your gold. As soon as you hit Swashbuckler however the game becomes a torment where everything from wind, your crew and even your family hates your guts and wishes to destroy you.The final difficulty however isn't even mentioned by most players who can give you hundreds of strategies for Swashbuckler but not a single for Rogue. It really is just better to forget that this difficulty even exists. It will test your limits as it rips every shred of humanity from you until you're either begging for mercy or some kind of robotic killing machine of the colonial seas. No matter how good you are on Rogue the swordfight with the final boss in his fortress has been designed as a testing protocol for T-800 units instead of being a game for actual human beings to complete.Oh and good luck with the dancing minigame.

												Pirates! is a really classic game for me - though I admit it could be part of its appeal to me was that it was so far ahead of its time when it came out. Free roaming, sailing with different handling depending on the size of the ship, a map based on the real world, two types of battle, leadership, piracy and privateering for political gain, marrying women, hunting treasure, searching for long-long relatives and trying to quell your crew from mutiny... all in a game from the mid-1980s. The only thing that even nearly matched it in terms of depth was Elite.It's received updates, and updates, and updates, and... it's still the same game, at the core.			"

												I brought my thirst and swag into a local tavern off an island I was sailing by, we proceeded to drink and dice, and having a luck roll of 77 when I was born, the gambling addict was soon out of money. He proceeded to bring me into a back room and show me this girl he had found as a stow away. Double or nothing he says for the girl as collateral, Wanting to bang out as many chicks as possible before the redcoats end my reign of terror I of course accept and walk away with a new wench. She proceeds to tell me she is looking for her husband, a naval officer who went missing, and If i was a decent man I'd help her. I proceeded to shut her down and make her train my sailors to bring morale up. A year goes by and I'm at another tavern; a man comes up to me and tells me that I own his wife and hes been looking for her all this time, would I part with her out of a sense of lost romance and love? I of course decline because this isnt a charity, he offers 10,000 gold, I accept. Its 4am and I log off, when I retern my coffers are filled with 1,000,000,000 Gold.  I proceeded to throw volley after volley of conscripted men into the meat grinder of local forts until I owned the worlds best fleet. Needless to say the game was ruined after that, but I was the best pirate in the land.			"

												If you played the original i'd recommend playing this for a big ole blast of nostalgia.  If you've never played pirates before, well i guess you can buy this as it is a pretty fun adventure/rpg/exploration type game thingy.... i suppose....  I got it on sale for dirt cheap and seeing as how it is an older game i'd recommend getting it cheap too.  While it definetly shows its age, for the price tag its hard to pass this one by.  I'd recommend it if you like old school games, but if you aren't into playing remade old games then skip this one as you aren't going to get any real modern play mechanics.			"

												FIXED!: I still say ""buyers beware"", but I have found a reliable, and good fix for the problems I have been having. I am hoping this fix is good for anyone else who was having the same issue. It is a game made before Windows Vist, 7, and 8, and thus was not optimized for play on those versions. I hope these solutions work for you, so that you can seemlessly enjoy this classic.Fixes random crashes: http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/07/31/pixel-boost-sid-meiers-pirates/?ns_campaign=article-feed&ns_mchannel=ref&ns_source=steam&ns_linkname=0&ns_fee=0Fixes ""steam not found"" error: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=26798077&postcount=13----------I love this game. I have spent hours and hours playing this before, on Xbox, as well as Windows. However, I cannot play this version for more than 15 minutes before it crashes. It is really annoying. There are some compatibility issues with modern versions of Windows that cause this, and has never been patched. I recomend this game if you are playing on a Windows XP machine. However, if you are on Vista or later, especially 64 bit, just beware.			"

The controls however are wierd at first, but you'll get used to it later as you play.Ships you want to aim for as a beginner are the ones listed belowBrigsFrigatesSloopsShips you want to aim for as an expierenced playerLarge Frigate(Can carry a large crew, make sure you have a big crew to board them)Ship of the Line/Man-O-War(Only appears on higher difficulties when you cause a lot of trouble with trade routes and such, deadly firepower, avoid being hit as these deal devastating amount of damage if you do not have an armor upgrade) -If you are feeling confident on taking them on, give it a go, you'd be a fool to sink that beast.

												Duel for control of the High Seas, for the hands of noble daughters, and for the return of your stolen family. You're the hero (or is it the villain?) of Pirates!This game hits me right in the nostalgia - it's one of the first PC games I ever really got into - and when it went on sale I couldn't resist grabbing a copy. Yes, the reused enviornments can get stale but, hey, it's an older game and what's there is solid enough to keep your interest. If you don't mind putting up with a little 'vintage realness' Pirates! is worth the money, full price or otherwise. 7/10Would recommend			"

												I brought my thirst and swag into a local tavern off an island I was sailing by, we proceeded to drink and dice, and having a luck roll of 77 when I was born, the gambling addict was soon out of money. He proceeded to bring me into a back room and show me this girl he had found as a stow away. Double or nothing he says for the girl as collateral, Wanting to bang out as many chicks as possible before the redcoats end my reign of terror I of course accept and walk away with a new wench. She proceeds to tell me she is looking for her husband, a naval officer who went missing, and If i was a decent man I'd help her. I proceeded to shut her down and make her train my sailors to bring morale up. A year goes by and I'm at another tavern; a man comes up to me and tells me that I own his wife and hes been looking for her all this time, would I part with her out of a sense of lost romance and love? I of course decline because this isnt a charity, he offers 10,000 gold, I accept. Its 4am and I log off, when I retern my coffers are filled with 1,000,000,000 Gold.  I proceeded to throw volley after volley of conscripted men into the meat grinder of local forts until I owned the worlds best fleet. Needless to say the game was ruined after that, but I was the best pirate in the land.			"

												No other game stole so many hours of my childhood.  Well, maybe Rollercoaster Tycoon Gold, but that's besides the point!  This timeless open-world sand-- er, waterbox-- gives you a ship and wishes you well, then reels in the anchors to let you do whatever the hell you want.  Sure, you could be a hero and save your family from slavery at the hands of an evil and abusive Marquis, but... why would you?  There's only so much time in your simulated pirate life, time that could be used to board Spanish trade galleons, to sack cities, to find ancient Incan ruins, to deliver ultimatums, to conquer all in the name of the Dutch, to beat up drunk tavern regulars, to buy treasure maps and moustaches from Sid Meier in the back corner of the tavern, to marry sixteen governors' daughters through your ballroom dancing swagger, to do whatever the hell you want!YAR HAR DIDDLY DEE, BEING A PIRATE IS ALRIGHT TO BE, DO WHAT YOU WANT CAUSE A PIRATE IS FREE, YOU ARE A PIRATE!

												I really had my reservations about this game. It looked a little dated, and not much content. I do like ships and pirates and trading and after I got the game in a humble bundle i decided id give it a go. This game is wonderful. You start out as an apprentice level sailor with the que's flashing during fights and dances so you dont fail. Then journeyman comes around and the que's are gone and you have to see the movement of the person your fighting or dancing with to have an idea of what your defence/dance move should be.At first i thought it was dumb that you could only battle one ship, but that ship you have direct control over and it would be difficult to control more, and relying on AI to fight with you brings in risks of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ decisions. Over all, this game is really worth it. i would have paid the 10 bucks in full if i knew what i was getting into			"

												Looking for someone to tell me I'm wrong with the following statement.  This game is perfect . . . except for:1. Ship speed is everything for winning this game on the hardest setting, thus making all the dif ships you can get moot; expecially trying to sail around slowly with a whole fleet--something you'd never do trying to win the hardest dif.2. The game provides several avenues for making money, but just basic capture/sell is so much faster/effective than anything else; which also makes the rest moot.3. The sneak-in-to-town mini-game is way to high risk vs. reward, so again in a game you're trying to win, you'd never do this . . . unlase you ""save-scum""Recap: the designers put in multiple paths to victory in this game (a must for any ""good"" game), but once you discover the ""correct"" path, it is so overwhelmingly the ""correct"" path that even if you force yourself to try something different all you can think is this is stupid and can do task X in 1/2 the time (time - the greatest commodity in the game) by doing it the ""best"" way.  Again, please someone tell me I'm wrong.			"

But the game retains all of its potency. If your at all intrested in pirates and ship combat and the carrabiean, then this is the game for you. It's also great for kids and adults.10 out of 10 would sail the carrabiean again.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played. A timeless classic which to this day I still play!! An amazingling large open world with a brilliant economy. A game that you can loose days in getting no progress into the storyline whatsoever, i never have completed the story. You can become a successful trader, marry a princess, be apart of wars, become the most feared pirate of the carribean, have the biggest fleet. Its up to you. This game is a must play for any gamer!			"

												My wife and I love this game so much we decided to make a let's play - who knew a game this old could still keep us hooked after all these years?   I love this game, my wife loves it, my kids love it, even my father in law played for hundreds of ours.  It's appropriate - and fun- for all ages.The combat is simplified, easy and very satisfying - the story is simple and satisfying, the graphics are still beautiful and compare to many modern indie games out there.  Actually now that I think of it, this was one of the first non dungeon rogue like games to come out.  Every game is different and you never know where the seas will take you.Highly recommended and we'd love to connect with other Sid Meier's Pirates players out there!Here is my wife and I playing what we call a thirty minute pirate game

												I played the old DOS version alot, and thought the remake wouldn't be as good.  While somewhat different, I like this version more.  You know you have played for too long when you can take the top spot on the Top 10 Pirate list without taking out any of the other 9, and then still have time to finish the main quest and take down the 9 before retiring.Simplistic yet addictive.

												Simply one of the best pirate games around, that is until AC4: Black Flag came out, but it is still a classic and worthty of your time. I spend hours and hours playing this in college, lost the CD but picked it up again on a steam sale. Some of the side missions are a little dumb, like dancing with the governer's daughters...you'd think a real pirate would just punch them in the face. Oh well. still, the sea combat is great, taking out towns, ships, building a fleet. all fun times.			"

												This is a great classic. Each successive journey out into the world gives you the opportunity to build your wealth up through attacking ships, raiding towns, finding treasure or just the best buy/sell prices. The higher you set the difficulty, the more loot you get to keep. The fewer crew you have, the more loot there is to go around. So there's a real incentive to keep challenging yourself to take on more risks. Freeform Pirate games aren't common, but this is definitely one of the best.			"

												When I first picked this game up from the Sid Meier Humble Bundle I looked at it with nothing but a slight idea of what was to come.  To be honest I didn't expect much at first but after getting into the game after an hour or so, I was hooked.  The game is simple in nature yet complex to master, as are many of Sid Meier's games.  The pirates theme is masterfully directed and the story, while lacking, doesn't need to be there in the first place.  You create your own story.  Become the most vile Pirate to ever sail the seven seas or be a noble sailor for one of the nations colonizing the area.  Seek revenge solely on those who took your family or loot and plunder everywhere and everyone.  This game is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.  Though it may be a bit clunky and awkward at points, it adds to the charm of the game.  I can not reccomend this game enough to anyone with interest in the pirate theme or anyone looking for a fun adventure.			"

												An updated edition of an older classic I loved as a kid - I was pumped to find this edition in a bundle, which I picked up for a song. Usually, this game can be found discounted, but is worth a LOT more than a lot of other, more expensive games out there.You're a pirate, you go around capturing and looting ships, rescuing damsels in distress, dancing (it's fun; don't look at me like that), and fencing with other pirates. If you haven't tried it, DO SO.THe only con - difficulty settings are managed in-game, unlike in previous editions, with significant in-game consequences. For some, this can be a little off-putting, especially if you want to jump straight in to a higher difficulty level from the beginning.			"

												Pirates! is the all the swashbuckling fun a person could want from a pirate-themed video game without being too restrictive. It lays out a basic backstory with optional follow-through, but otherwises allows the player to run wild in the 17th Century Caribbean. At times, however, the game can be a little too hands off in terms of direction (explanation of game and world mechanics and parts of the ""storyline""). The controls can a little confusing at first, and I would really recommend a number pad if using a laptop but a mouse is a good alternative also (I've used both and found that while the mouse is more convenient a number pad makes the game much easier to play). Overall, this game is easy to get a hang of quickly and you'll have a fantastic time pirating your way across the high seas.			"

												Score: 10/10Although Sid Meier's Pirates! is a very old game, it gives the player an unrivaled pirate experience. You are free to make your choices and shape the world in any way you see fit, and that is what I call a true RPG. Which brings us to what I believe is the strongest point of this game, the hability to provide an amazing interaction with the game world, even if you don't realized as you do, as every action brings a reaction somewhere. If you save the merchant ship from the pirates, your allies may prosper, but that very pirate ship that you sunk will be a hard hit in the pirate community. Or, if you are to become the most fiered pirate of the seas, you might find that your pillage is bringing cities to decline.The other mechanics in the game do not present any remarkable point, but been able to have old school ship fight is quite amusing, as well as deciding your batles by your favorite method of combat (ship/sword fight). The graphics and sound are alright and there is no plot, you make your own history.This game deserves a 10 for the great interaction mechanic it carries even being decades old! Definitely a gap to be yet filled.			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates! is a surprisingly fun and deep simulation of being a ship captain in the Caribbean during the glory days of piracy. You're not limited to being a pirate. Although the game doesn't explicitly say so, the simulation of the four major powers and two minor powers operating in the Caribbean is quite complex. There's a real war going on, and all of it happens by sea. Although invasions happen over land, troops don't get into position to invade unless they're transported by ship. Many troops don't get paid and people don't get fed unless their wages and food arrive by sea. The economy is primarily based on sea trade, and blockades occur. Warships must be built and sailed where they're needed. And governors and other important people move around by ship.All this means that there's a rich environment for you to play in, and many possibilities for how you want to play. You can, of course, be a pirate and loot the treasure ships of all the wealthy nations. You can serve a nation as a legitimate but independent privateer. You can pretend to be part of a nation's navy and go to war on its behalf, attacking targets of military importance and earning the appreciation of the nation even if you don't get much money out of it. You can even take part in land-based invasions and try to conquer cities, either for the benefit of a nation - territory really changes hands in this game - or just to loot and pillage. Or you can be a peaceful trader. The lesser powers, pirates and Indians (i.e. Native Americans), have their own agendas which enrich the environment further.Besides the sandbox gameplay, you have several concrete goals: rescue your family, acquire wealth and fame, woo beautiful women, find hidden treasure and lost cities, bring villains to justice, and defeat the top pirates in the Caribbean. There are also minor quests that allow you to act as a law enforcer (or turn a blind eye to crime in exchange for bribes, if you wish), and mini-games such as breaking into enemy towns, dancing (which is quite fun), and both real-time combat at sea and turn-based combat on land.There's a lot to do, and for the most part it's all well-designed. There are five difficulty levels, allowing the game to be enjoyable for all players, and several eras you can start in and skills you can specialize in, which increase replay value. The game's main shortcoming is that it's too easy, because it helpfully auto-saves before anything bad happens, allowing you to simply reload your game and retry. This diminishes the importance of many gameplay elements, such as breaking out of jail, upgrading your character, and maintaining multiple ships in your fleet, and leads to excessive risk-taking while dampening the thrill of success. The game really needs an Iron Man mode. (Thankfully, a mod to add one exists.)Another potential problem for some players is that the game doesn't have much of a tutorial, but the manual is good and worth reading.			"

												When I picked this game up, I had been having this urge to play a pirate game. Something open world, where I could choose my own path, but still be a pirate. I wanted the game to be about more than just continual swordfights. As I looked over the community reviews on various ""pirate"" games, there didn't seem to be a lot out there that offered open world freedom.Sid Meier's Pirates! offer you that freedom. You can determine the size of your crew, the routes you travel, even who you fight: you are offered the chance to be a privateer for any of 4 different countries (Don't worry, you don't have to serve any allegiance). You also get to decide if you will be the pirate that raids ships and pillage towns for a living, or more of a merchant/pirate that buys and sells goods as well. There is a main questline of finding your long lost family and getting revenge against those responsible, but it doesn't get in the way of any other path you choose.Now, Sid Meier's Pirates! isn't perfect. Some of the minigames get very VERY tedious the ninth or tenth time you do them (dancing with the governor's daughter). But all around, this is a very fun game. And for it's price, this game was definitely worth it, especially for those of you looking to scratch that Pirate itch.			"

												This is a really good game.  You are more or less free to roam...follow the story line (free your family), hunt pirates, loot tons of ships, achieve royal status with various nations, marry ump-teen govenors daughters...pretty cool.  If you go the love route, be prepared for pirate ballroom dancing...yes you read that right.  That part is kind of corney, but if you master it you do receive a lot of high level and expensive loot for free.  BTW, the aspect ratio for graphitcs is stuck at 4:3, no way to change it without messing up the GUI/menus.  You can learn to live with it, or waste time in the forums looking for a solution that does not exist like I did.  Overall a 10/10.			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates is one of his best games, alongside Civilization 4 and Civ 5. In this game you can experience the exciting world of the 18th century Caribbean, filled with notorious pirates like Blackbeard, buried treasure, and devastating storms to blow you off course. There are two basic ways you can play the game: You can plunder every single penny from every single person, or you can obey every law there is, and befriend the governor of every town and city on the map. And, of course, you can be somewhere in between. This game has one drawback I will mention: you must have a number pad on your keyboard to play it. Almost everything from sailing your ship to the swordfighting minigames requires the number pad. Aside from that limitation, it is a great game. Not too difficult, but not too easy. I recommend that you purchase this game and try it out for yourself. If you like Sid Meier's other games and you like pirates, you'll like this.			"

												Been wanting a fun pirate game for a while, and since AC Black Flag just didn't do it for me I tried this out.  To my surprise this game is awesome.  Can easily put many hours into it and is simple yet deep and fun.  Totally sandbox, and you can plunder to your hearts desire.  It's definitely a Sid Meier's kinda game, and its old so the graphics and RPG elements are a little dated.  But its definitely worth the small price tag and I would ABSOLUTELY recommend if it was on a steam sale.  However, I truly wish a decent pirate RPG would come out with: leveling, weapons, ship upgrades, custom crew members, sea/land battles, and a good story; as this game sadly is not that.  And that game would most definitely sell.All in all, simple, fun, addictive.  Good purchase.			"

												I still remember the first Pirates! It was a very good game to play at that time and i spent a lot of hours in it. So when this version came available i hoped it was as the first one and it was. It is a remake of the original with better graphics, playability and they added a few extra's to the newer version. If you are a fan of the old one then this is a must have, relive your childhood.If you are looking for a realistic sea battle game then this is not the game you are looking for it is a casual game. Con's - User controls are somewhat unusual. Takes a few to get used to but not a real hinderance.Pro's- Different activities to pursue. Be a trader, Pirate or go out and conquer for your nation.- Easy battles which makes it fun to play, it does not take ages to conquer a ship or town.			"

												Sid Meier has made many games with clever tactical depth, but is not so swollen with rules, so that anybody can jump right in. Pirates! continues the tradition by being a game chock full of strategy, but is highly accessible.The game is a sandbox. You can go anywhere, and do anything, within the Spanish Main. Generally, you plunder ships or towns, and get promoted by friendly nations. There are plenty of other things to do, too.Tasks you perform have an associated action oriented mini-game. You'll be ship-to-ship battling and swordfighting a lot. I like most of these games, though your mileage may vary. Many people have mixed feelings about them.As far as management goes, the game cuts out micro-managing. The action just keeps flowing. The typical mundane busy work of hard-core strategy games is kindly removed here, in order to get to the good bits. There are plenty of strategic decisions to be made, but you get to think in a sense of what you WANT to do, not what you HAVE to do.Certain things are a little tricky to get used to. Sailing East is much harder than sailing West. Your crew slowly becomes restless over time, forcing you to pay them off and take a few months vacation before going back to sailing.After you get to the ripe old age of about 35, your health starts to decline, and you might have to retire before too long. This takes you to an amusing detailed report on your post-pirate life. Hopefully you are a Governor instead of a Pauper!The graphics and sound are cartoony. Everything looks like it's from a Disney/Pixar movie, and the voice acting is done in jibberish, like in The Sims. Subtitles are in English, though. The cartoony feel is not bad, but is sometimes just a little TOO campy.The controls are a bit strange. While you can use a mouse, you're better off doing the mini-games using the numpad. It's a little awkward at first, but you get used to it fairly soon.Pirates! is one of my all time favorite games. Two thumbs and a wooden peg-leg up!			"

												Pirates! is a game I played quite a bit in college, and playing it again now, it holds up surprisingly well. You play as a Caribbean pirate in a small ship, and you can use it to build up a huge fleet, earn a fortune, find lost cities of gold, and do tons of other things. More than anything else, Pirates! is a sandbox game. It will suggest things to do, but you're free to set your own goals.When you're not sailing, most of the Pirates! gameplay is in the form of mini-games. You'll become very familiar with Fencing... your sword will solve many problems. But you can also participate in naval combat, dance, siege towns, sneak into hostile towns, or hune around the wilderness for treasure. Most of them are short, simple, skill-based games that are incredibly easy on low difficulties, but can get near impossible on the higher ones.The graphics were good for their time, and they've held up better than I expected. The music is nice, but there's not enough of it. The game usually controls well enough.I got this game when it went on sale, and I've been having a lot of fun with it again. I'd wait for a sale to get Pirates!, but when it does, this is a game worth getting.			"

												For a game that's over ten years old, Pirates is easily the best game I've played in a long time.  It brings a romanticized view of a century of piracy to gaming, yet avoids Treasure Island clichés like parrots and peg legs.  You'll find a lot of light comedy in the presentation of the game, too!  However, the overall gameplay is quite sophisticated.  Unlike games such as Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, you have to know how to sail with the wind to your advantage.  The size of your sword, ship, and crew matter tremendously as you conquer the West Indies, as well as the hearts of colonial governors' daughters.  You may find yourself chasing ships for game days on end only to lose it to the wind, so you have to be good at assessing situations and using them to your advantage, else the enemy does the same.  Surprisingly, these elements do not detract from the gameplay, but instead add a level of interest and challenge that draws you in further.I'd give it a 9.8out of 10.  It's not perfect, but it's damn close.  My only concern is technical issues (performance), as the game did not run optimally on my system due to the game's slightly antiquated nature.  Even so, the fact that the game IS so old (and this one was a remake) stands as testament to its fantastic ability to entertain.  Any PC gamer should definitely give it a try.			"

												After all these years, this game can still make me lose track of time. Back in college played it on a Mac in greyscale. Then played it as Pirates Gold. Trying hard to get it to run a bit more smoothly in Windows 7.  Definitely worth the price of the game!			"

												This game has held up amazingly well considering I have been playing this gem of a game since the days of the Commodore 64, than later on XBox, and finally on steam.  One of the few games I can get lost in for hours at a time.  You can choose to live the pirates life, a merchant plying the seaways, or anything in between.  Can be a bit repetitive at times though a lot of that can be avoided (dancing/wooing the governors daughter/sword fighting). 8/10.			"

												The game brings back memories from my childhood. Back when I owned an Xbox Classic, I would play this game almost every day to try and become the most notorious pirate. I was elated to find it here on Steam. The combat system is very old and repetative, but I would absolutely recommend it to anyone that wants to feel like a scurvy dog on the high seas.			"

												I really wanted this game and after a year or two of waiting I bought it.I went through and fully completed the campaign in about twenty to twenty-five hours, so this can last you awhile.There is swashbuckling and ship battles to be had!You can own and command a fleet of ships ranging from a Canoe to a fearsome ""Ship Of The Line"".When you divide the plunder you can choose to stay at your current naval rank/ game difficulty or get a promotion and slightly increase the game's difficulty. You can also look for buried treasure by purchasing or finding a treasure map.You can attack any ship you see even ones you're supposed to be escorting.You can attack or invade any port or town, to do this,Attack a town with your ship's cannons to kill most of it's men, then invade by land to capture or pillage the town.The graphics are good, music is decent and the dialogue is good aswell.I rate this game, Eight War Canoes Out Of Ten.

												Been wanting a fun pirate game for a while, and since AC Black Flag just didn't do it for me I tried this out.  To my surprise this game is awesome.  Can easily put many hours into it and is simple yet deep and fun.  Totally sandbox, and you can plunder to your hearts desire.  It's definitely a Sid Meier's kinda game, and its old so the graphics and RPG elements are a little dated.  But its definitely worth the small price tag and I would ABSOLUTELY recommend if it was on a steam sale.  However, I truly wish a decent pirate RPG would come out with: leveling, weapons, ship upgrades, custom crew members, sea/land battles, and a good story; as this game sadly is not that.  And that game would most definitely sell.All in all, simple, fun, addictive.  Good purchase.			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates! is a 2005 remake of the original game he made back in the 1980s. This time, you have better graphics, more advanced swordfighting sequences and more options for everything. You start the game off by leading a mutiny on a merchant vessel. From there on, you can decide whether you want to avenge your family by defeating the Marquis de Montalban, defeating all the major pirate captains in the Spanish Main, accumulate vast amounts of wealth through trade, marry a governor's daughter whether she be sexy or ugly, or if you want to attack merchant ships, plunder seaports and instigate a brand new war. The choice is yours! My only complaint is that you can't customize your character: although he does age, you always have to be the Orlando Bloom type of character. Beyond that, this game is every sandbox adventure you ever dreamed of.			"

It is fun in a tycoonish kind of way to build your fleet, pillage towns and do things on your own free will. It's a game that aged well for something that originated in the late 80's/90's.

												I still remember the first Pirates! It was a very good game to play at that time and i spent a lot of hours in it. So when this version came available i hoped it was as the first one and it was. It is a remake of the original with better graphics, playability and they added a few extra's to the newer version. If you are a fan of the old one then this is a must have, relive your childhood.If you are looking for a realistic sea battle game then this is not the game you are looking for it is a casual game. Con's - User controls are somewhat unusual. Takes a few to get used to but not a real hinderance.Pro's- Different activities to pursue. Be a trader, Pirate or go out and conquer for your nation.- Easy battles which makes it fun to play, it does not take ages to conquer a ship or town.			"

												Pirates! is a game I played quite a bit in college, and playing it again now, it holds up surprisingly well. You play as a Caribbean pirate in a small ship, and you can use it to build up a huge fleet, earn a fortune, find lost cities of gold, and do tons of other things. More than anything else, Pirates! is a sandbox game. It will suggest things to do, but you're free to set your own goals.When you're not sailing, most of the Pirates! gameplay is in the form of mini-games. You'll become very familiar with Fencing... your sword will solve many problems. But you can also participate in naval combat, dance, siege towns, sneak into hostile towns, or hune around the wilderness for treasure. Most of them are short, simple, skill-based games that are incredibly easy on low difficulties, but can get near impossible on the higher ones.The graphics were good for their time, and they've held up better than I expected. The music is nice, but there's not enough of it. The game usually controls well enough.I got this game when it went on sale, and I've been having a lot of fun with it again. I'd wait for a sale to get Pirates!, but when it does, this is a game worth getting.			"

												Sid Meier has made many games with clever tactical depth, but is not so swollen with rules, so that anybody can jump right in. Pirates! continues the tradition by being a game chock full of strategy, but is highly accessible.The game is a sandbox. You can go anywhere, and do anything, within the Spanish Main. Generally, you plunder ships or towns, and get promoted by friendly nations. There are plenty of other things to do, too.Tasks you perform have an associated action oriented mini-game. You'll be ship-to-ship battling and swordfighting a lot. I like most of these games, though your mileage may vary. Many people have mixed feelings about them.As far as management goes, the game cuts out micro-managing. The action just keeps flowing. The typical mundane busy work of hard-core strategy games is kindly removed here, in order to get to the good bits. There are plenty of strategic decisions to be made, but you get to think in a sense of what you WANT to do, not what you HAVE to do.Certain things are a little tricky to get used to. Sailing East is much harder than sailing West. Your crew slowly becomes restless over time, forcing you to pay them off and take a few months vacation before going back to sailing.After you get to the ripe old age of about 35, your health starts to decline, and you might have to retire before too long. This takes you to an amusing detailed report on your post-pirate life. Hopefully you are a Governor instead of a Pauper!The graphics and sound are cartoony. Everything looks like it's from a Disney/Pixar movie, and the voice acting is done in jibberish, like in The Sims. Subtitles are in English, though. The cartoony feel is not bad, but is sometimes just a little TOO campy.The controls are a bit strange. While you can use a mouse, you're better off doing the mini-games using the numpad. It's a little awkward at first, but you get used to it fairly soon.Pirates! is one of my all time favorite games. Two thumbs and a wooden peg-leg up!			"

												I rank the 1987 version of this game as one of my favorite gaming experiences ever (eventhough it took an eternity to start on my c64 cassette-player). I've also played the 1994 version, which was more or less identical to the first, apart from then up to date grafics and sound. So it was with mixed emotions that I aproached this installment of Pirates. Would it hold up, would my memories be bashed to pieces, would I be tormented by nightmares of spanish pirate hunters? Well I'm surprised to say that it did hold up, petty well. Most of the orginal gameplay was still there, basically the same ship combat, basically the same melee (3 attacks, 3 parries/evades), The ""new"" stuff like added items, new settlement types, new city-combat all added to the gameplay in a good way, the dancing maybe not so much though. Although the grafics is now outdated, they do give a nice cartoonish feel to the game.Basically this is the same game that a loved as a kid, but with an added delicate facelift.			"

												Extremely fun, very cute, quality gameplay (for a 2004 title this ran smooth and looked good!!!!!). I can't see myself replaying this, but the single playthrough I did was *very* enjoyable (I received the rank of Mayor, 3rd highest).Gameplay wise you start with your family being wronged and you are able to escape imprisonment and choose to enlist with 1 of 4 nations- the Dutch, the English, the Spanish or the French. You sail around the Carribean and capture ships (or even cities!) of the other nations. You can fight pirates too, including some of the famous ones! Combat involves primarily dueling where you could your opponent's sword move and attack with your own. You may also utilize ship based naval combat by firing off your cannons against other ships with 3 different kinds of shots: your general damage round shot, grape shot to take down crew members, or chain shot to bring down masts & sails. Aside from the combat your goal is to defeat the baddies, gain treasure maps, rescue family members, and even settle down with a lovely wife! =)Bottom line: play it, but ♥♥♥♥ sailing east.			"

												This is a great classic. Each successive journey out into the world gives you the opportunity to build your wealth up through attacking ships, raiding towns, finding treasure or just the best buy/sell prices. The higher you set the difficulty, the more loot you get to keep. The fewer crew you have, the more loot there is to go around. So there's a real incentive to keep challenging yourself to take on more risks. Freeform Pirate games aren't common, but this is definitely one of the best.			"

												This is a terrificly fun, low stress game that gives you the sights and sounds of being a pirate in the caribbean seas circa the 1600's. It plays out like a fast paced board game crossed with an enthusiastic child's fanciful imaginings of the piratey life: all of the highs and none of the lows. It's such a breath of fresh air to play a game that doesn't try to saddle you with a heavy ""Hollywood"" cinematic story. The encounters are entirely under your control in true sandbox style and you venture through a series of minigames at different locations to obtain information about the placement of notable people, treasures, and upgrades, with each task being fun and easy to grasp.  There's a wealth of things to do with the only drawback being repetition sets in too early; you fight the same pirates, perform the same battle actions, talk to the same placeholder figures over and over again. Give it a shot.  It's fun and frivolous and you'll definintely be entertained.			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates! is a surprisingly fun and deep simulation of being a ship captain in the Caribbean during the glory days of piracy. You're not limited to being a pirate. Although the game doesn't explicitly say so, the simulation of the four major powers and two minor powers operating in the Caribbean is quite complex. There's a real war going on, and all of it happens by sea. Although invasions happen over land, troops don't get into position to invade unless they're transported by ship. Many troops don't get paid and people don't get fed unless their wages and food arrive by sea. The economy is primarily based on sea trade, and blockades occur. Warships must be built and sailed where they're needed. And governors and other important people move around by ship.All this means that there's a rich environment for you to play in, and many possibilities for how you want to play. You can, of course, be a pirate and loot the treasure ships of all the wealthy nations. You can serve a nation as a legitimate but independent privateer. You can pretend to be part of a nation's navy and go to war on its behalf, attacking targets of military importance and earning the appreciation of the nation even if you don't get much money out of it. You can even take part in land-based invasions and try to conquer cities, either for the benefit of a nation - territory really changes hands in this game - or just to loot and pillage. Or you can be a peaceful trader. The lesser powers, pirates and Indians (i.e. Native Americans), have their own agendas which enrich the environment further.Besides the sandbox gameplay, you have several concrete goals: rescue your family, acquire wealth and fame, woo beautiful women, find hidden treasure and lost cities, bring villains to justice, and defeat the top pirates in the Caribbean. There are also minor quests that allow you to act as a law enforcer (or turn a blind eye to crime in exchange for bribes, if you wish), and mini-games such as breaking into enemy towns, dancing (which is quite fun), and both real-time combat at sea and turn-based combat on land.There's a lot to do, and for the most part it's all well-designed. There are five difficulty levels, allowing the game to be enjoyable for all players, and several eras you can start in and skills you can specialize in, which increase replay value. The game's main shortcoming is that it's too easy, because it helpfully auto-saves before anything bad happens, allowing you to simply reload your game and retry. This diminishes the importance of many gameplay elements, such as breaking out of jail, upgrading your character, and maintaining multiple ships in your fleet, and leads to excessive risk-taking while dampening the thrill of success. The game really needs an Iron Man mode. (Thankfully, a mod to add one exists.)Another potential problem for some players is that the game doesn't have much of a tutorial, but the manual is good and worth reading.			"

												When I picked this game up, I had been having this urge to play a pirate game. Something open world, where I could choose my own path, but still be a pirate. I wanted the game to be about more than just continual swordfights. As I looked over the community reviews on various ""pirate"" games, there didn't seem to be a lot out there that offered open world freedom.Sid Meier's Pirates! offer you that freedom. You can determine the size of your crew, the routes you travel, even who you fight: you are offered the chance to be a privateer for any of 4 different countries (Don't worry, you don't have to serve any allegiance). You also get to decide if you will be the pirate that raids ships and pillage towns for a living, or more of a merchant/pirate that buys and sells goods as well. There is a main questline of finding your long lost family and getting revenge against those responsible, but it doesn't get in the way of any other path you choose.Now, Sid Meier's Pirates! isn't perfect. Some of the minigames get very VERY tedious the ninth or tenth time you do them (dancing with the governor's daughter). But all around, this is a very fun game. And for it's price, this game was definitely worth it, especially for those of you looking to scratch that Pirate itch.			"

												This is a really good game.  You are more or less free to roam...follow the story line (free your family), hunt pirates, loot tons of ships, achieve royal status with various nations, marry ump-teen govenors daughters...pretty cool.  If you go the love route, be prepared for pirate ballroom dancing...yes you read that right.  That part is kind of corney, but if you master it you do receive a lot of high level and expensive loot for free.  BTW, the aspect ratio for graphitcs is stuck at 4:3, no way to change it without messing up the GUI/menus.  You can learn to live with it, or waste time in the forums looking for a solution that does not exist like I did.  Overall a 10/10.			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates is one of his best games, alongside Civilization 4 and Civ 5. In this game you can experience the exciting world of the 18th century Caribbean, filled with notorious pirates like Blackbeard, buried treasure, and devastating storms to blow you off course. There are two basic ways you can play the game: You can plunder every single penny from every single person, or you can obey every law there is, and befriend the governor of every town and city on the map. And, of course, you can be somewhere in between. This game has one drawback I will mention: you must have a number pad on your keyboard to play it. Almost everything from sailing your ship to the swordfighting minigames requires the number pad. Aside from that limitation, it is a great game. Not too difficult, but not too easy. I recommend that you purchase this game and try it out for yourself. If you like Sid Meier's other games and you like pirates, you'll like this.			"

												My second favorite pirate game of all time.  Favorite being Uncharted Waters: New Horizons on the SNES.  This game is entirely based in the Carribean.  Starting the game up you choose what type of pirate you are going to be by picking a skill.  After that you pick your nationality.  You can choose between Spanish, English, French, and Dutch.  The Spanish seem to have the most ports and cities so I'd consider them the easiest to start with.  You work your way up the pirate ranks by finding buried treasure, defeating notorious pirates like Blackbeard, and trading goods between ports.  It's a great game and worth the price in my opinion.

												Sid Meier's Pirates! is a 2005 remake of the original game he made back in the 1980s. This time, you have better graphics, more advanced swordfighting sequences and more options for everything. You start the game off by leading a mutiny on a merchant vessel. From there on, you can decide whether you want to avenge your family by defeating the Marquis de Montalban, defeating all the major pirate captains in the Spanish Main, accumulate vast amounts of wealth through trade, marry a governor's daughter whether she be sexy or ugly, or if you want to attack merchant ships, plunder seaports and instigate a brand new war. The choice is yours! My only complaint is that you can't customize your character: although he does age, you always have to be the Orlando Bloom type of character. Beyond that, this game is every sandbox adventure you ever dreamed of.			"

There's so many thngs you can do and choose,and it all flows out so smoothly.I give it a medium-high score out of an even higher score number. I swear to God I was not paid off by Firaxis to rate it this.*sniffs fattened wallet*			"

												Going into this game I wasnt entirely sure what to expect, I was pleasently suprised though.As far as for what type of game it is and the year it was released and what they had to work with I would rank this a 4/5Simply a 4/5 for a few reasons.Cons:Dancing is extremely difficult once you level up.They did great on the water graphics, but ship graphics comparatively are horrid.That being said, I still suggest this game for any ye pirates who aint yellow belly land lubbers!

												Sid Meier's Pirates is one of his best games, alongside Civilization 4 and Civ 5. In this game you can experience the exciting world of the 18th century Caribbean, filled with notorious pirates like Blackbeard, buried treasure, and devastating storms to blow you off course. There are two basic ways you can play the game: You can plunder every single penny from every single person, or you can obey every law there is, and befriend the governor of every town and city on the map. And, of course, you can be somewhere in between. This game has one drawback I will mention: you must have a number pad on your keyboard to play it. Almost everything from sailing your ship to the swordfighting minigames requires the number pad. Aside from that limitation, it is a great game. Not too difficult, but not too easy. I recommend that you purchase this game and try it out for yourself. If you like Sid Meier's other games and you like pirates, you'll like this.			"

												This is a remake of the original from the late 80s (was it early 90s?). It uses the same engine as civ4 and overall does a pretty nice job. You'll love it whether you've played pirates before or not.The sea combat is great, land combat is ok, but drastically improved over the original. Duels are a tad too scripted and easy but get the job done.The dances mini game for wooing potential mates is kind of annoying but it works ok. What doesn't work and what sucks in this game is sneaking into cities. It's a really slow stealth crawl through town and very hard to find the building you are looking for. Dreadful, just try to avoid sneaking around. As in all the other pirates games search for lost treasure at times can be really difficult but it shouldn't be too easy right?Overall I had a great time trying to collect everything in one playthrough. It's so open ended that once you collect everything there isn't a ton of point in replaying but it does have replay value if just like the gameplay.			"

												At first the dancing portion of the game was challenging but after you have played the game for awhile, you can easily memorize the choreography.  It's fairly easy to learn and there has been a few times that the game froze up and had to be re-started.  I enjoy games by Sid Meier and this is one of his older games but it still has entertainment value.  The price is right so I encourage anyone interested to purchase the game.			"

												So basically this is a pirate simulator. You start out as a young guy with a small crew and ship. Years ago an evil pirate breaks up your family leaving you alone and now you're matured you set out on the Caribbean. From there you choose to follow the storyline of getting your family back OR disregard that and lead the life of a stereotypical pirate.Gameplay is a little limited BUT there's a lot of paths you can go. By paths I mean you can choose which time period to live in, choose what life you want to lead, choose whom you ally with (or be a total pirate), a great selection of ships (all customizeable), your personal skill sets. The limited part is that for most of the time you'll be doing the same thing: get a  ship, go plunder other ships, sell items, get gold, talk to people in the town. There's some side things like rescuing people, helping a country out, collecting treasure maps but generally it's the same thing regardless of which path you go.The visuals are very colourful and beautiful. Although the game is old the visuals have a style that still looks good and not dated. The sound is great. The music, although limited to a few key tunes, is very pirate styled and pleasing.So in short although the game is somewhat limited in what you can do it doesn't get boring over time! That's because it is quite immersive, aesthetic, controls well and is just fun! Beautiful graphics and audio and good controls ensure this game doesn't feel dated.7/10			"

												If ye be looking fer' Pirates, you surely found them with this scurvy old title. Clean as a captain's spyglass is the play of the ships and friendly enough fer' lads and lasses of all ages ta' enjoy. Ye be starting with a measly sloop and the entire Carribean be at yer' call. Chase after ye lost family or sack some french ports and marry the Governer's daughter. Pirates be as timeless as the sea herself, an' for just 10 pieces of eight, she be right for the remembering. Yar.Horrible attempts at pirate talk aside, this is by far one of the best games I've ever enjoyed playing. I can remember back when Sid Meier's Pirates had just been released how many endless days were spent sitting in front of my computer screen playing the wars between England and Spain. It's got a special place in my heart.The game plays out as an open-world sandbox where one is free to pursue the noble goals of taking down the top ten most notorious pirates of the carribean and sacking ports. Or if one is feeling a bit less like fighting they can play the relatively simple merchant game of buying goods in one port and sailing them to another for profit. There is the ever present staple of pirate tales where buried treasure maps can be found. Also this portion of the game around your entire family being kidnapped and you needing to rescue them, there's that. However Pirates never directly forces you to do anything. It is a sandbox in the truest sense, at least under all of that water. Ships can be upgraded at the different ports and while learning the map comes naturally you won't be stuck going to the same 4 ports over and over (Unless you choose to, that is.)The combat element plays out in one of four ways. The naval battles between ship and ship feel crisp and polished even despite the game's age. While rudimentery in some ways, ships bombard eachother with broadsides of roundshot, grapeshot, or chainshot. Once enough damage has been dealt or if taking the ship is the goal the ramming of the two ships together will start the swordplay. Swordplay consists of three attacks, three dodges, and one taunt. While basic it is entirely about timing and plays out fairly well. There is a turn-based strategy portion to sacking a port with a landing party but my strategy in this has always been to simply bring more men. The only place where the game falls short is in it's Stealth selection of sneaking into a hostile port. It's not bad, but it does feel a bit slow and very repetitive.Out of all the games I've played or purchased on steam through either my own library or familyshare, this one is by far the best Game-Per-Cash value. At $9.99 it's nice to see a familiar old face pop back up and give me hours of good natured fun. I can't reccomend it enough.			"

You can become a successful trader, marry a princess, be apart of wars, become the most feared pirate of the carribean, have the biggest fleet. Its up to you. This game is a must play for any gamer!			"

												My wife and I love this game so much we decided to make a let's play - who knew a game this old could still keep us hooked after all these years?   I love this game, my wife loves it, my kids love it, even my father in law played for hundreds of ours.  It's appropriate - and fun- for all ages.The combat is simplified, easy and very satisfying - the story is simple and satisfying, the graphics are still beautiful and compare to many modern indie games out there.  Actually now that I think of it, this was one of the first non dungeon rogue like games to come out.  Every game is different and you never know where the seas will take you.Highly recommended and we'd love to connect with other Sid Meier's Pirates players out there!Here is my wife and I playing what we call a thirty minute pirate game

												Arrh! Glad to see that my favorite adventure game of all time has over whelming aproval. My disks were no good, caused by cracking, but when I saw that Steam had it for sale digitally, and at a cheap price, I grabbed it. I have played Pirates since the old Mac classics were out in the late 1980's. I love this version...the best yet!!! Get this and get your gold on! ahoy matie! I am back to capturing more Spanish treasure!			"

												The game is a timeless classic. Along with Railroads, these are two games I could play forever.  Pirates should be remade soon I hope and made to be more complex. But the older versions easily get a 10. So much to do, challenge starting out with just a handful of  money. I have never actually finished the game.

												Basically Mount & Blade but with Pirates and story (A pathetic story, but it's there). Treasure hunting, sailing, trading, ship to ship and sword combat (realtime), raiding towns (turn based).Only downsides I can see are the mutiny mechanic (there's a sort of upkeep system that makes you keep stealing amounts on a regular basis and they get increasingly picky about how you get it) and the aging of the captain (It's a decent length though. My first campaign is still going).If you want a time sink, this is a good one to go with.			"

												I bought this game with low expectations but, with it being on sale and all, I figured ""why not""  - looking to scratch an itch for boarding vessels and some fun swordplay, I went for it.  Whilst not bowled over entirely, this game IS very addictive, and I played it for several long, intensive sessions; certainly getting good value for money in the process.What we have here is more a collection of minigames than anything else; hotkey-based swordplay and dancing, a very detailed sailing simulator (albeit an easy one), and some grid-based TBS thrown in for good measure if you decide to take your crew ashore to plunder a town.A good game, but with limited replayabiility as you tend to find the ""optimum"" build very quickly.  I'd pay £5 for this game.			"

												For many people, the 1985 version was the game they grown on. Well.. for me, this was it. I still remember how I used to play a pirated version of this pirate game in like 3rd grade back in 2004, and I didnt really understand what it meant when my father bought me an actuall disk of the game, since.. well.. I was like 8. But still, I can't even begin thinking how many time I put into this game when I was back in elementry school. While my entire class was playing Pokemon, I played this. Today I am 17 (Which like I said, considered a little kid compared to all the people who enjoyed the older version in 1985 but.. yea.. I dont really care), and even though I dont have as much time to play as I used to, I still enjoy installing this game from time to time and replay it. if it's on a sale and you dont care for outdated graphics, I think you won't regret on purchusing it, even today.

												Its basically what Assassins creed should have been, great little gem of a game Its an open world game where you trade goods and raid ships, working under different countries. You can also claim cities and kill off other notorious pirates to increase your reputation amongst the other countries and pirates, which gives you harder pirates to kill and stronger ships to raid and more loot to have.Just recently got the game, so i only really have the genaral gist of the game but i think it gets a solid 8/10 for the gamplay I really wanted to have playing black flag			"

												Greatest pirate game of it's time (not like there was much competition), and the best pirate game I've ever played. If you don't mind spending a bit of time watching your boat sail against the wind at a snails pace (GODDAMMIT THE WIND ONLY BLOWS TO THE WEST AND I WANNA GO EAST ♥♥♥♥ I'LL BE HERE FOR DAYS), no game I've played yet meets the sense of adventure and purpose that this game provides. With so many ways to pirate, from killing everything you see to finding buried treasure to working for the a nation's military (if only to bone that governor's beautiful daughter), this game stays fresh and fun every time.

												Sid Meier's Pirates another great game from a great game maker. Your family is taken for ransom, you grow to be a teenager and you are ready to set sail to try to free your enslaved family from the evil Colonel.Or you can say SCREW THAT, IMA GO PLUNDER SOME SHIPS!!! You are free to do so :)This is a pirate-sandbox game. Similar to the newly released Pirate Game, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. You can follow the storyline and set free your enslaved family, or you could go out to sea and plunder, get yourself married to a governer's daughter, gather the ships of Blackbeard, Black Bart, and Captain Morgan, upgrade them to their highest, THEN go out and rescue them. This is what I like about Sid Meier's games, its got good sandbox engine to it. The Carribean is HUGE, you could sail for hours and maybe not even get 100% of the content done.The Melee combat is fluid, but a little TOO easy. Just counter when the button flashes, then attack. The ship combat is fun as well, although its very trivial if compared to Black Flag. If you wish to go save your family and THEN take down famous pirates, feel free to do so! It is important to note that you should not split your loot until you feel you are ready to do so, because you will lose some ships and loot and you need all the loot you can get since upgrades and items are expensive, but it makes it so money HAS a use at least. Unlike Black Flag, this game requires you make an effort to keep your ship in good condition and your crew happy, if your crew gets unhappy, they will abandon you. You dont want that.As I said, the Carribean is huge, but honestly in this game, Its kind of TOO big. Black Flag has a function where you can initiate Travel Speed and get where you need to go faster. This game only has half and full sails, and even then, if you dont follow the wind direction, your not gonna get anywhere in the next 5-10 minutes. It should also be worth mentioning that you do NOT have any sort of waypoint system in this game. You have to navigate your way around, which can be a bit difficult, but if your patient, you'll start getting it.So, is this game good? Yes! This is for you if you absolutely love the Golden Age of Piracy and want to experience it in a way.			"

												This game is like 5 games in one: sailing, real time ship battles, fencing, turn based strategy, dancing (Rhythm game), and more. Stick with me here though: what makes classic nintendo games great, is that they are simple enough for a newbie to pick up and enjoy but also evolving with enough depth to grasp a hardcore gamer. THIS IS THAT TYPE OF GAME and what makes Pirates! so great as well. Start out as an apprentice -each time your crew is unhappy, divide the plunder to start refresh and jump to the next diffculty level. The game really progresses from each tier of diffculty nicely til your at the most difficult level and you are like wow, how did this game get to this point, it was so easy at first. The graphics still hold up too! Play this now! Trust me, there is something for everyone in this game.			"

												(This is the 2004 remake of the original game from 1987). Sid Meier's Pirates is a lighthearted swashbuckling romp set during the Age of Discovery.The gameplay basically boils down to a series of minigames; ship-to-ship battles, sword duels, dancing, land battles and treasure hunts.The game is open-ended; there's a 'main quest' of sorts but you can feel free to ignore it if you want. There's plenty of other goals to pursue; find buried treasure, defeat infamous pirates to become the most feared in the Caribbean, track down wanted criminals and collect their bounties, escort ships carrying peace treaties (or betray the nation you're helping and destroy them - war is more profitable than peace for a pirate after all) or just attack everything in sight and amass as much loot as you can.A game won't last forever - your pirate starts the game aged 18 and as time passes in the game he will age and eventually be forced into retirement. If this game has an overall ""goal"" at all it's to have the highest score you can at the time you retire. The game has difficulty levels; on every playthrough after your first you can choose between them - first time starting a new game, you're forced into the easiest difficulty, though there's a way to change it once you get going, too.Unfortunately, I don't feel like the game has much replay value. The minigames (with the exception of ship battles) are repetitive and shallow and I was burned out on the game before I'd seen everything it had to offer (I completed the ""main quest"", went after all the named pirates and then lost interest). The harder difficulty settings feel more frustrating than genuinely challenging, too.Still, I got 25 hours of fun out of this game for £6, so I'd say I got my money's worth; I recommend it. "

												I like this game but the age really limits it's mechanics. It becomes very samey after a few hours. I feel like if there was a sequel to this game made today, it would be really great. So ill list all the bad points first.-Ship travel is often SLOW as hell. Especially if you have to travel against the wind (which never changes direction). It could have done with a minimum speed cap based on the ship you have.-Basic sword fighting. The sword fights are all the same and are quickly cheesed with fast attacks.-Not much to do. You can marry a daughter (one), Kill 9 other pirates, rank up with each faction, tresure hunt, and do  the main story line. Sounds like a lot on paper but then you realize killing pirates are the same as fighting any other person in the game, Ranking up is exactly the same in each faction, each daughter requires the same exact things, and the main story is mostly more pirate hunting stuff. Its extremly limited in variation.-There really isnt much of a story anyway. Its got open world-itus which means you can go anywhere at anytime but there isnt any structure. The pacing is god awful. and it takes forever to get to the next story point. In the 6 hours I have played (never played it before) I got to the highest rank in the english faction as well as midway in the other 3, killed all other 9 pirates, had married a daughter and romanced 4 others high enough to marry if I wasnt already, Saved 3 family members in the main story (which involves killing the SAME guy over and over) and gotten most of the items in the game.All that said though, I did enjoy myself for the most part. The only part I really hated was just how slow ship travel is which would entail me watching a video on another screen while my ship traveled across the map for 10 minutes. I do think its worth picking up if its on sale for very cheap and I do think you will have a decent time with it for a few hours.Its just held back due to the time period it was released in. Unfortunatley the mechanics dont hold up as well in this day and age. Im surprised a sequel hasnt been made yet seeing the love for the ship battles in Assassins Creed Black Flag though. I feel like it would do wonderfully in the market right now.			"

												This game is fun But... be warned this game has an EXTREME difficulty curve! If you play too fast you wont be able to progress. This is do to your character aging and technology progressing, as well as young skilled competition coming on the scene. This is the only real problem with this game.			"

												A true gem, played this game for weeks on end when it first came out.  Still bust it out from time to time as there's no other game that quite satisfies the swashbuckling itch like Pirates!  This and Pirates of the Caribbean (Sea Dogs 2) are without a doubt the best Pirate games of all time.Edit:  My playtime is low on Steam because I've owned the CD-ROM since the game released in 2005			"

												Where to start..... Unlike alot of these reviewers, i had not played this before, i walked into this game completely blind. So, the fact that theres no nostaligia involved here, my review is for those who have never played or heard of this game before. Theres no tutorial or manual to speak of, but to be honest this game dosnt really need one. Its an rpg, so if youve palyed previous rpgs like me, you'll have a basic understanding of what your doing. If you havnt played one before then this would be an excellent first choice. So, your thrust into this open world pirate game with nothing but a back story, which i might add is not narrated in the slightest. In fact, i think the reason theres so much content in this game is because they didnt do any voice acting AT ALL. Theres just mostly grunts or the wooing of ladies for ""dialog"". But besides the lack of voice acting, the game is damn near perfect. There is SO much to do in this world. Without any spoilers, You have to save your family, become a top notch pirate, track down criminals, defeat pirates based off of real life ones such as Captain Kidd and Black Beard, pillage ships, raids towns, dance with the ladies, ship battles, fleet managments, sell plunder, buy food stocks, get unique items, upgrade your ship, get special crew members, conquer cities in a board game like rts mode, search for buried treasure, get promotions, gain land, ect. And thats probably half of what there is. At this point im only 10 hours in the game and i have already done all of that, and there is just so much more to do. If your a fan of pirates or Rpgs, GET THIS GAME AND GET IT NOW!!! It's only 10 dollars for so so SO much content, and the replayability is off the charts! Do yourself a favor, and buy this game and pray they make another one!			"

												Arrr me maties! To this date the best game for you to become the most badass pirate ever! Beautiful sandbox-like gameplay, a true gem, sadly overlooked by many people. I really don't have much to criticize - perhaps the lack of a proper story. But what the game has to offer (which is sailing around with ships, battling others, duels, sieging cities and many other things) is really good.And unlike Assassins Creed 4, there is actually kinda realistic morale element where your crew can revolt when you're too long at sea, or you're not very succesful pirate. Game itself is easy to jump in, but certainly provides more than a decent challenge.Ship ahoy!			"

												This is basically Mount and Blade's campaign mode but instead of visceral, gory combat holding the whole thing together, we have pirate-themed quicktime event minigames. And yet, it works! I found the lack of variety pretty stunting around hour 4 though, and I doubt I'll finish it. In the ~five hours I played I completed about 10% of the actual main storyline (granted, I spent almost all that time ♥♥♥♥in' around). So, uh, yeah. If you liked running from camp to camp, building up an army, gearing them up, then watching as they all get taken away in one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t battle, you can do that here. Except, y'know, no battle. Pirate minigame.			"

												Let me start off by saying that I love this game so much that I almost felt like I was cheating on my wife when I bought it anew last night. I bought it on the day that it originally came out, and spent actual DAYS playing the game, only stopping to eat, bathe, and go to the bathroom. I don't think that I slept more than eight total hours in that first week, and my name was known, loved, and feared throughout the Caribbean. More so than in any other Sid Meier game before or since, I was completely engulfed by this game to the point of addiction.Then, you know, life (and other games) happened.So, flash forward a few years and I saw that it was on Steam. How well did it hold up? Would I fire it up, laugh at the dated gfx and gameplay, never to play again? Would it be like I'd never stopped playing and find myself engulfed into the game again? I downloaded it last night, and have already racked up seven, almost eight hours. Gfx and some clunky and (now) counter-intuitive gameplay aside, I still love this game and thought it was absolutely worth the $10 to buy it again. It's just as fun as I remembered, although I do confess that I still hate the dancing portion of the game! Absolutely recommended!My only REAL gripe is with the sound. It's not that it's dated, it's just that when you're playing the game, you have no choice but to either turn off the sound altogether OR you're forced to listen to the same... jaunty... pirate... ditties... again... and... again... and... Imagine being forced to listen to the sound of a dentist's drill or your favorite child's death rattle on infinite loop - this is the quality of the music. While you can go into the system properties and turn off the music, that's only the music for cut scenes and the like - the in-game music is tied irrevokably to the sound effects, so no cannonfire, no sound of the wind... unless you're willing to listen to monkey-grinder music.

A classic. One of my favorite games of all time.Personal overall rating: 9/10I've played this game for almost 9 years now! Just got it on my computer a few days ago and, wow... It's so much better. I first played it on Xbox, then psp, then got it for my 360, and now have it for my computer. Of course, this is the best version of the game. ALL HAIL THE MASTER RACEOPTIONS MENU:The Video settings has 9 options. Picture Gamma, Water Detail, Object Detail, World Detail, Resolution, Shadows, Advanced Lighting, Trillinear Filtering, & Shaders. It's an old game, most computers will be able to handle it with the settings turned up relatively high. The Audio Settings has a Master Volume slider, Music Volume, Sound FX Volume, Dance Music Volume, and a 3D Sound Driver toggle. The Modify Ship's Sails and Flags option changes your ship's flag appearance and the logo/crest on your main sail. There's 6 crests/logos for your sail. 1.Dutch: Greater Coat of Arms of The Netherlands, 2.English: St George Crest, 3.French: Royal Coat of Arms of The Kingdom of France, 4.Indians: Tribal Tiki Logo, 5.Pirates: Jolly Roger Crest, 6.Spanish: Coat of Arms of Toledo.There are 5 flags, the Flags are 1.Dutch: Orange flag with a green xing emblem, 2.English: White flag with a red St George cross, 3.French: Blue flag with a gold Flour De Les emblem. 4.Pirates: Black flag with a white Jolly Roger. 5.Spanish: Yellow flag with a black Royal Lion. GRAPHICS:It's an old game. It's not exactly pretty. The game looks best while you're out sailing. There is noticeable aliasing, mushy textures, and choppy animations. The water refelction is decent. The explosion effect during ship battles when cannonballs make contact and when ships explode is awesome. It's the game's strongest point graphically. The way the colors of the sea blend together is nice as well. STORY:The story is kind of weird. An evil Spanish nobleman (the Marquis de la Montalbán) interupts a dinner party consisting of you and your family. Your family is in debt to him. When you see him, you immediatley know he has bad intentions, so you bolt passed him through the door. He takes your family. They become slaves. You survive on your own for the next 10 years. You begin your young adulthood joining a faction (Dutch, English, French, or Spanish). You serve on a ship where a cruel captain is in charge. Tired of being abused and insulted by the captain, you and your mates rally up and form a mutiny against him. You boot him from the ship, and take charge. You're the captain now, and realize this is the perfect opportunity to find your lost family. PLAYING THE GAME:Sailing is a ton of fun. The feeling of adventure you get from cruising the sea is so satisfying. Playing a game that isn't the same copy paste recipe as every other game in itself is extremely satisfying. There's open sea adventure, epic ship battles, duels, city invasions, sneaking through hostile towns, treasure hunting, pirate hunting, and the wonderful ability to do whatever you want. Live the pirate life your way. You can gain new items for your character like dual pistols and some well crafted swords. You can aquire new ships and give them upgrades. You can even name your ships as well as your character of course. You'll be addressed by your character's name by the other people in the game. They address you by your surname, so when creating your character make sure you name them by their last name. Anyways but yea, that's the game. You build up your crew, and become the deadliest pirate to ever live. Please try the game. It's cheap, it's fun. You'll enjoy it. Please just try it.			"

												This is a fantastic game that has managed to age quite well in my opinion. I purchased this game initially off the Xbox Marketplace and enjoyed it thoroughly on console, when I saw they had done something of a revisting of sorts I was excited and pleasantly rewarded with an even better experience. The only thing I wish is that they'd make another one with more options for your character and perhaps a more in-depth combat system. Get this game if you want something that doesn't require a lot of time dedication, is fun and accessible, and you like pirates and 17th Century naval combat.			"

												Why is this game so good? If you look at it from an objective PoV, this is just a collection of repetitive minigames (there's a swordfighting, which is basically a rythm game; Dancing, which is literally a rythm game; Theres a siege which has some strategical options but basically coes down to ""more troops win""; And a naval battle which becomes somewhat boring as you realize the AI is really dumb at it). On the top of it all is a fairly simple resource management system (basically, have food) and ""get from point A to point B"" system which is a slog, especially if you are travelling from west to east.This doesnt sound too good now, does it. So why is this game so good? I played the heck out of the original about 20 years ago on a Commodore64, and again about 10 years ago when this version came out. And yesterday I bought the Steam version and I just wanted to fire it up for a while to see how it runs, and then somehow I played almost 8 hours straight without even moving from my chair or noticing the time.During that 8 hours, I - raided countless ships - Always showed mercy to the lads who wanted to come aboard- became the most notorious pirate on the entire spanish main- Found Blackbeard's legendary buried treasure between a tree with a dead man hanging and an Inca temple- Sacked Havana twice- elected a dutch govenor there - Found out the new govenor's daughter is actually beautiful- became pretty good at pressing buttons while dancing- I fenced with her fincée- Then I rescued her from captivity - and married her (which turned out was a pretty bad idea since traveling from Havana to anywhere is actually a slugfest)- I found two of my long- lost relatives - kicked the ♥♥♥♥ of Evil Baron Raymondo a dozen times - defeated the long-standing enemy of my family Marquis Montalban (who is now my cabin boy) - and found the legendary lost city of the Incas.So there you have it. I think the strongpoints of the game is the athmosphere, living the pirate dream, and all the stories you make up for yourself. The game has a really vibrant world and the sandbox frame lets you fill it with your own stories. And of course there is that ""just lets dig up this one more treasure then I'll go to sleep for real"" vibe.Tow remarks at the end, one: For some reason the FPS drops if you fire with anything other than normal cannonballs. Second: I can kinda recommend this game for kids. There is some non- depicted killling during battles, but there is no violence or gore during swordfights. Also there are some big blossoms but no nudity. The atmoshpere is bright and the game is simple to play.			"

If your a fan of pirates or Rpgs, GET THIS GAME AND GET IT NOW!!! It's only 10 dollars for so so SO much content, and the replayability is off the charts! Do yourself a favor, and buy this game and pray they make another one!			"

												TL;DR for the super ♥♥♥♥ing lazy:The Good: Sid Meyer's Pirates.The Bad: It's not 1987 anymore and hasn't been for a couple years, at least..I don't feel the game has aged really well - games have come a long way. If you remember the old Pirates! fondly, this might shatter your nostalgic illusions a little.But that said, it is exactly what it's supposed to be, it works, and it's still an ok way to kill some time when you just want a nice, casual game.

												This is one of the best pirate themed video games ever made, and the game that most pirate themed games end up taking their inspiration from. It's easy to pick up and play yet there's a lot of complexity here too. From bounties to allegiances to trading there are a lot of things you can do here yet you can also just sail around capturing ships & pillaging. The main thing I like about this is the fact that no matter what you do you never feel bored. You never run out of stuff to do, and you're always accomplishing stuff. Goals can be challenging but they're never so impossible that they get too frustrating. This is a great title that will challenge you and even if you fail at a challenge it never punishes you for it. It gives you many chances to come back later when you're more prepared for it. All in all one of the best games I've ever played, and certainly one of the best pirate games ever.			"

												Disappointing.  I really want to like this game but it has some issues.  There are some bugs that can pop up and make life annoying, such as getting stuck different places in your ship.  For example, I was captured and then bribed my way out of Havana.  My ship ended up on the opposite side of the island, glued to the shore.  No way to get off the beach.  Only thing to do is go to last save point.  I've also been trapped near towns with sand bars near, having to constantly answer the pop up ""do you want to anchor or sail away?"" while attempting to navigate away in the split second allowed.  Game is really, really simple.  Kind of surprising, given Sid Meier's other games.  Overly simple/devoid of features in many ways.  Can't do anything with land you're granted.  Can't invade enemy towns unless they have a garrison.  Can only attack convoys with one ship at a time, no matter how many ships you have.  Convoy gets all ships.  You can accidentally sell the cannons off your ship and end up defenseless.  If enemies capture a ship of yours, you can't capture it back, it just disappears.			"

												Though I put quite a few hours into this game my lasting impression is that it's not very enjoyable.  The concept itself is good, but the game becomes very repetitive and the play balance on harder difficulties is completely bonkers.  Late game on Rogue difficulty I lost a ship to only three hits, when fighting other ships of the same type I would hit them twenty times or more before they would sink.  The AI gets special abilities like attacking you on the strategic map, and the late ""quests"" of endgame are simply finding and fighting the same guy over and over again until you get a map to go and fight him again in some place in the middle of no where. And while the game has a lot of ""mini-games"", man of these are simply not compelling.   The game has a lot of content but all that content is ultimately light on depth, and despite playing the game to its conclusion and getting a Fame score of 106 my ""victory"" was little more than a page of text.  Why not a simple cinematic?If you get it cheap, play it, then go on to something with more enduring quality and depth.			"

												I heard so much about this game and I love Civilization that I had to try it.  It was meh.  I think nostalgia clouds too many minds on how wonderful this game is.  It's not bad, it just isn't all that special. There isn't a real storyline (they kind of make a basic quest of finding your family which isn't very exciting) and maybe that would have spiced the game up for me.  I love a good story.  It just throws you in there and you just start living the life of a pirate captain which is great if you don't like being shackled to linear game play.  Felt like a chore going back and forth on the map at a snail's pace and I just wasn't having fun.  I gave up after realizing how many times I had to trek back and forth and I didn't want to waste my time with it.  I feel like this would work as a casual game on a mobile device that you could play for a bit, put it down, and pick it up later.  The dancing sequences are annoying, the sword fights are all the same and get boring, and trying to catch the wind in your sails was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.  I feel there are more engaging choices out there.			"

												Hahaha, these upset fangirls.  I guess the truth does hurt.I should've stopped playing this a couple hours in, but I wanted to give the game a chance to get better.  It's too bad that it never does.Let's start with what looks good about this game.  Decent sized world, four nations to work for/against to gain rank, NPC ships attack one another, nations declare war and peace against one another, nations capture each others ports, many types of ships, freedom to do what you want, trading, pirating, making a fleet, sword fighting, romance, treasure hunting, rescuing family, finding lost cities, storms at sea, crew mutinies, bringing down pirates, and even other stuff.  It sounds awesome.  It's too bad most of the things that happen are pointless and half of the game is tedious minigames.I'd say about 50% of your time will be spent playing the minigames, so lets start with them.  There are several minigames including sea battles, sword-fights, dancing, land navigation, sneaking, and ground battles.  Most of the minigames you'll play will be the first three.  They're ok at first, but you'll play those same minigames over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.  Did you get tired of reading that? That's how I felt about those first three minigames after playing them 15 times.  Then realize in a playthrough that you'll play those three anywhere from 60-100+ times.  Imagine playing Mario Party, except it only has 6 mediocre minigames, and it only selects 3 of those minigames 90% of the time.  Then play that Mario Party for 10-13 hours.  That's what playing through Sid Meier's Pirates feels like.  I have absolutely no idea how anyone could tolerate multiple playthroughs of this mindless dreck.The other 50% of the time spent sailing would've been alright, except for the wind.  Do you like sailing west?  No worries, because the wind has got your back.  At some point though, you're going to need to sail back east.  You will.. do... this.... at.... a.... snail's.... pace.... against.... the.... wind.... Oh... here... comes... a... cloud... to.. speed me back up and.. it's... gone.... Time.... to.... take.... a.... nap....  I hated sailing anywhere in the west.  There were times when I'd set sail east, walk out of the room for a bit, come back, and still not be at my destination.  Nothing interesting ever happens while you're out at sea either.  You'll never be in danger of running out of food.  I often had multiple years worth of food from sacking ships.  I'd go into ports selling it off.  It's cool to see a Treasure Ship or Military Payroll for the first time, but by the 5th time, it's not quite so exciting, and by the 10th time, you won't even bother plundering them unless it keeps your crew from going to mutiny status.  The most exciting thing that happens out on the sea is accidentally running into one of the main quest enemies.  This is only exciting because it saves you 10 minutes of boredom finding out where they're headed and spending time tracking them down.  Also somewhat annoying is that occasionally the game will launch you out of a port straight into some rocks which damage your ship.  If you have a large fleet, instead of following your path, they do their own thing.  This often includes taking damage when they sail into rocks that you manuevered around but they decided would make an excellent path.I could've probably tolerated all of that stuff if the rest of the game made up for it, but it doesn't.  The game has no objective and nothing you do matters.  Doesn't matter whether you save your family, or rank up with each nation, or take out all the top pirates or do anything.  The game ends whenever you feel like it should end and retire.  One nation declares war or peace on another nation, doesn't impact you at all.  NPC ship sinks another npc ship, it'll respawn.  One nation conquers another nation's port, doesn't matter, can still sail in there and do all the same things I could've done anyway.  Pirates sack a port, doesn't matter.  Want to buy some of the cool stuff that guy in the corner sells, crew gets mutinous.  Amass a nice fleet, doesn't matter, only your flagship fights in battles and your crew will become mutinous and you'll have to divide the plunder and go back to 1 ship anyway.  You're the top pirate in the land, doesn't affect a thing.  Saved all your family, does nothing.  Want to save your family?  Have fun hunting down Baron Raymondo and waiting for him to respawn 12-16 times to get all the maps pieces.  Have fun sword fighting that same guy behind the bar 25 times that the dancing minigame gives you as a quest.  I completed most of the main objectives, aside from nation ranks, but gave up and retired when my wife expected me to dance with her 8 more times for the rest of the lost city map pieces.Maybe the problem is that I played Uncharted Waters on the Sega Genesis and know what a good pirate game should be.  This entire game is a tedious grind where nothing you do matters.			"

												An old game with old game problems.Some minor bugs with Steam and DirectX that can be easily fixed.The main problem is the lack os native widescreen support. There is a couple of fixes available, but if you apply any of them, the HUD, some buttons and texts stays partially off screen. If that isn't bad enough, to click on some buttons you'll need to click outside then for them to work. It gets very frustrating to play this way.If you don't apply the resolution fix, you get stuck with 4:3 aspect ratio resolutions and using this with widescreen, everything will get stretched. "

												I bought this game on sale as I was looking through the lunar sale offers and came across it.From my childhood I remember my dad playing this as I watched and he recently told me he started playing it again. I bought it and while I don't regret my purchase, I can't recommend it either. For the time it was released, this was an awesome game.Now...Widescreen resolutions makes the game crash on Windows 10 and when I tried buying a diamond necklace at the tavern, it crashed again for some reason, even though I've bought anything else I've come across without issues.Maybe it's meant to be that way, but the dancing minigame is horrible, every guide says to follow the rythm of the music, but even as I press the required key, I lose my progress if I had any. Only thing that works is to press slightly after you'd think it would fit with the music and the rythm, but this is just making it incredibly hard to time right.If you've played this game before,you won't need my review, if you haven't, don't buy it. It's outdated and crashy on newer systems.			"

												Played this game when it first came out as a teenager. Great game.15 minutes into the game my ship got stuck on land. kept spamming want to"" sail away or send a landing party"". I tried to sail away ... wouldn't work. decided to start a new game. In the new game, after visiting the first city when tried to leave, it put me back in the same stocked shipped from the previous game !!! apparently this is a known issue and you need to uninstall and install the game again for it to fix,As much as I love to play the game for the nostalgia .. I am going to pass. Don't want to play for hours and then the same s**t happen. In this day and age these kinds of bugs are not acceptable			"

												Not sure why this gets so many great reviews but I just didn't like this game and if it were possible I would have looked into a refund. The whole thing reminded me of a Disney Movie, with the campy cartoonish characters, little to no story to speak of, no managing a pirate fleet, combat was way to simplistic and seemingly made for 8 year olds. I guess I wanted to raise a pirate fleet and take over the seas, micromanage the ships and crews and had combat be a bit more interesting than this. No fast travel either. It's cheap and if you got little kids then buy this but if you are looking for a more realistic pirate experience this isn't it.			"

												It blows my mind how this gets any positive reviews. I suppose everything will have it's lovers and haters. Count me in the latter category.I typically love Sid Miere's games too. NEVER have I run into more outdated controls in my life. Even playing it at moderate difficulty levels I found this ""game"" to be more stress-inducing than a flight being canceled at the busiest airport while being forced to take two final exams in chemistry and 16th Century Literaure all at the same time. CONS:- The AI will generally always counter your sword attacks, while countering it's own requires PRECISE timing or else. - Adapts and speed up dance challenges, to the point where the odds of winning are slim to none.- You'll generally ALWAYS be placed upwind in ship battles, making manuvering nigh impossible. Meanwhile, AI ships will dance circles around you- The winds tend to blow extremely fast in one direction (west in my experience) making travel in the opposite direction very tedious and time-consuming.PROS:- Immersive, the general atmosphere is great- The music is simple but lovely- Fun, when the difficulty is balanced [usually never] (even at lower difficulties it's an imbalanced game)All in all I can't say I enjoyed my time with this title. In fact, I believe it gave me muscle cramps due to the stress it induced. I'm glad I only spent $2.50 on it during a sale, but I can say it was $2.50 wasted "

												Ugh, so much abou this game drives me CRAZY, but so much of it is fun too. The fun part is mostly due to open-world sandbox play, with no scripted gameplay, you can just sail around and do what you want. The good is pretty good. The bad is absolutely a deal breaker, though. The dancing thing with the governor daughter is impossible on the PC. I played this to death on the Xbox with no problems but this stupid PC version gives you 1/10th of a second to respond to the dancing bullcrap which made that part of the game unbelievably frustrating--on par with the buggy SM Railroads. The ships get stuck on land masses and LAUNCH like a rocket out of ports so you have to hit pause every time you leave a port. ANNOYING! In summary, it's too buggy and annoying for repeat play. the old Xbox version of possibly iPad version are better choices for this game. This PC original is not worth playing.			"

												I bought this game a long time ago but only play recently... This game is really repetitive and boring can make you have fun for some hour but after is really boring.The main story is really poor and is really frustratting to proceed because everytime i got a help and get where they say to go the guy is allready gone, i'm fine with that i mean is really immersive way BUT you got there and nobody else give you task you just go around and hope someone will say something because is random the task in the city! I mean you can go around for half hour or more and don't proceed with the story!The subquest in everycity is copypasted... You proceed defeat everyone and got a girlfriend in everycity with the same pattern...I like the idea and the concept but is really old game and not really worth to buy now.Maybe back in time was a really good game but don't buy it now.

												I wish ratings was not yes or no. Im giving it a no just because the ratings are too high. See, it is a great game for its time. But theres a few annoying parts. It cant be called an adventure game because you are restricted to the caribean and you do not feel like an adventurer. Not the improved 'uncharted waters' I hoped for. The challenge is too wimpy at first- get your attack speed up and mash buttons in duels to win every battle- then becomes too hard. But most annoying of all there is no tutorials. I have played this long and became #1 pirate, and dont know HTF dueling (the main thing in the game) even works, the controlls seem to suck. Dancing seemed impossibly hard. Granted I am playing as adventurer captain (hard difficulty) but that stuff should have been explained by the time I finished my 6th pirating carreer. You cant really customize your ship. And trading stinks, you really cant make any money at it. For the record I do recommend it anyways if it is on sale.Some things I find quite great is the ship to ship battles take a lot of skill, and has quite a lot of depth. And when you attack a town the game turns into a nearly full strategy game.If I or anyone else could mod the game for even a few months, it would be great. But as is it just slightly below wonderfull, just a collectors item from another time.			"

Compatibility modes don't work, and you'll get an error ""Unable to find Steam"" if you try.The game in its current state needs to be taken off of Steam until fixed, since it's largely unplayable.

												If you REALLY want to play this game, download it on your phone from your carrier's app store for $0.99. The phone version has everything this one does, for less money and you can play it anywhere. I thought the PC version would have more features and whatnot, but it doesn't. It's just a waste of money.			"

												It becomes rather repitive after a short while. Once you've danced with 1 governors daugther, you've danced with them all, 1 seabattle is the same as all others, the same goes for swordfights. You'll be spending a lot of time sailing and at some point you don't even bother to fight the battles, which you can choose as hardly anyone wants to attack you. When you want to complete the questline you'll kill the bad guy about 4 times.			"

												It's from 2005, but feels even more oldschool.It presents the kind of fun you don't find in newer games, where everything is streamlined and sugercoated for the users. This is the kind of game that has initially a very steep learning curve but eases up quickly as you go along and that in it self is a pleasure new games rarely give.It's got just a bit too many flaws to be a really good game, but the few hours i put into it was filled with fun and joy. On sale if you like pirates and want a bit of the old games feeling, go ahead and get it. But i don't think anyone has the patience to spend too much time on it.			"

												So much promise but age and/or operating systems have brought down what Pirates could be.The first problem I encountered was an absolutely ridiculous graphical glitch with the sails and flags of the ships. I would boil it down to a physx issue, but I don’t think that technology even existed when Pirates was released. Basically what would happen is that when the wind blew a certain direction, any fabric on screen would stretch to infinity and obscure 60-70% of the screen. The next issue I had was that for some reason the primary method of control (awkwardly using the number pad) straight up did not work. I tried a different keyboard as well as an old PS2 board and neither allowed any of the diagonal buttons to register.I’m not a computer genius or anything, but I can’t imagine all the technical problems I had running the game being anything more than driver issues and modern operating system changes. If you have an older XP system I bet this game is amazing, from the little bit I suffered through, there was so much awesome content. But if you own a modern gaming computer, just be aware that this game may not play nice with your setup.			"

												Maybe I don't get this game, or it just wasn't running properly on my computer. A slow and choppy game, Pirates is a baisc open world Pirate game where you sail around trading and plundering.The trade mechanic worked fairly identically to most games with a trade mechanic, and was fine, but the actual pirate battles were fairly lackluster, mostly involving a bit of maneuvering and a whole lot of patience. While you can build up a fleet of ships, this is mostly for maximizing your cargo capacity, and not really for getting increases in combat bonuses (at least as far as I could tell). You can only ever bring one ship into battle, which kept the gameplay very light. If there is depth to be found in this game, I was too frustruated by the incredibly slow pacing to find it.			"

												It's not that this is an old game, it's that this game isn't very good.  Gameplay is instantly repetitive and dull, very little risk, all reward, but no real action.  Sea battles make no sense, guns don't matter, all you do is ram the ship, hit a few buttons to defeat the captain, loot.  Dancing with girls mini game is just silly.  Mechanics make no sense.  Split loot disbands your fleet and you lose all your money?  Why would you ever do that?  Retire ends the game?  Why would you ever do that?  No clear benefits to upgrading ships, again because all you do is ram other ships and duel.  No clear point to hiring more men, just more mouths to feed for no reason.  Overall, just a terrible game that you throw away after half an hour.			"

												In this game you take a role of privateer or pirate. You can work for either English, French, Dutch or Spanish - or even for all of them if you time your actions well. There's constantly changing basic economic and political system where player's actions do affect on the bigger picture as well. You can sail, capture ships, fight pirates, trade, do missions, dance with governors daughters and so on. There's many goals to fullfill and many ways to play. Because there's different eras to choose from and the world is open, dynamic and reactive the gaming experience does change lot. There's also different difficulty levels which do have effect. Game's replayability value is quite high and you can get it cheaply, especially on sale. Technically speaking I have been playing this game for something like 30 years from it's early versions on Commodore 64. From those early days they have added more content and huge haul in graphics but the core is same. And it works. Still one of the best, if not best, pirate games there are.			"

												Just picture it- Your flagship, a host of galleon's stuffed with spice and sugar, each pirated by a skeleton crew under the watchful eye of your Frigate 'Banshee'. From the aft deck, you stand, uniform tugged by the breeze, gazing back at the spanish main. It's cities burn as people dig through the ashes or else cower under the new governor's you've appointed whom now reign over the new dominions of your country. A great host of men have gathered beneath you, grumbling about being packed like sardines in their triple hammocks but still, eagerly awaiting their share of over one hundred thousand in newly minted Spanish doubloon's. The Spanish, whose military has so spectacularly failed to halt your onslaught now watch in disarray for the dark smudge of smoke on the horizon, a precursor, heralding the terror to come. For the greatest pirate ever to sail, has come to visit and even though the bounty on his head has climbed 'ten thousand, thirty, fifty thousand doubloons?!' still nobody would take them, for none cross....you!I've been playing this game for years now, it's my every now and then game where I'll play one or two careers. Even though it's old, I still get a great kick. It's terribly easy until you're at least a Rougue Captain, but as your character ages, you become slower and all skill fade with age. It's a good, quickish game which will instantly make you happy.If you're not into older games, then this one isn't for you. It is limited in areas, but it's the perfect game for people who enjoy funny, non taxing games that don't require considerable time or background attention or anyone who enjoys Sid Meier as a rule.

												This is a classic game that continues to impress. It's a little difficult to describe, though. You play the role of a young ship captain who is free to roam the caribbean. There are four major powers that control the region. The English, Dutch, Spanish  and the French. You can choose to serve one of them, all of them or none. You patrol the sea looking for targets of opportunity. If you choose to join a nation, you can legally attack their enemies. This is good for when the war ends. It means that nothing was personal and that your former enemies will allow you to pass by without any trouble. You don't have to do that though. You can choose to attack all of them, but then you will have to rely of pirate havens for supplies and repairs. To sum it up: It's a great game that will keep you coming back for more. The only real problem I have with it is the fact that I cannot raise the resolution above 800x600 or the game might crash.			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates! (for kiddies) still remember playing this game when I was a kid and when seeing it on a steam sale there was no way to refuse some nostalgia drive. Now that aside, the game mechanics are so dumbed down that even my beagle could play it (gee... that dog has some serious A.D.D), you go from port to port choosing whom you want to serve (or if you want to be a real pirate and target just about anyone).Wind doesn't really affect you much early on (neither does the enemy forces, you can conquer towns with just about a rag-tag bunch of pirates and take over war galleons with your starting ship easily), gaining the heart of a governors daughter (and acquiring useful items) can be as easy as to dance with her a couple of times while you visit a port and talk to its gov and then giving some gifts to her (if it only were that easy... wait... sometimes it is :O )Your crewmates are great, have a lot of personality and background, they will sail with you 'till the end of your days....... nah just kidding they get annoyed if you gather a lot of $ or stuff and don't divide it, dunno about how blackbeard did stuff but I'd be hell lucky being a pirate and quitting after just one year of going around looting and killing and plundering and stealing governor's daughters and.... you get the point.But honestly, all in all, there's some really good fun to be had here, get it on a sale, play it from time to time and you'll get your kicks out of it I know I do.

												One of the best games from when I was younger. I don't like that your character ages the way that he does, but that's a petty quibble. My least favorite part of this game is that the wind seems to be locked to the West via glitch, so traveling East is very slow much of the time. All in all a VERY fun game. Very much worth playing.

												I originally bought this game off a scholastic reading catalog in 4th grade. My brothers and I would play it for hours obviously and would never be able to find his lost family and ever beat the game. That being said we had a blast sailing around the Caribbean and Spanish main doing pillaging and retiring as rich badasses with the governor of Port Royal’s daughter. The game is still fun even though I now find it very easy. All in all its a good game. If for whatever reason you don’t feel like shelling out ten dollars for it wait for a sale. It’s worth the buy.

												Why they don't remake this, I don't know. The wide open world allows a lot of freedom in your actions, however should you be a completionist, then there is a slightly repetitive main plot where you find your lost family members. The only other issue I have with the game is that it can be a little too easy at times, for example I left the port at St Kitts to be confronted by Henry Morgan, the most notorious pirate of all time... To only thrash him later by ramming his ship and then wrecking him with a rapier. Overall, it is a good game although it can be a bit slow at times.			"

												Ah Sid Meier how you love to make people waste their entire day away on just one video game. He does it well that's for sure, and Pirates (Next to civilization) Shows this better than anything. With this 2004 release being the best.Pros:-Very Piratey...Yohohoho.-Capturing, Plundering, and Digging up treasure never gets old.-The game let's you increase the difficulty the farther you get in the game-Restoring your family feels good-There's a good amount of upgrades-Pillaging Towns is the best part in my view. It acts as a Turn Bases Strategy, with some nice mechanics-You can Fight actual pirates like Black Beard.Cons:-If you can't control yourself while playing video games. Then STAY FAR AWAY! This game will take your entire life in a blink of an eye.-It's very tedious. If you can't stand grinding you will hate this game.-Dancing STINKS! If you don't have a good num pad then good luck trying to play that minigame.Overall if you like being a pirate then pick this up. Oh but remember something. The Spainish are the best to raid. (SO MUCH MONEY!)			"

												This game is great. In fact, it's probably one of the most fun games I've ever played. You get to live the fantasy of being a pirate...not with all the realities of wasting months of your life on the sea and all the infections that come with that, but you get to fire cannons and have sword fights on deck and raid colonial fortresses and dance with the governors' beautiful daughters. There is plenty of variety in what you can do in this game. If you're tired of capturing ships for profit, go take an outpost for your favorite nation; search for buried treasure; play the main story line; hunt down famous pirates; get captured just so you can have fun sneaking out of jail. This game never gets boring, and the difficulty levels are sufficient to either give you a leisurely stroll through the Caribbean or a truly gripping fight at sea. Highly recommend it.			"

(There is a group of people working on a getting it running again for free ) Any how I came across this game while looking for pirate themed games and its great! I dont like that the wind doesnt change dirction which makes the ship battles a little repetitive and you have to divide the plunder so often meaning you lose all the ships you collected and all you crew leave. Also the aging factor is really annoying. But it is a fun little game.			"

												I know what you are thinking already.  This?  Seriously?!?No BS, this game will suck hours out of your life like the government sucks money out of your wallet.  It is insane how much fun it is to try and get a broadside in on a Spanish trade vessel, or maneuver armies in attempts to take out cities.  Not to mention the sandbox environment, probably the first.  There are so many options to choose how to play the game, you will probably take a long time to play the same game twice, unless you do it intentionally.  Probably the best part though, is how easy it is to pick up and put down.  Only have ten minutes?  No problem, raid a couple spanish ships, hit save and quit and boom, your done.  ::Aside; what ever happened to such a simple function?::No matter the computer, whether laptop or gaming rig, Sid Meier's Pirates will have a place on the hard drive, right by Solitaire.

												After putting in my 40+ hours at the desk job, it's nice to come home to a rewarding game that doesn't require too much brain power.  At around ten dollars, this kept me entertained, relaxed, and engaged for most of a weekend.  It is well worth the cost.  Many developers now are pushing for a more real-life experience with darker visuals and more deeply challenging  game play, but I don't want to play those types of games all the time.  There's still plenty of room left on the SSD for brighter, happier visuals and simpler, joyful games.  I did run into a bug once where my ship got stuck, but the fix is to reload the last autosave battle, and you're unstuck... no big deal.			"

												I was playing Pirates! for a year after it came out on PSP. I borrowed it as often as I could from the library and played so much I recognized where every treasure could spawn at from one scrap of the map. I would dedicate entire days to me lying on the couch, trying to sack a new town for the Dutch. I became so skilled that I wouldn't be slowed on the hardest difficulty.However, even with all of that work, I never 100% completed the game. It's so easy to get caught up in the politics, treasure hunting, intregue, and dancing. This game can keep you so busy that you'll be retired before you know it.The only way for this game to be made better is to release an HD remake (or sequal) with some minor adjustments:Improved graphics (better textures, water effects, etc)Improved framerate (60+ would be ideal)Custom keybinding and controller supportModding support Other than that, it's a really good game. 9/10			"

												This game was essential to my Childhood. Along with the Civ games, and many an MMO, this game DEFINED part of my gaming legacy. Totally worth it. The Combat mechanics are interesting, and given when it came out, it looks good, even now. granted, an HD reboot would be NICE but hell, this game totally stands the test of time.			"

												This is still the best pirate game out there with hours of fun, minigames fill the game at every corner. The difficulty changes at will after dividing the plunder and it really does change. Capture ships and towns, romance the governers dauter, and rescue lost family. Great game highly recomend buying it, especially if its on sale.			"

												A classic pirate game from 2004. It's incredibly fun (Even in today's standards) by the fact that ship, crew and money management all come into play in this non-linear quest of; anything.The quest systems usually come along the lines of;Kill this pirate (after awhile, you'll receive PART OF a map obtained for the next quest)Find this family memberFind this pirates treasure (GOLD! Very valuable.)and so on. Although, you can selectively stray away from these quests, even though they award you with certain benefits and instead go and help a certain faction (English, Dutch, Spanish, French.) to obtain promotions and thus, privileges that benefit you and your ship.The game includes three variants of fighting;  -First: Ship vs Ship combat. In this, your ship will be plotted against a ship that you happened to run into on your voyage. It's basically firing cannons to each other, but you can gain strategic advantages by unlocking different cannon types and upgrades. (Normal = Hull, Chain = Sails, Grape = Crew)  -Second: Captain vs Captain. Usually if you besiege a fort under certain circumstances or you run into the enemy ship in naval combat (See variant of fighting 'First') in which you'll be pitted against the captain of the enemy. It's really just press buttons at certain times to win. Simple right? But just as before, upgrades and other things will cause you to win/lose like the amount of crew you have compared to them, and your advantage bar.   -Third: Siege. If you decide to besiege a fort, then you will gain a time based strategy feel, in which you will gain a few troops of different qualities, as well as the enemy gaining their own. You must fight using your troops and play with their qualities in order to achieve victory. The graphics style is rather well fleshed out for it's time, and is incredibly smooth in all areas. The art style seems to fit really will with the Pirate game.Dialogue isn't exactly the thing you'll be reading constantly, however, sometimes useful information will pop up, like trade ships located or the location of treasure. So occasionally you may want to listen!The options menu is decked out with everything you'll need. Including resolution, toggling of certain lighting and trilinear filtering. However, you shouldn't have to change anything now-a-days due to the high-end processors in our computers.Great story! Although the dialogue as noted above it rather low-end, the story is actually incredibly good!Cons:-Although the quest line, it has rather repetitive game play. Depending on luck and skill, the game can fly by and you'll already have some of the top end ships.-Enemies do exactly the same thing (Linear AI programming)Absolutely wonderful game. I have no huge disappointments about it. NoCeBo - 9/10. "

												I only give this a thumbs up because it fulfills a huge nostalgic void in my life.  This was a game I played as a kid.  I remember being pretty good.. and falling in love with the fact that you can't really beat it.  Honestly, if you never played the original all those years ago it might not be that great.  It's really hard to say because I am so biased.			"

												The best pirate game ever made. Nothing's ever come close to this beast of a game. It's replayable, easy to play, charming, and incredibly fun to play. When I first played it in the early 00s I couldn't wait to see more games like it. It's kinda disappointing that years later our gaming world still hasn't surpassed this simple game.

												This is the first PC game I ever played so it has a certain special place in my heart. Even in 2006 with less than 1 GB thius game did more than Far Cry did in 20+ GB. We have an open world, a crazy amount of vessels to sail, an active and important political system, swordfights, upgrades, treasure hunts, and so much more. THe naval combat system is also quite advanced with wind and range playing important roles in battles. Over the years I just keep coming back to this game because it's so in-depth and well-done. For any fan of pirates or sailing this game is a must-have. 10/10 would recommend to everyone.			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates! (for kiddies) still remember playing this game when I was a kid and when seeing it on a steam sale there was no way to refuse some nostalgia drive. Now that aside, the game mechanics are so dumbed down that even my beagle could play it (gee... that dog has some serious A.D.D), you go from port to port choosing whom you want to serve (or if you want to be a real pirate and target just about anyone).Wind doesn't really affect you much early on (neither does the enemy forces, you can conquer towns with just about a rag-tag bunch of pirates and take over war galleons with your starting ship easily), gaining the heart of a governors daughter (and acquiring useful items) can be as easy as to dance with her a couple of times while you visit a port and talk to its gov and then giving some gifts to her (if it only were that easy... wait... sometimes it is :O )Your crewmates are great, have a lot of personality and background, they will sail with you 'till the end of your days....... nah just kidding they get annoyed if you gather a lot of $ or stuff and don't divide it, dunno about how blackbeard did stuff but I'd be hell lucky being a pirate and quitting after just one year of going around looting and killing and plundering and stealing governor's daughters and.... you get the point.But honestly, all in all, there's some really good fun to be had here, get it on a sale, play it from time to time and you'll get your kicks out of it I know I do.

												One of the best games from when I was younger. I don't like that your character ages the way that he does, but that's a petty quibble.

												Just because a game is old doesn`t mean that its poor. This game is amazing and still stands up today in both gameplay and graphics. There are multiple paths you can choose in your personal adventure. With four factions (England, France, Spain and the Dutch) theres plenty of ships to plunder and town to raze, plus lots of goveners to help and ranks to climb, not to mention the dancing at the ball. On YouTube I`d recommend Sips` playthrough if you need any help or just want an entertaining watch.			"

												This game...it's hard to describe it exactly in an overarching view.Let me go ahead and talk about the factions in this game.Spain: Huge amounts of land and ships, but the ships suck and the land cities are heavily guarded. Ships are usually huge, but slow, and have a huge amount of crew, but the ships seem like they are made out of cardboard. Has most cities in the game. Also, the Spanish are at war with everyone almost all the time.England: Sloops and Brigs as far as the eye can see! England has some of the fastest ships, and remember how I said the Spanish ships are made of cardboard? Well, the English cannons fire the equivalent of napalm in a ball when hitting a Spanish ship. Besides the Spanish, they have the most amount of cities, although most are islands and not on the mainland Americas.France: The French have some what I'd consider all around style of ships. They are a mix of ships and power, but they work. They have less than the English, but aren't doing the worst.Netherlands/Dutch: ""Oh sweet almighty Jesus, we are screwed,"" is probably what you'd think if you were the Dutch king. Basically, the Dutch aren't exactly doing the best when it comes to amount of land or types of ships, but it's much easier to buy and sell in Dutch markets, as well as get promotions. Basically, you want more recruits and buy food cheaper? You want to be Dutch.Jesuit Missions: Basically, think of a bunch of priests living on islands. There you go. They have no real alignment or ships, they just are there and sell food. Talk to them to help with your main quest to find your family.Pirate settlements: Like a regular city, but you can usually only get recruits and food here, but you can end up helping the pirate leader to take over cities.You do NOT have to side with anyone. Basically, the game allows you to have the freedom of you choosing the options to help anyone. I, personally, help the Dutch all the time (because it's actually easy if you are good with economic type of gameplay), but you could, for example, help the Dutch one time, help the English one time, help the Spanish once, then help the French, and have everyone love you.This game is amazing, and it has multiple minigames of fencing, land battles, ship battles, and, yes, dancing.

												Highly addictive. Great fun. Your pirates will sing ""Blow the man down"" when you defeat top pirates. What's not to like?Oh, well, there is the one drawback of not being very userfriendly about how to attack towns and settlements seem to be off limits (if I try to attack via land, it just walks me into the town because even hostile nations don't guard their smallest settlements with soldiers so I guess the townsfolk just defeat pirates by friending them?) I have beat this game twice (if there's such thing as beating it) and I am still planning to play a few more lives. Get this game if you like pirates (legal or non-legal), ships (small and fast to freakin huge frigates), cannons (with a variety of ammo), swords, or, well, ballroom dancing to mad harpsichord music.

												This is a dumb game!  And it's unlike most of the Sid Meier's Civilization games. That said it can be fun to stumble through this (and if you've tried dancing with the Governor's daughter You'll know what I mean) But dumb isn't always a bad thing. The basic mechanics seem simple and it's a great change of pace. I originally bought a copy of this years ago and toyed with it a bit. But when I saw the chance to get it in my Steam account for under $1 I decided it was time to revisit it.When I checked that it would run OK I was immediately drawn back into the game's playful aspects and spent over an hour before saying ""It's time to get back to the real world.""  By all means check it out. For less than a buck it's already been worth my money.			"

												A fun pirate game set in the Caribbean, during the 17th Century. You are a privateer looking to make his fortune and rescues if lost family. It is an early open world game, in that although there is a notional storyline, in practice you tend to end up sailing the seas, capturing or sinking ships with impunity whilst leaving your family to rot in captivity. The gameplay is not only confined to sailing the ocean blue, there is a host other (nefarious) activities to take part in, ranging from sacking cities and copious amounts of swordplay to wooing the daughters of cites governors with your masterful dancing skills. The controls are simple to pick up, although can hard to master are higher difficulty levels – a case in point is the dancing. At low difficulty you are given clear guides to which button to press. This becomes subtle hand gestures at higher levels, easy to miss as you stumble around the dancefloor like you have had too much grog. Graphically it is pretty to look at, without be Assassins Creed Black Flag. Bear in mind this was first released in 1987. It has been updated for modern OS but is still more functional than flashyGameplay	8Graphics	        6Control		7Fun		        8Overall		7.5 "

												Sidmeier's Pirates is a remake of an older version of the Game and ticks all the boxes right for doing so. Having said that. I have 10.5 hours in it and finished it - that said higher difficulties from the start are still open to me, as you are obligated to start at the easiest difficulty when you first start the game but you can during the game up the difficulty by 'dividing the loot'.It has several 'mini-games' including dancing/romancing governor daughters, attacking cities, and fighting on ships. These mini-games are not overly hard, but not too difficult that is just a breeze. As you can interspace them the way you want the mini-games are never bothersome, in my opinion.The atmosphere and humor of the game is its major selling point and as such it a good little game for a bit of relaxing. And with the difficulties, different starting eras, and starting proficiencies you can definately make it harder on yourself to get a more challenging experience should you wish it, but to me it does not seem as if it was created to make you have deep low and mountain peak highs, but rather a relaxing giggle.

												This is an old game, but I gotta say, it's a good one.I got the urge to play some kinda pirate simulation game a while back, and there has just been nothing out on the market like that of late, unless you're into Assassin's Creed.. which I'm not. (because Ubisoft.)  But I found this on sale for a few bucks.. and thought.. Ok.. Pirates.. Sid Meier.. sure, why not.  It was a good choice.Lots of things you can do..different goals you can try for.  The mechanics are somewhat simplistic.. I mean, it's a 2004 remake of a 1987 game, so you can't expect too much sophistication out of it..  But that said, if you're looking for something to swash your buckle.. (or would that be buckle your swash?), this'll do it.  The minigame mechanics for fencing and dancing are easy at the lowest difficulty, but get quite challenging at higher ones unless you've got good ""twitch gamer"" reflexes... So most of us will find a decent challenge available.The AI does some strange things at times.. that's pretty much to be expected..   Like in my latest playthrough, I decided to be a English pure ""privateer"".. following the terms of my ""Letter of Marque and Reprisal""..  Drove the French and the Dutch completely out of the Caribbean, and the Spanish are down to just a half a dozen cities on the coast of Mexico and Central America..  The last French and Dutch cities to fall, and the last Spanish city on the northern islands, all responded by sending invasion force after invasion force, sometimes 3 or 4 frigates at once laden with troops.. over and over.. out of cities with barely any money or troops due to my blockade..  which, of course, would be impossible with any sense of ""realism""..But that doesn't detract from the fun. In fact, it makes it even more amusing.. ""How can I get the AI to freak out this time?"" becomes it's own sort of meta-game.  At least for me. I personally would *love* to see a *sequel* to this game.. not a HD remake, or a relaunch.. but a full Pirates! 2.  Updated engine, graphics.. merging geopolitics into it a bit borrowing elements from the Civilization series.. Really treating the naval situation and piracy in the region during that time as it was historically... a proxy war between the competing empires of Europe..  Character development maybe, a skill tree, so you get better at your skills along with upgrading gear, instead of just getting bonuses from equipment..  More promotion options, etc..  The ability to have actual fleet combat, and the ability to found your own colonies...But probably the only actual real *downside* to this game.. is that I haven't figured out how to actually be the aggressor against a foreign city... the only way I've found so far is to just look and sink a whole bunch of their ships till the harbor guns get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ enough to take a pot shot at you.. then you get the option to ""attack""..  I wanna bombard em from sea, then unleash the pirate hordes.. lol..But even with that annoyance, and the limitations of this being a very old remake of an even older game.. it's a classic.. Revolutionary for it's time, and has aged quite well. Give it a try.			"

												The game has Sid Meier's name. It should say it all. Open world and  addictive gameplay is what you get. The game is still enjoyable many years after its release. The graphics do look aged, but the art style looks good and that, in my book, is more important than polygon count and texture resolutions.			"

												This Review Did Come In Late.. Like A Few Years Late... But, This Is The Best Pirate Game I've Ever Played. Just Look At My Screenshots For It! I Would Say More, But This Is As Simple As I Can Put It. I've found out how to do a few glitches and exploits for the game here and there. But yeah. It is fun if you can mess with the game. And also, If you want to find mods for this game, (Since it's ridiculously hard to find them since this game is very very old and forgotten by many people) Here's a link: http://www.hookedonpirates.com/ This is very old as well and pretty much forgotten. But they work. Have fun this this ancient relic of a game. Still amazing despite it's age. It just goes to show, Don't hate a game, Or forget it just because it's old. Old games can be better than some of the new games. As some of the newer games are rushed due to some people money whoring/etc. There's few masterpeices in gaming nowadays sadly. I wish it weren't true. But it is. But yeah. I 100% Fully Reccomend this game if you want to have a pirate experiance in a game.			"

												The graphics are dated and cartoony, the gameplay is simple, and yet it's the funnest Pirate based game I've ever played. If you tried playing Pirates of the Burning Sea, this is very similar, but lacking the MMO economy driven enviroment that that game had. Overall, if you have been on the fence about this game, wait for it to go on sale during a holiday or random weekend event and pick it up. It's certainly a decent time waster.			"

												This is a minigame fiesta that even Miyamoto would be proud of.  I could win this game on hardest difficulty with a beer in one hand while doing my taxes on a seperate screen.   You would think that would make it boring- you'd be dead wrong. This game is the epitome of the Sid Meier Sorcery™.   It's a perfect mix of theme and mechanic, people of all ages and backgrounds could enjoy it- it's just a perfect game, really.

												Anyone who has ever played Pirates of the Carribean Online will find this game very similar. It's got great naval fights, however other than that the fights on land are rather plain and revolves around a simple puzzle similar to rock-papers-scissors. After about 10 hours of gameplay, I've managed to practically finish the story mode and it gets rather dull afterwards. Nevertheless, I still recommend the game since it's surprisingly still very fun for a 2004 game.			"

												I have always loved this game, it's a pretty simple game that isn't very challenging, but I love it.Pros:•Wont matter for a lot of people, butvery little mouse input needed, great for playing on the bus, or somewhere where I don't have an external mouse with my laptop•Graphics still hold decently well, the animations are a bit laughable, but the graphics don't hurt my eyes.•Very little story.  While the game does have a story, it doesn't push you into doing it at all, so your free to do whatever you want. Considdered a pro, because a lot of simular games like this force you to do the main storyline, and limit the open-world.Cons:•Some of the minigames can get a bit reppetitive. Dancing is very important in the game, but is not very fun, and I hate sneaking into towns. The most common ones like sword-fighting or ship battles stay fun.•Not very difficult. Even on swashbucking difficulty (the hardest one) the only thing I have trouble with is a few sword fights, but if you use the cutlass and taunt often, they aren't a problem.Overall, this game deffinetly is not for everyone. I have always loved this style of game, so it's easy for me to love this game. The game isn't very expensive, especially on sale, so I would whole-heartedly recomend picking it up if it looks even slightly appealing to you. "

												Great little game that I deeply enjoyed.Controls take a little getting used to but once you get to grip with them they're fine.Only real downsides for me were the need to 'split the booty' multiple times in a game, would have preferred it to be an optional thing and have a quest or expensive item as an alternative way to reduce crew unhappiness.And the occasional accidental sinking of a member of your fleet, would have been nice for the ships in your fleet that you don't control to have a little smarter Ai for pathing, sending a massive galleon through that tiny gap I just sailed my tiny slope through was an expensive mistake.Wished for feature: fountain of youth aka endless mode, who wants to get old and have to stop being a pirate I want to live forever with endless time to go kill blackbeard or find that missing person.

												This game--- oh Lordy have mercy, this game! Going into 'Sid Meier's Prirates!', I had the impression it was going to be an overall decent experience, but without much direction. The game has a story, but, in my first few minutes, I had feared it'd be too open-ended and not give me much to go on. Wrong.You're set out proper into the ocean with a decent crew, a small ship and a good six or so months worth of food, and are tasked with finding your captured family. While this may seem daunting, seeing as there are sixteen greek family members to all track down, it's surprisingly simple to start the story. Simply make your mark by capturing a few easy ships, do some quests for some governers and such-- before you know it, you're hunting down pirates, treasure, merchant vessles and everything of the sort, easy peasy!The game is wonderfully simple to get into, and it kept me hooked for hours. Couldn't stopl playing unit I demended to myself ""Go eat something and finish your homework--- THEN you'll have EVEN MORE time to play!"" And so I'm writing this review eating one heck of a tuna sandwich, if I do say so myself. It's got parsley and mayo in-- I put lettice and some mango on it, and a little bit of hidden valley ranch---The game.It's awesome.If you're looking for a light-hearted but still involved pirate game where you carve out a ledgend other pirates will envy, this is the game for you! Fluid mechanics, everyhting feels wonderful to do-- just... I waited for a sale-- and this was undoubtedly some of the best three bucks of my life. Usually 10 but heck-- I'd say it's totally worth it, there's just so much to be had!			"

												Why they don't remake this, I don't know. The wide open world allows a lot of freedom in your actions, however should you be a completionist, then there is a slightly repetitive main plot where you find your lost family members. The only other issue I have with the game is that it can be a little too easy at times, for example I left the port at St Kitts to be confronted by Henry Morgan, the most notorious pirate of all time... To only thrash him later by ramming his ship and then wrecking him with a rapier. Overall, it is a good game although it can be a bit slow at times.			"

												Stupidly fun pirates game. There's a main quest to follow, but you can ignore it if you'd like. There are lost cities to discover, treasure to be unburied, towns to be sacked! Work your way up to the number 1 pirate by defeating famous pirates (including Blackbeard!). It's a game of revenge and adventuring, but even a taste of romance as you dance your way through all the governor's daughters. Literally dancing, because there's a dancing minigame.One thing I particularly enjoyed about this game was the combination of real-time and turn-based strategy. Most of it's real-time, but oftentimes if you sack a town, you'll have to pit your pirates against their soldiers in a fun turn-based game (the only time that isn't the case is if your number of pirate greatly trumps their number of soldiers; then you'll just have a sword fight with the Captain of the Guards). It's a fun game with several levels of difficulty, plus you can start at different time periods, which will also help decrease or increase the difficulty of the game, so replayability is high.			"

												Anyone that doesn't like this game is out of their damn mind. I LOVE THIS GAME!!! I just had close to 50k gold. Went to Havana and divided it all between my crew of like..almost 400? I came out with close to 7k.I'm a count to the Spanish, even though they are who I attack and plunder ships of most often. I have a LOT of treasures or collectible thingers, like upgraded swords, guns, clothes, ruby ring, diamond necklace, compasses, rutters.....dancing shoes, all sorts of stuff. I am (or was, but probably still am) the 2nd Most Notorious Pirate in the Spanish Main. I beat Henry's butt (forgot his last name) and got Queen Anne's Revenge from him (not sure what happened to Blackbeard..assuming this guy took it from him), and toted around the ocean with it in my fleet for a long while. I have every upgrade on my Spanish War Galleon that I think there possibly is. So......yeah.This game is awesome.Now I just need to make it back to the other side of the map and find that big breasted woman I wanted to woo and try and woo her.♥♥♥♥♥ better like the jewelry I got her or I'll choke her with it.Also, I've done barely any of the quests. Aside from one waiting for me when I get to a place. My family is probably long gone or dead by now...			"

												It might not be everyones cup of tea but if you played the original, you'll love it.Brand new players may not fall in love with it so easily though, but still......I got to dance with the ladies, chase down and duel notorious pirates, experience great naval fights between multiple ships, learn to fence on my toes, get blown to pieces by pirate hunting ships, assualt towns on foot, sneak into cities and hit guards in the back of the head with batons, receive promotions, experience 6 months in jail, find and dig up hidden treasures, help some monks and more...The game has greatly improved graphics and sounds and I enjoyed it for about 6 hours before it got a bit repetitive. I am sure though that it is more and issue with me in 2016 than the game itself.There aren't many pirate games out there to compare with but so if swashbuckling is your thing, this is probably the one you need.Njoy!

The closest was asssassins creed black flag which with its amazing ship battles and nice graphics seems like a way better choice yet it never captured the feel of being a pirate Sid Meier's Pirates gave me. In ACBF i felt like Edward Kenway but in this game although yes you do have a predefined character i felt like a beast ♥♥♥ captain tearing up the seas in my sick ♥♥♥ ship every once and a while i play through this game again and it is an extremely swashbuckling adventure.

												I remember the old 5 1/2 inch floppy version of this game, back when I was 8 years old.  I thought it was cool then. This reboot is much the same as the original, but better in so many ways.  Pros:1) No more 5/12 inch floppy! Graphics and controls (obviously) much improved!2) Family friendly gameplay without sacrificing good ole fashion pirating!  Fighting, plundering, charming governors' daughters, revenge...I could go on.3) Definitely fits in the ""Just one more turn"" category.Cons:1) For modern gamers, this might be a bit outdated, but for those who remember the grinding of the floppy drives and the monochromatic displays, there's nothing wrong here.2) No lady pirates and no character customization.  You will not be disappointed.			"

												***Should have done a sequel for this game instead of reworking Civilization 5***Anyways, I bought this game for nostalgic reasoning, played it near initial release.If you've never played it before, it will give you that initial burst of enjoyment you've been looking for, right away, you'll experience a ship battle which has strategy with a punch of arcade style battle.The game is full of mini-games but obviously the majority of us are here for the ship battle and ship upgrades!A ran into a bug that spawned my fleet on shore and it was stuck there, overwriting both autosaves so I could no longer continue.Sid Meier's Pirates! becomes repetitive quickly in a sense you know it didn't really have to.  What I mean is, all the mechanics of the game are awesome ideas, but are lacking volume.  For instance, the amount of ships in the game is very light.  You will easily get the best ship and be disappointed quickly by this.  I mean, this is fine, but the amount of content they could easily add to a sequel makes my head spin and can't figure out why they have not.There are no good pirate games out there, IMO, that offer the arcade play style that Sid Meier's Pirates does.  The game is simple and satisfying.---If they ever made a sequel, this would be my fantasy features*way more ships*diplomatic relations more diverse*being able to create your own faction/nation*rampart(nes) city attacking and defending mechanics with modern twist*multiplayer- lot's more but I have to run			"

												This game is one of the best games I've ever played. A balanced and engrossing mix of elements including tactics, trading, sailing, rpg(revenge), humor, Disney (yes), combat, and rommance！！The details of every fraction is extremely well handeled. I like how they put 3 levels of rommance options for each nation and you can potentially pick your GF from 24 different girls! That's more than Skyrim! Though usually I would skip the ""plain"" ones. (I mean seriously the barmaid looks more royal than them)  In the begining I was a little lost about what to do in the game but once I found my way around the game it became very addictive. That didn't take too long since it's pretty self-explanatory. 9.5 out of 10 the 0.5 taken out because I had a headach finding lost relatives/city the map for those missions seems to be auto-generated at random. Sometimes it tells you to search ""The south of XX city"" you could end up spending 3 hours hiking through the area in vain. Not sure if it's a bug or I wasn't doing the right thing.			"

It's got great naval fights, however other than that the fights on land are rather plain and revolves around a simple puzzle similar to rock-papers-scissors. After about 10 hours of gameplay, I've managed to practically finish the story mode and it gets rather dull afterwards. Nevertheless, I still recommend the game since it's surprisingly still very fun for a 2004 game.			"

												Sid Meiers deserves praise till the world ends, for the Civilisation game and for this. Sid Meier's Pirates! is a treasure that we all need to dig up and admire for the rest of our lives. If this game was remade by Sid, I would want nothing changed except for a graphics update.usually I talk about the good about a game first, but this is a special game where a lot of love and attention to detail has gone into it. What I mean is: its near perfect. I can't think of anything letting this game down... Graphics for the time were amazing, it had intresting naval combat and dualing mechanics, dancing to woo governers' duaghters and just grenrally screwing the spanish.Now, I have one tiny problem with this game: moral. I cannot, for the life of me, get on top of moral on the harder difficulties. It's not like I can just play a magic flute and their all happy, can I? Thankfully this is the only issue I have with Sid Meire's Pirates!Buy this game, plunder the Caribbean and woo those Goveners' duaghters... oh yeah, Goveners' duaghters don't have names either, you just woo them and leave.

												Sid Meier's Pirates is an interesting mix of genres presented in a sort of ""proto-sandbox"" fashion: players take on the role of a swashbuckler living during the 17th century ""Golden Age of Piracy"". You may pursue the in-game story of searching the Caribbean Sea for their lost family members, but the game does not push this object on you but every so often, meaning that players are fully free to disregard the main storyline in order to make their own distinct niche out of Caribbean life. These activities include ship navigation and exploration, land combat (presented as a turn-based strategy minigame, ala Civilization), and courting noblewomen (presented as a rhythm minigame).The graphics are colorful and have the right amount of cartoonishness to them, and the often upbeat soundtrack helps put a smile on my face every time I boot this game up. If any of this sounds interesting, I'd say to jump head-on into Sid Meier's Pirates, as I don't think a simple review conveys how much fun this game is, so much as sitting down and making of it what you will does. The seas are what you make of them!Also, for those of you who originally owned this game on CD like I did, Steam will be able to read and use your old save files!			"

												I played this a lot years ago, and it's still very enjoyable.  It's a pirate simulator with gameplay broken into a series of mini-games.  Sailing, sword-fighting, dancing, and sneaking are each individual mini-games, most of them similar to quick time events, and there is a simple system for dealing with food, morale, crew, loot, and all that.  There's also a story but it's not very interesting.  It's weakness is a lack of depth.  You will get tired of it eventually, because it becomes quite repetetive after a while.			"

												This is the first PC game I ever played so it has a certain special place in my heart. Even in 2006 with less than 1 GB thius game did more than Far Cry did in 20+ GB. We have an open world, a crazy amount of vessels to sail, an active and important political system, swordfights, upgrades, treasure hunts, and so much more. THe naval combat system is also quite advanced with wind and range playing important roles in battles. Over the years I just keep coming back to this game because it's so in-depth and well-done. For any fan of pirates or sailing this game is a must-have. 10/10 would recommend to everyone.			"

												A still relevant classic!  Play as a pirate and do pirate stuff!  Sail a ship, swashbuckle, dance with the Governor's daughter, plunder, siege forts, trade goods...and kill, because pirates mainly kill.  It's still the best pirate game out there!			"

												Although the game squarely qualifies as old now, I couldn't resist buying it given how much I played it years ago, and how powerful the memories of it.The story offers a simple and straightforward red thread to follow for completion, but leaves so much room for exploration, choices and personal characterization (or lack thereof) that it actually allows many replays without getting boring.The minigames are of course a bit repetitive, but that's not something that ever bothers me, especially since they're based on rhythm and reactivity. Only the slow sailing across the map got annoying after a while, and that's a feature; you're NOT supposed to cross over the whole ocean without pause or action.Basically, this game is a blast for any player who likes writing their own story.One day, I'll publish the epic chronicles of the dreaded legendary pirate who attacked and took over the whole Spanish Armada with his lone but glorious war canoe Croustibat! :D			"

												This is a classic game that continues to impress. It's a little difficult to describe, though. You play the role of a young ship captain who is free to roam the caribbean. There are four major powers that control the region. The English, Dutch, Spanish  and the French. You can choose to serve one of them, all of them or none. You patrol the sea looking for targets of opportunity. If you choose to join a nation, you can legally attack their enemies. This is good for when the war ends. It means that nothing was personal and that your former enemies will allow you to pass by without any trouble. You don't have to do that though. You can choose to attack all of them, but then you will have to rely of pirate havens for supplies and repairs. To sum it up: It's a great game that will keep you coming back for more. The only real problem I have with it is the fact that I cannot raise the resolution above 800x600 or the game might crash.			"

												Best couple of quid I ever spent, getting this on the Steam Summer Sale.================Pros:+ Despite being utterly dated, the art style of this game is compelling+ There's no shortage of variety, with half a dozen minigames to flesh out the ""moving around doing stuff"" experience+ Really sells the Caribbean with a lovingly crafted map full of hidden objects and items+ Rewards proactive adventure-buccaneering, while not forcing it down your throat+ The Governors' Daughters ('nuff said)+ PIRATES- Some of the minigames (looking at you land battles) are a wee bit unpolished and somewhat overstay their welcome- The art style of this game is compelling, but it *is* utterly dated- That painful crawl East across the open sea, especially on lower difficulties when the wind never changes direction- A few (infrequent) game breaking bugs - one of which could be a major epilepsy triggerIf you're willing to brave the storms that inherently come with a period-piece of a game, then there's a lot to love about Sid Meier's Pirates. Oh, and that dancing minigame? The trick is to press the buttons in time with the beat. ;)			"

												I was playing Pirates! for a year after it came out on PSP. I borrowed it as often as I could from the library and played so much I recognized where every treasure could spawn at from one scrap of the map. I would dedicate entire days to me lying on the couch, trying to sack a new town for the Dutch. I became so skilled that I wouldn't be slowed on the hardest difficulty.However, even with all of that work, I never 100% completed the game. It's so easy to get caught up in the politics, treasure hunting, intregue, and dancing. This game can keep you so busy that you'll be retired before you know it.The only way for this game to be made better is to release an HD remake (or sequal) with some minor adjustments:Improved graphics (better textures, water effects, etc)Improved framerate (60+ would be ideal)Custom keybinding and controller supportModding support Other than that, it's a really good game. 9/10			"

												After putting in my 40+ hours at the desk job, it's nice to come home to a rewarding game that doesn't require too much brain power.  At around ten dollars, this kept me entertained, relaxed, and engaged for most of a weekend.  It is well worth the cost.  Many developers now are pushing for a more real-life experience with darker visuals and more deeply challenging  game play, but I don't want to play those types of games all the time.  There's still plenty of room left on the SSD for brighter, happier visuals and simpler, joyful games.  I did run into a bug once where my ship got stuck, but the fix is to reload the last autosave battle, and you're unstuck... no big deal.			"

												This game is one of the best games I've ever played. A balanced and engrossing mix of elements including tactics, trading, sailing, rpg(revenge), humor, Disney (yes), combat, and rommance！！The details of every fraction is extremely well handeled. I like how they put 3 levels of rommance options for each nation and you can potentially pick your GF from 24 different girls! That's more than Skyrim! Though usually I would skip the ""plain"" ones. (I mean seriously the barmaid looks more royal than them)  In the begining I was a little lost about what to do in the game but once I found my way around the game it became very addictive. That didn't take too long since it's pretty self-explanatory. 9.5 out of 10 the 0.5 taken out because I had a headach finding lost relatives/city the map for those missions seems to be auto-generated at random. Sometimes it tells you to search ""The south of XX city"" you could end up spending 3 hours hiking through the area in vain. Not sure if it's a bug or I wasn't doing the right thing.			"

												I originally had this game on PC so I've played it more than my Steam account says.This game despite its basic principles and gameplay, is easily fun, addictive and charming in its own little way. An older game that lets you feel like a pirate or maybe even a secret agent for one of the 4 countries (if you just capture all ports for a country like I do for fun).			"

												OH MY GOD, MY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES--So happy finally able to own this game and finished it.Back then I was a dumb kid who didn't know the relation between the money, the crew, and the happiness...Thus, mutinies.Yep, more than once.Damn pirates.But now, once I know the knacks of this game, everything seems to be okay.Plundered ships, cities, golds; found lost relations, lost cities, pirates treasures; got max rank in all countries.It's awesome!Now that I finished it, kinda a lil bit sad, but I'm satisfied.I guess it's time to retire from pirating.Farewell my childhood memories...

												This is a dumb game!  And it's unlike most of the Sid Meier's Civilization games. That said it can be fun to stumble through this (and if you've tried dancing with the Governor's daughter You'll know what I mean) But dumb isn't always a bad thing. The basic mechanics seem simple and it's a great change of pace. I originally bought a copy of this years ago and toyed with it a bit. But when I saw the chance to get it in my Steam account for under $1 I decided it was time to revisit it.When I checked that it would run OK I was immediately drawn back into the game's playful aspects and spent over an hour before saying ""It's time to get back to the real world.""  By all means check it out. For less than a buck it's already been worth my money.			"

												Highly addictive. Great fun. Your pirates will sing ""Blow the man down"" when you defeat top pirates. What's not to like?Oh, well, there is the one drawback of not being very userfriendly about how to attack towns and settlements seem to be off limits (if I try to attack via land, it just walks me into the town because even hostile nations don't guard their smallest settlements with soldiers so I guess the townsfolk just defeat pirates by friending them?) I have beat this game twice (if there's such thing as beating it) and I am still planning to play a few more lives. Get this game if you like pirates (legal or non-legal), ships (small and fast to freakin huge frigates), cannons (with a variety of ammo), swords, or, well, ballroom dancing to mad harpsichord music.

												Just because a game is old doesn`t mean that its poor. This game is amazing and still stands up today in both gameplay and graphics. There are multiple paths you can choose in your personal adventure. With four factions (England, France, Spain and the Dutch) theres plenty of ships to plunder and town to raze, plus lots of goveners to help and ranks to climb, not to mention the dancing at the ball. On YouTube I`d recommend Sips` playthrough if you need any help or just want an entertaining watch.			"

												This game...it's hard to describe it exactly in an overarching view.Let me go ahead and talk about the factions in this game.Spain: Huge amounts of land and ships, but the ships suck and the land cities are heavily guarded. Ships are usually huge, but slow, and have a huge amount of crew, but the ships seem like they are made out of cardboard. Has most cities in the game. Also, the Spanish are at war with everyone almost all the time.England: Sloops and Brigs as far as the eye can see! England has some of the fastest ships, and remember how I said the Spanish ships are made of cardboard? Well, the English cannons fire the equivalent of napalm in a ball when hitting a Spanish ship. Besides the Spanish, they have the most amount of cities, although most are islands and not on the mainland Americas.France: The French have some what I'd consider all around style of ships. They are a mix of ships and power, but they work. They have less than the English, but aren't doing the worst.Netherlands/Dutch: ""Oh sweet almighty Jesus, we are screwed,"" is probably what you'd think if you were the Dutch king. Basically, the Dutch aren't exactly doing the best when it comes to amount of land or types of ships, but it's much easier to buy and sell in Dutch markets, as well as get promotions. Basically, you want more recruits and buy food cheaper? You want to be Dutch.Jesuit Missions: Basically, think of a bunch of priests living on islands. There you go. They have no real alignment or ships, they just are there and sell food. Talk to them to help with your main quest to find your family.Pirate settlements: Like a regular city, but you can usually only get recruits and food here, but you can end up helping the pirate leader to take over cities.You do NOT have to side with anyone. Basically, the game allows you to have the freedom of you choosing the options to help anyone. I, personally, help the Dutch all the time (because it's actually easy if you are good with economic type of gameplay), but you could, for example, help the Dutch one time, help the English one time, help the Spanish once, then help the French, and have everyone love you.This game is amazing, and it has multiple minigames of fencing, land battles, ship battles, and, yes, dancing.

												Sid Meier's Pirates! (for kiddies) still remember playing this game when I was a kid and when seeing it on a steam sale there was no way to refuse some nostalgia drive. Now that aside, the game mechanics are so dumbed down that even my beagle could play it (gee... that dog has some serious A.D.D), you go from port to port choosing whom you want to serve (or if you want to be a real pirate and target just about anyone).Wind doesn't really affect you much early on (neither does the enemy forces, you can conquer towns with just about a rag-tag bunch of pirates and take over war galleons with your starting ship easily), gaining the heart of a governors daughter (and acquiring useful items) can be as easy as to dance with her a couple of times while you visit a port and talk to its gov and then giving some gifts to her (if it only were that easy... wait... sometimes it is :O )Your crewmates are great, have a lot of personality and background, they will sail with you 'till the end of your days....... nah just kidding they get annoyed if you gather a lot of $ or stuff and don't divide it, dunno about how blackbeard did stuff but I'd be hell lucky being a pirate and quitting after just one year of going around looting and killing and plundering and stealing governor's daughters and.... you get the point.But honestly, all in all, there's some really good fun to be had here, get it on a sale, play it from time to time and you'll get your kicks out of it I know I do.

Looking for that next trade route, or trying to woo the governor's daught- Ok who am I kidding?

Combat system is entertaining and vast. You strategically command your men in a grid battlefield or take out the enemy captain yourself and finish the battle immidiately. You can upgrade your ships and rule the sea while being friendly with city mayors to get their backing. I loved it in when i was a kid and I still love it.  Best pirate game out there...  "

We have an open world, a crazy amount of vessels to sail, an active and important political system, swordfights, upgrades, treasure hunts, and so much more. THe naval combat system is also quite advanced with wind and range playing important roles in battles. Over the years I just keep coming back to this game because it's so in-depth and well-done.

												Graphics: 5/10Sound: 4/10Mechanic: 5/10Story: 4/10Action: 8/10Originality: 6/10Lasting Fun: 4/10and all considering that this is a game from a totally different age of computer games.Quite a good and funny game but definitely not what you expect from a modern game any longer. The game was released in 1987 and kinda overhauled and re-released sometimes around 2004. Considering the age of even the later version graphics and game look pretty good. I bought it for about 4 bucks which is an ok price, but I would never have paid 10+ for it. This game is not a simulation, it's more an arcarde style action game where you sail around, sink ships of several factions or pirates, do some politics and a little trading and can go for treasure hunting as well. actually the game has all a good pirate game needs. Yet, the action becomes stale pretty fast. Trading is kind of tedious as it requires you to have large ships and go long distances. Sailing long distances is punished in the game as your crew is going to desert you faster than you can replace them. In the later game this seems to get much better, but getting there is not funny at all. You can use your small starting loop to easily take a full blown war galley as prize. But you will not have the men to maintain it for long, even if you have loads of gold. The game is pretty open to your actions, there is no fix chain of quests you have to follow, although there are very helpful quests. The information in the game and the presentation of your ships is bad. You do get zero info about the capacities of your ships (you can carry 60 guns in small ships, but you don't see easily how many guns get fired and how many are just cargo). There is no full size view of your ship in the menues (I wish I could have seen it in full size and rotating), no fluff info (ship type, tonnage, sails, guns, etc). Hunting pirates was a laugh, I brought down No. 1 from the list within my very first 15 minutes if gameplay. Orientation is hard sometimes when leaving harbour, the compass is pretty simple and yous camera view very narrow. Although many seem to have enjoyed the cartoonist fun style of the game I missed the feeling of grim and dangerous piracy. It feels a bit like playing pirate in your bath tub. Good for a moment but nothing that makes me remember it or want to proceed further. Nice but yesterday.			"

												An amazign well designed game. It is so much fun and quite simple to pick up I played for hours straight. I became addicated to getting everything and beatling all quests which is extremely unlike me. Only issue is that for me at least the keypad never worked and I played the whole game using the mouse which once you get the hang of it isn't bad but during fencing I had to ""cheat"" and keep pause the game.

												A classic pirate game from 2004. It's incredibly fun (Even in today's standards) by the fact that ship, crew and money management all come into play in this non-linear quest of; anything.The quest systems usually come along the lines of;Kill this pirate (after awhile, you'll receive PART OF a map obtained for the next quest)Find this family memberFind this pirates treasure (GOLD! Very valuable.)and so on. Although, you can selectively stray away from these quests, even though they award you with certain benefits and instead go and help a certain faction (English, Dutch, Spanish, French.) to obtain promotions and thus, privileges that benefit you and your ship.The game includes three variants of fighting;  -First: Ship vs Ship combat. In this, your ship will be plotted against a ship that you happened to run into on your voyage. It's basically firing cannons to each other, but you can gain strategic advantages by unlocking different cannon types and upgrades. (Normal = Hull, Chain = Sails, Grape = Crew)  -Second: Captain vs Captain. Usually if you besiege a fort under certain circumstances or you run into the enemy ship in naval combat (See variant of fighting 'First') in which you'll be pitted against the captain of the enemy. It's really just press buttons at certain times to win. Simple right? But just as before, upgrades and other things will cause you to win/lose like the amount of crew you have compared to them, and your advantage bar.   -Third: Siege. If you decide to besiege a fort, then you will gain a time based strategy feel, in which you will gain a few troops of different qualities, as well as the enemy gaining their own. You must fight using your troops and play with their qualities in order to achieve victory. The graphics style is rather well fleshed out for it's time, and is incredibly smooth in all areas. The art style seems to fit really will with the Pirate game.Dialogue isn't exactly the thing you'll be reading constantly, however, sometimes useful information will pop up, like trade ships located or the location of treasure. So occasionally you may want to listen!The options menu is decked out with everything you'll need. Including resolution, toggling of certain lighting and trilinear filtering. However, you shouldn't have to change anything now-a-days due to the high-end processors in our computers.Great story! Although the dialogue as noted above it rather low-end, the story is actually incredibly good!Cons:-Although the quest line, it has rather repetitive game play. Depending on luck and skill, the game can fly by and you'll already have some of the top end ships.-Enemies do exactly the same thing (Linear AI programming)Absolutely wonderful game. I have no huge disappointments about it. NoCeBo - 9/10. "

												This Review Did Come In Late.. Like A Few Years Late... But, This Is The Best Pirate Game I've Ever Played. Just Look At My Screenshots For It! I Would Say More, But This Is As Simple As I Can Put It. I've found out how to do a few glitches and exploits for the game here and there. But yeah. It is fun if you can mess with the game. And also, If you want to find mods for this game, (Since it's ridiculously hard to find them since this game is very very old and forgotten by many people) Here's a link: http://www.hookedonpirates.com/ This is very old as well and pretty much forgotten. But they work. Have fun this this ancient relic of a game. Still amazing despite it's age. It just goes to show, Don't hate a game, Or forget it just because it's old. Old games can be better than some of the new games. As some of the newer games are rushed due to some people money whoring/etc. There's few masterpeices in gaming nowadays sadly. I wish it weren't true. But it is. But yeah. I 100% Fully Reccomend this game if you want to have a pirate experiance in a game.			"

												I did some looking around for a good pirate game and picked up this one. I've been quite pleased at how it turned out. Controls rely heavily upon a numpad, but I've been OK with that. After all, this is a remake of a much older title. I enjoy the ship battles, fencing, treasure hunting, and sieges. Even the dancing minigames are fun. In my first playthrough I got auto-retired and was a little bummed about it since I was still having fun. But after a little research, it turns out there is a way around that. I'm immortal in my second playthrough. That's the plan, anyway. I recommend you pick this one up. It's a gem.			"

												I was playing Pirates! for a year after it came out on PSP. I borrowed it as often as I could from the library and played so much I recognized where every treasure could spawn at from one scrap of the map. I would dedicate entire days to me lying on the couch, trying to sack a new town for the Dutch. I became so skilled that I wouldn't be slowed on the hardest difficulty.However, even with all of that work, I never 100% completed the game. It's so easy to get caught up in the politics, treasure hunting, intregue, and dancing. This game can keep you so busy that you'll be retired before you know it.The only way for this game to be made better is to release an HD remake (or sequal) with some minor adjustments:Improved graphics (better textures, water effects, etc)Improved framerate (60+ would be ideal)Custom keybinding and controller supportModding support Other than that, it's a really good game. 9/10			"

												Played it way back when Blockbuster was still around on the original Xbox. It's aged, but still a very enjoyable experience.Graphics: 7/10 - Held up better than I would've expected.Gameplay: 8.5/10 - Solid ship battle mechanics, reaction-based swordplay, ship management, and even mutiny.Sound: 8/10 - Would've been an 8.5 or 9 but for whatever reason I still don't particularly like the ballroom tracks.Lasting Appeal: 9.5/10 - There are so many ways to play this game that you'll find yourself making new saves just to experience everything this game throws at you.Overall: 8/10 - One of my favorite original Xbox games.

												Sid Meier's Pirates! (for kiddies) still remember playing this game when I was a kid and when seeing it on a steam sale there was no way to refuse some nostalgia drive. Now that aside, the game mechanics are so dumbed down that even my beagle could play it (gee... that dog has some serious A.D.D), you go from port to port choosing whom you want to serve (or if you want to be a real pirate and target just about anyone).Wind doesn't really affect you much early on (neither does the enemy forces, you can conquer towns with just about a rag-tag bunch of pirates and take over war galleons with your starting ship easily), gaining the heart of a governors daughter (and acquiring useful items) can be as easy as to dance with her a couple of times while you visit a port and talk to its gov and then giving some gifts to her (if it only were that easy... wait... sometimes it is :O )Your crewmates are great, have a lot of personality and background, they will sail with you 'till the end of your days....... nah just kidding they get annoyed if you gather a lot of $ or stuff and don't divide it, dunno about how blackbeard did stuff but I'd be hell lucky being a pirate and quitting after just one year of going around looting and killing and plundering and stealing governor's daughters and.... you get the point.But honestly, all in all, there's some really good fun to be had here, get it on a sale, play it from time to time and you'll get your kicks out of it I know I do.

												The tale of the Shipless pirate.it all started well, Mr. Sir. Captain. Reynaldo was a French Privateer raiding English and Spanish shipping he came to amass a small fortune in prizes and plunder he soon became famous and took on more crew, but soon things changed for the worse the French made peace with the spanish and the English merchants were all too scared to sail home. with the money stoping he soon took to darker pursuits, buying strange medicine from a myterious man in a backroom of a shady for 6000 Gold the men soon became worried for their captain, but more so for the loot. the spending was rampent, 3000 gold here a few thousand more there. soon the fortune he had spent years building was well deminished he resorted to outright Piracy to keep the crew in line. he started spinning tales to governors daughters dancing with them hoping to lead them on for more money to buy ""exotic"" and ""mystical"" items, but the crew finally agreed it was time for Mutiniy but just as it happened they suddenly came under fire, an English Pirate Hunter masking itself as french. the Crew returned fire a round of chain shot destroyed the main sail and the English promptly surrendered, a large amount of gold was plundered, and the Crew Mutinied taking the Gold and the Captains ship leaving him stranded on an Island.  Thus the final score is 10/10 would buy strange medicine from a mysterious man in a dark backroom of a Shady tavarn.			"

												The game in its core is a collection of mini-games that all work towards a common goal and make it more than the sum of its parts. Lots of activities in the game, from sea battles, trading, ""massive"" town sieges, finding buried treasure and all the other pirate stuff you expect to do in a game with the name ""Pirates!"".There is something here for everyone I would say and you should really have it in your library. It is easy to jump in and out of and won't take a lots of time to enjoy it. The only thing I don't like about this game is that the movement and action keys are bound to the numpad, but with that said it does not take away from the game that much and you get used to it pretty quick. Overall, it is one of the best pirate themed games ever and it is dirt cheap, especially if on sale.			"

												I did some looking around for a good pirate game and picked up this one. I've been quite pleased at how it turned out. Controls rely heavily upon a numpad, but I've been OK with that. After all, this is a remake of a much older title. I enjoy the ship battles, fencing, treasure hunting, and sieges. Even the dancing minigames are fun. In my first playthrough I got auto-retired and was a little bummed about it since I was still having fun. But after a little research, it turns out there is a way around that. I'm immortal in my second playthrough. That's the plan, anyway. I recommend you pick this one up. It's a gem.			"

												This is a very good strategical and casual game, and a king amoung pirate games. It's story-driven, and there isn't a whole lot of choice-making, and there isn't much of an item system (ie no inventory) but there are still collectibles, armor, swords, guns, all the likes to buy from the mysterious merchants in the corner of taverns. Being able to take and pick from multiple different types and grades of ships is a good part of the game, along with making your own sails and choosing which flag you'll sail under. The naval combat, in all honesty, is slow and boring, so if I were you, just board them already! Don't sit there and fire cannons, they barely do anything. Boarding is less extravagant than most other pirate games. Basically you pick your sword (Go Rapiers!), which can be upgraded with new sets of swords you can buy, and defeat your opposing captain in a Hollywood-style match of sword fighting before your crew gets murdered. Should you win, you will be deserted or captured somewhere, and be left with little to nothing -- this is when the saving slots and loading come in handy, cause who the heck actually serves prison time in RPGs? If you beat the captain, which won't take much time to master doing, he will be everso conveniently knocked off his ship, once again, in a Hollywood cinematic style. This is especially true when facing a famous pirate such as the cliche Blackbeard. There are plenty other times in the game where you'll need your valiant swordsmanship, so be prepared for that. Other than that, it's working up the ranks of kingdom militaries, winning the heart of a governor's daughter (or a few, if you're into that...), finding your lost family members (NOT a spoiler, btw), and pillaging and exploring as you see fit. Don't forget to do some special missions along the way, trust me, they're actually fun and not a waste of time. Just try not to get too frustrated when searching the endless jungle lands for treasures and buildings, because you'll start to make so much more sense of the treasure maps you pick up as you go. There's more that I could say here, but you're probably already itching your mouse to hit that Add To Wishlist button, so I'll letcha go.TL;DR: Pirates!			"

												This Review Did Come In Late.. Like A Few Years Late... But, This Is The Best Pirate Game I've Ever Played. Just Look At My Screenshots For It! I Would Say More, But This Is As Simple As I Can Put It. I've found out how to do a few glitches and exploits for the game here and there. But yeah. It is fun if you can mess with the game. And also, If you want to find mods for this game, (Since it's ridiculously hard to find them since this game is very very old and forgotten by many people) Here's a link: http://www.hookedonpirates.com/ This is very old as well and pretty much forgotten. But they work. Have fun this this ancient relic of a game. Still amazing despite it's age. It just goes to show, Don't hate a game, Or forget it just because it's old. Old games can be better than some of the new games. As some of the newer games are rushed due to some people money whoring/etc. There's few masterpeices in gaming nowadays sadly. I wish it weren't true. But it is. But yeah. I 100% Fully Reccomend this game if you want to have a pirate experiance in a game.			"

This time I managed to beat it in about 4 days because I played it so much. It's very enjoyable to play a dashing rogue who sails the high seas fighting enemy captains and dancing with gorgeous girls. Until they make newer open world pirate simulation that I enjoy I think this will remain my go to game for such an adventure.			"

This game has truly stood the test of time, being accessible to younger audiences while also capable of bringing a real challenge to experienced gamers.

To objectively judge women based on their appearance? To be a duke in four seperate empires while they are all at war with one another? Then, I've got a game for you! It's called Sid Meier's Pirates, which aside from becoming repetitive, is a terrific game that every swashbuckling player should at least try. And just look at that price, it's practically piracy in of itself!			"

Dated by todays standards, any fans of the fictionalized 'Golden Age of Piracy', that can get past the aging graphics and interface, will be deeply rewarded.

												I discovered this pearl of a game on a LAN way back. One of the other attendees was just sitting there playing Pirates while the rest of us where shooting each other dead in Counter-Stike and gibbing it up in Unreal Tournament.It struck me as odd he'd be wasting valuable ""LAN-time"" (we only managed to get together like once or twice a year) playing a single-player game, so I felt intriqued to have a look.At a first glance it looked stupid: Just sailing around with his ship and picking random fights. But I gave it a shot and I was hooked for months to come.There's was certain blizz to sail about the caribbean. The game was beautiful in it's own way: One didn't pay attention to the blatant disregard for scale or the rather poor textures, because the world felt so alive with tropical colours. The gameplay was fun and varied, once you got in to the ""nitty-gritty"" of the core gameplay as well as all the mini-games. There was also a suprising depth to the game, where the market changed and countries would got to war and make peace. Simply put the game felt alive, and you where free to to what you wanted within this world.I could probably go on trying to describe the magic that makes Sid Meier's Pirates so enticing, but based on my own experience I think it's just one of those games that has to be experienced.If one could vote for the next big remaster, Sid Meier's Pirates would be on the top of my list.

												The game in its core is a collection of mini-games that all work towards a common goal and make it more than the sum of its parts. Lots of activities in the game, from sea battles, trading, ""massive"" town sieges, finding buried treasure and all the other pirate stuff you expect to do in a game with the name ""Pirates!"".There is something here for everyone I would say and you should really have it in your library. It is easy to jump in and out of and won't take a lots of time to enjoy it. The only thing I don't like about this game is that the movement and action keys are bound to the numpad, but with that said it does not take away from the game that much and you get used to it pretty quick. Overall, it is one of the best pirate themed games ever and it is dirt cheap, especially if on sale.			"

												The definitive pirate video game. Capture and plunder ships and towns, search for lost relatives, engage in battle on the high seas, pick your weapon and duel another captain, and more. While some of what you do can get to become tedious or repetitive, and not everything is perfect, this game still has a massive fun factor.You start the game and get to play for any of the 4 different factions: the Dutch, Fench, Spanish and English. Over the course of the game, you'll complete various tasks for each faction, as well as personal objectives, finally retiring in your old age and in failing health.This game is worth the price even when not on sale, but it's a total steal when it's discounted. Pure fun, plain and simple.			"

												I absolutely love this game, but take it with a grain of salt because I love every pirate game ever made. The main story was fairly engaging, the trading system is surprisingly fun, and the scripted fights are usually fun and visually cool (you can throw a guy out a window!). That said, on the higher difficulties ship battles, dances, and fights can become a huge trial to get through. A ton of aspects in the game rely on a sort of quicktime click x to do the right thing mechanic that is sometimes cool because it’s so simple but can get rather boring and frustrating after a while. If you’re interested in playing a pirate and exploring the world, then give this one a try. 8/10 best pirate game I’ve seen in a long time.			"
