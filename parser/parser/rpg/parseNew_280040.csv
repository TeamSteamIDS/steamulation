												It starts out being a blast as you rescue townsfolk, get newer and better items, and get further along into the game; but eventually devolves into repetitiveness. Although a roguelike in vein of TLoZ and BoI, it hardly gets very random. Due to this, as your skill level goes up, you get further in just to be hit by gobs of enemies. This is where the game's fault lies in as the enemies tend to take a lot of punishment before going down. As you get to the final area of the game, it gets worse in this regard as now said sponge enemies now hit like trucks and with every death you'll just be visiting the same rooms over and over and over. Now in an average roguelike, this wouldn't be a problem. In AWL, it's hardly random enough to give the player a reason to continue to do so.Finding blueprints enables you to reduce the luck element by finding a good enough item that you can now use at the beginning of the game upon purchasing it. However, even that process could essentially be considered ""grinding"" as you're going through the same places yet again to get something to help you get through the game's 3 main areas.Due to enemies spamming you in large amounts and them being able to take a heavy amount of punishment; rather than them changing up tactics, (or even getting new attacks or becoming faster for example) they essentially don't do anything creative with them. Everything else, such as the music, is passable at best. Overall, the game's faults will eventually wear you out on enjoying it.			"

												You awaken in a Wizard's Tower as Raga, the adorable reptilian familiar of a great wizard, only to witness your master being taken away by Death himself. After a brief tutorial, it turns out the little guy wants to take on Death's Crypts and its perils all alone and here your adventure begins. The story is very straight forward, very effective and is perfectly reminiscent of the best titles of the 80s and 90s. A Wizard's Lizard is a fantastic new top-down ARPG dungeon crawling experience which borrows many light elements from the roguelike genre, making it a more than worthy addition to Steam's growing library of rogue-lites.While beginning A Wizard's Lizard I can see that buried under all of it's simple and elegant charm there is a lot of content to be discovered. The first thing I noticed is that aside from our strong-willed little Lizard mascot, there are 4 more mysteriously blacked out character slots for unlockable types all of varying look and ability. After the short cutscene and tutorial you stumble into the huge halls of a luxurious and massive museum where you learn that the cherished artifacts of this sprawling monument have been stolen by, once again, Death himself. There are at least six different vast rooms in the museum all full of empty podiums for you to fill up with items, enemies and a vast array of other unlockables that you find throughout your journey, just another telling sign of the incredible amount of content and replayability that you will find with this game.Your next stop before getting into the chaotic meat of this addictive game is the town which you'll notice at first seems a little empty. You find out that lost in the Cemetery ahead are the people of this once thriving town for you to find who will give different perks such as discounts in shops which are all persistent throughout your plays and once again adds another insane layer of content to this already hefty game. As you find people certain areas of the town will fill out for you to interact with including the Shop and Tavern, creating more and more reason to revisit the starting area as you delve deeper and deeper.You have several main abilities to master in your endeavors through the dungeons ahead including your main weapon which is tied to precise right-stick directions, a dash ability, soul Orbs which act as bombs, and Totem Poles which act as defensive towers with different forms for you to find and try. There are loads upon loads of different items and artifacts to find of varying abilities such as the skill to see damage numbers in combat or increased attack power and every single one of them alters your gameplay just enough to change up your playstyle on every consecutive run, keeping you on your toes each time. The game is definitely challenging though you are given a second chance with the very cool and unique life/death system, plunging you into the realm of the dead upon the loss of life and turning you into a ghost for extended play. This isn't as much of a relief as it sounds, however, as you will be joined by the rampaging spirits of foes killed in the past.As you get into the core gameplay things happen very quick instantly throwing you into the hectic rooms of the cemetary all of which are procedurally-generated and randomized in classic roguelite fashion, bustling with hordes of enemies and destructible objects scattered all across the enviroment. The action itself is very tight, precise, fast paced twin-stick fare which require quick reflexes and fast thinking with your arsenal of abilities and there is so much going on in a single room it can sometimes get overwhelming. Luckily with the perks you get from various items, upgrades to your abilities such as Totem Poles, persistent bonuses from rescuing townspeople, and discoverable shortcuts the game becomes more manageable, fun, and addictive with every play.Most will be quick to put this in the same category as other top-down roguelites of recent years, but I'd say A Wizard's Lizard sets itself apart by achieving a much closer feeling to the classics it was inspired by than titles such as Binding of Isaac by having a much stronger and more realized resemblance to the sound, aesthetics, and gameplay of old favorites akin to Zelda or Gauntlet. There is no limit to the replayability of A Wizard's Lizard, and it is a must-buy as well as a very welcome addition to the world of roguelite dungeon crawlers. "

												An Indie darling in its own right, Binding of Isaac has had the benefit of an extensive DLC expansion and being developed and produced by the one of the creators of the critically acclaimed Super Meat Boy. To this day, both of these still hold a spot amongst my most favorite games. I’ve put near 40 hours into my Isaac addiction alone, so I’m rather critical when it comes to grading similar titles. With my time with the Wizard’s Lizard, I’ve found an equally addicting affair that takes several lauded features from Isaac and other similar roguelike titles, and modifies and even improves some to craft an occasionally familiar, but wholly enjoyable experience.First and foremost, WL plays like a twin-stick Isaac; you’re not limited to 4-way firing. You also have a dedicated sprinting function, which you will utilize to get out of sticky situations. Rather than bombs, you have access to a magical immediate-area blast attack and “totems” which, depending on type, can be laid at any point and can rain all manner of elemental justice on your enemies. These run on a cooldown system, and it quickly shows to be an unwise decision to waste them on weaker enemies. In fact, a major benefit the totems bring to gameplay is an element of strategy that Isaac typically lacks. There are situations where enemies will not be defeated by standard weaponry alone before they can reach you, but with a well-placed totem, a trap can fell a group of nasties before they have the opportunity to sap half your health bar. And sap it they will, but then even this becomes a unique part of WL, as death isn’t the end. In fact, it’s often the means to great rewards! Dying once turns your character in a halo wearing ghost, and this brings new implications and dangers. On death, enemies occasionally leave behind spirits of their own, and while in your own ghostly form, they can now hurt you. The risk comes in several dungeon-wide escapades that require the use of living and ghostly forms to pursue, as being ghost lizard allows you access to specific items that only he can reach. While death can bring on even greater challenges with new enemies, it’s entirely possible to earn your life back. Fighting through the ghostly hoard to earn back the privilege of your fleshy exterior is all but imperative, as you will not likely survive the later areas without the crutch of your ghostly half to fall back on should you perish again. Just like in Isaac, every game you start drops you in a fairly different series of rooms each time, though they start to blend together on repeat playthroughs, as the situational variety tends to dwindle quickly. In lieu of upgrades that give or modify abilities, you find a variety of weapons and equipment, like helmets, gloves, charms and the like. However, (and this is a big issue I have with WL), wearing a spiked helmet, green gloves, demon boots, a diamond ring, several charm necklaces AND carrying an abacus around do not change my appearance in the slightest. One of the most entertaining visual aspects of Isaac was the variety of horrid things you could do to him simply by finding upgrades! The game loses an excellent source of entertainment by not providing similar feedback to the player beyond a menu screen list.In keeping up with any upgrades and items you’ve nabbed, the in-game menu screen provides a much needed function that I always wish was in Isaac. You always have access to a larger map and a detailed list of all owned items and their abilities. This leads to my favorite feature in Lizard, one that really sets it apart from Isaac in a superb way: progression! Before beginning a run, you’re dropped into a hub, where you have access to a store. While dungeoning, you may run across special shops that will sell you a single blueprint. These blueprints give permanent additions to the hub store, where you can buy and set your starting equipment before each run. To earn money for your equipment, you must seek out missing adventurers in the dungeons and rescue them. Each rescue adds a permanent 500 gold to your starting funds, and a plucky new npc to wander around the hub.But far and away my favorite indication of progression comes from the upper door in the hub, which leads to the museum. What could be in a museum, you ask? Well, this museum provides several rooms, each detailing a specific aspect your progression. How many enemies have you killed from a specific dungeon? What weapons have you found? Equipment sorted through? Each found item finds a resting place, along with an apt description of what it is and what it does. The enemy rooms indicate just how many you’ve killed, along with an often cute description and their behavior pattern. It adds an entirely new dynamic to playing the game, and appeals to my want to play just one more in hopes of finding another something to add to my collection. The metagame is strong in this one.The last item of importance in the hub is the ability to open shortcuts to further dungeon zones a la Spelunky. Opening the first one was a bit of a pain for me, so I’ll enjoy not explaining how I did it.There are secrets that are in no way apparent on your first, fifth, or twentieth playthrough, and I won’t give any hints as to the whereabouts of the few I know of. What I will touch on is possibly the most important aspect of this game in relation to Isaac: The Difficulty. Typically, the game is standard fare, with your ability to escape dungeons unscathed hinging on your ability to adapt to specific creatures and situations that most often present themselves. That said, there were certainly rare instances of little resistance prior to a specific room, only to be so completely overwhelmed as to die then and there. At the end of each zone you will come across a boss, and this is one of the stronger aspects of WL when compared to Isaac. In Isaac, boss characters may differ on colors, and therefore strength, speed or defense. In WL, bosses behave differently, with varying methods of attack, depending on your luck of the draw. I can’t tell you how irritated I was to reach the first boss for the second or third time only for him to whip out an entirely different attack pattern that I hadn’t previously witnessed… and kill me. I was flabbergasted in the best possible way. That said, boss encounters can be too difficult. They have far too much health, and the few attack upgrades you can find barely augment your strength to point where I didn’t even really notice a difference. Expect to spend a lot of time learning patterns and flexing your muscle memory if you want to succeed.Wizard’s Lizard more than scratches the itch left by Binding of Isaac, and improves and even introduces many features unique to the genre. This game relies heavily on acquired blueprints, making your starting inventory the most important aspect of each playthrough. During my play time, I’ve noticed several mechanics and ideas lifted straight from the most popular action rogues, namely Isaac and Spelunky, but this in no way detracted from my time with WL. Rather it insights warm feelings of times gone by with some of my favorite gaming experiences. In the week that I’ve been playing WL, features have been added and notable tweaks were made. I fully expect more content to make its way in for a good while, and what’s here is already arguably more than enough. In short, this game is excellent, and easily sucks away the hours crawling through dungeons just to get a little bit closer to the end, or find that one item or blueprint you’ve been pining after.

												Someone recomended me this game because it was supposedly similar to ""Binding of Isaac"", but had native controller support and other roguelike elements and I decided to try. The game was interesting on the first run, but once I realized how little the items added to the gameplay and the repetitive nature of the levels it got boring pretty quick. In my opinion, what makes ""Binding of Isaac"" shine as a great game are the unique items and the carefully balanced challenge. You keep trying to do one run after another, motivated by the thrill of what new item combination you will obtain, how will it affect your gameplay and how far can you get with it. I felt no such thing in AWL, none at all. After 10 runs or so the SAME items would keep popping over and over, and I could barely tell the difference between any of them. The weapons were the most interesting part, but even so they had all the same damage and it didn't fell much different from using any of them.The ""level design"" was OK at best, switching quickly from empty rooms with a zombie to a large room with 5 enemies at close range, while a goblin throws daggers at you and a werewolf comes charging from off-screen.  Then an empty room with explosive barrels and a switch that opens the door. I get it is ""randomly generated"", but the generation mechanics and base rooms should be more interesting or ballanced. The player should be given the opportunity to gear a bit or meeting new enemies before being thrown in a room with 10 of it charing at him.The totem mechanic interested me a lot, but then I got an abbacus and checked the totem damage, which was basically the same as my own weapon and got disappointed. I tried to make a full-totem build by obtaining the totem book and shaman items, but in the end using it was so clunky, having to put it on the ground and kite enemies to it while waiting for it to poof and hope that the hitbox didn't cheat me. Most of the times it was simply easier to backtrack and throw hits at the enemy one at a time than wait for them to get hit by the totem.Now don't get me wrong, I love ""roguelikes"" and the difficulty associated with them, but what makes them fun is the possibility to test your limits and play the game everytime with a different set of cards. This feels to me more like I am playing an old NES game like Ghosts and Goblins where I have to keep repeating the same stuff and the difficulty is centered around perfect timing, patience and execution of it.I personally do not recommend the game, and if you feel that the things I cited are important for you, if you enjoyed ""Binding of Isaac"" for the items and hate doing the same stuff again, maybe this is not the game for you.

												My main issues with A Wizard's Lizard are: the game is too repetitive; there is not enough content; and everything becomes annoying (enemies, rooms, equipment).A Small Explanation Of What A Wizard's Lizard Is All AboutA Wizard's Lizard is very similar to The Binding of Isaac, but has an upgrade system similar to Rogue Legacy. During your crawl in the dungeon you can rescue an infinite number of villagers (3 max per crawl) who each give you 500 Gold to start each of your runs with. You spend your money before you enter the dungeon (or choose to save some or all of it for in-dungeon purchases). You spend your money on weapons / other equipment of which you purchase blueprints for in the dungeon. Dying will leave you in ghost form, but you can return to normal on the second part of each area.The Game Is Too RepetitiveThere are 3 main areas (Cemetery, Sewers, Crypt) each with 3 parts to them (e.g. Sewer 1, Sewer 2, Sewer 3) and 2 sub-areas with 1 part each respectively. That's it. All crawls feel the same because everything is set in stone. Blueprints, shopkeepers (and the kinds of items they sell), secret enemies and paths will always be in the same areas (e.g. Cemetery 2 will always have a blueprint for purchase, and Crypt 1 will always have a villager to rescue in the area). You always fight Death at the end. There are no surprises. Someone even wrote a guide on what you can find exactly in each level: https://steamcommunity.com/app/280040/discussions/0/540744934619347325/?There Is Not Enough ContentMany of the weapons feel the same and I think a lot of them should not even be in the game. There's even a weapon called the Owl Slayer that is very effective against Owl enemies. The problem with bringing such a weapon is that Owl enemies are only in the first area (Cemetery). Owls are not even difficult enough to warrant bringing a weapon for the sole purpose of making it easier to kill them. As stated before, there are 3 main areas with 2 sub-areas. One of the sub-areas does not have a Boss at the end, so that's 3 main Bosses and 1 sub-boss. There are also a couple special enemies you can fight if you want to, but you usually do not want to. Unlocking shortcuts to the Crypt and Sewers are laughably easy. You just have to kill one of those special enemies in each area once, which is not hard at all. You will also encounter the same enemies over and over with the exception of a few rare enemies. The game has 72 blueprints to collect (those 72 blueprints do not even include every piece of equipment in the game). The game has a Museum that lets you know which weapons / equipment you have completed the game with. I have completed the game with every weapon and piece of equipment and I can say it was not worth it.Everything Is AnnoyingThe Rooms: There is so much BS in a lot of the rooms that you have to be overly careful. Every room becomes a tedious nightmare making the game difficult for all the wrong reasons. There are so many non-enemy structures that when destroyed will send projectiles flying out and are very annoying. The Crypt is littered with arrow wall traps and the Sewers have wall traps that spew green liquid on you that slows you down and is more of a nuisance than anything. Rooms freeze with all activated / deactivated traps as they were when you leave a room. So if there is a sliding spike trap located near a door and it barely misses you as you get through the door, you will have to take damage on the way back for not paying attention. Another instance of this happening is when you die and become a ghost; all ghost enemies in previously completed rooms will be unfrozen like the spike trap. I died on a crawl one time after I was backtracking to get revived when I went through a room I had cleared before when I was alive, but now it had a skull ghost in the doorway which killed me instantly upon entering the room. Another annoying part of the rooms is that they can have annoying traps like webs on the floor that slow you down, fans that push or pull you, spike traps that spring up from under the floor, and spike traps that slide across the floor when you get in range. They are all annoying and everywhere.The Weapons / Equipment: Damage upgrades are necessary if you want to have a fun time in your crawls, but they are somewhat rare (for one thing you cannot purchase any of them at the town before a crawl) and all of the damage upgrades except for the charms come with a downgrade. The downgrade is that with each piece of spiked equipment you put on, your fire rate will go down.The Enemies: Once you enter a room with enemies you cannot leave until every enemy is dead (except for the 2 crystal enemies). This becomes especially annoying when you go into a room on accident. Some of the enemies can be fun to fight like the two types of Owls who attack you depending on which Owl type you attack which have some great strategic scenarios. And then there are all of the other enemies who all feel the same. Some enemies can freeze or slow you, but the majority of them just charge at you. The later stages feel like there are too many enemies / traps and the enemies have too much health. Some enemies can even kill you in one hit with an explosion against a wall.Final ThoughtsIf you're a completionist, you may find some entertainment from collecting every available blueprint (which was a pain to do by the way) or completing the game with every weapon and piece of equipment (which also was not very fun). The Museum also tracks how many times you've killed an enemy and will make the trophy of that monster Golden when you've ""Mastered"" killing them. This can mean a low number of kills like 25 or upwards of 500+. I'm not even going to try that because a lot of the enemies are rare or take a long time to get to.You may also be interested in this game if you want a 10-20 hour game that you never want to play again.

			A Wizard's Lizard on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/280040/ A Wizard's Lizard is a Zelda-inspired roguelike reminiscent of The Binding of Isaac with some elements of Rogue Legacy thrown in.		

GeneralYou may think that I absolutely love this game if you've looked at my hours played, and although I am enjoying it and I do recommend it, take it with a grain of salt please. I've found this game to be somewhat difficult, but the completionist in me just can not accept defeat, and so I keep coming back again and again. At this point I have 50 deaths and 0 wins. Therefore, I'm not at all sure what the ratio is between the game being challenging and my skill level being awful.There are a few characters to unlock, however that is far in your future if you're anything like me. First you need to learn the ropes of the game. One of the most enjoyable aspects of a Wizard's Lizard is the opportunity to explore for yourself and get to grips with how to accomplish the objective of the game. However, as you learn a little more each time you die, it has to be said that the biggest drawback to this game is the repetativeness.Last of all, I must mention that I have not played The Binding of Isaac, and therefore I can not give you any comments comparing the two games to each other. I find the Binding of Isaac too gory.GameplayYou are a lizard. A very cute lizard that looks cross and sticks his tongue out every time you attack. Your objective is to battle Death and help your wizard. You do this by wandering through the dungeon until you get to the last area. There are three main areas and two side areas. Getting hit (losing health) is a very bad thing because healing items are relatively few and far between. As you progress further and further into the dungeon, you'll be able to rescue villagers and buy blueprints which are the two persistent progression aspects to the game. They will give you more options in town before you start a run, making you more powerful, and thus more likely to get further.That's about it. It's pretty simple. Kill stuff before it kills you. Don't get hit. Get to the end. Although, as I might have mentioned before, it isn't necessarily easy to do.ControlsControls are WASD to move and arrow keys to attack (you can also use the mouse to attack, but I found it rather cumbersome to use). There are few hotkeys to learn to make life easier, but the three most important ones are: Z is a spell attack, X puts down a totem, and shift makes you dash. It's important to learn to use your abilities to help you clear out rooms faster and with less death.StorylineVery basic. It's really more of a theme than anything else. At the start there is a short cutscene setting you up to go rescue your wizard. Since I haven't managed to win a game yet I can't comment much more than that.SoundI really enjoy the music, it's quite fun if repetitive, but repetitive like Tetris or other beloved old games. You are warned if you hate repetitive music. The sound effects are rather basic and a little jarring on the ears. There are only a few which I deem practical sounds - giving you warning of an incoming attack.GraphicsDelightful graphics in my opinion. Cartoony, sure, but charming. I also appreciate that I can turn off the bloody globs of zombie exploding because I do not enjoy gore. The lighting effects are very neat, although after a while they became tiresome for me because they do make gameplay harder. There is an option to turn the lighting effects off.Pros+ explore the game for yourself to learn the ropes+ charming graphics+ hotkeys+ a lot to do for completionists+ achievements*** are more like challenges+ super cute lizardCons- repetitive- repetitive- repetitiveHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you. It’s my hope to make the reviews that I do take the time to write up, as helpful as they possibly can be.Rothana's Steam Review ArchiveFor those that are interested in seeing more of my reviews, I have set up an archive of them at an external website. I don't earn anything off of this at all, it's just a little side project that I add to when I can. Steam won't let me create a direct link though, so you'll need to make your own way to the URL I describe now: rothana dot weebly dot comFootnotes*Any prices that I mention are in CDN because that is what I see. The primary price I list at the top is the price that I bought the game at.**I will not be keeping an eye on whether the links are up to date, so if they are broken I apologise. Remember that these are external websites and I'm just trying to be helpful - I'm not responsible for the content on the other end.***Don't even get me started on achievements. My rant follows: Suffice it to say that I think most achievements are complete waste of space. The only reason I'm going to mention them as a plus point on a game is if they're being used properly. I don't care if you managed to kill your first zombie in the first five minutes of the tutorial... that isn't an achievement. Achievements should be challenges for the player to complete which are somewhat difficult to accomplish, and/or make you think about the game in a different way, thereby getting you to explore different ways of doing things and thus expanding upon the gameplay.Edit Log27/11/2014 added ""help me help you"" section18/02/2015 added ""rothana's archive"" section			"

												BIAS: I did a spot of Beta testing on it but forced myself to stick with bugs, no feature requests (usually). I'm attempting to review the game as someone without this experience obviously, apologies in advance for where the lines blur.DESCRIPTIONWizard's Lizard is a procedurally generated 3/4 view Gauntlet-like/Zelda-like. You play a Lizard called Raga but there are unlockable characters. The story is bare bones, someone's gone, go get them and there's stuff getting in your way along the way.You earn gold as you go which allows you to buy equipment at the shops, Armour, Buff Items, Weapons and the relatively new Totems (area of effect device with cooldown). There's also a big shop at the start in the town area that you help stock with items by finding blueprints for them the dungeons.Your starting gold and starting shop inventory is state, it's saved whenever you quit the game. So as play goes on you get richer and your starting shop is more bountiful. In time using the better equipment will obviously allow you to take a pop at some of the harder looking achievements, speedrunning etc.In terms of gameplay you run around a series of procedurally generated rooms that lock when you enter like Zelda, when everything hostile is dead you can leave again. Every weapon in your inventory is thrown at the enemy like in Gauntlet. Almost every enemy is shooting at you as well, it's pretty slow-paced so I'd say don't expect bullet-hell. The room design was constantly (and presumably still is) tweaked so the challenge instead coalesces more from claustrophobic room setups and a blocked off paths here and there rather than constant twitch-style play. Watch out for traps though.Where the game takes its own route is the death mechanic, when you die everything goes bright as you enter a kind of purgatory where the souls of most of the monsters you've killed, even in preceding rooms are now after you. The game's parlance is to call it ""The Realm of the Dead"" (or RoTD). The living monsters that you left behind in the Realm of the Living (let's call it RoTL) however can also still hit you so you're basically increasing your monster count if you're unfortunate enough to die, you've received a second chance but it's slightly harder so it's more of a wake up call if anything. Once you die here you really die this time and it's game over.As you might think there are elements of the game that actually require you to be in the RoTD like to pick up a key for a chest or something similar. You can bring yourself back to life by standing on a single-use pentagram, but it really is only single-use and there's not many of them, they cover entire monsterless rooms so you'll spot them when you see it.PROS:Out of every procedurally-generated game I've played, this one has the least amount of rooms designed and it shows in the quality of the rooms. There's more than the average brain could handle and that's enough, a lot of other developers could take note from this, less is more.Fast startup, after some one-time story dialogue every playthrough is instant.Secrets, quite a bit to discover, not just in terms of unlockables but also in aspects of the mechanics.The art, very well polished. What you see in the trailer and screenshots is constant throughout no lapse in quality that I can see.The boss design, can't go further without spoilers.Enemy movement, with each new monster comes a new movement pattern. Variety (and dodging) abounds when two opposing enemy styles meld in the one room as you're backing into a corner.CONS:Something has to suffer particularly in a small indie team and undoubtedly in this game it's the sound. The sound effects are pretty low quality and quite a lot of the music is too short and you can hear the point when it loops. Not disastrous though, I've certainly not had to take to turning the sound off or anything. Hopefully the quality will increase with further development.Sometimes they tell you, sometimes they don't. There are elements of the game that need explaining just like in Binding of Isaac, except where Binding of Isaac clearly drew a line between when it was a real secret and when it wasn't, in this game it really comes across like sometimes they had the time and sometimes they didn't. Again something I'm sure can change over time.Lag. It's made in HTML5 and JavaScript using 2D Canvas, squeezing the kind of performance they already get is very impressive but it beggars the obvious question, why choose these development tools? Rendering with another engine like Pixi or going straight to WebGL would likely melt these problems away in an instant, might not be plausible on existing code base but hopefully 2D Canvas is not the way of Lost Decade's future projects. (BIAS: There is a short term lag issue with mouse right now as well that shouldn't be around for too long, they should be able to squash that one quite quick)SUMMARY/CONCLUSION/QUESTIONS THAT I MADE UP:Worth £10.99?A lot more, doubtlessly. I paid closer to £25 for early access if I remember right. Worth every penny.Blah blah blah blah Binding of Isaac?Binding of Isaac was made by someone widely considered to be one of the best indie game developers currently working , with a number of finished titles already under his belt. He pulled inspiration from as far back as Nethack and peppered the story with elements of his own childhood and worked with a legendary game musician so he could tell a story. If you like me came to Wizard's Lizard because you enjoyed Binding of Isaac then you've found an excellent game but not another Binding of Isaac. Their intentions differ from each other and it shows, yes even in the gameplay. (BIAS: I can actually confirm that regardless of superficial similarities the developers have mentioned several times that this game was not inspired by Binding of Isaac, directly or indirectly. I think it was specifically Zelda 3 they drew from but can't remember)What would I like to see in the game?The game is complete as is I feel but I think the Realm of the Dead is far too decoupled from the rest of the game, there are a few opportunities to willingly kill yourself and reap any kind of benefit and they add up to less than a handful of scripted events from the devs, I feel this could do with the most fleshing out. Secondly, achievements, achievements, achievements, there's far too few, this game could do with so much more. I'm assuming they still want to change the game about a bit and they don't want to create an achievement that then becomes obsolete after an update but I hope more achievements follow soon.I thoroughly enjoy the game and speedrunning it later in the year will be a lot of fun. The kills really mount up and before you know it you begin to feel a pang of remorse for wiping out 864 owls or imagining the families of the scores of slain Goblins, good Goblins who died in the Amberfall Death Wars to your psychopathic Lizard, their widows traipsing through the desolate Cemetery with their late husbands dual daggers wrapped in cloth saying ""...this is all that's left of him. Haven't you done enough!! Can't we challenge death as you have!!"", but you don't hear them, you're knee deep in the remains of some minotaur smashing down lanterns for spare gold. He also recovers health by eating cupcakes! So kids will enjoy it too it's got that dual fun element to it.There's not much else to explain, go watch a couple of let's play videos and you'll get if it's for you or not. It wears a lot of what makes it so fun on it's sleeve. WYSIWYG. A resounding thumbs up from me.			"

												A Wizard's Lizard (AWL) is a unique roguelike which not only shines because of its graphics, but also by its innovation and gameplay.Unlike typical roguelikes (RLs) AWL features progression, meaning that you can free townsfolk each of whom grants you money for your next runs. During your runs you can aquire blueprints which allow you to purchase gear before your next attempt.This system makes dieing less punishing and significantly lowers the frustration level which is typical for this genre.Unlike other RLs AWL grants you a 2nd chance when you die. You can walk around as a ghost, but will face more enemies. If you manage to reach a pentagramm you can also revive yourself! Tip: There are puzzles and secrets which require you to be a ghost!This being said, AWL is a very ""skill"" dependent game. Snowballing into victory by overpowered items won't happen.AWL also features an interesting totem system. Totems are stationary buffs, debuffs or ""turrets"" that can be found during or, with according blueprints, purchased before the run.Giving a player ""abilities"" is nothing new, but it's relatively new for roguelikes. It's also worth mentioning since it was introduced as direct result of community feedback.Having followed and played the game for 5 month before the initial release, I am happy to see that the Devs not only do their best to fix the usual problems, but also value gameplay suggestions.I deeply recommand this game, for roguelike-veterans as well as players who are new to the genre.

												While this game looks nice, has a great theme and tone set by the visuals, and has a pretty nice upgrade system, there were many things that really killed my enjoyment of it.While individual rooms are generated well, with a random layout and varied monsters, each floor is utterly predictable, from the number of rooms to the effective contents of each.You don't do much damage, and you don't have many ways to get HP back, which is nice and reasonable, however every time you kill an enemy or break a destructable object the entire screen shakes.  It seems like overkill, and quickly becomes more of an annoyance.  Does every single kill need to have that impact?  You can have upwards of 50 creatures on the screen at a time in some rooms.  That's stopped being an occasional screen shake and become more of a semi-permanant earthquake.The graphics look nice, but the game ran very badly on my machine.  If more than one enemy was taking damage at a time the whole game seemed to tank for a few frames.  If several traps go off at once, again, it tanks.The game runs in a window, which is nice, but if you accidentally click outside the window, which is far from hard with a mouse controlled twin-stick shooter, then the game 'locks' whatever keyboard input it had until you jiggle it.  for example, if you were walking downwards, you will continue walking downwards when you alt-tab back into it.  For movement skills this is easy enough to fix, but it is particularly annoying when you accidentally lock down your sprint button, which prevents you from shooting and has a cooldown.  Then 2-3 seconds after coming back into the game and fixing your movement, you find yourself sprinting off into the wall of spikes.Running the game fullscreen letterboxes off either side of my screen.  This is an understandable design descision, since having a fixed player camera makes sense, I won't hold that against the developers.  However I will hold against them the fact that you can still click in the black regions with my mouse to target, and the game doesn't recognise that input, as if you had clicked out of the game.  That's just bad.Overall, while a nice game that would have done well as a free flash game, it quickly becomes very repeditive, and has enough buggy quality issues to make me sorely regret paying the full $15 price.

												***IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN UPDATED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CURRENT 2.0.10 BETA VERSION. TO USE THIS VERSION, RIGHT-CLICK THE GAME IN THE LIBRARY, GO TO PROPERTIES, THE BETA TAB, THEN SELECT BETA IN THE PULLDOWN MENU.***A Wizard's Lizard is not so much a Roguelike as a ""Binding of Isaac-like."" When I first saw gameplay of this game, I was instantly charmed by it. Being a Binding of Isaac fan, I've really wanted something to sink my teeth into while patiently awaiting BoI: Rebirth. Right out of the gate, this game has a lot working in its favor - an adorable protagonist, a creative premise (which informs its dual-natured gameplay), a great degree of challenge, a decent soundtrack, and a style and humor all its own, with references to Final Fantasy, Zelda, and even The Wicker Man.The challenge is something that comes on strong right from the start, as you are left with very few resources at your disposal to counter the massive hordes of enemies with their sights on you. To counteract this, the game rewards you for multiple playthroughs by allowing you to find blueprints and rescue villagers. If you are able to find an item blueprint, that item will be available for you to purchase back at the beginning hub town. In addition, each villager you rescue will allow you to begin the game with an additional 500 gold. At first I felt this slightly cheapened the experience by taking a random element out of the gameplay, but I quickly found that it allowed for a more customized approach while still keeping the game's random elements intact. In addition, these elements are completely optional, and playing through ""naked"" is a completely viable tactic to those who are brave and skilled enough.There is a great variety of weapon and armor styles in the game, with even the starter weapons ranging from a spear that travels further and more quickly, to double daggers that are weaker against single enemies but are better suited for dealing with larger groups. The weapon variety isn't as vast as that of Binding of Isaac, but it is still early on in the game's life and new content has been added and rebalanced at an incredible rate already.The game sports some other options for battling, however. Raga - the titular lizard in A Wizard's Lizard - is capable of two forms of magical attack. The first is a soul-based magical attack, which attacks surrounding enemies, dealing incredible damage. Each usage of this attack will use up a collected soul that you have stored. It can, however, turn the tide of a seemingly hopeless battle in a hurry, making it a spectacular desperation attack.The other alternative is Totemic magic. Raga will place a totem on the ground and that totem will attack with a magical effect a number of times before disappearing. The default totem is a little underwhelming, shooting a four-way, low damage fireball. However, there are many totem upgrades you can find, such as one that fires long-range boulders, one that performs its own version of your soul attack, or one that freezes enemies in place, allowing you to attack them or make a quick escape. The advantages to totems are a: the attack comes from them and not you, allowing you to focus on other things, and b: you have unlimited usages of totems, unlike soul-based magic. the disadvantage is that totems have a significantly longer cooldown time, and you might often find yourself sighing in frustration early on as a poorly-placed totem hits nothing, causing you to wait several seconds before you can place another.The soul magic also enters into another mechanic of this game - death. In A Wizard's Lizard, if you die once, it is NOT game over. Instead, you become a spirit and now are fighting on another plane, in which formerly harmless ghosts are now substantial and dangerous. The upside to this is that you will find significantly more souls to fuel your magic attacks than in the physical world, and can also find treasures normally not accessible to you. I do feel that this idea could lend itself to more dual-layered gameplay than it does, but it is nevertheless a creative and unique concept for a Roguelike. I have no doubt that as levels and content are added, this will be addressed admirably.And ultimately, this one of the strongest points I can recommend this game on. I've been paying very close attention to this title, and the developers at Lost Decade Games have shown an incredible amount of effort and passion in adding to and rebalancing the game. It's a sign of a company that takes gaming seriously and wants to offers the player the most enjoyable experience possible.What it really all comes down to is this. If you are a fan of classic-styled adventure games and/or Binding of Isaac, and you are looking for something new to sink your teeth into, this is definitely your choice. It is an incredibly challenging game with with, style, and charm to spare.			"

												I was a huge fan of Binding of Isaac and Legend of Zelda, two games that A Wizard's Lizard is often compared too. While I have found enjoyment in this game (and its general addictive nature) I would definitely place it below the former two. It has a fun item database and interesting upgrade elements however I found the gameplay itself can become quite tedious and bug issues, specifically around some monsters cause you to die unneccesarily - very frustrating after progressing to a certain point.I would only reccommend this game to someone with a lot of time to kill, if you haven't tried Binding of Isaac I would go there first.

												Repetition.  Repetition.  Repetition.  You are doing the same thing over and over.  Nothing exciting happens.  It's fun at first, but gets old pretty fast.  I had read several reviews giving it a nod towards The Binding of Isaac.  In a way, it is, but it has nowhere near the randomness (is that a word?) of that game.  I really like the graphic style and music though.  That is what kept me playing as long as I did.  It is definitely not a terrible game, I just lost interest fast.  One thing I do know that would help the game out considerably is if there were more health ups dropping.  The only time I saw them fall was early in the game...when you don't need them.  That was a bit annoying.			"

												Not quite the game I thought it to be. Videos of the game I have seen before do not match with the game as it is now.Some mechanics (which made the game feel unique) was removed and turned into this bland rogue-lite game.Pros:- Binding-of-Isaac style gameplay.- Nice-looking artstyle and graphics.Cons:- A complete run is way too short.- Projectile hitboxes feel way too big and often hit terrain and stuff instead of enemies.- The gameplay feels.. slow.- Massive feelings of grind as you do not unlock new stuff for usa (outside characters) as you do your runs.- You quickly find the same gear over and over again.

												Most people seem to compare this game to Binding of Isaac, and that's a fair comparison. A Wizard's Lizard is a topdown twinstick Rogue-like shooter in which you explore the floors of the different dungeons, gradually earning new equipment, weapons and powers to help you along the way.As far as a ""clone"" of Binding of Isaac goes, this one is actually pretty solid. It feels and plays the part, has great music, and is presented in a graphical aesthetic that feels all it's own.One of the game's innovations is the hub village area you start in before you set out for your run attempt. At first, the village is barren and lacking in population. With each run you will occasionally find villagers who have been kidnapped by monsters. Rescue them and they return to the village, each villager rewarding you with a permanent 500 Gold boost for future runs. In each run you will also occasionally find purchasable Blueprints, which when bought will add one random item to the village store for purchase. Eventually, you will earn enough starting Gold to buy some starting equipment that fits your play style, or experiment and try different things. It's a really well thought out idea that encourages replaying and rewards players that stick with it long enough so that they can influence their run's start and not leave upgrades entirely up to luck.What really helps distinguish this game from Binding of Isaac is the life/death mechanic. Traditionally, you'll be playing most of your runs alive, but if you lose all your health, you die, and come back as an afterlife spirit, giving you a second chance. The flipside to this is that there are far more enemies in each room in death, so you have to be even more careful when in this state. If you lose your health while a spirit, you die for good, and it's Game Over. Certain points in the game will allow you to bring yourself back to life, and there are some sections which require you to be either dead or alive to access or pass through, so it's a pretty nice idea to keep things interesting.Newcomers to this who play Binding of Isaac frequently with the Xbox 360 controller, a small warning. This game has native controller support, but your shots will be aimed in any direction you point the control stick, not just N/S/E/W. If you're like me, you could be aiming in the slightly incorrect direction due to the placement of your thumb on the controller. With just four directions, there's plenty room for error in Binding of Isaac. Here, you have put in a bit more effort to make sure your shots are going in just the right direction. You'll eventually adapt, it just takes getting used to at first.It's no Binding of Isaac, but if you're looking for a cute, gore-free alternative that's pretty enjoyable in it's own right, you could do worse than A Wizard's Lizard. Highly recommended when it's on sale.			"

												As a HUGE fan of ""The Binding Of Isaac"" I had so much high hopes for A Wizard's Lizard...And i was not disappointed at all.A Roguelike with Rpg elements, that gave me the rush iv been looking for in a game with this style for sometime now.You start as a simple lizard that belongs to a wizard (hence the title), and (Wont spoil) stuff happens and you gotta be the hero.And it is not just a Roguelike that throws you in the middle of nowhere and you just keep killing sh*t.no you start at a town and talk to towns people, and go to shops, and unlock stuff, its nice having that in a Roguelike (Lite).Controls basically plays like Boi, except for shooting goes at 360* (Degrees) so it is easier to play with a keyboard + mouse for me, i like playing Shooters using a mouse :| it fully supports a controller too so dont worrythere is an option to Subscribe to beta mode of this game, to get the updates and current fixes and patches.So its great to KNOW that this game's devs are still working on it and improving it.From what i saw so far they are still adding new items and stuff continuously, thats definitely a big plus considering the fact that most promising games gets abandoned, i am glad this game isn't.With those ADORABLE graphics, this game pulls off the perfect style for an RPG-Shooter.I just love the first soundtrack, makes me feel like playing a Ps1 Rpg game.very nice level designs, and characters, and enemies, with great animations, the artwork i dare to say is perfect 10/10 everything is very beautiful.The game has a very large set of Items, and Weapons and spells (totems) that can be found or purchased.With the feature of ""Spelunky"" of finding shopkeepers as you venture through, that you can kill them to get free item ( be careful they are one TOUGH sob's)Unique weapon attacks and styles, different items and ""Builds"".As for achievements, i can say this game's achievements are pretty tough, the players database of whom finished them is really low, because they are not easy to accomplish, and i am crossing my fingers for trading cards.The game has ""Inner"" achievements or should i say unlockables ( Kill X monsters ) to unlock statues in a gallery you find at the first village.Epic Boss battles,Tough Enemies, Treasures all around , Traps , Secrets, everything is there.So lets go with this againPros - - Wonderful graphics, animations , soundtracks.- Huge set of weapons and items and unlockables.- Tricky enemies and boss battles  - High Replay Value, and i think it takes a long time to finish the game.- Addictive gameplay style.- Challenging levels, and great level design.- A mix of Zelda, Binding of isaac, And Spelunky... you cant go wrong with those 3- Different characters, items , weapons (Blueprints) to unlockCons - - I found some minor ones but as they assured me its already fixed in the Beta so its coolEDIT :  They actually fixed many bugs.- Performance issues with large rooms + many enemies.i'd definitely dare to say that if you dont buy this game you are missing out on so much fun.Trust me on this one.If you like binding of isaac, and Enjoy roguelikes, or Shooters like this.then this game is your soul mate ^^But don't take my word for it , there are many Youtube videos, thank you for reading ^^			"

												But as it is it is just kinda boring samey and grindy as hell. What makes game like Risk of Rain and Binding of Isaac good? It is the fact that not 2 runs feel the same really. But this game has way to much samey feeling. The item system is just bad. The devs should kill all items, and then rework the entire item system to be like 80% passive items that synergize. This game has 0 synergies. And honestly it is why I just can't bring myself to like it, sadly. Isaac only has 2 classes of items where you must make a choice between the item you hold or the item you find. But this game, I think all the items are a choice, you cant have 2 items to synergize, and honestly this is where this game fails...The Binding of Isaac is just so much better. I mean look at my play times, I have over 300 hrs in Isaac and not even 20 hrs in this game, and I just don't want to play it anymore. I love Playing Isaac for its crazy synergies, but this game really has none, it is almost always the same, you very rarely find something good, and the game is just way, way, WAY too hard, out of 31 attempts I have had 0 wins2\10			"

												Fun, challenging roguelike 2d twinstick shooter.This game is hard. Like, seriously hard. It makes Megaman look like a stroll in the park. It makes Binding of Isaac look like a simple mugging instead of waking up chained to a drainpipe with a hacksaw and a cellphone next to you. In short, it's HARD.If you persevere though, there are plenty of hidden secrets to uncover - secret levels, unlockable characters. The pace starts off slower than Binding of Isaac - you have to be tactical *and* strategic, but as the levels progress, can become quite frenetic. Masterpiece class in game mechanics design. Plus, Raga is so CUTE. 10/10.			"

												A Wizard's Lizard is a game in the same style to Binding of Isaac as I'm sure many people have mentioned, though I would say there is a bit more focus on aiming for progression rather than rogue-like elements such as each run being different from the very first level and so on. So don't go in expecting exactly the same experience here as it won't be. It's also a pretty challenging game!I was asked by the developer to take a look at the game for my first impressions series and if you'd like to see the game in motion as well as hear some more thoughts on it I'd encourage you to check out the video below.

												So would I recommend this game? Absolutly. Is this a game for everyone? Maybe, maybe not. Let me explain why.First the premise of the game. You are a lizard-buddy from a wizard (hence the title) whose master gets taken away by some evil guys. Now it is up to you, to rescue him. And to do so you cross various dungeons and defeat a lot of baddies along the way. You get various equipment and skills and it's up to you to combine them and make the best of it. Sounds like fun, doesn't it? Oh wait, but that isn't everything. We all have seen these type of games before. I mean Legend of Zelda or Binding of Isaac. But A Wizard's Lizard adds a little twist to it. In the dungeons you can save townspeople. Townspeople, you say? Yes, because you have access to a little townarea that serves as your main hub. Some townspeople just give hints (in the beginning that is) but the rescued ones actually give you a reward. They'll put in a small amount of cash in a treasure box in the town. With this cash you are able to buy weapons, upgrades, armor etc before entering a dungeon. A big plus since having for example a lance is beter then your starting sword.But it doesn't stop there. Mostly when you die, that's it. Game over, start over. But not in this game. You resurrect as a sort of 'angel' lizard which gives you a second chance to finish the game. Combine this with the ability of certain rooms to turn you back to normal and you have a pretty much bag full of content to keep you entertained for a long time.Are there any cons? Yeah, perhaps. The floors, although randomized, can get a bit repetitive. For example the 1st floor of the first dungeon has the exit on on side of the path and a little graveyard on the other side. What's inbetween them or where you spawn is random. But these two are a certain give. Good side about this is, you want to get to both sides for the cash and the exploration. Also sometimes the music can get a bit repetitive as well.One last 'bad' thing is the enemies. Although most of the enemies are relativily fair some are a bit of a screwover. For example you have owl-enemies. But hitting one means all of the owls in that room starting flying around like a bunch of wild dogs and sometimes chase you. If you're stuck in a corner running for them, it can very easily screw you over. So just to summarize the game with the pro's and con's:Pro's:+ Main hub-area is a nice new twist to the genre+ Rescueing townsfolks adds a bit more exploration-iniviative for the players+ Upgrade your character before going into the dungeons+ Controls are smooth+ 'Resurrect'-mode adds a lot more gameplay-timeCon's:- Floor's & certain rooms can get a bit repetitive- Same goes for the music- Some enemies can really cheapshot you			"

												Very addictive. Think of it like a cute, permadeath legend of zelda. You collect weapons and armour as you walk around fighting monsters, but each time you die, you go right back to the start.If you make it far enough you have the chance to buy blueprints for weapons and to rescue townsfolk, both of which will help you in future games. So the game to my thoughts doesn't become too repetitive because even though technically you are starting at the beginning each time, you do so just that little bit stronger, with a new magic boomerang or similar which could potentially help you get just that little bit further.If you're going to buy the game, make sure you play it through a couple of times before you judge it. The first time you die and have to start again sucks, and it isn't until you rescue your first townsperson (stage 3) that you realise just how exciting starting again can actually be. Most people who don't enjoy this game I suspect only play it for a little while. It gets better and better with each playthrough, if you give it a chance.Technically this is a very short game - could probably finish it in an hour once you get uber enough, however to get uber will take hours of gameplay. It's a really interesting balance, and a fun little game which is well worth the price. Lots of different weapons to discover and apparently a whole heap of playable characters you can get after you beat the endboss - not that I have yet, and I've played a fair few hours.			"

												Become a magic lizard. Vanquish death itself.A Wizard's Lizard combines roguelike elements with Zelda-esque design and Binding of Isaac's battle style and dungeon layout (plus a little bit of Spelunky shopkeeper murder), offering a wide array of customization via armor, weapon, and item slots. Gamepad support is excellent, gameplay is intuitive; enemies do tend to pile on you right out of the gate during later levels, but I think handling that is something that comes with experience and better item drops. And flinging armloads of BEEEEEES at your enemies is definitely more fun than it should be.			"

												Terrible PerformanceFor some reason, this game has terrible performance. In the late part of the game the performance is so bad it's literally impossible to play. Many people in the forums have stated similar issues. This game looks like an IOS port and should be able to run fine with a potato, but currently high end PCs are struggling with it. I personally don't have much hope that it will be fixed due to several reasons:-It hasn't been fixed yet.-The reason there is no widescreen support is because that would mean 50%isch more pixels on screen and it wrecked the performance (as stated by one of the developers). -The fact that they can't get such an untaxing game to run smoothly and that the had to resort to such drastic measures mentioned above just screams incompitence. I honestly don't think that they even CAN properly optimize this game.-And most of all, they thought it was acceptable to release the game in this state to begin with.The first 3isch floors are playable but the frames do drop below 30 if many enemies are on screen at once. But since it's literally unplayable (for some PC configurations) in the later half of the game, there is no way I can in any way recommend this game.			"

												Food (health pickups) are insanely rare (1-3 a level IF you're lucky) and only usually only restore 5 hp (base hp is 50) which is a joke because monsters hit for 10-20+. To make matters worse in order to get the key to unlock the shortcuts to next areas so you don't have to regrind the same area 1000 times you have to have your player go into ghost mode... by killing yourself... it's the only way to get the key and it's just too punishing a game mechanic. Once you die and enter ghost mode anything you kill can also leave behind a spirt that now tries to kill you. Basically you need to kill everything twice now which gets you overwhelmed very easy. The only way to leave this ghost mode is to find a magic circle that raises you from the dead at the troll amount of 12 hp and they are rare too 1 per level only and thats if it's there. Now you have to hope that somehow you can find enough food to get out of this 12 hp state but due to the food shortage in game you'd have to play three levels flawlessly to get back to 50hp. What is more likely to happen is you get 1 shotted and go back to ghost mode where everything is harder and when you die again... game over you have to start alllllllllll over again because you never managed to find the keyhole In the next stage somewhere for that key you got.Can't recommend it as it has poor game mechanics like forcing a player to die to save progress.

												This is an interesting little game.I picked up A Wizard's Lizard because I wanted to try out Binding of Isaac-style gameplay but couldn't stand Isaac's art style at all. Way, way too gross for me. And I think I've gotten my money's worth so far. Full disclosure: I haven't beaten it.Now, the myriad of reviews telling you that this game is simplistic and not nearly random enough to hold long-term appeal... they aren't wrong. The items don't have as much ridiculous variance as in Isaac, there's not nearly enough item interactivity, and almost none of them have Isaac's insane ""what's an upper bound?"" appeal. The level design is far less complex than Isaac's and much more predictable. The enemies are perfectly solid, but a lot of them behave very similarly and overall none of them feel standout.So there's the bad points. That being said, I'd still recommend you try out A Wizard's Lizard, and here's why.First off, it's ten dollars now. It started at fifteen, which was a touch high, and I don't blame people who paid that much feeling a little shortchanged. But ten is a perfectly tolerable price for the amount of gameplay you've got in this game.As for that gameplay... I may not have played Isaac, but I like it better purely on the face of it. The game is plenty hard--as said, I still haven't beaten it--but it never feels like it HATES you. It never wants to kick you while you're down, or feels that's necessary. You have more health, the room layouts are more forgiving... It's still not just going to roll over and die, but it's not hateful.And it IS fun, at least fun enough that I'm still coming back and trying again after ten hours of making it to the Crypt once. It's engaging enough and challenging enough that you feel tested, and I'm STILL unlocking things. If you've been playing Binding of Isaac all these years it may not be nearly as challenging for you, but I couldn't say. And despite the cutsier art style, the story--once you learn it--is actually pretty bloody dark!So, is this game worth buying? I think so. It's not at the TOP of my list, but if you're looking for Binding of Isaac gameplay without having to deal with updates that make the game less fun and a thematic style that's trying too hard, this might be exactly what you're looking for.

												If you are familiar with The Binding of Isaac then this game will be familiar to you because it is one of those room by room shoot stuff at enemies while avoiding their attacks games.  This game is decent, with a good variety of weapons and power-ups.  You can obtain blueprints and there is an over world like in Rogue Legacy, where you can purchase weapons and items you have found the blueprints for at the beginning of a new game.  The money comes from rescuing townsfolk, randomly placed within the dungeons, who each add 500 coins to your total to spend on blueprint items and equipment.I am torn on what to say about this game in regards to Recommend/Not recommended. The game is fine, it plays well, and some of the features and ideas it lifts from other perma-death games work well in this combination, but I was left feeling like it was too slow.  Not that it ran slow or sluggish, but that your character was too slow to begin with.  There are items you can find that will increase your attack speed and movement speed, but they are largely randomly placed in chests and stores in the dungeon unless you find the blueprint.So based on the amount of games in this genre, and the number of games I think do it better, specifically the Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon and Nuclear Throne, I think I am going to have to give this game a not recommended.  If however you already own those games, and want another like those, then perhaps this one will still be fun for you, but again compared to those others I think this one moves too slow to stand toe-to-toe with those great games so I’d spend my money on them instead.

												A roguelike dungeon-crawler with randomly generated room layouts, A Wizard's Lizard has you playing as Raga, a lizard whose wizard got kidnapped by Death for trying to cheat death with a potion of life. Having had some of the potion of life spill on him before the wizard got spirited away, Raga gains the ability to die twice before it's game over. Upon dying, you may find yourself having to kill the ghosts of the enemies you just killed, and in some areas, you can step into a magic circle to come back to life! Hanging between life and death, can Raga traverse the dungeon, defeat Death, and save the wizard?No two gameplay sessions are alike. You only get stronger by finding better equipment or learning not to get hit. Normal gameplay has dark dungeons with little visibility which can work against you, Dying once lights the entire dungeon up, but forces you to take on unique ghost versions of some enemies. If you play enough, rescue trapped villagers in the dungeons, and buy item blueprints in dungeon shops, you can start out with more gold and unlock more items to buy at the shop before you enter the dungeon, making it easier to start the game out. It's a very neat sense of progression and makes dying less disappointing when you can actually gain something from your attempts at a crypt run.With a charming art style, a cute lizard, a tough-as-nails dungeon labyrinth, the ability to cheat death, and a system where you can gain progress from dying each playthrough, A Wizard's Lizard is a challenging but enjoyable roguelike game.

												AWL is a twin-stick shooter/rogue-like that is really, really polished - you can tell that this was a labor of love for the developers. Like most games in the genre, it starts out difficult and becomes easier as you build up your 'town' by rescuing villagers and buying blue prints.

												First impressions of the game, its simple and fun. Can make you pretty salty at times, especially when your low on health or sitting good, and you walk into a room that corners you. It makes the runs better the more you save villagers and collect blueprints ( your restarts add cash and weps/armor ) If your feeling prideful just do ""no-buy"" runs but the option is there to buy. It's in a way similar to binding of issac, but if your hardcore into BoI don't expect the exact same thing, it is a different game, thus expect it like that. Overall its a nice / aggravating game, I'd recommend it.			"

												While the game has a cute asthetic and interesting gameplay aspects (like diagonal shooting and a ghost system that gives you an extra life in exchange for facing more enemies) it ultimately fails at what it is trying to do. A wizard's lizard is ostensibly a rogue-like with randomly generated floors and rooms, but unlike a game like the Binding of Isaac, the rooms are not prefab. In other words, any combination of enemies and traps can be in almost any room. This seems like a cool feature, until you realize that it often leads to unavoidable damage. I've even had spike traps spawn right on top of a door, making it literally impossible to enter the room without taking damage. This wouldn't be a big deal if health was reasonably easy to come by, but it isn't. Health is either randomly dropped by enemies (with a very low chance of doing so) or purchased in stores for a huge amount of money. Money that you need to buy weapons and upgrades that will stop you from taking damage. I'm sure you can see the problem here. Your success in the game is nearly completely predicated on your ability to not take damage, and often times damage is unavoidable. Your hitbox is unclear, so even in the rooms where it is possible to avoid damage you'll still take damage that is not your fault. There is a sort of Rogue Legacy-esque permenant progression in the game, allowing you to gain more starting money and purchase items before entering the game's dungeons. Which brings me to my greatest complaint. The items are almost all worthless in any situation where you would want an advantage. Say you have an enemy that annoys you, owls for instance. And you want to kill them faster. Surely an attack upgrade is what you need? Actually, all the items that i've seen upgrade stats by 1 which is utterly insignificant. Owls (the brown ones at least) have twenty health and your normal attacks deal 10 damage. the most damage upgrades I've been able to stack (filling every single item slot available to me with attack upgrading items) was 6. So no matter how much attack you stack up you will never be able to kill the owl with one attack from a normal weapon.You can get better weapons, but they all have silly drawbacks and often their gimicks will get you killed. While it is fun to find all these different items and see what they do, and this game actually does a better job than Isaac and similar rogue-likes explaining what effects items have, it ultimately falls flat because the only items that make any difference at all are weapons. Almost all your abilities put you too much in harms way and healing is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ the permanent progression turns the early levels into a grind, and the game's difficulty stems far too much from a lack of HP being available and rooms having nearly or completely unavoidable damage on them. I honestly can't recommend this game at all.			"

Progress is stifled, presumably to hide how short the game is.There is value here, but the frustrations outweighed the postives for me. Low number of items, even lower number of useful ones, dodgy hit detection (or at least unintuitive detection) and the slowdown when there are high numbers of enemies ruined it for me.			"

												of all the games that i have bought, this was the only game that made me regret for the value. IMO, its too expensive compared to bindings of isaac. Boi is still a better game compared to this,  though there are reviews saying that this is a game that requires skill and not somewhat item dependent, thats true. but that point being that this game is harder and sometimes makes no sense. Healing is a very rare occasion in this game, there are times where you can even not heal a single time for the whole game. Makes it so easy to die. Another point is that this is kind of a ""Grinding"" game where you can start of with better items by buying them before entering the dungeon and getting the blueprint in the dungeon to unlock the specific item, so its a process of repeating to get better items to beat the game, up till now, i've done like 20 runs and beat the game 0 times. Please try out the game before buying. What u see might not be what u get.			"

												I love roguelikes or more precisely the emerging genre of roguelike-likes.  After the near perfection of Spelunky I had a hard time finding a game that really satisfy my desire for the genre.  A couple games have stuck out and one of them is A Wizard's Lizard.  Clever title aside I have to say this is a really fun game with a couple really clever concepts.At its core A Wizard's Lizards is a top-down dungeon brawler.  Every time you play you're dropped in maze of randomly laid out rooms.  You're free to explore them all to max out your loot and find better equipment.  Or minimize harm to yourself a go straight to the boss room.  That is the beauty of any great roguelike, the push-your-luck choices you constantly have to make.The combat system is fairly simple but feels really good.  Find the right weapon and equipment to match your play-style then go to town on the enemies.  Unlimited use of your staff is great just be sure to watch your cool down time.  Your soul orbs give you a nice powerful boost but its number of uses is limited so be careful.The coolest part of this game and the element that makes it so unique is its light/dark mechanic.  Death is not the end in this game.  When lose all your hit points go from the dark world to one of light.  Many of the enemies you struck down will reemerge as ghosts and ghouls.  Quickly make your way to nearest wicca symbol to give yourself back to the darkest and protect yourself from death once more.  Being able to recover from a near death experience like this is quite exhilarating.To conclude, this a well thought out roguelike.  It has a very charming, colorful, art style with may funny looking characters.  The combat consist mostly of smart movement and equipment savaging.  All put together a neat little game that doesn't take terribly long to complete but is difficult enough to make you try a handful of times till you make it through.			"

												I really like this game, and you might also if you liked 'Binding of Isaac' or 'Rogue Legacy'. Its an action roguelite. The play style is overhead rooms like Legend of Zelda, although they don't fit entirely on the screen at once, sometimes being as large as about 2x3 screens to fit the entire room.You get two lives, one as a normal character and a second as a ghost, but then you start completely over. As a ghost you have to fight the regular enemies and also sometimes their spirits or floating heads. Its a great mechanic. It affects puzzles in the game and makes you dread either death.The items are fun. There are different pieces of armor, totems, spells and weapons. The weapons have decent variety. Anything from swords (all are thrown/ranged) to spears, bouncing axes to buzzing bees, dual split daggers to explosives. Spells and totems are equally varied.			"

												A Wizard's Lizard is a pleasant, vaguely Zelda-like procedurally generated action game. You play the familiar of a wizard who has been abducted by Death, and you must find your way through a series of dungeons to face down the monster and rescue him.Naturally, this isn't something you're going to be able to do on a single life. For most of your attempts at the game you're going to be gathering money, paying to upgrade the village store, rescuing villagers who will then assist you the next time you play, and learning how best to handle the various traps, monsters, and bosses you face. Expect to die, die, die, die, DIE, each time starting your next game with a few more options than last time.Additional note: If you wanted to play The Binding of Isaac but that game's blood-soaked graphics and child abuse theme turned you off, A Wizard's Lizard has similar mechanics (if not as much variety in power-ups) and, for me, scratches the same itch.

												If you've ever played the binding of isaac you will find a lot of the elements in this game to be pretty similar. The only difference being that the overall difficulty curve here is quite low due to a grinding mechanic (rescuing villagers for $$$) that allows you to buy additional gear before starting each run. Regardless, there is still a good deal of challenge to be found and plenty of replayability, not to mention the devs are (as of 04/2015) still pushing updates for this game which is always a nice thing to see.

												I've spent roughly 8 hours of this game and while I don't think it's bad per say there is a lot lacking when stacked up to existing Roguelikes and ones coming out on Steam in the near future through Early Access and Kickstarter. Not going to criticize the art or the music, those things are subjective and you can like them or dislike them as you see fit. There are also bigger and more frustrating issues with A Wizard's Lizard to address. For starters, the Gold for saving Villagers. While in theory it is rewarding to give the player an extra mission on top of ""Beat the Game"" but in execution all it does is makes the game grind-y. Progression in a Roguelike is nothing new, nor is giving players abilities but none of it seems to matter in A Wizard's Lizard and that combined with the Grinding makes the entire experience feel like a slough. The progression is also staggered, items are locked behind their ""location"" not just cash which means you'll have to spend hours dumping time into each location to unlock everything if you so desire. To make matters worse, weapons do miserable damage but we'll touch on that later. This is helped along by unlocking ""Short Cuts"" however in a Roguelike intentionally cutting your playing time so you can grind is not a good thing. And that's the biggest issue with A Wizard's Lizard. It's grindy. It's grindy to the extreme. Which makes the second issue all the more problematic.The Grind isn't fun. The gameplay is uninteresting. Unlike The Binding of Isaac which gives you a unique run each time you boot up the game both in level layout and item generation or even Magicite which varies both the level layout and the tools you can use while throwing interesting traps and obstacles at you, A Wizard's Lizard does not. The rooms are plain square or rectangle in shape, filled with enemies and the standard sliding spike traps along with stationary floor spikes that deal quite a bit of damage to you. There are secret levels but they are not extra levels however they're a single level long and instead of being ""extra"" to your run they instead overlaps with the stage you'd otherwise go to. This makes the additional threat of these levels is thus not adequately paid for as you are just as strong for doing them than not. The only reason to go to them is to unlock special or unique items to their location thus making them simply another spot to grind.The enemies also seem to suffer from a bit of Rogue Legacy's palate-swapped enemies. While I grant that creating enemies is both time consuming and cost prohibitive especially of Indie Companies, the variety gets stale after four or five runs. A Wizard's Lizard also suffers from a failing many Roguelikes have started to make and that is swamping players with enemies in an attempt to make the game more difficult. More enemies does not a hard game make, and cramming them in only causes the game to feel even more grindy and unfair to beginners who lack the skill to crowd control. On top of their numbers, enemies have a great deal of health and deal a good deal of health when they hit. As mentioned above with the player's damage, enemies take forever to take down even with the ""best of weapons"". I won't even bring up the Mimics and other ""Hiding"" enemies, who you know are there but have to bait out and risk damage or just adds to the time needed to progress through the game. All of these complaints are amplified for the bosses, requiring you to grind for the best of items to even hope to deal significant damage against them. This of course means you have to grind past them time and time again to get the gear needed to smooth the process out. The boss fights other than them being damage sponges that are boring just as the rest of the game. The bosses are your stock standard Zelda-esque fights that, if they were more balanced, would be just plain standard. Instead they're boring fights we've seen a dozen times in more interesting games and in more interesting formats with the health meter cranked to 11. And that's my over all take of A Wizard's Lizard. Is it terrible? No. Would I recommend it? Not really. There are better, cheaper, and more interesting Roguelikes on the market or coming to market. Look into those.			"

												This game is most commonly compared to the binding of isaac. They are both shooter roguelikes, but the similarities just about end there.You have a primay thrown weapon, a time-based reusable totem, and a third soul weapon.Careful planning and synergies between well timed usage of these can make the game a walk in the park. Each combination has a key way of making them function well rather than relying on game-breaking synergies from random generation that other roguelikes often do.Also, lizards are awesome.			"

												As a huge fan of rogue-like / rogue-light / twin stick shooters, i had high hopes for this game.  Unfortunately, going in with such high expectations left the game feeling a little light.  That being said, the game isn't Isaac, it shouldnt be compared to that experience, and once i got that out of my mind - I was left with a really fun and challenging game.  You'll die, you'll die a lot... but stick it out and ""get good"" and you'll have a great time.			"

												A Wizard's Lizard is a cute little roguelite very comparable to The Binding of Isaac. The two games share a handful of qualities, such as an insubstantial plot, permanent death, procedural generation of items and rooms, and meta-progression in the form of unlocking new items.Unlike TBOI, AWL doesn't permit you to pick up a jillion items. Most items fall into a slot, such as head or feet, and you can only have one item in a slot. As such, there are likely fewer overpowered combinations of items. Actually, in general, the power of items in AWL is a bit more balanced than in TBOI.Combat goes beyond just shooting - you can place totems, which stick around for a short while and usually provide some kind of AoE effect. You can also use a soul ability, which requires a resource that you don't regenerate and must find lying around the dungeons, unlike totems. These abilities are generally more powerful effects, like invincibility and time slowing.As for your competition, the enemies you face tend to be very numerous as opposed to individually powerful. They aren't terribly tanky and most of them aren't particularly fast(or their shots aren't fast for those that throw things). Generally speaking, the enemies are not very imaginative, but at least most of them are not carbon copies.AWL curbs the random factor when compared to other roguelites like TBOI and FTL. This, in my book, is a negative. In particular, it doesn't feel like there's much randomness in map generation. For instance, it appears there's always one and only one room full of owls on one of the Cemetery levels and there's always a place to revive in Cemetery 2. Many other room layouts seem to occur with the exact same frequency between runs.The diversity of items is okay. There don't appear to be many items that will drastically change the game - something like flight or brimstone in TBOI. On the plus side, you can go to your inventory screen for a rough description of what each item does, and you'll eventually memorize them since there are prefixes that always mean the same thing(Dark Iron Helm, Dark Iron Boots, Dark Iron Gauntlets are all +10 health).The game's music is not too bad, but it really just doesn't fit the game's environment. The art for the game is cute and simple for some sprites, but in some places it just feels lazy.AWL's optimization is quite subpar. There is no reason for graphics this simple to be lagging an i5-3570k/GTX 660. There are only a few toggles for graphic settings(fullscreen, particles, lighting, screen shake) and switching them did not alleviate the occasional lag.A few other miscellaneous thoughts:	- The hub area that you start in makes the game feel a lot like some Kongregate MMORPG.	- Levels feel bigger than they should be, given how little you usually find in them. In TBOI, I wouldn't hesitate to go back and forth between a blood donation machine and an arcade 15 rooms apart, because there's a chance it would be worth something and it doesn't take forever to traverse rooms. In AWL, a similar attempt to maximize profit would take eons, because the rooms are much bigger, they tend to have more obstacles, and it takes a lot longer to load into the next room, rendering the value of backtracking to explore that last path debatable at best.	- M and I open the map and inventory, respectively, but they won't close it. You have to press ESC. -1In the end, I can't really recommend this, especially not over other roguelites, like TBOI, FTL or Dungeons of Dredmor. It is something different, and I enjoyed discovering new things for a little bit, but it wore off when I discovered how little power the RNG has in AWL. 5/10			"

												I got this game via a humble bundle and I'm sad to say that it just isn't that good.  This game doesn't hold a flame to the experience that The Binding of Isaac Rebirth(TBoIR) offers.  I'm a few hours into AWL and I feel like I've accomplished little and am only destined to grind repetitively (and boringly) towards no real goal.  I've unlocked some items and blueprints, picked up various armor and weapons, even freed 4 or 5 villagers, but I've yet to unlock any new characters or come anywhere near completing a single run.  Opportunities to succeed seem far too scarce while the cards are stacked against you until you are able to obtain a much more powerful build or character.In TBoIR you can at least say that within an hour or two's practice you can unlock more content, have a more varying experience, and certainly accomplish something more.  The biggest difference between this game and the Binding of Isaac Rebirth is that you can play run after run in Isaac and you don't feel like you're needlessly grinding.  I've put over 200 hours into TBoIR and have yet to be bored during a run because there is enough variety and change with the levels, enemies, room layouts, characters, and vast array of items to make each run fun.  After only an hour or so in AWL, I already felt like I was pointlessly grinding in this game and making little progress.  At this point I have no interest in continuing this game.Positives- Interesting cartoony graphical design- good roguelike concept- varying level layouts- variety of weapons, armor, and ""builds""- Great to see a description of what items do in the pause menu (no checking the wiki like Isaac)Negatives- controls feel more clunky than those of TBoIR.  It just isn't as tight- Everything from killing enemies to finding items feels very monotonous and you're very aware of grinding- Too few health drops to recover damage- Prices for shop items are very high even when you take the time to loot every room in its entirety and deplete every zombie grave entirely- You never really feel powerful (not necessarily OP) like in TBoIR- If you accidentally hit the shopkeeper while in his store, he will immediately attack you until you are dead or you kill him.  (You do get to take every item in the store without paying for them, but with the clunky controls, I've accidentally attacked the shopkeep several times which has ruined my runs)- If you manage to kill the shopkeep, he will continue to attack you in every store you enter for the rest of your run.- For whatever reason, this game is very clunky about room transitions and my character turns around and enters the room I just left quite often "

												This game is, for all intents and purposes, a completely inferior Binding of Isaac. You've got the same basic rougelike setup, and the game seems promising at first, but eventually it becomes obvious how many crippling design flaws the game has. If you haven't played Isaac play that instead, and if you have I'll describe this game in terms of Isaac except with:-Needlessly large rooms, so that you can't see everything at once.-Uninteresting item progression. Instead of stacking buffs, you find new weapons and standard RPG equipment that you have to swap out. This could work, except because of how the macrogame works after a couple of games you'll start off with more or less everything you need for the playthrough and be locked into one specialization, and since the equipment doesn't have tiers 90% of what you find will be useless.-Weaker gameplay. Isaac gave you all sorts of chances to kite and poke your enemies, but you were usually still at some risk while you do it. In this game, most enemies have no way to retaliate to ranged kiting, and one of the gameplans (specializing into totems) lets you create a proxy that kills everything while you hide in the corner. Worst of all, this seems to be the best strategy, and it's pretty bad to go into a Rougelike thinking ""well if I'm lucky I'll find the beehive totem and spend the next 30 minutes hiding while my swarm of +8 bees clears the rooms for me"".-No sustain. This seems to be the core problem with the combat, since because the game refuses to give you any significant amount of healing items, if your gameplan has any chance of taking damage you're eventually going to die (hence sitting in the corner while your proxy totem kills everything). Food is rare (you might get one piece as a drop per game and it heals you for about one hit worth of hp and it takes a whole floor worth of gold to buy the same amount from the shop) and even the health potion you get after bossfights is pretty underwhelming. I can sort of see why someone thought this was a good idea; it shows off the game's afterlife gimmick (which I liked until I realized it was the reason there's no way to sustain yourself), but at the cost of any combat strategy other than ""take no damage ever"".-Fewer rewards. You don't get free items at all unless you find them randomly (which are still more common than the food, but an Item Room would be a lot more satisfying), and there's only a boss every 3 floors. That means you're essentially limited to what you find, what you buy from the store, and what you start the game with, and since you can start with a full matched set of equippment you'll probably just buy/find a weapon or two and have your optimal build with no effort.-Set Bonus in a Rougelike. Since you're filling equippment slots you're going to end up shoehorned into one playstyle because if you try to complete a set instead of just starting the game with it, odds are you'll never find all the different parts. Most agregious is the Trickster equippment, which increases the damage done by Trickster weapons; you can't start the game with any of this (unless it unlocks later) which means that if you pick up a Trickster item, you have to hope you somehow find enough of the others to make it worthwhile. I think there are 5 items and a weapon, and I see maybe two per playthrough. -Same Bosses every game. You only meet them every 3 floors, but it's always the same fights. The bosses aren't especially bad, although they all have cheesy moves that you're not going to be able to dodge if they decide to use them, and as I said this is a game where you aren't allowed to take damage.That more or less sums it up, and even though there are things I like about this game, the list above was more than enough to make me give up on it. For something that follows the same formula as Isaac, I question whether the developer has actually played Isaac because this game has so many issues that Isaac dealt with much better. A different genre of game could get away with this, but top-down shooters are really only about one thing: how well designed the gameplay is, and the gameplay here needs a lot of love. "

												A very poorly planned game. Upgrades seem to do nothing. Weapons barely make a difference aside from bees and spears.  running the same levels over and over repeatedly wears thin very quickly. Lack of any kind of progression outside of unlocking almost worthless blueprints in the shop makes it a boring grind. Also has FPS issues, especially when using the mouse to aim. A lot of wasted potential here.			"

												Lost Decade Games has giving the world a real gem of an instant classic with A Wizards Lizard. The art style seem to devide people, but the gameplay sure doesn't. The little Lizard Raga walks, shoots, turns, scoots and everything else right on cue. Its one of those rare games where if you die, its your own dang fault.Level layout is great too, viewed from a near top down (Isaac style). Theres so many dead ends that can lead to certain death or a ton of gold, or maybe even a weapon upgrade. The thrill of finding one of your favorite weapons in a random chest after a tough room is amazing. In my case finding a trident makes my run instantly better.I absolutely love the whole ""you die and get a second chance as an angel lizard while you can be resurrected and keep going""-bit. I also really like the fact that the ghosts of all your slain enemies can come back to haunt you the spirit world! Making you choose between disturbing the dead and possibly get more money, or letting them rest in peace and have fewer enemies when you die.. cause you will. A lot.If you enjoy games like Binding of Isaac, Spelunky, Rogue Legacy I'm betting you'll like this cute little Lizards adventures as well.			"

I haven't had so much fun with a game since the original paper Dungeons & Dragons... and... anybody remember Larn?  Wow!  This game is so clever and so much fun I give it ye olde 2 Thumbs up for replayability.  Note to other gamers who've been around the block a few times.  Winning & unlocking the achievements relies more on channeling your own inner weasel than still having the reflexes of a 15 year old.  Thank you, Lost Decade Games!  More!  :D			"

												I really want to recommend this game, but in it's current state I just can't. I love the look and the premise. There are some really great things about this game, but there are some major deal breakers as well. Unfortunately, there are some issues as well. If you have a lower end/older computer don't even bother. You will very quickly get to a level where there is so much on the screen that your frames will drop to almost nothing and make it impossible to play at even a reasonable level.My other issue is that there are many rooms that are just complet ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You walk in and are surrounded by about 20 enemies instantly and have literally no chance to avoid taking massive damage and possibly dying.At this point, I hope the devs can patch it and fix the game so it works and is reasonably difficult without going too far. Sadly, I really don't expect it to happen.			"

												I am a massive fan of Binding of Issac and have played a lot of rogue-likes since then which have all tried to emulate the same style of gameplay but either end up feeling too similar or too different to really scratch that itch. A Wizard's Lizard is a perfect mash-up of BOI and Rogue Legacy, while bringing some of it's own very creative ideas to the table. The Rogue Legacy trend of persistent improvement has often fallen into the trap of making your character too powerful or over-ruling the skill aspect. With A Wizard's Lizard it feels like the equipment that you unlock and the gold that you build up is all about building the character you'd like to play as, while being very balanced. If you want a lot of offense, you'll need to sacrifice attack rate and you won't have much money left over to increase your other stats. It also saves the frustration that can occur with random generation and not getting the items that you most enjoy playing with. Highly recommend AWL, it has gamepad, keyboard and Mouse & keyboard support - the latter has surprised me as my favourite, but having an aiming reticle has gotten me out of the BOI trap of only shooting in 4 directions. There's also a really interesting second life mechanic which is used in some creative ways - yet to figure it out!Love it, I know I'll sink a lot of time into it.			"

Edited July 3rd: As of update 2.0.12, all game-breaking bugs have been fixed. Recommendation changed. This is a fun, tough little action-roguelike. There are still a few small issues like slowdown when there are too many mobs on the screen, but nothing that makes the game impossible. It seems like the devs are still working on balancing bosses as I've noticed huge swings in their difficulty between this update and the last one. Progress is VERY incremental, as you slowly save villagers and buy blueprints to give yourself a better run. Some of the items look really similar, and the names are not displayed before you purchase them, so it can be frustrating thinking you were buying a Helmet of somethingorother when it turns out to be a Helmet of someotherthing.If you liked Binding of Isaac or classic LoZ, try this one.I am including my original review below. Most of the issues are no longer applicable, but they still existed in a $15 game:I'm surprised this isn't labelled Early Access (I wouldn't have purchased it if it were).In the 70 minutes I played, there were no less than 3 game breaking bugs I experienced multiple times each.1. On Win7, game must be run in XP compatibility mode or you get only a black screen on launching.2. Sometimes when hitting an exploding barrel the game crashes to desktop3. Sometimes (for no discernable reason) the game's visuals will freeze. You can hear the menu options and run into things, but the screen is frozen.These kind of bugs are totally unacceptable in a roguelite, or any game with permadeath. Hopefully the devs will be able to get it patched fairly soon, but it's pretty frustrating that this is for sale on Steam as is without a ""beta"" or ""early access"" tag, considering how buggy it is.All that said, the bits of the game I got to play are pretty fun. The controls are very similar to The Binding of Isaac, though movement is a bit less slippery and shooting a bit more precise (due to the controller support adding 4 more aiming directions, and the projectiles not taking on any of your own character's momentum.) It's a shame the bugs make it unplayable. Once it gets patched up I think it'll be a fun little action RL.			"

												Alright, after many more hours with this game I am amending my previous review.I previously said that the equipment you get makes such a small difference it's unnoticable.  I take that back.  The equipment that raises your attack speed and your overall speed definitely make a noticable difference.  The equipment I have a problem with is the spiked set.  Raising your damage by 1 really doesn't do anything to help you, and it's much more worthwhile to wear, say, the Ranger set to increase your mobility or the lead set to increase your HP.  Spiked set should add more offense.I also said that the never-changing layout was dull.  I fully retract that comment.  The more I play the game, the more I'm thankful that the layout (i.e., blueprints always on the same floor, pentagram always on the same floor, townsperson always on the same floor) stays the same, so I know what I should be looking for each floor.Now that I'm at the point where I'm nearing the crypt, my only real problem other than the spiked set is the slow down.  In the sewers, the slowdown (which I believe is caused by the poison traps in the walls) makes things very difficult, borderline unplayable.  After fighting the boss of the sewers five times in a row and each time having my run end unfortunately with a massive slowdown, it begins to get frustrating.Other than that, this game has grown on me quite a bit, I find it a blast, and I would recommend it to anyone.  Hopefully there are tweaks to come.			"

The random dungeon crawling element is great, but the combat system is too simplistic for my taste.  You simply shoot and dodge projectiles, that's it.

The achievements are actually a lot of fun to try and do because it's challenges you wouldn't do otherwise. For example, complete the game without buying anything in the shop, or visit both secret locations in one run and then complete the game.

												I am a massive fan of Binding of Issac and have played a lot of rogue-likes since then which have all tried to emulate the same style of gameplay but either end up feeling too similar or too different to really scratch that itch. A Wizard's Lizard is a perfect mash-up of BOI and Rogue Legacy, while bringing some of it's own very creative ideas to the table. The Rogue Legacy trend of persistent improvement has often fallen into the trap of making your character too powerful or over-ruling the skill aspect. With A Wizard's Lizard it feels like the equipment that you unlock and the gold that you build up is all about building the character you'd like to play as, while being very balanced. If you want a lot of offense, you'll need to sacrifice attack rate and you won't have much money left over to increase your other stats. It also saves the frustration that can occur with random generation and not getting the items that you most enjoy playing with. Highly recommend AWL, it has gamepad, keyboard and Mouse & keyboard support - the latter has surprised me as my favourite, but having an aiming reticle has gotten me out of the BOI trap of only shooting in 4 directions. There's also a really interesting second life mechanic which is used in some creative ways - yet to figure it out!Love it, I know I'll sink a lot of time into it.			"

												This game surprised me. It features some things from the Rogue-like genre with Permadeath and RNG elements of dungeon layout and power ups found. It also has a progression to it tho that slowly, over time, you will become stronger and stronger with being able to suit up each life before going into the dungeon. Similar to the way you slowly get stronger in Rogue Legacy if you've played that rogue-like-like. Controls are solid wether its gamepad or keyboard and mouse. As of this writing there is some frame loss and stutters which can happen at the worst times in packed rooms, but they have been acnowledged by the dev and hopefully will be adressed soon.Should provide a good dollar to hours of entertainment ratio.[Offical Chops Seal of Approval]			"

Edited July 3rd: As of update 2.0.12, all game-breaking bugs have been fixed. Recommendation changed. This is a fun, tough little action-roguelike. There are still a few small issues like slowdown when there are too many mobs on the screen, but nothing that makes the game impossible. It seems like the devs are still working on balancing bosses as I've noticed huge swings in their difficulty between this update and the last one. Progress is VERY incremental, as you slowly save villagers and buy blueprints to give yourself a better run. Some of the items look really similar, and the names are not displayed before you purchase them, so it can be frustrating thinking you were buying a Helmet of somethingorother when it turns out to be a Helmet of someotherthing.If you liked Binding of Isaac or classic LoZ, try this one.I am including my original review below. Most of the issues are no longer applicable, but they still existed in a $15 game:I'm surprised this isn't labelled Early Access (I wouldn't have purchased it if it were).In the 70 minutes I played, there were no less than 3 game breaking bugs I experienced multiple times each.1. On Win7, game must be run in XP compatibility mode or you get only a black screen on launching.2. Sometimes when hitting an exploding barrel the game crashes to desktop3. Sometimes (for no discernable reason) the game's visuals will freeze. You can hear the menu options and run into things, but the screen is frozen.These kind of bugs are totally unacceptable in a roguelite, or any game with permadeath. Hopefully the devs will be able to get it patched fairly soon, but it's pretty frustrating that this is for sale on Steam as is without a ""beta"" or ""early access"" tag, considering how buggy it is.All that said, the bits of the game I got to play are pretty fun. The controls are very similar to The Binding of Isaac, though movement is a bit less slippery and shooting a bit more precise (due to the controller support adding 4 more aiming directions, and the projectiles not taking on any of your own character's momentum.) It's a shame the bugs make it unplayable. Once it gets patched up I think it'll be a fun little action RL.			"

I got it with a 50% off coupon at least, and I would not recommend anyone get it until it goes down to the 5 dollar area.  The random dungeon crawling element is great, but the combat system is too simplistic for my taste.  You simply shoot and dodge projectiles, that's it.  The weapons all seem the same, shooting straight, some go farther, shorter, slower, faster etc.  It's basically Realm of the Mad God in a dungeon setting.			"

												Short story, it's a great perma-death, old-school-Zeldaish, rogue-like. Lots of items to find or create, different characters to unlock, randomly generated dungeons, and quite difficult. The achievements are actually a lot of fun to try and do because it's challenges you wouldn't do otherwise. For example, complete the game without buying anything in the shop, or visit both secret locations in one run and then complete the game. Makes for quite a challenge.Highly recommend if you like the old Zelda games or rogue-likes.			"

												An absolute joy to play!Sharing the basic mechanics that made Binding of Isaac a joy for many, A Wizard's Lizard takes that and makes it even better.I never injured BoI, but I thoroughly enjoy this game. Everything from the adorable art style, good music, and random enemies there is so much to do. While dungeons are randomly generated they don't ever feel boring at all. You always have to be on your toes for something to jump out of a barrel or a chest actually being a mimic.Gameplay First impression

			A Wizard's Lizard is a little top down Action RPG, similar in respects to Binding of Isaac. It's a fantastic game that any fan should check out.		

The fact that death has been changed in a colourful way, literally, makes it even more fun. Did you die? Oops, it's not the end. Time to fight as a little astral spirit, and in fact dying is part of the game. You can't actually progress without dying, so get use to it. This game is certainly worth the price, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to people that liked Binding of Isaac.			"

TL;DR rating:[2/5] ""An inferior Binding of Isaac clone""-Only buy if it is heavily discountedPretty much just that. This game immedieatly feels like it was trying too hard to be the binding of isaac. Now im not knocking the dev for wanting to emulate a good game, but ultimately this game doesnt add enough new stuff to the genre set it appart, and doesnt quite deliver on the basics to be satisfying.Graphics: Enemies super generic, sprites are too cartoony, almost feels like they were ordered from ""Generic-Sprites-R-Us""Sound: Equally generic and kinda... almost too upbeat. Makes it hard to take seriously.Controls: Decent, features mouse and controller support, but the controller analog sensitivity is too high, needs a activation threshhold.Gameplay: Boring... like really boring.This game feels like a student project to make a Binding of Isaac clone. It adds a FEW new things like a persistent town hub where you can buy stuff for your run. You can save townsfolk in the dungeons and each one adds persistent starting gold with which to buy items at the beginning of the run. Also you have equipment slots so you have to pick and choose what items you want, you cant just stack all the collectables you want. But other than that it is pretty much inferior in every other aspect to its source material.Im not trying to knock the dev either, I understand not every game will be a masterpiece, but it is hard to recommend spending money on something that isnt really that fun. This game got boring extremely fast and I'm a pretty patient guy. Even on the holiday sale price im a little bummed I bought it.If you REALLY just want to try it out, then get it when it goes on sale.			"

												This game is almost same looking as The Binding of Isaac, with cool features and new things to explore. You begin from peaceful town where you can do things like buy yourself better starting gear. Trough game you can save people which gives you more starting gold, and shops sell you different blueprints to items which you can buy in your town. So the more you play and unlock the more you are able to customize your each start of game. Find favorite items and combine them to try win the game. Graphics and gameplay are both great. Oh and you have 2 lifes. When you die once, you respawn as angel giving you second chance, but as beign angel, the game gets little more challenging, so you shouldn't die too early. Good luck Lizards!			"

												If you're a fan of Rogue-Likes, and got a lot of enjoyment out of THe Binding of Isaac, you'll have a ton of fun with this game! It's compelling, easily replayable, engaging, and has a great soundtrack and refreshing art style; it's not one of those lazy pixel art games.			"

												9/10 it's the Dark Souls of Rogue-lites -IGNAll sarcasm aside, I find this game to be so addicting. While I personally lack the discriminating tastes necessary to judge graphics, I can say several things about the gameplay.The dynamic of the life/death system seems to have quite a lot of potential, but instead it is relegated to somewhat pointless difficulty spikes and a requirement for advancing certain secrets. We could see updates that add more use to this mechanic, however.The item variety is far from that of it's next nearest cousin, The Binding of Isaac, and the item synergies are practically nonexistant. The fact that there are 9 kinds of items in which two of the same kind are mutually exclusive (as opposed to 1/2 in Isaac), the game feels restrictive with regards to how you will built your character, practically demanding that you min-max.  I've been rather harsh on this game, but that doesn't mean I dislike it. There are several factors that actually make this game fun for me. For instance, the controls are very solid. When playing with keyboard and mouse, I know that any mistakes I made were a result of poor reflexes in all but a few cases, in which you aren't exactly given an opportunity to react fast enough.The progression system also adds a sense of worth to even your worst runs, assuming you can get at least one blueprint and/or save one villager, which gets easier as you become better. This system makes the game even more addictive than it already is; my quote about this game being the Dark Souls of rogue-lites is actually quite accurate, since the game is punishing until learned, and still difficult once learned.A Wizard's Lizard is a solid title despite it's somewhat restrictive nature. If it weren't for the fact that The Binding of Isaac serves as a baseline for games like this, it would be even greater in my eyes. I can't recommend this to everyone, but if you're a rogue-lite fan who feels burnt out on The Binding of Isaac, or just wants a fresh look on the sub-genre, I'd say that you should consider picking this game up.I'm also going to add that the protagonist, Raga, is cute as a button.

												I feel like this game tries too hard to be The Binding of Isac, yet they fall so short. The gameplay is slower and, to me, it didn't ever feel like there was any direction in the game. I never felt the drive to go and find or do new things. The one redeeming quality is the artstyle, wich looks fan-friggen-tastic. 6/10			"

												This is a cute little gem of a game. I picked it up in a Humble bundle and I feel like I ripped the devs off.This is top-down dungeon-crawling roguelike action boiled down to its most essential ingredients. Permadeath, obviously, but your progression is marked in several ways so you don't feel your time and  effort each run was wasted. Slick controls and cool powerups (though I find the right analog stick just a little too touchy for my liking). Tough but fair gameplay, for the most part. Lots to discover and even a few puzzles to work out.If you enjoyed Binding of Isaac, give this a go.			"

												Obvious comparison to The Binding of Isaac, but doesn't quite deliver as hefty a punch as Isaac does in replay value. It's definitely fun, but this game is less about crazy item combinations with insane synergies and more about gathering armor and weapons. There is permanent progression similar Rogue Legacy, so eventually you get to the point in the game where loot gathering isn't really relevant. From there, all the game has to offer is the gameplay, which you will probably be bored with by the time you get to that point. It's worth the $10 for the 25-30 hours of gameplay you'll probably get out of it, but don't expect to play this game endlessly.			"

												A Wizard’s Lizard is a rogue-like that resembles Link to the Past in its design. In it you play as Raga, a wizard’s pet lizard. Your master tries to cheat death and Death comes to take him personally. It’s up to you to go and rescue him. The town of Amberfall is all but deserted when you start, but you can find villagers as you traverse the dungeons in search of your master. Each villager you find will increase your starting gold by five hundred. So, if you save ten people, you’ll start each run with 5000 gold to spend. You also find blueprints, which eventually make every item in the game accessible. With enough patience and enough townsfolk rescued, you can unlock almost every item in the game and have enough money to outfit yourself before you even step into the dungeon itself. Like most rogue-likes, A Wizard’s Lizard is randomly-generated in almost every aspect. Random dungeon layouts with random monsters with random loot and random rewards. All of which goes down the tubes when you die. There’s no reward for skill or progress beyond saving townsfolk and recovering blueprints so you have access to more items. There are shortcuts, which can be unlocked by destroying giant killer crystals, multiple times. But other than that, it’s just running the same random rooms over, and over, and over again. I’m just not impressed. There are nine levels in all, spanning a Graveyard, a Sewer, and a Crypt. There are others but darn if I couldn’t find them but once in a blue moon. I only ever got as far as the first area of the crypt. The random nature of the game along with the dwindling chance for health items as you go makes for a nearly impossible path from start to finish. The best you can hope to do is just open all the short cuts so that you start out further along than normal. This game suffers from a lot of strange issues. Let me count them out:-Occasionally the controls will lock up and have you running upward forever. -The aiming retical here is NOT on top of everything like it should be, you can lose it in a crowd. -There are a rather large number of enemies that can’t be harmed when they’re sitting still. -There are weapons in the game that can kill you if used improperly.-There are zero enemies in the game that can be killed in one hit, even with top weapons and armor.-The game keeps track of all the enemies you’ve killed and items found when this could’ve just been done on a menu screen to track progress. Instead it’s a weird museum-statue area. The unique mechanic that comes with this game is dying. When Raga dies he becomes a ghost and suddenly you must fight both the living and the dead enemies in every room. Handfuls of living enemies turn into spirits, skeletons, and flaming skulls. So, if you wander into a room and you’re already dead chances are you’ll have to kill most everything twice. This isn’t fun, it’s tedious. Thankfully there are rare resurrection circles. I had to google what they did since the game doesn’t tell you— but if you stand in one while in ghost form you’ll be brought back to life with some of your health. But, if you die as a ghost the game’s over. You lose all your items, money, and progress. Like nothing mattered. I can go ahead and say I couldn’t beat this game, it’s just not for me. I made it seven levels in and it wasn’t from lack of trying. I didn’t get a single one of the game’s difficult achievements. I didn’t save the wizard, and I never even made it to the final boss. The increasing difficulty and the decreasing of health-items makes the game harder than it should be. Combine this with bad weapon-balancing, mobile obstacles, and the random nature of the beast and you’ve got a recipe for frustration more than you do for fun. Avoid this one.			"

												A Wizard's Lizard is what would happen if oldschool Zelda and Rogue Legacy had a child--a child that somehow inherited all the good traits of both parents.  Its gameplay is simple to grasp yet difficult to master.  There's enough discovery to last most players a good long while, and enough items that true mastery won't be immediate.  Episodic areas combine with classic action RPG elements to create something similar to The Binding of Isaac but that stands well on its own.			"

My only slight gripe would be that for feeling so casual, a typical playthrough can last a decently long time, and I wish there were a way to save your spot to return to later.

After about 10h of play i still didnt finished a run even once cause the crypt has lots of unfair situations were you get flooded with mobs that got to much health and at the same time traps that get you over and over again. The game system is kinda frustrating: not many means to recover health enemies nearly never drop any recovery items you almost always get outscaled cause most items are useless. Items and health recovery in shops are really overpriced. You have to grind alot. (saving villagers, buying blueprints from shops).In my playtime i also experienced many bugs were you have to restart the game: dashing and get frozen, dashing and get hit by a spiketrap, dashing and spawn a totem = you can restart the game cause your frozen on the spot while dashing forward without any means to break your dash.All in all i would say (even though i bought it in sale for 5$) dont buy it really not worth the money cause there are way better games in this genre.

												A one-dimensional, oversimplified ""Binding of Isaac"" clone, enjoyable, but only for a couple hours at most.I had extremely high hopes for this game and was quite disappointed to hear that the developer has already moved on to an early access ""sequel"" to this game (using this game's assets) rather than properly finishing this game (notably the balance and pacing issues). PROS:-Fundamnetal concept is fun-Progression in town is a good mechanic (allows you to do a ""vanilla"" run OR to buy whatever gear you want in base once you've unlocked it; the choice is up to the player).-Clean controls-Good secretsNEUTRALS:-Room variety is somewhat lacking.CONS:-Very repetitive gameplay. Floor layouts are randomized, but what is on them is not.-Poor boss design. There is a boss at the end of each world, but it is always the same boss....the only thing that varies is the attack pattern. Rather than allowing the boss to have a mix of all the available attack patterns, instead you ""randomly"" get to fight only one of the boss' attack patterns. Design here really makes no sense.-Different characters (once unlocked) provide little to change the game. They merely start out with different gear/HP, but they don't interact with the game in any unique way.-Poor documentation. Most game mechanics are never explained (ghost form, pentagram rooms). Some text boxes inexplicably stop (for example, when talking to a shop keeper he will say ""Let me explain my items...."" then proceed to tell you what his items do, BUT he does not explain healing items. So if he is selling 3 healing items, he will just say ""let me explain my items"" and then end his sentence there. Very confusing for a new player.)-Dev released and immediately moved on to a ""sequel"" using the same game engine/assets/etc. rather than addressing any of the balance or pacing problems of this game.

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine A Wizard's Lizard is a rogue-lite game developed by Lost Decade Games. The story follows a wizard's lizard as his master is abducted by death and you as the lizard have to save your master from the evil clutches of deathThe gameplay is heavily inspired by The Binding of Issac, however, A Wizard's Lizard takes a more family friendly visual approach rather than The Binding Issac's dark atmosphere and theme. The game takes an interesting turn with the death system, so much so, that when you die the first time, you get sent to a sort of spirit realm and then if you die again, it's game overThe music is really good and joyful but it can get repetitive as some points and as a whole, A Wizard's Lizard can get repetitve at some points so much so it can get boring very quickly, The Binding of Issac does suffer with this repetition but manages somehow to make it unique however with A Wizard's Lizard, it doesn't manage thatAnother thing which bugged me was the screen resolution. The game's resolution is fixed to a boxed resolution which means that the game is in a sort of a 4:3 resolution whic kind of bugged meOverall, A Wizard's Lizard is a good rogue-lite game to play in a few short bursts with it's cute visuals and good music RECOMMENDED :)  "

												This game is not worth its price. At all.Now, to elaborate on this statement, let me compare it to other rogue-likes which are the same price or CHEAPER than this once:- Rogue Legacy- FTL- Risk of Rain- Hero Seige- UnEpicAnd those are just a few. Needless to say, this game is a horrible combination of difficult unlockables, uninticing end goal and absolutely horrific RNG based gameplay. Don't get me wrong; a lot of rogue-likes require luck to do well at, but this one takes it to the point that if you pick the wrong starting items, you can be ♥♥♥♥ed straight from the get-go just because one room decided to spawn owls instead of zombies and so your speed set did jack♥♥♥♥♥♥The later levels do not get any better, and it takes forever to feel like you have progressed. Some ga,mes, like Hero Seige or Risk of Rain , use a levelling mechanic to ensure that, even if you don't get the best gear, you aren't royally ♥♥♥♥ed. A Wizard's Lizard DOES NOT have anything to make me come back to it. It's too difficult for too little reward. I don't get the euphoria of beating a level; i get the relief i don't have to go through that BS again for another minute or so. It just reeks of barely adequate level design, and the items you can get feel all the same.3/10. There are FAR better games out there fopr less money than this one.			"

Since it's release, the developers have continued to refine and expand the game into a well polished, well balanced romp through a unique fantasy land.

												i can't recommend this game because of this facts. 1. sometimes you can't even see half of the playfield, so you don't see, who's attacking you from what direction. 2. you can't take health potions with you, which you might find. in fact there are too less of them. 3. you don't know how much damage the different weapons do. 4. there are no difficulty stages, on which you could choose from. so after all, this game is unnessarily hard. even harder than ""Binding of Isaac"". in the game trailer, it looks so easy. yeah, if you find the right weapons and the right equipment. but if you don't, you are screwed.I got 80.000 + gold at the end and I couldn't buy s...!this game sucks enormously.

												It's basically the less-quirky version of Binding of Isaac.  Which is really not a good thing, because part of what made Isaac so great was its personality.  Wizard's Lizard has none of that.  No flair, no artistry.  Just some very generic artwork.  The gameplay is reasonably okay, but quickly turns into grinding as you find that most of the fun weapons require a lot of gold.It's not what I would describe as difficult per se, but it's a game that punishes you in some frustrating ways.  Your really cool fun exploding spears also hurt yourself.  Many items have a direct trade-off.  There's gobs and gobs of traps in every room, many of which are just permanent fixtures.  And they're not the sort of thing that feel good to navigate - they're just a nuisance.  It all adds up to gameplay that just wears you down and makes it hard to feel good about putting time into.

												It's regrettably but I did not enjoy this game. The game is similar to Our Darker Purpose and Binding of Isaac, and has some interesting mechanics that make it not just-a-clone. The real downfall IMHO is repetitive playthroughs feel quite similar and deaths feel cheap. Allow me to clarify the positives and detriments that befall this game in case you already played the previous two games I mentioned and want more.Unlike BoI and ODP, most items have 'slots' and can be freely picked up and replaced, and most of the items have trade-offs. You have access to a variety of weapons, as well as a secondary weapon with a cooldown called a totem, and then a limited use generally-more-powerful spell; all of which can be modified to different degrees by your equipment. Also unlike BoI and ODP you can fire at any angle using either a mouse or analog stick. Another interesting mechanic is the land of the dead vs land of the living. When you die as a living body your spirit continues to fight until you die a second time, however the dead spirits of enemies also will be able to attack you, providing a harder experience but also more charges for your spells. All in all, this is great news and I love the design.So why do I not recommend this game? Without a lot of items that boost your HP there are some enemies and passive explosive barrels that will one shot you. Sounds simple though right? Avoid bombs and explosive barrels which are immobile and you're golden! However one slip up, especially upon entering a very busy room, and you die, even at full hp. My first half dozen play throughs I would have fun learning patterns of enemies and killing them, but my timer of entering the vicinity of 2 explosive objects would be up and I would be forced to restart from the beginning. Once you master the art of prioritizing identifying the instant-kill barrels, the last area in the game has wall-traps that will kill you in around 6 hits from full, have 0 to 8ish per room, and require you to juke them (unless you have a fair amount of speed items). Additionally with how the lighting works, if you're alive you will have trouble seeing them in some rooms unless you walk along the walls. Again, like the explosive objects once you learn what to look for it's not hard to avoid them... but requires a lot of attention and I found it a huge detriment to my enjoyment.And I hear what you're saying, if you don't want to be forced to start over from punishing traps then don't play a roguelike. To clarify, my issue is not having to restart from punishing enemies/environments, but all the enemies and environments are what I want to experience and then I get instant-gibbed by a barrel that I didn't spot. This means you have to pay a lot of attention in a game genre that I feel is most fun running through zoning out/multi-tasking.I did put 10 hours into this game, and it is a good game, but honestly it just made me want to play BoI or ODP. I would not recommend this game unless you're a fan of the genre and want to try some variety.			"

												Don't get lured in by the fact that it looks like The Binding of Issac because it is deffinately not. While I must admit that it was kind of fun, it was also far too hard for any begginer to get used to. The Binding of Issac has a mostly balanced damage and map system, this game causes rooms to be over crowded with not only enemies, but with traps too. In my somewhat short amount of time that I played this game, I was convinced that i woulld get better. I never did. So, to all those out there who like The Binding of Issac and think this game is worth trying, be warned that you might never get past the second boss.			"

												This is a game advertised as an action RPG, but, to be honest, I don't see the action aspect of it. Art and music are rather nice, and I'm sure that there's plenty of opportunity for strategy and whatnot, but going through the first level was very slow and repetitive. Each room just had a different layout of enemies and traps, but you end up doing basically the same thing in each one, run in, avoid projectiles, and kill enemies.I don't know, maybe I'm missing the intended playstyle or the game gets really good later on, but it didn't keep me interested nearly long enough to find out. If you're looking for a really barebones rouguelike-ish RPG, then maybe you'll enjoy it. I didn't.			"

												Decent game.  Would be a lot better if it had around 100 more Steam Achievements and much better mouse control instead of the laggy mess it is right now with current mouse situation.I'd say it is worth the $10 if you are looking for something similar to a cross between Isaac & Rogue Legacy.I think that a $5 sale price tag is appropriate for a newcomer to the genre or someone not necessarily into this type of game.

												I found this game boring and repetitive. You go through various sections that all look alike and hit things with a sword. You might get some gold, you might not. When you die you become a ghost version of yourself and keep playing until you die again, at which point it's game over. Maybe I'm missing something but this isn't fun. Really, really wish I hadn't paid £10.99 for it, what a waste of money!			"

												This game always compares itself to an amazing roguelite such as the binding of issac, but no. Randomized elements are dull, dull, dull.The artstyle is cool, sure, do graphics make a good game? No, they don't..Fifteen bucks for this game, and I've only gotten 0.5 hours out of it and Im bored of it already.If you see a ROGUELIKE, for that matter. Yeah, what happened to the hundreds of hours of replayability that a roguelike has? I see nobody with that many hours here. They buy it, and then forget it in their library.Do not purchase this game, the items are repetitive and the level design doesn't seem procedural at all.Also, I hate roguelikes in which you can buy items for your next run, this is why Heavy Bullets isn't as popular as tower of guns for that matter..If you're looking for good roguelikes, I suggest skipping this game.

												This is not a good rogue-like. Or a good rogue-like-like.A rogue-like, in my mind, is defined by high - but not unfair - difficulty. As you progress through a rogue-like, you should become skilled in avoiding enemies, avoiding damage. A rogue-like should force you to become skilled, and you should enjoy yourself by conquering challenges as your skill increases.A Wizard's Lizard has gotten that wrong.You never need to become more skilled. You don't need to learn anything, in fact. I beat the game on my second attempt. Took less than two hours. Well, maybe the additional characters you unlock change things up?No.Unlockable characters are IDENTICAL to the base class; all that changes is starting equipment, which you'll trash within minutes of playing anyway.Well, what else could keep you playing? Increased difficulty? Doesn't exist. Speedruns? Yawn. Achievements? Nothing challenging. Seriously. The achievements for WizLiz are nearly all achievable without significant changes in play or thought.It's just...not a fun game.Don't buy it.			"

												Another failure in the line of games seeking to emulate Binding of Isaac's Success.Maybe it changes later, but out the gate of the game, there are hardly any items worth equipping.  I've encountered 3 item types:  +totem damage, +""bomb"" damage, +damage.  And then a Health upgrade that slows you down.  Oh, also, light...  Light's totally useful, I promise, it's not a waste in any way shape or form.  That is, unless you have any ability to see constrasts in color.The ""Totem"" is a joke of an ability.  Having a full set of equipment that augments the Totem's function doesn't make it useful.  I suspect taking away the cooldown on it and it still wouldn't be useful.  Bombs are similar to Our Darker Purpose, except they seem a bit more plentiful, and they don't have a persistent effect.The only other things you really find are Weapons, of which I have only found 2 that I'd consider, the second being a ""secret"" item.Beyond that, there is a multishot ring which is arguably staple or useless, as multishot projectiles cannot hit the same target.Gameplay wise, you'll run the first 3 floors over and over amassing +500 starting gold per run (if you save a villager) and then buy blueprints so that, eventually, you'll have enough money to start the game in a way that isn't completely inept.  This mechanic has been likened to Rogue Legacy, except that your gains in progression, per death, are extremely limited and at nearly 2 hours in I have not had any change in gameplay, what so ever.Also, while the game does bring something new to the table in letting you haev 360 degree shooting (you'll need to use Mouse or a gamepad to achieve this), it loses out on The Binding of Isaac's focus on cardinal directions and will inundate you with enemies in a way that makes it nearly impossible to dodge.Also, a stock enemy is basically Gurdy Jr. with lower health.Basically, if you like The Binding of Isaac not just for a game but for the polish, the sense of progression, and the strategy... this isn't the game for you.  It has none of these, and you should save your money for Rebirth.			"

												An excellent game - well worth your hard-earned dollar. Not for noobs - this game is challenging, as you wade through Death's domains dressed only as a lizard in order to rescue your master. Fans of Binding of Isaac and Zelda will love the artwork, weapons, buffs, puzzles, bosses and procedurally generated rooms. It won't be long before you die, at which point the game steps it up from 'hard' to 'nightmare', as your disembodied spirit now has to battle all the creatures on the other side.This game is hand-coded in html5 and is fully gamepad-compatible for your delectation.

												So far, I love that game! It's enough easy for me to painlessly start and enjoy the first level but after that the game ramps up slowly becoming more challenging and more fun! I'm not a huge fan of permadeath, I never liked Binding etc. with complex mechanics and steep learning curve but this one plays great and it knows how to motivate me to try again and again. Every time I master more skills, finish more levels, collect new objects and help more people! Still, I wish to have a ""Story mode"" where user can unlock levels and after death start on the last unlocked level. Yep, I know, it's a different game then but I would play it hard ;) BTW I found that game after listening to LostCast - best game design podcast ever! Thank you guys for your work!			"

												[4/5 *'s]  This game is fun, very similar game play, yet different than ""The Binding of Isaac"".   One of the things I enjoy about ""A Wizard's Lizard"" over ""The Binding of Isaac"" is the double stick diagnal control of shot direction.  While the rooms are random, however, the bosses are not, however the boss rooms are each different, and I *think* the bosses tend to behave a bit differently each game.  The one glaring problem with the game right now at least on linux seems to be a frame rate drop over time, but this only seems to occur when it is run through steam.  The problem can be worked around by running the game on it's own.  Perhaps Valve or Lost Decade Games will work this problem out in the future.			"

												For those who want a simple game with a high difficulty rating, look no further.  There are few crazy mechanics to learn (such as with Binding of Isaac), and a complete run-through typically takes me about 50 minutes.  Don't let that time estimate fool you, though - you will die.  A lot.Is it perfect?  Not at all.  Some achievements are impossible to figure out without the use of the wiki, the monster variation isn't terribly high, and there are things you will desperately wish you had known before you did something like accidentally shoot one of the merchants (who then turns into a super-fast, boss-like creature).  In my experience, though, every game has its downsides, and these really aren't too bad.What it  comes down to is that this is a Zelda-like game that is easy to learn, fun to play, has lots of replayability, and isn't quite so soul-crushingly difficult as most of the rogue-likes on the market today.  That being said, if you WANT soul-crushing difficulty, try the Challenge Modes!			"
