												The Good:Star Trek Online is a free to play game where you can compete at the highest levels with no cash investment. Purchasing items from the store help's support the game, however this is one of a few MMO's where those with money are not left totally behind.A lengthy story line is included that you can complete solo by filling the rest of your team positions with your bridge officers. Alternatively you can team up with friends and enjoy the experience together. The game contains a rich mix of ground and space missions in both the story line and the Special Task Force (STF) missions. There are also Zones such as Defari, Romulas, Voth and Nukara Prime where you can land planet side and complete a variety of missions. The developers are constantly adding new content, regions and special events. Anything can happen from free ships, a vacation to Risa or a visit from christmas Q.Once you have reached max level there is the repuutation system to earn further bonuses and equipment. Plus Elite STF missions to test you.The Bad:Star Trek Online experience lag when servers are heavily. The interface and options are overwhelming so is the depth of charecter customisation and training. Bugs do exist and most have work arounds, this is not uncommon in a sofware upgraded over so many years.Summary:STO overall for a free to play is robust and has held my interest as a long term game. Main factors in this are the customization you can make to ship and crew and the changing content. We recommend you give the game a try.			"

												I wish there was a middle-of-the-road option where I could recommend this game under certain circumstances. But since there isn't one, I feel like the most honest thing I can do is not to.I have a few hundred hours invested in this game, which I started to play in 2014. Since then I've gotten my main character to 60, and created a few alts that are on their way there as well. I've pretty much exhausted all there is to do in my main, and finally feel like I can do this justice with a review.So is this a bad game? I am inclined to say no. However, there are many negative things that will hold the experience back for you. The thing is that, mostly, they are not enough to stop you from playing once you've tried it and if you've liked it for what it is. But after a while, dissapointment might start to catch up with you nonetheless.STO is a bittersweet experience. I feel that most of the time, for every three good things this game has, there is also one bad thing to go along.Pros:-The episodes are really good. This game has an interesting story that kept me going from beginning to end to see what happens.-Space combat is not the most deep out there, but its satisfying and fun. Yes it's brainless and a spacebar smasher, but enjoyable.-It feels like a true Star Trek experience, despite some questionable things lore-wise.-Missions are repetitive, yeah, but more often than not many of them can be quite creative and entertaining.-There is a lot of room for roleplaying if you're into that sort of thing.-A good amount of content that will keep you busy for a few hundred hours.-The foundry allows for some welcome creativity and what I consider the most meaningful player run aspect of the game. It helps keep things fresh and going when you are out of episodes from the game's main storyline.-Getting in-game currency is not as painful as in other games, and the Exchange (a.k.a auction house) is great for fattening up your wallet.-There is a sizeable amount of voice acting (many of it from actors of the actual Trek shows) to help immersion.-You can customize your character appearance anytime you want, and as many times as you'd like.-The fleet (a.k.a guilds) system is good and has a lot of things going for it, from your own fleet starbase to many other cool things you can add and customize in it.-There is a decent amount of fan service and the tie ins between the tv shows and the game can be clever from time to time.-There are nice events that let you have neat things, as well as giveaways for the same purpose.-The game is regularly updated with content.Cons:-The game is designed to extract money from you. What I hate is that half of how it's done seems appropiate to me. The game seduces you to buy uniforms and packs from your favorite shows. If the milking would have stopped there, It would have been fine. But nope, the game asks you to pay up for the best ships of the game, or grind dilithium for around 2 months just to get one of the tier 6 ships (currently the best ones). And then theres the whole ""pay here for xp boosts, pay here to unlock more inventory slots, more character slots, and this and that, and etc."" which isn't as annoying as how it was on SWTOR, but still pretty out there.-Ground combat is terrible. At first, I accepted it for what it was, but after hundreds of hours invested here I have come to grips with reality and had to admit the truth: it is just horrible. Shallow, thin, counterintuitive, buggy, and just an overall mess. The AI of your companions gets the job done, but it is barebones basic. And enemy AI is just laughable. Patrols can be so bugged up, their walk will jitter and flicker around like a bad LSD trip.-The game feels like a singleplayer game that was slapped the MMO label because of some online components. There isn't really any need to group for questing and exploring, and end-game content is sort of shallow to even bother and fully experience it, so that pretty much erases any meaningful purpose to grouping.-Fleet actions (a.k.a. dungeons) are ok when they are space based but horrible when ground based. And even in space they can be boring, tedious and repetitive: fight waves of guys, protect some AI ships, and a small twist here and there depending on the particular one you're doing. There are different difficulties in which you can complete these, but considering you pretty much blow through everything with standard solo gear, the need to come together to get the best pieces seems like an aftertought. Don't expect endgame organized raiding here.-The community is just dreadful. The chat on Earth Space Dock really brings out the worst in humanity. I've actually created a special tab in the chat window that filters it out for whenever I visit. Players are not helpful, and every channel feels full of slander and insufferable banter. In groups, it's the norm to roll need on everything, even if you dont really need the gear at all.-This game is not noob friendly. The UI design is not entirely convoluted, but it can take a while to figure out. The map is a mess that will make your head spin the first time around. It is a labyrinthine disaster that will not be kind to a new player at all. Hell, I'm 60 and I still get confused looking at it.-The exploration factor is virtually unexistant, except for some random missions you can pickup when flying near some planets.-There is a lot of grinding, particularly with reputation, dilithium, stuff for the fleet, credits and many other currencies.-Bugs. Bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs. Little bugs, medium bugs, large bugs, game breaking bugs. Bugs everywhere. Sometimes they get patched. Sometimes they don't. Developers are not as terrible as people often say, but they sure slack when it comes to patching for fixing errors. Not to add content, though; they can profit from that.And despite having much more negative things to say about the game than positive and overall not recommending it, I feel obligated to answer the following question: is there any circumstance in which you would recommend the game? Surprisingly, yes.If you are a hardcore fan of Star Trek and videogames, and you are willing to depart from some money then this is for you. Or perhaps if you are one of those fellows that do not mind to grind for months. If you like roleplaying, this game can be hours of fun as well if you find the right fleet.If you're looking for a deep MMO with complex mechanics, don't bother downloading this. If you're not willing to open up the ol' wallet or grind your way through all the stuff you need, then keep browsing for something else as well.What keeps this game alive and running with faithful players that follow it, is that despite all the bad, it is fun. A lot of fun actually. Many of us stick around waiting for a miracle that might never come: for Cryptic to revamp the areas that need it, and to patch the game so it can be rid of the problems it has. Perhaps a bigger developing team, and a more humane cash shop.			"

												Damnit Jim, I'm a doctor, not a reviewer.EDIT: Time for a more serious review I think. I would change from thumbs UP to thumbs DOWN but this review is for some reason already highly visible.Delta Rising is a rapidly growing disaster due to several really idiotic decisions. The core content itself is sound. New episodes are fun and creative, with a compelling story and interesting T6 ships and mechanics.However there are a lot of persistent bugs, some over a year old, and swathes of existing content and queues in dire need of overhaul. Instead, Cryptic seem to focus on bringing out new, very poorly QA-tested, content and systems with associated P2W aspects and let the problems pile up.Throw in some very poorly timed nerfs, complete disregard for the sorry state of XP earning, and a total lack of dev communication, and you have a team so far removed from reality that they have the gall to call this the ""best expansion yet"". One can take a quick glance at the steam player numbers and see how it actually went down. Why not look at the dismal PvE queue numbers while you are there?tl;dr, still a great Trek experience, but some fools in Cryptic HQ seem to be going out of their way to make this game as unenjoyable as possible.""DO YOU RECOMMEND THIS GAME?"" - NO			"

												Where to begin?This game was my home for 5 years. I loved it and even when cryptic tried to run it into the ground, they always seemed to fix it at the last moment and restore my faith.not anymore. PWE has shown they are a greedy little asian company that only cares about fisting this game up the pooper and destroying the vision of star trek for cheap cash grabs and pay to get ahead. ruining players favorite ships everywhere in favor of pay to win ships...and turning a casual fun game into yet another mindless grind.As a long time TrekkieI am crushed, heartbroken and devestated to see this game being treated like♥♥♥♥♥♥by ♥♥♥♥ head companies.I will hold faith that one day someone will restore this game to glory.

												RIP STO. The game has turned into a grinding nightmare for players like me, who used to enjoy leveling up characters, buying individual ships i had ""ground it out"" for. Each new character seemed to get better and better as i learned how to make those insane DPS builds. However, they have trashed the value of all the ingame currency and even though i am a life time subscriber, i would not recommend it to anyone wanting to go all that deep with it. If you want to solo play and just enjoy the story line, why not, its perfectly good for that. But, for people like myself, the game killed itself with monolithic greed.			"

												By all means play this game so long as you don't spend money on it.For those that don't know, Star Trek Online (STO) is an MMORPG loosely based in the Star Trek universe. Canon is not followed that heavily however there are facilities to create your own story, involving roleplay communities and the foundry which is a tool to design your own missions. If you are a Trek fan I would personally leave your Trek canon feelings at the door as you might find they get challenged at regular intervals.That said it is a personal thing, and so work through the story because that is one thing that STO has done reasonably well for. The art in STO has always been very good and so that combined with the story missions has always made good time spent.Now pre-Delta Rising this game was pretty unique in that people who were casual, hardcore, in-between or even super-casual could play the game and be able to enjoy it. You could be competitve on less than an hour a day, and while some things required more commitment, it was something that would get you competitive with others without too much grief.However those positives mentioned I would be negligent to not go over in detail the severe issues in the game, and therefore why I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone who wants an enjoyable, sensibly progressive experience or doesn't want a second job.I am now talking post-Delta Rising for the most part, which is where most of the issues that now permeate the game originate from. I'll be talking about the bugs, which has been an ongoing issue anyway, the difficulty settings, the ongoing issue of the degraded state of testing and bad customer relations.STO is riddled with so many bugs it makes an ant colony look small. Two of the top developers have openly admitted to not listening to player feedback any more, which is very apparent. The beta test server is now mockingly called the 'exclusive preview server' as what you see is what you get, broken mechanics, bugs and game-breaking exploits with it.Part of the reason for this is that their QA team for STO is a measely 5 people strong (http://sto-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?p=20853101#post20853101). This has shown through the years as bugs have built up due to there never being enough bugs fixed before a lot more come in to replace them like a hydra's head. Some proof of the developers lack of regard for the player opinion:1) http://sto-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?p=13321451#post13321451This link is to the Star Trek Online forums. It has a message from Tacofangs that tells us that by the time they are putting out content it is basically set in stone apart from the odd tweaks here and there, and usually they are just tweaks.2) 


YouTube™ Video: STOked Radio Ep. 91 w/ Al ""CaptainGeko"" Rivera 

			Views: 2,993		

			In this episode of STOked Radio we welcome back Lead Designer Al ""Captain Geko"" Rivera and get a surprise visit from Co-Host Nikki.		

An interview which enraged players when Geko says that there is no actionable feedback on the Duty Officer UI. Suffice to say there was plenty of it and they did back track in a small manner after the uproar the interview caused and did give an option to minimise the UI.3) http://sto-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?t=1224081&page=79Because a practical case in point is always good, this is the link to the Tribble Feedback post for the Upgrade System. This is by far and away the most recent poignant example of the effort Tribble Testers such as myself put in to be simply ignored. I challenge anyone to go through that thread and find a dev response that addresses the core concerns of that well tested feedback.As far as Cryptic are concerned, money comes first and retaining players second. Feedback is ignored unless something crops up that damages their profits, which is why the game is so badly riddled with bugs.A very recent example is the recent release (Delta Rising) had such a huge content gap that many of us had to run patrol missions to fill the levelling gap, Cryptic even recommend this as the way to do it. However a bug that was flagged up during testing was the patrols weren't all scaling. Of course because this wasn't fixed it made it the easiest patrol and so people used it to get past the absurd gaps.So what do Cryptic do? They roll back a decent sized number of the players, cut experience gains by 70% and call everyone who took part exploiters. As you can imagine, although some would obviously exploit, the vast majority weren't and Delta Rising is becoming a PR nightmare.The reason this turned into a PR nightmare is two fold, firstly and as I have said, they ignored tribble testers. Yet the big issue that started up was that many folks who got hit by the roll-back were innocent of any wrongdoing. Anyone who has had any serious experience with Cryptic's customer services knows their ability to read data is severely lacking. I have personally been quoted inaccurate purchase history, incorrect data on missing items and even had the representative show a critical lack of company knowledge about current events, even about new development blogs that I was asked to send a screenshot of to prove existed.Next thing I want to talk about is the state of the game in terms of how one participates in the end game content and how easy that is to do. As it stands now Ground Combat allows for a lot more build flexibility than Space Combat does. The closer you get to end game Elite level (the top grade) the more you have to build a ship that is focused on damage dealing and little else.So to clarify, Space Combat at end game has become a DPS Race (DPS = Damage Per Second), where having DPS more in the 20-30k range or higher is essentially required to complete the missions, simply because the devs decided ramping up the hitpoints, shields and resistances on enemies exponentially was the way to improve difficulty which has only led to a system where creativity is punished in favour of linear builds.On the other hand we have Ground Combat that is still accessible to build variety so long as the build is sensible and is well fought out, and in fact each profession can run at least 4-5 different base builds and all of them can be effective. However that being said Cryptics idea of making this harder was to increases the numbers of tough enemies in missions and make them hit harder, something that doesn't make the experience reinvigorating or challenging on ground maps.One thing that links both though are the awkward optionals. Advanced queues have timers or objectives that instantly fail the mission if they fail, which is bad from a player progression standpoint as a fresh 50 is going to struggle to get gear they need, as the gear materials come from those missions which has led to a sort of necessity of either having a very competant team or the chance to be carried through, both options of which are poor game design. However the sad part is anyone who has the gear already has a leg up and can finish the missions with relative ease still, however at this point in time Elite Borg queues are missing so using the old favourites as a comparison is not easy, however I will post videos of before and after in case anyone wants to look them over.A comparison:Old Elite Khitomer Ground:

 This has 17 Elite Tactical Drones in, slightly weaker but still time eaters for less geared or experienced teams.I will post Elite Comparisons when they become available.Want to play? Go right ahead, but when you start hitting the pay walls, don't ignore the fact you'll be paying literally hundreds of whatever currency you use to get competitive, it's not like before when newer folks had every chance to be as good as the older players.So would I recommend this to anyone? Of course not, play for free but don't be surprised when Cryptic ruins it, again.			"

												I've been playing this game on and off since it's launch and it has gotten better from those days. My perspective is from one who only plays PvE(Player vs Environment) content. I'd recommend you try this game if;1) you are not bored with the tradional WoW type MMO (hotbar combat)2) you are Star Trek fan3) you like to play doll with your character(s) (the character customization in this game is awesome)4) you can live with bugs popping up (The new VP promises that bugs will be fix fast but only time will tell)5) you can resist(or don't mind gambling) since there are lock boxes in the game which gives out a top prize of ships(basically classes in the game), etc BUT you can get all these things in game if you have enough in game assets to dabble in the exchange(auction house)6) you don't mind the usual MMO grindfests which can get repetitive to farm better gear, etc7) you are not a hardcore gamer8) your internet connection to the servers is not crapThe gameplay itself is nothing to write home about and the main reason I'm still playing it is because it's the only Trek MMO out there. The game panders mostly to the casual crowd.Contrary to some, the game in my opinion is not Pay to Win. You can have access to all the ships and gear if you grind enough currency to exchange for these items which other players put up in the auction house. Using real money is just a shortcut in the game.Also this game features player created missions, some of which, are much better than the official ones. Don't forget to give some a try if you decide to try this game out.In my opinion, Free to Play means demo and Star Trek Online's demo is surprisingly good in the sense that it's not restrictive like in some other MMOs. If your ISP does not suck and you can wait to download a 10GB or so game, give it a try and see if it's up your alley. Live long and prosper. \V/.			"

												The story line is VERY good, very trek and as you can see I've spent SOME hours in the game.It used to be very fun but lately the devs arrogance is increasing and theay are NOT listening to the playerbase.A great amount of players are unsatisfied at the moment and instead of communicating with the community all they do is deleting threads they don't like on the forumsNew content coming in frequently so you don't get bored, problem is alongside new bugs come in and in between there is not enough time/crew to fix them so the list just gets longer and longer.update 5.3.15:they are releasing new not canon high end tier ships now which are improved versions of thecanonships already ingame for more $$ - €€.

												Almost a year and a half and roughly 800hrs+ (1,600hrs total) after originally reviewing this game, I believe it's time to wipe the board and update from scratch. Having played this game for so long I think I have a pretty solid understanding of the overall state of the game. Originally I was very enthusiastic about the game and may have come off as a bit one sided. Now, I'm going to try to be as unbiased as I can. I thoroughly enjoy playing this game, don't get me wrong. However, my opinion may be heavily based off of the fact that I am quite a big trekkie. If you aren't that versed in the Star Trek series or movies then you may struggle through the storyline and/or a lot of what this game is offering in terms of general aspects of the game. You could most likely still get a good experience out of this game even if you aren't really a Star Trek fan. But you've been warned. The game starts you off with you being able to play as one out of three factions. (You can have a default of three characters which can pick between the three playable factions. You also have the option to buy more character slots if you desire) Each faction, the Federation, the Klingon Empire, and the Romulan Republic has a seperate storyline TO A POINT. After about half way through the main storyline you will be forced to play the same missions as the other two factions that you didn't pick. This may hurt replayability and/or having characters on each individual faction. The missions can become very repetetive as they follow pretty much the same idea every time. Kill something in space, go down to a planet and kill things there, come up into space again and kill something, done. However, that is just a very very very crude synopsis of each mission. There are definitely variations in this pattern and, if you follow the story and read the dialog, can be a very interesting and enjoyable experience. The storylines are quite long, however they of course stop at a certain point. After you've finished the main missions you can entire fleets. You may join fleets whilst still in the main missions, however they don't really mean much until you reach level 50+ or finish the storylines. Fleets consist of a group of players that donate and interact with eachother to help evolve fleet areas. Your entire fleet must work together to gather the materials needed in order to finish these projects. The higher tier a certain zone achieves you gain access to high end gear and equipment. Upgrading tiers just gives you ACCESS to the stores in which these items are located. And some items cost a pretty penny. (NOT REAL MONEY!) There are also Reputation systems. These use a very similar tier system to a fleet, but you are the only one that can work on your Rep systems. Reputation systems give you access to high end gear and equipment. This may sound exactly like fleets but they don't give you the same type of gear. This game makes you work long and hard for endgame gear. And what better than to give you this work than in the form of GRINDING. Yes, grinding. Lots and lots and lots of grinding. Grinding is pretty much the only way for you to get past level 50 and get to the levelcap, 60. PvEs (Player VS. Environment) or as a lot of people call them in STO, STFs (Special Task Forces) is pretty much all you're going to be doing if you want to get to level 60. Granted there are missions that you can do to get from 50 to 60 but they still leave some mighty fine XP gaps in between them that you need to grind in order to unlock the next mission. Now let's be real here. This is an MMO. It isn't uncommon to find grinding in MMOs. But what else normally comes with playing an MMO? Yep, microtransactions. Microtransactions can give you a shortcut if you don't feel like grinding. The C-Store is a large store with exclusive ships, weapons, outfits, and misc. items. All of these things I have mentioned are obtained through the ingame currency known as Zen. You can GRIND for dilithium and then turn refined dilithium into zen, but you can only refine 8,000 dilithium a day. And let's just say 8,000 refined dilithium converted into zen won't get you anywhere near the amount you'd need to get anything like a zen ship. T5 ships cost 2,500 zen and T6 ships cost 3,000 zen. You can convert real money into zen, but $1 is equal to 100 zen. So if you want a good endgame ship you'll have to either grind enough dilithium for you to get 3,000 zen or pay $30. Now, if you've been reading other reviews or been reading/hearing anything about this game you've probably heard about there being a paywall or that this game is P2W (Pay 2 Win). You can kind of understand where that's coming from now. However, I disagree to this as you can indeed get anything in the zen store without paying a cent. It'll just take much much longer. Paying in this game is just a shortcut, not a wall. Customization in this game is on point. You can customize your character so in depthly that you can even change the positioning of your cheekbones. You can change the deepness of your chest and even how wide your ribcage is. Multiple hairstyles to choose from for both genders and multiple eye colors, skin colors, and hair colors are available. You can get more uniforms and even alien outfits in the C-Store. (Most if not all of the outfit packs are 550 zen each) You can combine multiple outfit sets together to make a 100% unique play and attire. You can even customize the colors of your individual outfit pieces with dozens of different shades. You can even customize your ship. You may customize the material of your ship's hull and even add a paintjob if you want. You may also have different bridges for those of you who want to roleplay. The graphics aren't terrible but aren't incredibe at the same time. The optimization is pretty bad. So for those of you that like having a steady 60fps+ may be forced to run on the lowest graphical setting. And even then you may not get your beloved 60 frames all the time. I've come across many different texture bugs in my time and some have been fixed, some not. Animations in this game are lazy and in small numbers. Performance wise this game is laggy. Server lag and frame lag are relatively common. It's bad, but tolerable in most areas. Places like Risa where vegetation is everywhere is VERY laggy. I have to turn my graphical settings ALL the way down if I want to go to Risa and even then I can only maintain about 25 FPS.Space combat is fun and unique, it takes coordination and good gear to survive the PvEs and mission battles on maximum difficulty. It can be frustrating at times but in general the space combat is neat. Ground combat is iffy, some people like it more than space combat, but personally I find ground combat distasteful. The ground combat controls feel clunky and the HUD layout feels wrong for combat. It might just be me but that's my opinion. The Devs (Cryptic) don't listen to the community at all. PWE (Perfect World Entertainment) seems to be more interested in getting money instead of thinking about what the community wants and craves in the game. The devs don't even fix many bugs regularly.Overall this game can be fun. My final conclusion would be:To Me: 8/10 I like itTo Trekkies: 7/10 Worth looking intoTo MMO fans: 7/10 Nothing specialTo Average Gamer 6/10 MehFinishing Statement: ""It can be a lot of fun IF you're a Star Trek fan and/or MMO fan.""

												When I first started this game I'd recomend it to anyone interested in space RPGs, now: never.Why? Simple really, in the beginning this game was almost perfectly balanced, with ~30% content grind, but these things where optional and could be found as loot with % drop chance, bought from other players or simply a direct reward while you where exploring new areas etc.As it is now, there are HUGE power creeps, making almost all viable options of ships and skills bad-really bad, and a handfull few stupidly overpowered and all new updates and new ships they pour in makes the ship you grind for obsoleate before you even get it.There are 5 (main) types of credits. Three which you need to specificly grind for.And don't get me started on those damn Locked Boxes, you need a key to open, keys can be bought for ~1-2 000 000 credits (or just pay up real money). Each boxs has ~1-2% chance (stays at that % even if you pay) of holding ANYTHING you would like, most is just useless crap.And forgett the exploration they're boasting about, it's just the same thing over and over, go to place a and defeat three waves of really easy enemies, then defeat the really easy flagship, repeat. (Yes, I played on Elite setting.)Now let me explain where the grind element comes in, a base ship has ~20 slots for equipment.You will grind for:Space:- The ship itself. (Price for good ships ~1 000 000 ( very low end) - 100 000 000 (high end) ingame credits. One Elite mission will give you avarage ~100 000)- Weaponsx6-8. (It'll take you ~3 weeks to get ONE high level ship equipment from a Fleet merchant.)- Shield.- Engine.- Deflector.- Consolesx6-8.- Space crew skills.Personal: (You + crew.)- Weaponx6.- Shieldx5.- Armourx5.- Skill Kit.- Land crew skills.- Crafting. (Gods only know how long THAT will take.)- Passive skills.- Sub missions. (Duty missions.)- Events. (These will pile up quick and if you don't do enough to turn it in (100%), you walk away with nothing.)- Reputationx6-7.- Crafting XP.- Crafting material. (More kinds than you have slots in your Bank btw, and you don't find the ones related to each other in the same place, forcing you to scan every single quadrant to find those you need and end up with a ton of those you don't anyway.)Fleet: (Community effort.)- 5 buildings to simultaniously upgrade, with 6 subcategories each, all 6 can (and need to) be upgraded atleast 5 times. (All demands HUGE quantities the same resources as your ships and eqpts cost.)Don't think that's the end of the list, I just can't remember what more there where.So no, no no no no no no no NO, do not start this game, because it'll eat up all your time and give you nothing in return.Edit after New Dawn:Did you remove your pay-to-progress? No? Well, no change here then.			"

												Having thousands of hours played into this game, STO has been a bitter sweet experience. STO was a great game back when it was a subscription model, though it was still generic on all aspect of gameplay. The ship models are very nicely designed, ground game however; Very shallow, while the highlight of the game are the space battles, you cannot help but think it is a mere space bar spammer or clicker. Through the years the storyline has improved and the addition of voice acting has helped enhance the experience, however; that cannot save it from the harsh Development team strategy, which are time gates, lock boxes, extreme cost for upgrades, and lack of customer support. This is truly one for the most diehard Star Trek fans like me, but for serious gamers, avoid this one unless you love all PWE games & their business model.			"

												What once was awesome became a bad joke. Cryptic turned this game into a p2w asia grinder...- Since Delta Rising, there's ONLY grind left to do- No balance anymore- PvP is dead (there has been no update to pvp for many years anyway)- Queues are empty- Devs are lying, making jokes about players and even insult playersLast but not least: Newbies won't have any chance at all to keep up with long time players as long as they don't drop several thousand dollars.We've all seen it coming for a very long time, but it finally got worse than we expected!

 Space: The Final Frontier.  Space is vast, huge, unimaginably large.  Space in Star Trek Online is not so much.  The game takes place mostly in our Galaxy, with the Alpha, Beta and Delta quadrants split up into three largish maps.  Once you hit level 60, it'll take you around five minutes to get from one side to another on the largest of these maps.  You can transwarp, which is like teleporting, around which greatly reduces your travel time.  There's also a sprint option for getting around.  Basically, there's a large space to fly your ship around in but it does not feel endless.These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.This is where the game shines, in my eyes.  Like most MMO's, you get out of it what you put in.  Star Trek Online is unique wherein you don't just work to level up your character, but your ships and bridge officers as well.  With the inclusion of Duty Officers, it's like managing your very own star ship crew.  The Duty Officer system lets you build a crew and then send them out on little missions that will last from fifteen minutes to days on end.  Your voyages are a big part of Star Trek Online as well, with a large campaign on both the Federation and Klingon side and a medium sized campaign for the Romulan faction.  These campaigns are broken up into 'episodes', each segmented into different categories.  The writers certainly know their stuff, with little nods to the series littered throughout the campaigns.  A lot of these missions really make you feel like you are helping your faction though hard times or discovering new things. Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds. Missions in Star Trek Online are heavily instanced, with a lot of the more recent content not playable in groups.  This can make it a little harder if you're trying to play though the lot with friends and there's no really easy way to tell which missions are single player only.  There are quite a few queues once you get towards end game and most of these are a mix of challenging and entertaining.  They range from fighting off a Borg advance to pushing the Terrian Empire back into their own reality. To seek out new life and new civilizations. Seeking out new life and new civilizations is something that Star Trek lacks a little bit in it's core gameplay.  Luckily, we've got the Foundry for this.  The Foundry is an easy to use mission creator inside Star Trek Online with the intention of pushing your missions to the live game.  These missions will be playable by everyone and with some creative thinking, the sky can be the limit with this tool.  People can donate in game currency to your account if they really enjoyed your mission, so creating something of great quality can be benificial to yourself as well. To boldly go where no one has gone before. Star Trek Online is five years old now.  People have been here before, aside from Foundry missions, you won't discover anything new here.  Though, I'll take this time to quickly talk about the Free to Play model.  There's been some argument over the 'Pay to Win' status of this game.  While you can sink real life cash into Star Trek Online to fast track yourself to the top, you don't have to.  In fact, with a bit of time, you can actually earn in game currency and covert that to currency to buy items from the cash shop.  Obviously, Star Trek Online is geared towards wanting you to spend money and there are some brazen attempts to pull some out of you, but with some self-control, you're able to enjoy all of the story and locations without spending a dime.  Premium ships and gear is locked behind a pay wall, if you're happy not having this.  Not one single cent needs to be spent.			"

												I enjoy this game. I don't write reviews,  I Love Star Trek and this is easy to get lost in and with all the negative reviews I've read I have to write something positive. I would absolutely recommend this game.  Kills me to see/read reviews that are thumbs down by players who have hundereds of hours in and speak all this good and try to throw out ""pay to win"" or that cryptic doesn't give back. ""it's pay to win."" Everyone who complains that you have to pay to win is just wrong. You can earn game currency(zen) by playing the game. you get dilithium just by playing. You have to refine that dilithium and exchange it for zen. You are only allowed 8000 dilithium to be refined a day. at this time I think the exchange rate in 236 dilithium to 1 zen. You can do the math, too early for me to do it. Sure it takes longer than paying but what doesn't and it's not difficult at all. I saved up 3000k zen by doing this and it seemed like it took no time. For reference, you get 500 zen a month by subscription. Bought the ship I wanted that was only offered using zen.In fact it comes easy just going through and playing you earn dilithium just doing the regular missions. You also earn by doing side crew assignments which run while you're doing missions. You earn different ships by leveling which is the other thing. Most of the ships you buy with zen aren't that much different than the ones you earn leveling, at least I wouldn't see it being a problem for a casual player of the game.Paying doesn't earn you any combat bonuses either. Paying really only opens up more slots for officers, ships, and gives currency each month. look it up on the site. It only expands those slots by a few. PLUS if you pay for a month subscription, cancel, and never sub again. you KEEP all the bonuses you earned while subscribed, with the exception of the monthly money, when you're unsubsscribed. Who else does that?I've been playing for a few years now, on and off, and all i've seen this game do is grow and develop into something awesome. I look forward to the new content or ""seasons"" and the devs always seem to do something to draw me back if I stop playing for a while. The map has expanded and grown to be awesome. If you're a fan, sometimes just flying around the map and visiting the places you recognize is rewarding enough. Cryptic has done nothing but improve this game step by step and continue to do so. They feature voice work by actual star trek cast and seem to be making this a truly remarkable and unique game. The thing I love most is the foundry missions. Which are player created missions that play as episodes in Star Trek. So you have your ship that you get in game, you have your crew, and then you get to take them on these episodes/missions that feel like you're playing through an episode that you're watching on TV. This is by far one of the greatest things this game has to offer for the fan who wishes he could watch a new episode. and as a plus, anyone can create missions through the foundry. The ""Fleets"" are like guilds or clans in this game. and I have found them nothing but helpful. Content is unlocked by joining one. Awesome features that I think are worth your while. !st column is recommended. The game itself is beautiful and any Star Trek fan has to geek a little to be able to take a character though all the places you've watched growing up. There are problems with every game and everyone is different in what bothers them vs someone else but to generally thumb down this game is rediculous. I feel sorry for those people because I'm sure they are having trouble finding a fleet or are frustrated with maybe the learning curve of all the content but if you give this game a fair chance, and are a fan of Star Trek, I think you'll find yourself feeling that same feeling you felt while watching your favorite episodes when they first aired just playing through and learning the game. I personally cannot wait to see what they do with it in the future.			"

												I love Star Trek, but I cannot recommend this game.Myself, my wife, and my 4 kids all have Lifetime Subs to this game, we bought in when Cryptic first introduced the LTS while it was beta.  But you know, it is what it is, they went free to play. I can get over that, they had to do what they had to do.Then they started selling outfits and such -- cool beans, they have to make money somehow after F2P.Then they started selling ships -- not ship skins but out-right ships that are 20x better than what you can obtain in-game without years of dillithium grinding.Then they added lockboxes which require keys only obtainable from their cstore (the p2w shop).And their latest scheme is making it a mechanic in game to need to expand your ship slots for admirality, which requires zcredits.You will press the ""buy now"" button more than you will ever press any other button in this game.  Avoid it.  This game is a whole new level of micro-transactions and pay-to-win.Want an extra character for farming? Buy NowWant more storage in your inventory? Buy Now Want even more storage? Buy Now (multiply that by 16 I think)Want more bank storage? Buy NowWant more shared bank storage? Buy NowAwe! You can't buy that new weapon on the market because your bank account can't hold enough money to buy it? Buy NowLockbox Dropped? Buy NowNew ships added? Buy Now (but you better check your bank account, they can get expensive)Want more bridge officers? Buy NowWant specail bridge officers? Buy NowWant more duty officers? Buy NowWant specail duty officers? Buy NowWant more ship slots?  Buy NowWant a new ship? Buy NowThat is just the start. This game will nickel and dime the hell out of you.Do be warned, there are many that have subscribed to this pay-to-win system, and they will tell you everything they can conjure to get you to play the game so that they have someone other than those who have sunk more money into them game than them in the game to feel significant.  These folks will give you the following excuses:1) If you grind long enough you can obtain everything in-game that you can in the cstore    - This is an ambiguious statement, your life-span isn't log enough for this to happen if you pay $0.00.  Even if you could, the markets are controlled by the people who CAN purchase things like ship modules, keys, etc from the cStore giving them a very clear advantage in-game by use of their wallet.2) You can gain the dillithium easy and fast to get everything in the cstore    - This is outright false.  In order to ""grind fast"" you have to either a) spend money or b) soak about the first 7 months of your play-time into grinding the dillithium to get 8 characters to grind this dillithium.  Once you do, I'm sure you'll be so sick of grinding dillithium you will have already uninstalled.3) Then don't pvp, there is no competition elsewhere!    - False, if your gear isn't to a certain spec, if your ships aren't to a certain spec, you can't get in non-pug groups. 4) It is a free game, what do you have to loose?    - Time that could be had having fun elsewhere, that's what you have to loose.  You will not see the paywalls in this game until you get to the higher levels, namely T6 ships.  Then you'll need upgrade modules or you will need to buy a c-store ship to obtain them.  These T6 ships make it possible to continue playing the game (else you will die, over and over again), and then, if you want the T6 perma-passive bonuses from the ship, you MUST purchase it from the Cstore.  I'll be very clear about this factoid: unless it is a specail event, you cannot obtain high-level ships in-game without someone spending IRL money and a LOT of it.To give you an idea, a ""ship bundle"", can sell for $200.00 or more.  So before someone says this game is free, reflect on what I just said.This is not Star Trek, it is Pay Trek to Win.The one thing I dread most about this game is pulling up the patcher to see they have a new lockbox or new ship, because if you want to keep your character updated without playing this game as a full-time job... Buy Now @ $150+			"

												Do not recommend this game. I am a lifelong Star Trek fan, and I even was a Star Trek online fan for quite a long time, but Perfect World killed this game. It is but a shell of what it used to be. They want money for every little thing. People will argue against this point, saying you can convert dilithium to zen and what not so no need to spend real money... DO NOT BE FOOLED. It is a deception. If you were to go the dilithium to zen way to purchase new ships and stuff IT WILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE LIFETIME. It's capped at 8000 Dilithium per day, you would have to spend every moment playing grinding toward your goal accross multiple characters to get what you desire.The Delta rising expansion made the game so much worse than my above description even. Ships you already bought and paid for, now require expensive money bought items to be upgraded to be kept up with the new level cap increase. They decieve you by saying these upgrades are optional and not neccesary to play, but it is a lie. You will be a scrub without these upgrades. No one will want you on their team in any serious content if you run around without a properly upgraded ship.All in all the only good part of this game is the roleplaying aspect in it. Character creation is pretty immersive. Biographies are possible, plenty of social map and an active community. That is the ONLY reason anyone should play but the game itself? It's horrible.			"

												I've been a fan of Star Trek for a really long time. I've been to conventions, I've seen every show and movie multiple times, I've played damn near every Star Trek video game out there, and I was even at the Vegas Star Trek Convention when this game was originally announced (back when it was still being developed by Perpetual Entertainment). If Star Trek Online was going to appeal to anybody, I think it's fair to say that I would be at the front of the line. And for a long while after Cryptic released the game, it did. Star Trek Online started off as a very decent piece of fan service to the core series. No, the stories were never the same level of quality that was seen in the TV series, but it didn't have to be. The game succesfully hit all the right buttons to be a succesful Star Trek MMO, and Cryptic legitimately seemed like they wanted to keep improving the product they had released. Then came free to play. I have nothing against free to play as a general concept, but so many games handle it incorrectly in an attempt to increase revenue. That didn't happen immediately for STO, but after Cryptic Studios was purchased by Perfect World Entertainment, it sure didn't take long. Perfect World is very well known for churning out game after game with obnoxious freemium systems, so I suppose it shouldn't be to surprising that they did the same with STO. And that's exactly what happened.All In all, there's still a part of STO that's good, but it's covered in so much money grabbing BS I just cant' recommend the game to anyone anymore. I would love to be able to revisit the game I played for 1000+ hours (I played on the standalone client before switching to the Steam client), but it's just not there anymore. TLDR: Used to be a fantastic game, but it's been bogged down by to much freemium BS.			"

												I loved this game. However, PWE has completely ruined it. If you can stay awake through the first 50 levels, then you will see that the game is actually rather fun. All the missions are completable and the ""Trek sense"" is here. However, once you hit the P2W walls, your forced out of the immersion and into your wallet. Even after buying some overpriced ships (off of other people of course; you have to gamble for the ships in PWE's system), I still was struggling with getting proper entertainment. Did I mention this game is a StarTrek casino? You want the new ship? Buy lock boxes and keys (keys=$2.00) and have a 1/256 chance of winning the ship you want. Being the good citizen I am, I actually decided to buy the keys from PWE, then sell them on the exchange for money to then trade / buy the ship I wanted. Even thoguh it was overpriced, I payed the money and got the keys. Oops! It appears that Steam and PWE are not integrated at all and my keys became account bound. This rendered them useless (for my purposes). I contacted PWE and said that they did not inform me that my keys would be locked and that I demand an immediate refund. They blammed everything on Steam and refused to refund my money. I contacted Steam which, being the dunces they are, blammed everything on me and PWE. I decided to dispute with the credit card company (and I won) which resulted in my cards (that's right, all my cards) being locked from steam for an unkown amount of time. PWE tried to blame me for not reading their forum about the currency. A game that requires forum reading is hardly a game at all. I play video games to get away from all the homework I recieve during school. I used to enjoy the game before it became a P2W, neatly dressed, pile of garbage. My advice, stay away before your tricked out of your money.			"

												I played this game for over 5 years. In that time, I watched PWE buy it and turn it to complete garbage. Before they bought it, the main complaint was that it was stale and had little content. The PvP was fantastic though. After PWE bought it and made it F2P, it was okay for a while. They introduced ships with fancy consoles, that weren't necessarily gamebreaking, but at the same time were aggravating to fight against. Then they introduced lockboxes. These had fancy new gear and ships. This opened the floodgates for more of this stuff. Soon it became apparent that anything other than the newest ships and weapons would become obsolete very quickly. They kept adding more and more pay items. Power creep ensued. Now the game is a mess and typical PWE garbage. On a side note, to those people that say you can easily grind for stuff with dilithium, you can but it takes way too long for any normal person. To get reasonable amounts of dilithium to be able to buy ships and items, it would require you to grind like its a second job. A lot of the grind is also timegated. It should be called F2P but P2-have-fun. You can still play through the story (LvL 1-50) and it's interesting. Going from LvL 50-60 requires a bit of grind as missions don't give enough xp on their own to progess. After that you hit the paywall, and at this point if you want to progress, you will either be paying or grinding... a lot.			"

												Star Trek Online is a very decent MMO that does a fair job at capturing the expansive Star Trek Universe. You will encounter a plethora of memorable personalities on your journeys throughout the game while exploring both the famous and uncharted systems across the galaxy. At the time of this review you can currently play as a Star Fleet Officer, a Citizen of the new Romulan Republic, or a Warrior of the Klingon Empire. There are three career paths that you can chose - Tactical, Science, or Engineering - which determine what skills you have access to as well as what kind of ship you will command. STO is one of my top 3 best MMOs and is the second best MMO for Free to Play Players as there are literally no content restrictions unlike games such as Star Wars: The Old Republic (End Game content + Expansion Pack) or The Lord of the Rings Online (all content beyond The Lone Lands (level 30ish) requires individual purchase or subscription). You can easily reach max level (50) and beyond without subscribing. That being said there are the common account restrictions for F2P players, such as a currency cap, limited character slots (3), no account bank, and limited character bank storage space. If you do decide to play STO here are a few tips:* Levels 1-49 are essentially a giant tutorial that helps familiarize you with the mechanics of the game. * At level 50 the game content changes from Single Player to Group as you take part in STFs (Special Task Force) missions and their Elite counterparts where you fight extremely tough enemies such as the Borg and Tholians for reputation items.* At End Game, Lock Box and Cryptic Store Ships are vastly superior to anything else. If you are serious about playing the game throughout the End Content you should consider purchasing one as well as a subscription. "

												STO at first had the potential to be one of the most in depth sci fi games in the MMO universe, sadly this cannot be said today. The disconnection between the playerbase and the developers is as wide as the East is to the West, and the game seems like it will suffer the same fate as Champion Online did, mostly going into maintenance mode soon, that is if the developers do not wake up to what is going on around them. Plagued with BUGS, power creeps, balance issues, an expensive upgrade system, lock boxes, dead queues, very slow leveling up process, and very expensive Tier 6 starships; has pretty much stalled STO on its track. To be fair though, anything in game can be obtained for FREE with extensive daily commitment and grinding.Here is an article with helpful insight on the new problem that the STO community is facing, I hope you find it helpful.http://massively.joystiq.com/2014/11/30/captains-log-why-star-trek-online-is-kind-of-a-mess-right-now/Truth is, there are better MMO's out there that rewards players for their dedication, with developers not as hostile towards the playerbase. I cannot fully recommend the game as it has changed into something entirely else, it's only saving grace is the game's ip, other than that, it is a mediocre experience with pretty ships. Play at your own risk.			"

There are problems they don't seem to fix they just prefer to ignore them and add more stuff to the game. There are bugs that make the game hard to play like the power tray and the loadout don't work. I really can't tell you how much I hate this game and Cryptic Studio or Perfect World Entertainment.

												First off, I was a big fan of Star Trek.  To me it really wasn't about the characters, it was more abou the tech and the ships.  I can pilot the NX, Excelsior, and TOS Connie?  Sign me up!I started playing the game over 2 years ago, and honestly the direction is has been moving has made it so I no longer interested in the game.  There will always be grinding in MMOs, that's a given.  STO however takes the grinding to a whole new level of bad.  The game is set up to get you to 50 quickly so you can start grinding away.  You grind for reps, the traits of which you are now limited to 4 active space and ground.  You grind for gear that is now going to be worthless so guess what?  Grind for the newer gear.  To PWE/Cryptic, grinding = content.  Add the time gates to slow down any meaningful progress in the game, and you have what amounts to a second job.The last few feature episodes have been single player only.  So what's the point of being in an MMO if I can't run what little new content there is with friends?  This is the most single-player MMORPG I have ever played.  With the dwindling amount of players that probably won't be a bad thing in a while.Now after telling their player base there would never be T6 ships because they wouldn't want to make everyone's T5s obsolete (some costing $25.00 for a single ship), they are now rolling out T6s and giving people the opportunity to upgrade their T5s to T5Us, which will still be inferior to T6s.  In the case of fleet ships you will end up paying three times for the same ship, just to get a little better stats.If you play STO for any length of time you will notice the cash-grabbing.  I understand they have to generate revenue, but they way they do it makes you feel used.  I have seen it grow worse with every season to the point it is so obvious now you wonder if they will charge you every time you enter Earth spacedock. If endless grinding is your idea of fun, then this game is for you.  But this is not a Star Trek MMO.  They have moved so far away from the base material this is now a generic space MMO with a Star Trek flavor packet.  I only log in for the social aspect with my friends who haven't left the game.  It's sad, but I can no longer recommend this game to anyone.			"

												I have a few hours in this game, I've played it on and off for a few years and streched out over that time frame, my hours played aren't that great. All though ~I do have time on Arc as well.When the game was launched, many felt that it just simply wasn't good enough to merit the subscription and player numbers quickly fell, this is not to say the game is bad, it's fun in parts, it helps if your a bit of a star trek fan I think, there are good moments when you meet familiar characters from the shows and things like that, but these are moments.If there was such a thing as a casual mmo then I guess this is what it would be, there is a grind but it's mostly a grind that you can do an hour here or there on your own or with a small group, there are huge fleets but again it's not something you really need in order to participate in the content, you can solo and pug your way through it.It's fun, but, can quickly become repetative, ground combat is old and clunky but some space battles can be a lot of fun.It seems that from the start, This was nothing more than a cash grab using the Star Trek name though and it's only ever gotten worse, It quickly went free to play and is advertised as such with the assertion that you don't need to buy any ships from the store in order to play, well, this used to be true until the delta rising expeansion.At this point the company decided that it would totally shaft all of it's existing paying customers, the way the expansion was handled and the release of the new T6 ships is another post entirely, suffice to say that it killed the game, many players including myself stopped playing because of the way we were being fleeced for money, quite blatantly, it was either pay more or pay again, that was the choice we were given.The numbers trying to join STF's (instanced group missions) went from a couple of hundred and now struggling to reach 30 on a good day. They are well aware of this and have made efforts to address it, I feel their recent content addition has been very fun, fun enough in fact that I started playing again, I bought some stuff, I'm the sort of person that pays for things when I feel I am getting enjoyment out of it, I've spent a lot on this game.Why do I still play it? Mostly because of people who play it, I'm never going to make another purchase in it thats for sure.The other day after spending a couple of hundred pounds on their C store, I realised that there may have been an issue with some of the items that I bought, I sent in an in game ticket as a subcribed player I am supposed to get a better service of support apparently, I waited days for a reply and then finally found out the answer to my issue myself, I then tried to get help with that issue and this time decided to try their ""live support""The guy said hello and asked me what was up, I explained the issue and the dude in the live support decided all by themselves that my issue was with an ship bundle that I purchashed after I had just sat and typed out something quite different to that and then just flipped me off with the most redundant repsone.So if that was my thanks for subscribing and spending a small fortune on the game, I let them know that I was cancelling my subscription and that my wife would be too and that no more money would be spent on the company if their live support people can't even be bothered to read a parahraph before giving a redundant auto response.Since then I seem to have a strange bug where inventory items are going missing, the first I noticed was an old reputation reward shield, it was loaded into a visual slot and then one day I logged in and it was gone, I passed this off as maybe me being tired and discarded it by accident, then later I thought I had lost some beam weapons that I had made for an alt,But today I realised that it's not me that is discarding missing items, I made a whole load of low level warp cores, I put two with decent modifiers in my bank for an alt and the rest went onto the exchange, I logged out for an hour and when I got back, at least 10 of my exchange listings were gone, there was no mail or money in my account for them, the ones I had put in the bank for my alt were gone too.Now I've went ahead and opened a bug report about this but I can already tell you what the reply to that is going to be.""Tough♥♥♥♥♥♥mate, grind some more, have you tried buying some of what you need from our C store?""If that's what the company thinks of someone who has supported it, then what chance have you got?This could be a great game, but it only cares about your money.

												This MMO is nothing more then a F2P (Forced 2 Pay... Well okay rather a F2PFP2P, which is short for Free 2 Play Forced Pay To Progress) money pit which you will find out when you get towards L50. I have tried coming back to this twice now and both times it was much the same. Pay to Play model forced down peoples throats without mercy. With this new ""Delta Rising"" expansion however it becomes absurdely prevelent to the lengths of corporate greed this company will go just to try to ""milk"" potential new cash cow customers/players just for L60 gear. Now while yes you technically can get end-game stuff for ""free 2 play"" expect to take this on as a full time job if you do and give up whatever you currently call a life because in the end this is what this one realistically boils down to. Which is unless you feel like blowing money which is better spent towards other games or essentially a new PC, Rent, Bills, ect...Bottom Line, Essentially this is put out by a company that tried to force steam users along with non-steam users to use a data mining launcher which gathers ALL of your information to sell to 3rd partys, Ultimately early on it's a good way to pass the time and invest in if your a die-hard trekkie (which be forewarned prior to delta rising they gutted the core essence of the exploration aspect of what made star trek what it is by removing it all together!) otherwise your better off passing this one up as it will suck you in and suck your wallet bone dry with it's addiction forming factor. Essentially the norm for this is you'll get hooked, play it for about a few months, get sick/bored of it, and ditch it for about 6 months to a year or longer and just rinse, and repeat.			"

												As Cryptic Studios released the game 2nd Februar 2010 they had an idea of how to make a good Star Trek Game. I played in Alpha and Beta and ordered several copies preorder to gain a lot of ingame stuff that was different on every copy of the game. They did not make it perfect at start, it had its flaws, but hey were working on it to make it better over time. I really enjoyed playing the game. You had exploring missions. Yes at some point they repeated themselves, but that is how close you can get in a game to a Star Trek feeling. The ingame store had updates from now and then and I bought some stuff, like the Defiant Retrofit (Now T5). You could speculate how a game that demands monthly money to play it can have an ingame store that requires money again, but it was another time and technically you could unlock almost anything by playing. The design was  attracting a casual playing older/wealthy player base anyway. Prices were not too high and any unlocks were always account wide forever.This all changed as Arc Games purchased Cryptic Studios and everything went downhill. The chinese company turned the game really quick into a typical chinese pay to win game. With the release of the T6 Ships around 80% of players left, for obvious reason not being willing to pay real money for them. Only other way to get these ships was brainless grinding and playing every day. Didnt take long for the famous chinese shop in shop system appeared in which you could buy stuff that only was unlocked on one character for the double price. Yes I actually calculated everything. Ofcouse you can grind everything out, but getting a T6 ship from the Zen Store without using money will take you around 150 days with one character, depending on the dilithium exchange prices and you having enough unrefined dilithium.Anyway we went enough on the pay to win part now, lets get to the gameplay. Well every patch breaks more stuff than they can fix. This is not Cryptics fault. They actually work hard I think, they just dont get any money to repair and improve stuff in the necessary amount. Arc Games is sucking everything out. The warp out animation is broken for months. An animation Cryptic originally changed 3 times at release till it satisfied them. But look here, shiny, shiny new ships. Give us your money is Arc Games answer to that. There are several issues in the game right now. Game breaking graphic bugs and never ending glitches can be expected while you play. Be sure the server disconnects you around 30s per map you are moving.Now lets get to the part if you really have to pay money. Yes and no. Technically you can play with your free ship, but the enemies are getting stronger and stronger and standing a chance with a T5 ship against the Vaadwaur proves challenging, against Na'kuhl it is suiciding through the missions.If this still didnt convince let me you tell you that, besides having bought multiple keys for ingame items at release, I am a Lifetime Subscriber. We get free Zen every month, only reason why I still play btw. As I went back into the game after a break I had the problem I couldnt claim the T5 I bought some time ago on any other character. Wait there is a player support that I asked immediatly to get a message some days later, I just need to dismiss it on the character I own it and reclaim it there. Ofcourse I trusted the support and dissmissed the ship. Jokes on me, I couldnt reclaim it. Wrote another ticket explaining it, showing proof of the purchase. Guess what. They didnt care and didnt want to give me the ship I already paid for. I was supposed to buy it again.Conclusion: You can play the game, some of the original good content is still there. I recommend you to make a character and just play the story once. After that stop playing. Dont waste money on it. The game is close to being dead anyway. Not later than they release T7 even the hardcore fans will leave.Really sad what lifeless, souless husk this game has become. It had great potencial and it still has. I never expected it to be like the Series. Maybe one day a better company will buy Arc Games and make the game good again.			"

												After an obsessive Deep Space 9 marathon that left me yearning for more but unwilling to subject myself to Voyager/Enterprise, I decided to give this game a try to ween me off the resurgence of my inner Trekie. I don't regret trying it, and put a lot of time into it/might not be finished with it, but I also can't recommend it as a good game. While not exactly a 'pay to win' production, there does come a point in the higher levels where upgrading your ships to the current maximum level takes more 'Zen', the purchasable currency of the game, than a person could reasonably be expected to gather themselves in-game. Pros: - The game has great character customization. Few are willing to admit that most MMO's are basically complex dress-up games, but this game embraces that element. Not only are you afforded extensive personal customization, but all your bridge officers can be fully customized as well, ony their sex and their race being pre-determined. While there are many alien races to choose from, you can also select 'Alien', which allows you to create your own species, and gives you wildly versatile customization. Want to play as a bald, pot-bellied toddler running around with a Bat-leth? Go for it. Want your captain to look exactly like a Vault-Boy Bobble-head? No problem. Want your first officer to look exactly like one of those giant blue chicks from Avatar? Jake Sulley it up all you want. - Ship combat is fun, versatile, and very nostalgic. The mechanics mirror the way combat is portrayed in the show very well, with all the special abilities available being the go-to phrases of Captains throughout the Star Trek franchise. Emergency power to weapons, reverse sheild polarity, fire a full spread of torpedoes, activate the tacheon beam... all the technobabble of Star-Trek returns, all with unique functions in combat. My personal favorites? Ramming Speed and Self Destruct. - Uncannily challenging for an MMO. The game has the rare MMO feature of a difficulty setting, and the max difficulty is really quite challenging after the tutorial levels, and really quite crushingly difficult after around the lvl 40 mark. The ships you confront will be exceptionally more powerful than yours, often able to obliterate you in a single torpedo spread, making quick reaction time and well-thought-out tactics essential. Cons: - Ground combat is weak, and ground missions are often exceedingly annoying puzzles that don't so much challenge you to think as force you to do a lot of tedious reading while running back and forth between consoles. Many of the ground missions were a major chore to complete. -The crafting system is dreadful. Essential resources are incredibly scant, about 2 harvesting nodes present on about 2/3s of the missions you run, and 90% of those nodes being the basic common-grade materials, meaning you'll have huge stacks of those and next to none of anything else. The only decent way to gain experience in crafting is to engage in these 20-hour research projects that prevent you from building anything while they're active, and actually building things gives you minimal experience by comparison, and wastes your over-rare resources. The only way to really succeed in crafting is to buy crates of resources using Zen, I.E real world money. Otherwise, your crafting will never in a million years keep up with your leveling, or ever be of any real value to you except perhaps in the distant future of play. - It doesn't really feel like an MMO. Besides the occassional 'Borg attack' event to which everyone in a system is invited, playing with other people is a rarity in this game. You see other folks flying through space at warp, you run into other folks at the docks/space stations, but the vast majority of missions are all solo experiences. There are ques for PVE and PVP events, but they are so long that I've never successfully joined whatever it is they're queing for.- space combat, while entertaining, follows 2-dimensional rules. While I undserstand the need for set 'up' and a set 'down' while in space combat simply to keep directions and mapping viable, ships are far too bound too and bogged down by the imposition of 'up' and 'down' in space combat. You cannot dive, nor fly straight up, nor do a flip, nor fly upside-down. You essentially move like a sub-marine and not a space-ship. This puts annoyingly restrictive limits on manuevering and heavily detracts from a players capacity to use superior piloting skills to any sort of advantage. It's also highly annoying when travling to positions/enemies above or below you, as you have to slowly spiral down or spiral up in order to change your height position. This has got to be the single greatest turn-off for me.			"

												I have no idea how this game has so many positive reviews, Im a fanboy for sure, but I still cant bring myself to like this game since the company was sold, and I have played and do play mmo's Still. Im a lifetime sub and I am telling you this game stinks. The business model seems to be sell lockbox keys, Honestly haven’t touched it in 6 months at least but it can’t have changed that much. Flying between Sectors is the least immersive experience in gaming I think I’ve ever had, feels like I’m swimming in a kiddie pool... with 100 other ships in these tiny space sectors. Another disappointing entry into the Star Trek Video game franchise.			"

												After Almost 500 Hours, and the same amount of cash, this is a Star Trek fanboy dream, almost, after this amount of time in game, conclusion, needs to go the way of WoW in a big way, lot of hidden fees, and vague, unclear things, to make you spend even more money, some shady stuff going on here....if you are a Star Trek Fan be careful, you could buy quite a few games, with the amount of money you end up possibly spending, and you will want to spend money, cause the game is geared that way, would prefer a monthly fee for sure over the paygate to happiness here, free to play is a really bad thing, unfortunately if it wasn't for that we would not still have this game.....good and bad.....good Star Trekspace combat is ok, but you do not have full 360 which doesn't make any sense, with dx11, and physics, No Reward for Content, very limited Items, and rewards, pay to winyes you can get everything in gamebut they limit you to how much you can make in one dayso you will want to spend morewhich shouldn't beonce you spend 150 bucks lol you should have all you need for a yearbut doesn't work out that wayif you are easy to spend money they will get rich off you			"

												Star Trek Online. I have almost 2000 hours on record. But I do actually have way more than that. For a while I had a really weak computer and I played the game standalone on a the DVD cover release. Back when that still existed.Where do I start?Star Trek Online has been through two phases, one is now gone but I'll take you through it anyway. To see how it has evolved.When Star Trek Online was released it was driven by Cryptic and released by Atari. Both on their own site, Steam and through DVD boxes in stores. At that time the game was really weak and lacking. There was no audio dialog or fancy cutscenes and the graphics were already a tad outdate. New content was barely released because of how small the team was. But we still had a lot of fun exploration missions, you could visit every star system even if that ment just flying around the planet and looking around. You also had to pay to play back then. You could buy playing time online or buying ""month"" cards.Then the big boss ""Perfect World Entertainment"" came a long. Now this was a good and a bad thing. The good news is that since Perfect World has a lot more resources than small Cryptic. And Atari was just a publisher, this now ment that Star Trek Online had a big team with a lot of resources. This mean the game quickly evolved in a highly positive way. Such as missions getting better and more complex, the introduction of even more advanced audio dialoge and cutscenes. The general story telling of the game got improved a lot. There have also been way more updates and patches and they even just recently overhauled the graphics engine and it looks all quite nice. The ships have also been re-done since Beta days to make them look more realistic. Most even have brand new, made from scratch models and textures. So the graphics now compared to release are amazing.That being said. The game is now free to play and everything ingame can be accessed without real life money. Though it'll take you ages to do that. But since the game is free, and there's something you really want I don't see a problem buying it for real money. You support the developers.While the developers do not always pay attention to small bug reports that have been sitting on the forums or tickets for ages. They do fix serious issues. For example one time, I deleted my main character that I'd have for years and after 2 weeks I got a mail saying they managed to recovery the character. They are also good at cracking down mean players and annoying ""gold sellers"".While the story driven content and graphics have been improved, togheter with general gameplay some things have been ""broken"" as well.For example, most systems in the Galaxy cannot be entered unless you have a specific mission. Almost all systems have a patrol mission, where you enter.. Explore, kill some bad guys or something. But when you've done that once. You are NOT allowed to repeat the mission on the same character.The story arc is also ""shared"" for all the factions in the game. Each faction has some unique missions but in the end they follow the same line of missions but it's done in a way so it's somewhat different and okay in my eyes.They removed the exploration missions. In the old days the game itself generated a random star system, a random map and a totally random mission. So nothing was ever the same. Almost. Anyway it was a fun way to get some diversity in the game when you've done all your leveling and stuff. This was sadly removed because it did not ""feel up to the game standards"" but we have not seen a replacement.So when you're done playing all the story missions and done all the patrol missions. There are also some mini missions on Starbases and some planets, but again. These are non replayable. All you got is PVE and PVP. PVE is mostly dead but if you get in a fleet you can run private sessions. PVP is somewhat broken if you can call it that. It means the ""general"" player can't really compet here because of how out of control DPS has gotten. But that's something you can google. Of course if you wanna' get into DPS it can be quite fun for those who love that.But in short, Star Trek Online is an amazing game that brings the Trek universe to full scale in my eyes. You can visit and see all the locations from the show. All the starships are included in great detail along with a few new ones. The game also take place in 2409-2410. That's way ahead of Star Trek Voyager, Deep Space 9 and The Next Generation. That allows the game to have technology that wasn't in the series. For example personal shield generators and stuff like that. It works out great with the game setting and it does bring the feel of this is what Star Trek would evolve too.There is a lot of Star Trek lore in the game to enjoy, everything from food items to a name mentioned. Or just a location or event in the series. You can also meet a lot of Star Trek Characters complete with audio dialog from their actors. Like the Doctor played by Roberto Picardo, Tuvok by Tim Russ and even Neelix by Ethan Phillips. There are also some people from Star Trek Enterprise etc.The game also now focuses heavily on what happend in Star Trek Voyager, Deep Space 9, The Next Generation, Enterprise and even The Original Series. For example a lot of the deep episodes on the TV shows that was not really fully explained. Like Yeasterday's Enterprise.. The Temporal Cold War. The Iconians.. Stuff like that are explained in the game and it's just amazing.But you don't need to be a Trekkie to play. You can still pick up on a lot of the jokes etc. There is also a lot of customization involved in the game. You have a lot of options when it comes to designing your character. It even puts the character creator in Saints Row to shame, and that's saying something. You can also customize your starship and mix parts. For example a Galaxy Class can have different nacelle's.. (Engines for you non Trek fans).Anyway to this day, even though it's free the game gets new content quite often compared to other MMO's. The only other bad side is that the game community can be quite... Hostile. So it'll be hard to make friends and feel welcome. Try to ignore that, as some of the players including myself are awesome and nice.In short, this is an amazing game. Especially if you are a Trekkie. And the fact that it's free, it doesn't hurt to try. Does it?Also the game runs well on my system, though I have a very powerful system. Sometimes you do get a tad huge FPS drops if there are a lot of clicky powers etc. But that's just the game slowing down. Not you. Also on the Steam Page it's mentioned that it can run on ""Intel HD Graphics"" this is only newer generation. The game was developed to work on Intel HD Graphics so everyone can play it. I tested it on my laptop with a Core i5-5500 2.20 GHz CPU, 8 GB RAM and Intel HD Graphics 5500. The game runs quite well with graphics set to low. You can have things like character detail, high detail objects and textures maxed out. But fancy things such as lighting and shadows must be off. Still runs quite well on a ""non gaming laptop"".

												Star Trek Online I started playing this game a few years ago when it went Free to Play (F2P).  If your a trekkie or a scifi lover I recommend this game.  The different story lines are well put together.  And unlike most F2P games it isn't a pay to win game.  The reasons for that is you can achieve everything the guy that just dropped some of that hard earned cash on a ship or items through just grinding and playing the game.  Play as Klingon, Romulan or the Federation character.  This Star Trek Universe takes place after the Star Trek Nemesis movie. (cause JJ Abrams universe is an alternative one) Leveling your character is fairly easy think I capped out in about two weeks if not sooner.  There is both ground and space missions.  And once you have done all the story’s because you will there is the end content like Special Task Force fighting the Borg and few others.   One cool aspect of this game is the foundry where players like you create there own missions in the foundry and upload them so you can play there missions.  Some of the people creating missions for you are fantastic at it and creating missions and its is pretty fun to give it a go.  Also if your a lonely gamer and don't play nice with others this isn’t the game for you because a lot of content is only accessible if your in a fleet ( guild).  Now there are good fleets and bad fleets.  You will jump from fleet to fleet till you find one you like.  Now on to the four types of currency the pay Zen, Dilithium which you achieve by doing missions, or different events. Energy Credits you get just by playing the game and buying and selling items, and Fleet credits.  Each has its own role in this universe the Zen enough said you buy zen to purchase different items in the zen store.  Now the dilithium which is the most important because you can sell dilithium on the market to turn into zen there is a daily cap on how much dilithium you can earn each day because Perfect World wants you to spend money.  Now the fleet credits are earned by joining a fleet (guild) and helping contribute to fleet projects.   I do however recommend you subscribe for one month if you are getting into the game because of the added perks you receive like ship slots, character slots, inventory, bank, and also the 500 zen they give you for subscribing. Then unsubscribe and you still still have those added benefits.  I still subscribe to this FREE TO PLAY game because you also earn other perks.  But as you progress in the game you will see if its for you or not.  But STO is probably one of the best F2P MMORPG's on the market.			"

												How could I give a bad review for a game that has given me over 40 hours of entertainment for $0? And I know that 40 hours is only the tip of the iceberg. I am here for the story, I am a Star Trek fan, so I play mostly solo and this little game shines under that light. I can't say anything about the PvP, I have never done it. The PvE is pretty fun though. Anyway, as a single player story, for free, it's an amazing Star Trek game. Now let the negative reactions flow, for this is the internet.			"

												First off do I recommend this game??? That is a good question and I would have to say yes and no.Yes if you are a Star Trek fan and no if you are looking for a casual MMO with no pay wall. Yes I know nearly 800 hours in game… But there is no way anyone can play all aspects of this game,  getting 5 Toons (characters) to level 60, have full reputation, end game gear and all R&D at level 15 in less than 500. Unless you pay a boat load of cash and even then there are things that are behind time gates to max out all your crafting will take 4-6 months minimum.   Pro'sThe lore and story are really damn good and the major saving grace of this game. If you are a Star Trek Fan then you will love this, as it takes all cannon and moves on with it in its own universe. Introducing enemas new and old from all over the franchise. you can also play it your own way want to load your ship up with different colours of weapons and look like a happy rainbow of death then go for it. Want to be the next Picard and try to be diplomatic about things than strap your Toon into a Galaxy class, say♥♥♥♥♥♥in French and go bring peace to the cosmos. Space battles are well done and you will in the early stages have to think about how you approach things even more do on the elite difficulty with friends. Most of the story can be played with friends as a co-op.Graphics are starting to show there age but are still quite pretty.  Ship detail is very good.   Customization is a big strength from clothing to ship paint to various bumpy heads you can change it all including making your toon a midget with a hightist attitude. cons. PVP: let’s get this out of the way PVP is essentially dead in this game and is more between friends than fleets(Clans guilds). The PVP system in game is in major need of an overhaul.Bugs such as doing an episode (Quest) with friends only to have the game say. “Oh no you didn’t and you were never there.”  Beaming into solid objects, Reset to Boff (Bridge duty officer) powers. Yep those are important but hay it’s just to make getting that first place all the more difficult as your team gets murdered when you are scrambling to rest them so that you can helpCamera angle resets at the most inopportune moments, lagrubberbanding ""Boldly going to where you have already been""  can at times be rife.While you can put in a ticket to report bugs as I have many times… Do not expect there to be anything done about it unless it is extremely bad. Lag and banding  are normally felt if an instance has more than 35 persons in it or if your ping is above 90. Before you ask it is not my PC or internet connection my PC being an I7 4770K@4Ghz 32GB ram and 2 R9 280's  and the game is on an SSD the internet connection I have is 50Mb down and 3Mb up  and they system is kept very clean.combat in general is all pew pew pew.Lack of Cryptic love for the science class. Seriously Cryptic treat that class like the creepy uncle your parents told you to stay away from. Other elements. Community. For a game that has little to no official community managers, The games community For the most part are welcoming and helpful with just the few elitist or idiots that blame the noob for their own misgivings Chat is normally quite active and some are always willing to help if you get stuck. There is a forum reddit and various online tools to help with the game. In game currency is split into four parts. Energy credits EC (main), Dilithium, Lobie crystals and Gold Pressed Latnum (GPL).EC can buy you almost anything from ships to weapons but the game suffers from greed a hell of a lot so it may take you time to get what you need with some items costing in the hundreds of million range. There is also a 10.000.000 EC cap on the free to play characters. Dilithium is your life blood for R&D it is needed to upgrade weapons with good procs hoard that pink crap as much as you can and never spend it to get out of a time gate. Lobie is used for some nice to have not need to have consoles and is gained from opening lockboxes.GPL is pointless and not really needed. Is the game pay to win. In the strictest manner no not realistically unless you have more money than sense $5 would get you one fleet module that will sell for about 10-15 mil EC on the exchange one epic beam bank with the best procs will sell for about 100 mil and you would need 8 of them . Cannot buy power or your way to the top of the DPS tree unless you spend a hell of a lot it is easier to grind out than to spend. Ah but what about tier 6 (T6) ships.  Aren’t they more powerful. “NO”  It is the weapons, consoles and the person’s ability to pilot their ship other way around I have in PVP taken down T6 ships with a T4 free ship a T4 is viable at end game so long as you have a dps of over 10,000 you would not hamper your team. Anyway the game is free to play so give it a go just don’t spend cash unless you really want to   "

												First things first, don't let my play time fool you.  I've been a player of Star Trek Online for about 5 years now and I gotta say; it's not getting any better.  That said, let's start out with the good...(TLDR At Bottom)You can't talk about a Star Trek game without talking about immersion.   This game does draw you in and make you feel like you're a part of the 24th century universe that began with Christopher Pike and continued for decades after.  You feel like you’re a  part of an ever growing galaxy, doing missions to better the life of those around you.  That said, it’s only good immersion for one pass through.  Starting a second character on the same faction finds you instantly bored and upset with having to perform the same exact story over again.  Thankfully there is more than one race, which means more than one story.  If you want to stay the same race though, just take a different route (Assault/Science/Engineering) you’ll find yourself performing the same story over and over again.  In addition, the additional content that is added after the 3 main storylines is pretty much identical no matter what race you are.  Thus, you only get one playthrough of the additional content before you're repeating it with your other races. Anyway, back to the good stuff…Sound and graphics are well done in this game.  Arguably the best Star Trek experience yet.  Game play adds to that experience as well.  Large ships, while having more firepower and armor, actually feel bulky and slow while smaller ships are much faster and more maneuverable.  You have to customize your equipment/ship to the style you play or you’ll quickly find yourself in a lot of trouble when an enemy race locks its weapons on you.  There are also a HUGE array of ships you can use, of all classes and sizes, bringing a high level of variety, sort of...Now let’s get to the bad.  This game is distributed by Perfect World.  That means the game is free, but not really.  The game has been slowly converted from a very balanced system to what exists today, a heavy “pay to win” system.  The best ships are only really available on the marketplace and every new ship has a higher price than the last newest ship.  Now, I’m not going to say I haven’t purchased my share of ships, because I have.  But it gets extremely frustrating when a ship you paid good money for is suddenly made inferior by the next ship released, with that ship then being made inferior by the next, and so on, and so on, and so on.  This has quickly become the biggest money grab in the history of MMO’s.Today, if you want the latest collection of “Tier 6” starships (9 in total) you’ll have to fork out 12000 Zen (the store currency) for the bundle, which equals around $130 of real cash.  Believe it or not, that’s actually a deal!  Buying just the tripple bundle for a specific race costs 6000 Zen ($70, roughly).  Buying each ship individually for 3000 Zen would be an astronomical $315!  For virtual ships in a game where said ship will probably be inferior in less than a couple months, that’s a lot.In all honesty, the pay-to-win scheme has literally destroyed this game.  On top of all the crap available in the market, which includes inventory expansions, expanded ship storage, upgrades, clothing, bridge layouts, shuttles, and so on, you start to hate looting ships/people because of all the drop boxes you’ll collect.  Of course, the drop boxes are locked and require you to purchase keys (from the market) to unlock them.  I remember, at one time, having my inventory filled with nothing but drop boxes.  Like an idiot I paid for about 30 keys (can't remember the cost, but it wasn't cheap) and got what I expected.  The boxes either had absolute junk or items that would become useless within a very short time.  There was always a very rare chance of getting a starship in a drop box, but I never did.  That said, I've heard of people spending hundreds of dollars on keys just to get those rare ships.  (Maybe Perfect World isn't stupid, because people are)  After my 30 keys were used I started dumping the drop boxes in the garbage, as selling them on the auction is totally useless.  Trust me, if you go to the auction and type in the name of any drop box you’ll have no less than 50 pages of already existing auctions at stupid low prices.Some players might argue that you can trade in-game dilithium for Zen, and it’s true.  That said, all this has done is pushed the cost of the items in the marketplace higher.  In addition, you can only convert so much dilithium every day, and the exchange doesn’t guarantee how much your dilithium is actually worth.  Honestly, it’s worse than gold farming in other MMO’s.  Not worth the time or effort you’ll have to put into it.TLDR :  So, do I recommend this game?  Absolutely not.  The pay-to-win scheme has pretty much destroyed this game and the massive amount of drop boxes you’ll end up looting will annoy the hell out of you.  It’s got a fairly good story, which continues to expand, but the game just feels like a Ferengi designed it.  So no, I don’t recommend it.  Why then is my play time is as high as it is?  Not really because I enjoy the game.  I was one of the saps who got suckered early into sinking money into this P2W pit of decay, before we saw it for what it was, and I wanna be sure I get my money’s worth before the final nail goes in the coffin... That's why.			"

												I have to say this game has really taken a turn for the worse in the last few years. It feels uninspired nowadays, with everything that comes out just more pay-to-win type stuff. What's worse is the lockbox system, which I vehemetly opposed when it was first introduced a few years back.I've been playing since closed beta. I've logged quite a few hours over a long span of time. Going FTP promised us so much, and for awhile, things were good. For a brief, brief time.Now, this game is just a giant grind. It's not even fun; just repetitive and uinteresting. And that's so sad to me, becuase I love Star Trek so very very much.Perhaps most disappointing is how bad DS9 still looks. After so many years since launch, they still haven't gotten right the one setpiece I love the absolute most in all of Star Trek. Seriously, they dolled up ESD and added Utopia Planetia and a bunch of other stuff, but still haven't fixed DS9. ""But HEY! There's a bunch of crappy new wannabe Star Trek ships to buy! OOO shiny!""STO is one of those games I now just load to see what's new, jump around a little bit on any of my 20+ Vice Admirals, and then quietly delete the game files.Star Trek fans deserve a better game. Save yourself the trouble. The only thing that's Star Trek about this game is the title.			"

												If you intend to get one or two characters to 60 simply to expirience the story get right ahead but if you intend to get decent gear in order to face off in pvp events then turn around right NOW! this game has no pvp any more.  This game is nothing more than grinding up gear by playing the same groups of missions every day simply to prepare for the next set of missions for which you have to grind endlssly.  THERE IS NO POINT ANYMORE.  Yes the the story is decent and the voice acting is neat getting to hear the actual actors from various star trek series such as voyager and the next generation come back to voice there roles here but other than that this game has  nothing. People need to stop handing moey to cryptic for recyclign old ship designs and making them into a new tier.  I see no point of adding a sixth tier of star ships except for them to make a huge prophet.  I cant believe I'm saying this but The Farengi could learn a thing or two from the guys down at cryptic.

												Space.The final cash grab.These are the voyages of the starship ~xX ElItEgAmEr420 Xx~  It's continuing mission; to explore new cash avenues and exploit them.  To seek out your wallet and remove the benjamins.  To boldy crush cannon like no one has before.Update 2/2/15: The above was originally posted almost 2 years ago.  Anyway...I still don't like the cash shop, or the lock box of the month, but I can't deny this time vampire has me somewhat interested again, but probably not for long.  The rewards for doing the missions seem less and less interesting as they divert all that good stuff to the in game rep or dilithium grind.For a now free to play game, it's not too bad all things considered.  Due to the way the player run economy works, you can grind for cash shop items by converting dilithium into in-store currency, so technically you don't have to pay a cent and still get access to everything in the store.  It'll just take a good long while.  It's a good skinner box like that.TL;DR: It has improved since I last played, but I'm still not recomending it.			"

												Let me start by saying that having played MMOs since they were a ""thing"", I HATE free to play games. They have single handedly ruined the MMO genre. Instead of buying the game like Guild Wars 1&2, or paying a monthly fee like WoW, it's considered totally normal now to be nickel and dimed to death while you play a shoddy bug ridden game until the developer abandons it to go make another WoW clone and start the process over again. It's even leached into the single player market with needign day one DLCs to play the damn games. All these free to plays should have stayed sub based with unending trials, free accounts limited in level and gear, or should have gone the buy to play route. Thats said, nothing I can do about it, the market is what it is, here is my review of STO:I've played this game off and on since launch, before it was on Steam and went free to play. It's gotten quite grindy at endgame, but what MMO isn't. You'll probably love this game if you like Star Trek. Ground game is decent, ship combat is a lot of fun. Character creation is very good also, as per any Cryptic game, play as any of the iconic races or an alien of your own creation.Very fair free to play model also, imho one of the fairest. Expansions are all free. Everything in the cash shop can be earned ingame with time. The cash shop consists of mostly cosmetic items, along with ships for every tier, and quality of life upgrades, such as inventory and bank space. The only must buy item would probably be a tier 6 ship for endgame. Up until then, you get a free ship every ten levels. I only say must buy because you will hit max level long before you have saved up enough to buy it for free.They do go on sale, and the in cash shop currecy ""ZEN"" will go on sale once in a while also. But, you can wait and save dilithium, the main ingame currency, for a few months and trade it for ZEN to buy a ship. Why not wait til a sale, drop 20 on the game, and buy a ship and a costume? You've paid more for games that only provided 20 hours of gameplay I'm sure, and the developers really do deserve money for their work. Now, about the pay to win calls claims from people..Yes, it works the other way and you can also trade ZEN for dilitium, which is used in upgrading your gear. It's less ""buying"" gear, and more about speeding up the upgrade process. The thing is, it's not required. You can do all endgame with the highest available MK gear without upgrading it. It makes it so you can do daily mission and reputation grinds a little faster on alts and it makes your wee-wee feel bigger. But really, why spend real money so you can upgrade all your gear to max, skipping most of the game, to then cry you have nothing to do in game? The grind is there for a reason. Don't like the grind? Maybe you should rethink playing MMOs.Call it pay to win if you want, To me, pay to win is paying cash to obtain items that can't be earned in game, or buyign gear that is locked behind raid progression. That's not the case here, but whatever. If you think speeding up what is basicly crafting pay to win, I will never be able to change your mind. Stay away from the game.I think there should always be something you have to pay for in a free to play game. See the games that try to be super fair and only put comsmetic stuff in thier cash shops? They are either suffering from no income or already dead, because if people don't have to pay, most will not pay. Since when does free to play mean free to access all content anyway? Why would a company make a game and then expect nothign in return? Yet, when they do want something in return of thier product, they are villianized by cheap spoiled children. If that offends you, stay away from the game.8/10, Probably a 7/10 for non Trek fans, but it's free, so at least try it. Only game I know with ship to ship space combat that isn't Eve.			"

Posted: July 31, 2016
This review is a thorough and comprehensive breakdown of what is in Star Trek Online. I fully expect it may make some want to play the game, even though my personal opinion is negative. I explain this in the conclusion.An Overview of Star Trek OnlineStar Trek Online (STO) is an MMO set in the Star Trek Universe created by Gene Roddenberry. This is the universe that started with Star Trek: The Original Series back in the 1960s and included The Next Generation as well as many more TV series and movies. This is NOT the Star Trek from the 2009 movie, Star Trek: Into Darkness, and Star Trek: Beyond.tl;drYou thought I would just put it here and let you skip my whole thought out review? The NERVE. JK: it's at the bottom if you really don't want to read this.The Story GameplayYour character, which you can go to extensive lengths to customize (more on that later), begins as an acting officer aboard a vessel. Almost immediately, they will become the captain due to an unfortunate series of events. From this point forward, you take permanent command of the vessel and complete missions which unfold into a story. Each season of missions covers a new storyline. This part of the game is what I found most enjoyable.The MMO ExperiencePut simply, there is little in terms of actual MMO gameplay. You fly around at warp and can see other player-controlled ships flying by on their way to other destinations. In addition to that, there are PvE events which you have a fairly decent chance of filling up the mission queue to get it to start. But PvP is ABSOLUTELY DEAD. In all my hours of playing STO, I've never EVER been able to engage a PvP event because no one wants to play (and to be honest, the controls aren't exactly good for making this a PvP game anyway). And as far a co-oping missions, if there is a way to do it, no one told me. The missions, story or daily, seem to all be single player only.Character Creation/CustomizationBoth when you first create your character and any time you're at a starbase, you'll have the opportunity to modify your character's outfit and appearance with an amazing amount of freedom. Pick from dozens of outfits (less if you don't spend ZEN on them) and use any color scheme you want to (Just a recommendation: make your character an ALIEN. By doing so, you'll be able to give your character almost any features from any race you want, other than a cat tail, and you can much more drastically alter your character's appearance later on.). Also, not only can you modify your own captain, you can also modify the appearance of any of your bridge officers.The ship customization is also surprisingly liberal (no, not the political orientation). Your ship typically be configurable with parts from at least three classes of starship, allowing you to make starship combinations that never existed in movies or on the wiki. In addition, you can choose what type of windows you want, as well as painting your ship with a variety of decals, in the colors of your choice (though only some of the decals are actually good, and only on some ship classes).The Progression SystemAs you complete more missions, you'll earn experience points that help you rank up and acquire bigger and better ships. At every 10th level (at least up to 50) you earn a free ship of the next tier, in any one of the three ship classes. However, to claim each bigger and better ship, you'll need an open ship slot. If you don't have any, you'll have to give up one of your smaller ships for it, and unless you bought it with ZEN Tokens, you'll have to pay to get it back.The Currency(ies)Energy CreditsAt the start of your Star Fleet career (or Klingon or Romulan career), your missions will all award you in Energy Credits (EC). These are useful for buying basic upgrades for starships, low level healing kits, and basic weapons. Because of the upgrades you'll either collect as loot or be awarded for completing missions, this means that you'll rarely spend any EC outside of the Exchange, what you use to sell items to other players. In addition, they are also used to pay for appearance changes (to player and starship) that don't require the use of ZEN Tokens. These latter uses are what most of your EC will be spent on.DilithiumThis will be what you both loathe and need during most of your STO gameplay. Dilithium crystals (DC) are the currency that is not only used for purchasing most starships, but also for fleet projects, purchasing ZEN on the Dilithium Exchance (DEx). As a result, you'll always be somewhat short on the stuff. However, you cannot get  DC directly. Instead, you complete missions which award you Dilithium Ore (DO) that then has to be refined to DC. It occurs at a 1:1 ratio, but you can only convert a maximum of 8000 per day. In addition, the missions you can complete to earn DO are long, tedious, and low reward. It's difficult to even hit the maximum-refined-per-day. This is where the DEx comes into play. Some players will pay with real cash to get ZEN, then sell that ZEN on the DEx to get DC directly, with no daily limits and very little waiting.ZEN TokensThe paid, real-world based curency of STO, this annyoing gold coin is necessary to buy some higher tier items in STO. These include the refit and retrofit starship variants, as well as ALL Tier 6 starships and most small craft (except the Danube Runabout). As with all real-world-based currencies, ZEN is cheaper per-unit as you buy in larger amounts. However, by using the DEx, you can obtain ZEN without ever spending a penny on this game; it'll just take a long time. This is to do with how much grinding it takes to earn DO. It also doesn't help that the price of ZEN on the DEx is always increasing, since there's always more demand than supply. When I started playing STO, the exchange rate was around 80 DC per ZEN. Now, it's at 400 DC per ZEN, and it's only going to get higher. That said, if you can take advantage of a slow period of buying in the market, you can get ZEN a little cheaper and turn it around for a profit of DC. It'll only be a minor victory though, since you'll always want more. More for more character slots, more ship slots, more advanced ships, a character rename, a cool outfit, The Original Series ships and outfits, ... I think you get the idea. No matter how much ZEN you earn through the exchange, you'll have to buy some with cash at some point if you want to buy more than one or two things with ZEN during your STO career.ReputationThis one is the most confusing and the last to worry about. Once you reach Level 50, you'll be able to take part in reputation missions for a variety of factions, including New Romulus, the Dyson Joint Command, and the Delta Alliance. These missions will give you Reputation Marks (RM) that you can use on projects for that specific faction. On completion of the missions, you will earn Reputation Points (RP) that can be spent in combination with DC on highly advanced equipment. There is also a similar system for Fleet advancement, but Fleet projects can be contributed to by anyone in the fleet, and only started by high ranking members.FleetsThe closest thing to a community or faction this game has, fleets are groups you join for a few small benefits. You get another daily mission, and when the fleet is big enough, access to another dilithium mine (and DO mission) which you can transwarp to from the fleet's starbase. If there's more to fleets than that and the projects, I never experienced it.Conclusion/TL;DRIf you just want to play this game for the single-player story missions, go for it. I enjoyed the story. For a fun multiplayer MMO experience, I'm sorry. It's not here, and that's why I don't recommend this game.Fun Fact: Character Limit -->			"

It has it's ups and downs, but overall, this game is stellar (forgive the pun), and can be an awesome way to spend several hours of your day.

I flew with one of the game's top pvp fleets (Sad Pandas) for a long time and now can't stand to even keep it installed because glitches, one-shot-kill weapons, pay-to-win powercreep and the developer's blatent disinterest in creating deep balanced gameplay in lieu of the latest cash shop money grab have sucked all fun from it.

												It begins as a great game if you're a Trek fan, but unless you're willing to grind obscene amounts of Dilithium to convert to Zen, or just buy Zen from PWE, you're eventually going to hit a brick wall where progression pretty much stops.  I can confidently say that a good 80% of the ships in the game, the best Bridge Officers and Duty Officers (the former of which, no joke, are where most of your real power comes from) are only available through Zen or lockboxes.  Even if you get the Fleet version of a C-store ship, you won't get the special consoles or abilities that make that particular ship type good.While it's possible to purchase some ships on the Exchange, the fact that you have a cap of 10 million energy credits ensures that you're going to have to pay Zen to lift that cap if you want to purchase any of them.  Only the cheapest ships on the Exchange won't set you back more than ten mil, and most typically run into the 9-digit range.  You either get a ship with good bridge officer seating and either the durability to withstand an entire squad of enemies shooting at it, or the firepower to obliterate enemies before they can deal appreciable damage, or you're eventually going to hit a brick wall where you won't be able to damage enemy Cruisers and Battlecruisers faster than they can self-heal, or you're going to get obliterated by science vessels, which have abilities that can either damage your hull underneath your shields or just delete your shields entirely.The game looks good for its age, and I have few faults with its storywriting (most of it's faithful enough to the source material that only the most discriminating Trek fanboy will find fault with it), but it's so heavily over-monetized that it will get frustrating unless you're willing to pay.  I run by the old adage - ""If it ain't worth playing through, it ain't worth paying for"" and boy is that ever true here.			"

												Do you like star trek? do you like exploring the galaxy in your starship? discovering new species? settling diplomatic disputes? well than this is not the game for you!First a recount of my latest encounter with this games support:After playing this game for years and having beyond hundreds of hours into it, a glitch in the game deleted one of my ships and with it all of my gear, after contacting support and going back and forth for several days they ultimately told me there was nothing they were willing to do to help me... nothing at all.The bottom line is this is a dying MMO with nearly no effort put into it, there is NOTHING to do in the end game, which will only take you about a weekend to reach max level. The whole game should just be put out of its misery and cryptic should learn how to \ re-evaluate how the currently treat the long term players and supports of this game, especially that still pay money to play a free to play game... They are an inept company that doesn't care about its customers If they didn't have the star trek IP they would have gone out of business when Atari dumped them and part of me wishes they had...The game play is weak, pretty much all you have to do is spam the space bar until you win, the writing and acting in the game are some of the worst i have ever seen, almost every ""new"" mission involves either time travel, and let me sum up ALL of the games story lines in one phrase - ""The iconians did it"" - This hardly mentioned in the show race is apparently responsible for every single event that has ever happened in the galaxy and has become Cryptic's all purpose excuse for poor writing and zero imagination every story line just leads back to an : it was the iconians moment...There is nothing that makes Star Trek so wonderful and enjoyable in this game, no interactions with crew members, no dramatic writing, no exciting moments, no diplomatic responses to anything... simply power up shields - hit the space bar and pew pew to victory...I think my time with STO has come to an end, I recommend if you are a current player you get out before what happened to me happens to you and if your considering playing it please don't, or at the very least don't give them a single penny of your hard earned money it isn't worth it and Cryptic/Perfect world simply doesn't care about any of their players and sadly I don't think they ever will.

												Every gamer has ""The game"" that they play. To some, it's COD. To some, it's Minecraft. To me, it's this game. This is one of the few games I was dedicated to  playing even before I got steam.  When a glitch occured that stopped steam from realizing I was playing STO through it, I didn't play any other game until i solved the issue.  I've spent more than twice the time on this game than my second most played game. I've spent literally more money in this single game than the rest of my steam library, and I'm willing to spend much more.  However, what made it be my favorite game if all time? Well first of all, it aged very well for me. There were of course times where I took breaks to play other games, but no other game had me come crawling back as quick or kept me around for as long. Content is always coming out whether it be the actual developers producing a new episode or event to keep me occupied, or the immense community that is constantly pumping out new and custom-made missions, some of which last for over an hour and some that have an entire series to be played.  There's also so many different ways to play the game. You can craft any career to do practically anything within the game's limits, and I've over 20 characters in the game, each with their own unique build, or at least their own unique twist on one. And the cahracter customization's the greatest I've ever seen in my life. Over 20 different species, spread over 3.5 factions and each species having their own unique ingame traits and character design options.  There's even an option to create your own unique species, if you want to take the time to do so.  Another thing that's kept me around for a long time is the Roleplay Aspect.  While this is more personal subjectivity, Not a lot of games I've played give the freedom and room to create your own entire roleplay series, which me and a few friends have taken as much advantage of as we can.  Of course, this'll only apply if you wanted to roleplay.  Another great thing about it is that the game is completely free and not at all pay-to-win.  You're given full access to all the story and gear, and if you had enough time and resources, you could theoretically buy everything that would normally be bought with actual money through ingame currency alone.  The stuff you DO buy with real cash however can be costly, however I never regretted a purchase I've made in this game (Probably only because I'm dedicated like hell) The game's also been pretty faithful to the official Star Trek universe, so much so that the developers have brought in actual actors from the series to voice their respective characters in game, Including the legendary (R.I.P) Leonard Nimoy. The gameplay is also something I've always enjoyed. While a lot of my friends jopke about the ground combat, I didn't have any trouble with it personally. For the SPACE COMBAT however, it's been universally praised as engaging and loads of fun, which is something I have to agree with 100%Ultimately though, most of the content is only subjectively good, and this is all about Star Trek.  If you don't care for the series,i can't say whether or not you'll like the game, This is because despite actually having a lot of content from the Star Trek universe (Including many of the actual actors reprising their roles) This game doesn't entirely follow the core ideas of Star Trek.I've always been a huge fan of Sci-fi in general, so if you're a general fan like me I'd say it's at least worth a try. it's completely free to download and play through, No story or gameplay is locked behind any paywall, only gear and stuff to either extend your immersion or improve your gameplay.  Again, i'd say it's at least worth a try, you've got nothing to loose, and so much to gain if you find it enjoying.			"

												Once upon a time (~2010-ish), there were two Sci-Fi MMORPGs.  One merely had a ""rough"" start - that was Star Wars: The Old Republic.Star Trek Online is an MMO with a few very interesting ideas, that could be so much more than it is.  First, it's the only MMO I've seen with a level editor.  Second, it takes the idea of character customization to its logical extreme.  Lastly, it's set within a very rich universe.Why am I not thumbs-upping this game?What WorksFirst, customization.  Your ship can be absolutely yours, from the outer hull to the bridge itself.  You can be yours, in that you have 'a few' customization options for your Captain.  Lastly, your bridge bunnies have the same degree of customization that you do.  Want a 2410-version of a battlecruiser with bridge bunnies in TOS miniskirts?  Doable!This game has combat at two levels - ship-to-ship combat  and ground combat.  This is something that, again, I've never seen in an MMORPG, and combat at both levels feels reasonably good.  It's a shame the downsides so outweigh this.While the writing is questionable (this is Star Trek, after all), the missions are more than manageable, and are usually set up to be about the length of a TV episode (and, the official quests more or less fit the TV episode format in some ways.)  In this way, you *can* just set aside 45m-1h for a mission, and walk away satisfied.  Time-boxing in an MMO is something I've - again - never seen before, and like.What Doesn't WorkMicrotransaction.  God, oh God, the microtransactions.  This is the poster child of an Allegedly Free Game.  Sure, you cna download it for free, patch for free, but to have anything resembling the ability to be competitive, you'd better be willing to shell out real money.  Certain buy-only ships have special consoles (sort of like Trinkets in World of Warcraft) that can be equipped on other ships, but have to be de-equipped from the bought ship, first.'But...you can make Zen in-game by exchanging refined dilithium!' You can't make Zen in a reasonable amount of time.  On 4 June, 1 Zen exchanged for 380 Refined Dilithium.  Lowbie ships are 500 Zen, better ships can be 1500 or 3000.  Using that rate, 380 * 500 = 190,000 Refined Dilithium.  Now, sounds good, right?  Just a lot of grinding?  ...That would be too easy.  There's an artificial limit on the amount of dilithium you can refine - 8,000 Dilithium per day.  190,000 (for our lowbie ship) / 8,000 = 23.75 days.  For that newbie ship.  I would define 3 days to 1 week as reasonable for a low end ship, 1 week to 2 weeks as reasonable for a high end ship, and a bleeding-edge ship as being able to be sorted within 2 weeks to one month.Missions.  This game tries to make you feel like you're free to explore, and you (sort of) are...but your freedom only goes so far.  There's a number of missions where you cannot see through obvious deceptions (yes, the Ambassador really is an Undine infiltrator, and it's not subtle) or make otherwise reasonable decisions.  ""But Thou Must!"" is very much in play in this game.  If you want to be a Dangerously Genre Savvy Captain, look elsewhere.Ship selection is another sticking point for me.  If you're Federation, you're fine.  If you're KDF, you're sort of OK for ship selection.  Romulans can just go screw themselves, unless you want to pay out to buy a Federation or KDF ship instead.  The balance of selections is pretty lopsided to the point where I can only conclude you're intended to actually play Federation, regardless of Empire choices.This game is all about the grinding.  If you absolutely must play, join during an XP boosted weekend, to rocket through as much of the early grind as possible.  It won't save you from the mid-to-late game grind, or worse, the Admiralty grinds...but it's something.I love PvP and more or less stopped when it became apparent that the developers share neither my love, nor the interest in keeping PvP interesting.  The game is set up so that there's only really one PvP build per ship, and even then that exists within a very strictly controlled overall strategy.The TL;DRNo.  Just no.  Not recommended, I award Cryptic/Perfect World no points, and may God have mercy on their souls.  This could be an awesome game...but it's just not.  I once compared StarMade, a game with some seriously bad design decisions, to this one, but I wound up taking it back and apologizing, because comparing nearly anything else to this is unnecessarily harsh, and not at all different from saying highly unflattering things about all of a persons' female relations.I would like to not only decry this game, but call upon the indie community to give us a game based loosely on Star Trek, maybe an MMO, that does what this game sets out to do, better than this.  This game is the example of how not to do a game set in space, whatever good points it has.			"

												So I've given STO the old college try and have come to the conclusion that, while I personally enjoy it, I just can't recommend it in good faith to most people. I love Star Trek and that's one of the reason I've played it this long and will likely continue on and off in the future. That and I've learned to tolerate the poor ground combat and some of the game's other weak areas and there are a lot of weak areas.  However it's not all bad. Some of the few good things include:- Star Trek setting and lore- Starship combat- Starship look really good- Voice acting (Where it's included. Most quests aren't voiced)- Character customizationThe bad is most everything else. Very poor ground combat, poor quest design, currency grinding, clunky interface, ugly ground textures and dated special effects accentuated by a patch work of development suggesting a lack of resources and focus. There's also an extremely heavy emphasis on paid content and little attention given to free and pre-existing content that needs work.However despite all that the game is free. If you like Star Trek, if you like Space ship combat then maybe give this game a try if only because it will cost you nothing to do so. Maybe you'll be able to overlook the bad for a while and get some fun out of it. I know I did, maybe you will too.			"

												Ground combat is ♥♥♥♥ing boring, the whole crafting dynamic sucks, you need to pay to be competitive in PvP.That being said, if you're like me, and you want to fly around in starships in the Trek universe and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, I fully recommend this game. Don't buy it to have a great MMORPG experience, buy it to have some fun playing around in starships and mentally reenacting your favorite episodes.Personal advice: don't spend money on this game, just level up until you get the starship you want (for me it was the Sovereign-Class cruiser), play around for a bit, and just quit whenever you start feeling bored. Rinse and repeat if you want to try out different factions/classes.			"

												Having played this game since release. I can honestly say this is the worst is has ever been.I'll keep this simple by making a list of the good and bad.Good-1) Great story, the production quality of the missions has grown since the walls of text in 2010.2) Graphics, the game still looks good even after so long. Consistant updates to the engine have only just started but the improvement is very noticable.3) Largely free-building. There is no class locking, anyone can fly anything (Even if there is only really one class worth using)4) The galaxy map has been combined, even if the instances are now huge and still only have 75 people in them.5) Space combat can be fun, ground combat isn't to bad.Bad-1) Aging engine, graphics aside, expect some serious graphics lag as the old 32bit engine can't deal with the huge particle effects.2) No game play veriety, tanks and crowd control are not in the slightest uway useful, the game is fully focused on DPS. If you like playing a tank or healer, there is no place for you here.3) Class balancing, there is really only one class, Tactical. Science officers are ok, engineers no use for you here, tanking is easily done on a ship, the class is redundant.4) Toxic community and devs, from the dev team that had is public relations person call all PvP'ers '14 year olds in thier mums basement'.5) No end game content aside from repeating grinds.6) Almost literally no PvP content.7) Bugs, Bugs, Bugs and more bugs.8) Wallet warrior friendly, the game used to allow people to earn ingame curreny and convert it to money to use in micro-transactions. To fix that they just made it cost hundreds of thousands of ingame currency with a cap of 8,000 per day.9) Money grubbing, lockboxes, promotional events, speeding up crafting, speeding up skilling. Everything could be done with real money.To sum it up. STO was a gem, it required skill, you needed to really know what you were doing, work as a team. Now its a laggy, spammy, unbalanced mess, and I would not recommend it to anyone.Let this game die people, that way CBS can give the IP to a competent dev team that isn't being ruled by it's asian money grabbing overlords.

												Generally speaking, this game had the potential to be a great Star Trek game.  Sadly, the studio that developes and runs it has turned out to be profit centric to the point of ignoring things like constant spamming by asian players in chat asking you to pay them money for in game currency (which you can't block out until they've spammed you), server disconnects that are rampant (7-12 times per day on average), content that either is tempermental or flat out doesn't work, fleet options that seem to get broken after every other update and content push (which defeats the purpose of having a fleet), etc...Having put nearly 100 hours into the game itself, I'll admit that aspects of it are quite fun but over the years the quality of the game has been declining.  What I find interesting is that again, this game could be fantastic if it was supported and maintained better.  Sadly, it doesn't seem like this is the goal of the developement team.  I suppose when they had the opportunity to do more as a pay to play format, they did what many of the smaller developers do and soaked up profits while neglecting their product.  In the end, what we have is a game that is more of a tease than a pleasure.I'll continue to play for now simply because the game isn't completely broken, but I would STRONGLY advise any new players to NOT spend any real cash on this game.  If the developement team would be willing to fix outstanding bugs, content and servers, I would consider revisiting this review and possibly stating that paying for it would be worth it, but as it stands I simply can not encourage anyone to spend their money on this game.I would caution anyone from complaining on the actual cryptic forums as they have been known to ban people for posting negative reviews on their forum.  If you're going to post anything against them, I would recommend doing it here since Steam isn't beholden to Cryptic studios.			"

												In my experience, a solid 7/10.Star Trek Online is a pretty damn solid MMO, especially if you're a Sci-Fi fan like me. Its combat is pretty good (especially the space combat which is fantastic and could almost be counted as one of the game's best features, in my opinion), the character customization options are also pretty good (especially for Federation players who get a metric ton of playable races to choose from ranging from Vulcans and Humans to the parasitic Trill and the warlike Andorians and telepathic Betazoid). You can even customize your star ships! Many (if not most) of the available ships have alternate parts you can use to replace the default stock parts (ex. all the Federation ships I can think of have alternate engines and saucer sections you can choose from) and different paint-jobs you can apply to further differentiate yourself from other players. You also custom-name every ship you acquire (Federation players can even give their ships their own custom-made registry numbers [ex. the Enterprise's registry number is NCC 1701]).A lot of reviews will highlight the number of microtransactions in the game, but I think they blow it way out of proportion. Does STO contain microtransactions? Yes. A few of the cooler ships available in-game are behind a microtransaction paywall (ex. the Federation Constitution-class is a replica of the original Enterprise and is available for a fee), however, the vast majority of the most powerful vessels in STO cannot be purchased via microtransaction.Are there better MMOs out there? Certainly. But this is, by far, the best Sci-Fi MMO I've ever played. STO's free-to-play model is fair to those who pass on microtransactions but accomodates players who don't mind shelling-out some cash to gain access to some of the ritzier playable races, outfits, ships, and bridge layouts.I highly recommend Star Trek Online to any fellow Trekkies out there who're looking for a decent Sci-Fi MMO since you get to rub-shoulders with awesome characters like Spock, Worf, Sela, Seven-of-Nine, and Tasha Yarr. There are even a few instances where you'll fight allongside iconic ships like Voyager, Defiant, and at least three different Enterprises!If you're a Trekkie, give it a whirl and I don't think you'll be dissapointed.

												An amazing game all considered!To me it's just incredible to see how much it has grown and improved since three years ago when I started playing. It has it's defects, I won't lie to you. But it's definitely the most original mmo experience I've ever had, the most vision inspired and honest endevour!There's plenty to do, space combat is great, complex and exciting. As are the mechanics of gameplay, in general. Ground combat is ok, but improvents are constantly in development. Also, to be honest, pvp play falls a bit short at the moment, even though after just a first match you can realize that there's huge potential, and the community around pvp is remarkable (they even started an open school!). Gameplay is very story-driven, and most of the narrative inside it's absolute TOP NOTCH Star Trek fiction -they have brillian writers. It is, I think, the only place where new Trek episodes are being made at the moment. It's been showcased in many mmo rpg reviews and also won a ""best free to play"" title a year ago. If the game is not enough for you, and if you feel like it, there's an integrated editor called ""The Foundry"" where every player can create their own episodes (=quests, pve campaigns), and upload them into the game for everybody to play, review and vote (there's a periodic competition with prizes for the winner)! The content is limitless! What else can I say... I just loved it from day one and I will keep playing it, as I know Cryptic is committed and passionate about making it a little better every day!Just try it out and decide for yourselves, it's free to play for crying out loud!! :DLive long and prosper!

												I love Trek, and I loved this game for a long time. I played this game OBSESSIVELY from launch until not too long ago (not all through Steam). The devs need to grow a pair and balance this game. If the bottom line is all that matters, and it's making money, then good luck to them, but it's no longer for me.First time around, the stories are interesting and quite fun to play, and if you're into it, then some of the player created missions in-game a fun too, but that's all solo stuff, and the devs WILL find ways to make even the newest player play through ALL of them several times so that not even solo players can escape grinding.When it comes to anything you do with other people, it's a ridiculously REPETITIVE, and intolerably EASY grind fest. Sure, you need to know a little about the mechanics, but however good or bad you are at the game, you only really need two of the five players to know what they're doing, and there there might as well only be one end game mission in the game with random enemy spawn, as all the maps are essentially the same.With the addition of JJ stuff, and the rest of the frankly silly Agents of Yesterday expansion, I will never play this game ever again. GG Mr. Captain Lizard Man - You know who you are.You'll either love it and turn into an uber fanboy/girl for whom the devs can do no wrong, or you'll play it for a month, max out your first character and go play something else.Free to play? Yes, that I will give them. You pay to be impatient, not to win, and it is possible to get everything in the game (barring a few items that won't affect your competitiveness) without paying a cent. Be prepared to spend a long time grinding for it all though, or else start with a plan to have several characters in order to speed up the process. I can't fault the F2P model, as it is one of the more player friendly models I've seen, but end game is so utterly boring once you've done everything even a few times (you'll end up running several maps more than just 'a few times') that it's simply not worth investing the time in as once you do max up, there's a real sense of 'OK, what now?', to which the Devs answer seems to be 'Buy this new OP ship and make the end game stuff even easier' or 'Make a new character so you can enjoy all our solo content ALL over again'. There little to no PvP, and like I said above, a team of monkeys and one half decent player can tackle most of the end game content.And lastly, they talk in their trailers a lot about Exploration. It's total BS and there is literally nothing like that in the game. Let me repeat that. In a STAR TREK GAME, there is NO EXPLORATION element AT ALL.Meh. Big rant from a long standing, money spending player who is really disappointed with what this game has become.			"

												If you are a Star Trek fan and/or enjoy MMORPGs, you will really enjoy this game and may end up spending a lot of time here.The character customization is fantastic, I can lose myself trying to detail each member of my crew. The aesthetics are very good, although there may be some lag if you enter a high player-vs.-environment area. The lore is very good, and you can teleport down to countless planets and walk around, doing missions on the ground. There are vehicles too and the combat is pretty standard for an MMORPG. The grinding and item drops are reasonable, and you can grind HARD to get a good ship, but that will take A LOT of time.The coolest feature is when you deploy your squad into an enemy ship, however, I really wished it could be like Pirates of the Caribbean (the XBOX original, buggy gem) where you could take it over and use for your own, but you cannot (would take away from the grinding aspect of the game).There is a massive variety of missions, both in space and on the ground.The space battles can be very, very fun when you go into an area with a lot of activity. Watching an armada of ships trying to destroy a Borg cube can be intense and rewarding.Would definitely recommend giving it a chance if you were interested.Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												Just as enjoying the original series demands you forgive the rough edges and quirks, so too does STO. The graphics are generally outdated, the ground combat/movement is quite clunky, there is a bit of a  lack of compelling gameplay options for late game, the story delivery/UI is very outdated and limited, and there are many bugs and graphical glitches.BUT, the newer content, and ships in particular look quite beautiful, the space combat is fluid, intuitive, and rewards trying out different builds or ships (of which there are many), and there is a large amount of different gameplay aspects to focus on so that you're never stuck for something to do or tinker with.Generally though, it is quite a laid back MMO experience. STFs (STO's dungeons) reward you for playing well and completing optional objectives (meaning more marks for reputation/fleet), while giving you a base amount if your team can't complete their goal. The emphasis is placed on improving your performance and getting more rewards, rather than having players being locked behind a gear/skill wall they might struggle to get around. If you want to do your own thing without feeling compelled to group up to see all the game's content, you can do that, and if you want to min/max your builds to complete elite STFs, you can do that to.While this means that you won't get that euphoric rush that you might get from doing dungeons/raids in other games (wiping several times before fianlly downing the boss for example), it does mean you are always progressing. There is however a satisfaction in seeing your favorite ship and build strategy come together and improve in subsequent runs.Outside of the combat based gameplay, you have a lot of ""UI games"". Things like sending duty officers and your ships (great addition that might give you reason to fill your ship roster) on missions to gain xp/credits/crafting materials/equipment etc, as well as R&D to craft items. Finally, it is free to play but nearly every aspect of the game is affected by micro-transactions. The good news is that for the most part everything purchasable is either cosmetic (outfits/ships), for convenience(more bank slots/balance cap), or to decrease the grind (xp boosts/buy Dilithium). This means you can see all the game's mission/story content without spending a cent if you so desired, albeit in a slightly less powerful or exotic ship. As I said before though, given the nature of the game's content, this is adequate.It's free to play, so there's really no reason not to try it if you're half interested or a fan (you have to at least try some of the space combat).  Most importantly though, if you can handle some bugs and the archaic story mechanics you might find that you've found a bit of a diamond in the rough.			"

												Ill keep it short. Ive been playing more then the record time on my accout due to when I was first playing I was playing throught the games direct client etc. Anyway game is mostly free to play till about level 50 and then its harder to find free ships. If you use to paying 50 bucks for a game or even 30 you should have no problem buying a ship and flying it around. Ive seen some negative reviews but the reason i personally come back is I love star trek and the game is really the best thing we have as fans of the series to play with. Arc games has some.... Issues but there is alot of content to find in this game. Not as much as WOW or even Runescape in terms of size but more so custom ships and different builds. Ive been playing on and off for about 2, 3 years and you cant go wrong if you want to play the game. Have a open mind and just have fun. Heads up though if its your first time go with Tactical. The game focues more on DPS and choosing this class first with give you the best chance at knowning the game and having fun at first.			"

												After sinking the better part of my university career into this game i came to the conclussion that this game is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bar you go to with your friends. When your with friends its the best, the conversations with the fleet (guild) or random players kept me up late but when your there without your friends you realise its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bar. The PVP is dead or woefully unbalanced and despite the three ""classes"" (the three departments in starfleet, science, tactical and engineering) the holy trinity does not exist here. It is all about DPS numbers with all group PVE actions requiring high DPS to have a chance. The story up to end-game is enjoyable for both of the main factions (fed and klingon) and the sub-faction (romulan) but when you reach max level the game boils down to run the same mission over and over and over to gain currency to buy better gear to make the same mission easier to complete. There is no depth to this game beyond character creation (which is surprisngly robust) and it suffers from pay to win to an unbearable degree.			"

												If you have more than a passing interest in Star Trek, this MMO is worth trying out since it's free; you don't need to shell out any money to reach the level cap or to have fun while you level up. The F2P model feels fair since you can grind for the in-game currency that allows you to buy any ship or NPCs in the game. There is no paywall to speak of since as a completely F2P player I managed to get ships and equipment good enough to do endgame content.My favorite part of the game is building up the roster of capable Duty Officers that you can send on missions, just like what a real captain of a starship is expected to do. Your duty officers can even come back injured if the mission was particularly harrowing, and take time to heal in sickbay. Want to see Seven-of-Nine as a Bridge Officer on your own ship? You can do it in this game.So why did I stop playing? It's not the F2P nature of the game, which I still hold as a gold standard for F2P games. It's the lack of immersion which I crave for in games that finally drove me away. First and foremost, there is an insane number of loading screens. Moving from a room in my own ship to another room can result in a loading screen that can take up to a minute to load. Also, the art direction does not feel like Star Trek and the textures on some of the ship are very low resolution, such as my favorite ship in Star Trek, the Intrepid class. The new ships made just for STO did not feel like Star Trek. Other graphical infidelities kept grinding at me: the phasers on a starship do not fire out of the phaser strips, the bussard collectors are static, the ceiling is way too high inside a ship. And last but certainly not least, I have to pilot the ship myself all the time where a captain in Star Trek leaves the piloting to the helmsman. I signed on to play as a captain, not a helmsman. Immersion gone. I would return to the game if they fixed this but this is impossible without a total rewrite of the game, which will never happen. Perhaps in the next Star Trek MMO we will have a more immersive experience, but don't write off this one just because it's not perfect. It's a great experience while you level up and enjoy the stories in the missions, all without spending a single cent.			"

												I'm a Trekkie, always have been, always will be. Star Trek Online seemed like it was going to be the be-all and end-all of Star Trek games. For the longest time, I believed this to be true...I deeply regret that it has taken me over 1000 hours of gameplay and several hundred dollars to come to the conclusion that this game blows. It is a poorly ""slapped together"", savage abomination of an RPG, with a Star Trek licence.The space combat is quite fun but it is not ST. The ships don't move in 3D, you're on a 2D plane. You spend your time casting a bunch of buffs and debuffs and the ship auto-fires. Where's the fun in that? You can't warp unless you're in ""sector space"". The entire galaxy is mapped and explored(sorry Enterprise, you're redundant now). You can't target subsystems like a warp core or shield generator. Standard ST ship systems, ie. a tractor beam, don't exist unless you have trained a bridge officer in that ability. You can't capture enemy starships. I mean, even the damage physics are severely lacking; your ship stays in one piece until it explodes. I could go on but the list is near infinite.The ground combat just plain sucks. I'm not even going to elaborate.The story is, however, quite interesting.This is a typical ""freemium"" game. It claims to be free to play but you'll be coughing up a lot of dough if you ever want to feel like you're getting somewhere. Don't be fooled, once you're maxed out they'll release another $150 expansion just to keep your wallet from looking healthy.In my humble opinion, the absolute worst thing about this game: It is highly unlikely that we will see another good ST game in the near future, thanks to these licence hogs.Overall I give the game a ""blegh out of ten"". Rather play Bridge Commander.			"

												I've got over 500 hours into this game, still have not earned enough dilithium to buy one of the ""premium"" ships. To buy a ship costs $10-$20 or more FOR 1 F'ING SHIP! And there is no way to buy through steam. Long story short:PAY-TO-WIN or GRIND-AD-NAUSEUM.         As a trekkie myself, I found the game quite enjoyable, for the first few hundred hours. The last couple hundred hours have been a painful, repetitive, attempt to grind for something I know is not going to be worth it in the end. The game is free, but only limited amounts of it. Your inventory is quite limited, you are limited to a few of a certain kind of characters to play as. You cannot access the higher class ships without paying cash or grinding for literally months to earn dilitihium (which you must refine, but are limited to only 8,000 refined per day) then finally using it to buy ""zen"" in an overpriced player driven ""zen"" exchange market. After buying additional inventory slots, and banks slots, and character slots, you can forget about buying a ship through ""grinding"" in anything less than a year.          I had hoped to at least earn ONE higher class ship before writing this review, but have gotten tired of the monotony of this game, and with so many other good games out/coming out, this one is soon to be obsolete anyways. Perhaps that is why the dev's are charging so much for their content, and trying to make it pointless to try to earn anything through ""grinding."" That is why I say this game is PAY-TO-WIN, and that is why I cannot recommend this game to anyone other than the hardcore Star Trek fans. And to them I say this, enjoy this game until level 50-60. Thats it. Unless you want to repeat the same content literally thousands of times to maybe earn a ship. Do not spend your cash on this game. You will have to go outside of Steam. This game is years old, and on its way out. Spend your money on a newer, better game.			"

Me after 500 hours of playtime:I will not sacrifice any more time for this game. I've made too many compromises already. Too much effort wasted. They're stealing my money with their sales, and I fall for it. They assimilate entire fan bases, and I fall for it. Not again! The line must be drawn here, ...this far, no further! And I will make them pay for what they've done!Me now:Meh, whatever. "

												I use to love this game, even gotten the life time sub when it first came out and played the heck out of it, the hours here on steam dont even include the many hours i played before it went to steam, but now the game is ageing and its gotten a bit boring. nothing new is really comen out, exept maybe a reskin of old crap. and of course it feels like its turned into a pay to win type game. alot of areas are preaty much dead and game feels like its on life suport.  I just feel that they should just let the game die and give the STO title to someone else to make a new and updated star trek MMO			"

												If I had reviewed this game a few months ago, it would have definitely gotten a thumbs up... but now that I have over 700 hours into the game, I've started to see cracks in the facade. To start with the positives, the game plays like a single player game. I myself do not really care for MMOs in general as I generally don't like being forced to deal with the toxic communities of games, but STO is much different. Sure there are jerks, but by in large the community is willing to help you if you have a question. The game plays just like a single player game, just incase you really don't want to deal with other players.Also, the ships are pretty well modeled, and space combat (especially with a lot of ships) really gives you that big battle feeling of the Star Trek TV shows.Unfortunately those are the only positive I can say without adding negatives, so lets dive into the rest.The story lines for the Romulans and Klingons are especially strong (the Federation is rather generic), unfortunately very early in those two races stories, you end up having to do the same exact missions you had to do as a Federation character. To me it seems to be a huge cop-out by the developer. If you play at an average pace, you will be done with all of the story missions up to current day. When you consider that this game debuted almost 6 years ago, that is quite disappointing. In my opinion, rather than getting any wash-up actor who made a guest appearence, or had a supporting role on any of the Trek shows, they should forget about that and focus on more frequent releases of storyline missions. Speaking of missions, there are a few gems that are well written, creative, and fun to play, but by in large every missions consists of an opening space phase where you fight to reach a planet, you then beam down and have to fight on the ground and accomplish an objective, and then you beam back to your ship and have to battle in order to leave. Those types of missions make up a good 85-95% of the game. Also, the major story arc the game has been leading up to for years (fighting the Iconians), has been a complete disappointment since it has debuted. Almost as if the developers didn't know what to do with it now that it has finally arrived, and now they are in a big rush to end it and debut their new story arc for the game.Thankfully the new story arc seems to involve more exploration and less shooting, which is what Star Trek is really supposed to be about (in theory). Everyone loves space battles, but after the five hundreth time of doing them, it is nice to have something different. There is a system in the game where people can create their own stories and missions, and make them available for everyone else in game to play. It is a good idea in theory, but even the top rated ones I have sampled are amateurish and dialogue heavy. After 5 minutes of playing one you will just want to get on with it and start skipping dialogue. One of the biggest universal complaints about this game are the microtransactions. Yes, this is a ""free to play"" game, and they need to make their money somehow. I don't have a problem with it, but I do have a problem for the ridiculous prices they charge you for the smallest stuff. Want to rename your character? That will be $5. Want to respec your skills? Another $5. Want a cool ship instead of the neutered free ones they give you? That will be $20 AT LEAST. The norm is $25-30. Anything cool, from ships to uniforms, that you may want will no doubt cost you money. Yes you can get the TNG Enterprise D or the Enterprise E from the later movies for free, but they are the much weaker versions. Fortunately you CAN get through all of the storyline missions with the free ships. You may have a bit of trouble in the later stages of the game, but it can be done. I will give the developer credit for how masterfully they've made the game to convince players to pay money. The longer you play the game you can really see how things like daily dilithium refining caps, lack of inventory space, bank space, etc is all crafted to steer you to spend money. It's very sad that the serious players have to have one main character and then several other characters that all essentially farm and supply the main character with enough resources/in game currency to accomplish things in a reasonable amount of time.Also, it is worth mentioning that the Klingon faction is essentially dead in the game. The majority of players either play Federation, or Federation aligned Romulans in the game. Also, doesn't anyone think it is odd that this game which is mainly about the Federation, who are essentially space communists, is centered around an in game item selling system? In order to make any decent amount of money in the game, you will have to work ""The Exchange"" and sell items to other players. Which brings me to the end of this long review. Once you finish the story missions, have joined a fleet (this game's equivalent of a guild) and have gotten decent gear, you will be able to handle anything in PVE (PVP in this game is essentially non-existant, not that it isn't there, people just don't really play it). It is at this time that all there really is left to do is to grind for every so slightly better, and more time consuming to get, gear. When you stop and think about it, and consider that PVP in this game is almost a non-entity and you can already beat most things in PVE when you are in the ""end game"" with ease , what is the point of grinding? If you continue to grind for better gear, and drop lots of money getting the top tier gear, you're only essentially doing it for bragging rights.So anyways, to sum all of this up, if you really love Star Trek and want to try this, go for it, play through the storyline missions, but don't spend a dime on it. Also expect to run out of things to do, other than grinding, within a couple months (depending on how often you play). It's not so much that STO is a bad game, I do think they have gotten a lot right and did fairly right by Star Trek, but that it has fallen victim to the micro-transaction model of making games and is very clearly a cash grab at this point in its life.One final thing, if you do think you want to spend money on this game, consider that someday the game's servers will be taken down permanently (like all old MMOs) and you will be left with nothing to show for your money spent.

												This game has a lot of charm for people that are deeply into retrogaming.  The engine is fifteen years old and it shows.  The visuals are primitive and great fun for the Playstation 2 enthusiast crowd.  However, because the game is built on Cryptic's ancient proprietary engine, the game suffers tremendously.The early (first two weeks or so) of play, this game is very entertaining.  It may be prehistoric, but the pew pew is mildly entertaining.  The earlier storylines are pretty good, but many have been revamped recently, and the revamps are utterly awful.  The dialogue reads like it was written by a middle school student that watched too much scoobie doo growing up.After the leveling ends, however, you are presented with the reality of the game.  Since being bought out by Perfect World Entertainment, Cryptic has lost most of the rights to direct the development of their games.  As a result, Star Trek Online and other Cryptic IPs like Neverwinter have recently begun losing players at a dramatic rate.  The honeymoon after going FTP has reached it's inevitable conclusion with this game as Perfect World Entertainment has turned this game into a thinly veiled scam and gambling interface that utterly diminishes the intellectual property and is pretty offensive.  There is a common excuse used by Cryptic apologists that 'well, all FTP games are like that these days'.  Hogwash.  That's no excuse.Because Perfect World has so drastically reduced Cryptic's resources to develop the game, there has been little to no real content introduced since early last year.  Ever quarter or so, Cryptic is able to scrounge together a 'featured episode' that evidently has never been edited or run through any kind of quality assurance, and call that 'content'.  At the same time, the bulk of their resources and development is spent on introducing more 'lockbox' ships.  These 'lockbox ships' are quickly thrown together reskins of earlier ships and don't really introduce anything to the game.  You have the privilege of paying for lockbox keys in order to open the boxes that contain them if you feel lucky, as you have less than a .005% chance of getting the ship in the lockbox.  The entire game runs off of this mechanic.  Where a valid and reputable game has a crafting system, Star Trek Online has a gambling system, where even if you spend the 8-12 months (yes, an entire year) maxing out a single crafting skill, you can't actually craft the gear you are trying to.  Instead, you are permitted a minimal 'chance' to create the desired gear.  So in the end, Star Trek Online is a good game to play for a few weeks.  As the lead developer has stated the game isn't really interested in retaining players.  They rely completely on gamer churn.  There is no endgame content, there is no meaningful progression, there is no reason to invest a single dime in or continue playing past the level cap.  Everything after that point is a sad scam designed to get you to throw out those dollars.  And we're not talking three or four dollars here.  For the ships gated by Perfect World Entertainment's Zen (ingame currency) store, you are expected to shell out between 25 and 120 for what you're after.  120 dollars for a ship in this prehistoric engine on a game that is just a thin veneer for a gambling simulator.  I would have recommended this game to people about two years ago.  But now, as the population is disappearing and the ingame community is dwindling to nothing, as well as the development team holding a very public scorn for the remaining players, I would have to say 'save yourself the heartache'.  Watching what Perfect World Entertainment has done to the Star Trek intellectual property will break your heart if you're a Star Trek fan.  According to rumor there is another Star Trek MMO in the works.  Wait for that one.  This one isn't worth your time.			"

												I started this game with a strong distaste for MMOs and a love of Star Trek, hoping the gameplay might be interesting enough to support a decent story. Well, it turns out that the gameplay is pretty great (once you level up a bit, of course) and the writing is fantastic! If you don't care about Star Trek, you most certainly won't care about this game (as the best parts are fairly story-centric) but if you do, there's a good chance you'll love it. The ground combat is pretty mediocre, but after the early-game bits the devs clearly realized that, and instead lean heavily into the space combat (which is *awesome*), leaving weirder, more puzzley elements for the ground-based mission bits.  The only real problem I have with the game is its unfortunate need to use MMO trappings sometimes. With the occasional fleet battles notwithstanding (see: recreating The Battle of Sector 001 ad infinitum) there is basically no reason for this to be an MMO. Apparently, once you hit the level cap there's not a ton of stuff left to do besides fleet-based raids, but each of the three factions has a unique story progression, so while I can't speak for the quality of any faction's story except the Federation, there's an easy 100+ hours of story-based game here to play for absolutely no money. That said, it's totally worth a few bucks to get some of the unique ships or costumes from the shows, if you want them. The game is structured around three different specializations (basically buff/debuff/healer, tank/warrior, and minion master), but you are never locked from acquiring a differently-optimized ship and can make up the difference with bridge officers, as well as getting a respec token every few levels, so you're never really 'locked in' to a particular playstyle. Anyway, I just like this game a lot more than I thought I would, so, recommended.			"

												As a Founder, with a lifetime account I will admit up front my opinion may contain a small amount of bias. Since I have not had to pay for the game, following Beta, I have had the fortune of enjoying it off and on at leisure. STO, has evolved since the beginning, with a whole new research and development system, additional episodes with a magnificent ton of canon content, STO allows players to experience up close, old favorite worlds, species we've grown up with for decades, and new, powerful enemies of ancient Trek lore, back to cause destruction. The graphics are mid-level, but the game makes up for those shortcomings by allowing players to fully customize their ships, officers, characters, and more. One evil little caveat, this game is notorious, and I do literally mean Notorious for it's legion of micro-transactional content. I do not agree with the level the current owners of ESO take micro-transactions. I believe that paying out of pocket for the chance to wear Star Trek: The Motion Picture costumes, is a little overboard. This is just one example, there are hundreds more. Each has to be bought separately with coins from the in-game store. Coin's can be purchased with real money. As a huge fan of Trek, up until about 2 years ago I had purchased everything the in-game store allowed, and the sheer volume of new content available by micro-transaction was so high, I didn't have the hundreds or even thousands of dollars necessary to keep up with it. Sadly, there is a lot of content, including actual pay to win ships, consoles, etc. which may be out of the casual gamers reach. If one can overlook this glaring and elephant in the room sized flaw the game has, the game can be fun. The episodes are like playing an interactive star trek series. It has a lot of room for growth and potential. I would recommend giving it a try if you haven't already.			"

												Yeah, the game serisously needs to be revisited, and yeah, all the pay to win stuff is maddening, but it is a free game. Go ahead and enjoy it if you are new to this whole thing. You technically can get almost anything in the game for free, if you are into taking an hour every day for several months to get one ship. I actually managed to level my KDF characters free ship to be fairly powerful. It's no t6, but it still packs a punch. If you are new to it, or just coming back because it hurt you so, it's a free game in which you can play decently and enjoy the ""story"", and the community.7/10			"

												So I've never written a review for a game before, and thought this would be the perfect oppportunity considering the amount of hours I've put in. As a start lets just say that you will enjoy this game tenfold if you have an understanding and/or love of the Star Trek Universe. Want to be a Federation captain....done.....want to fly a variety of your all time favorite ships from the series.....done....want to customise all of the above to your liking....done.It certainly has been a game that I keep returning to when the ""triple AAA's"" are just not worth it. That being said, I must admit that I have put alot of money into this game in order to speed up my fleet's progress. This game is a MASSIVE grind, if you want to see the big DPS numbers and/or want to have a large fleet base. Only thing I would say I am not fond of is the ground combat which can be bland and too simple, even considering the amount of skills at your disposal. The Space combat however is tonnes of fun, and I especially love upgrading my weapons and starship to improve performance -the variety and combinations at your disposal is just incredible.I wish more of my friends played this game, but no worries, because I will return, I will explore, and I will keep supporting this game. Thumbs up from me.			"

												Back into the game after many years away to find a game still going strong. Iffy graphics but a ton of content, and devs keep pumping it out with a pretty huge update.People claim the community is toxic (honestly only Fleet chat is the only chat i really spend time in). But I met only good people in my old fleet. There were people who were totally dedicated to the game and helping other players. My fleet leader was one of them. Ex-Navy vet giving out tips to an eager new cadet, in-game advice and life advice. After he was killed in a car accident his wife got on in the game to continue playing and let us know what happened to him. She kept his profile going on for a while at least.While i was/am the best player, the community here was one of the best i've encountered. RIP. Miss ya bro.			"

Agents of Yesterday, More like Agents of 2 Hours of GameplayDon't be fooled by the The Original Series stuff they have been pushing, you get to create a brand new character and start in the 23rd century with your own TOS era ship, guns, uniforms, and Missions, Sounds fun right? well it is... for about 15 minutes.I begin to create my character to my preferences and finish with the accept button to start my journey... oh wait Character Creation Failed, i try again multiple times and finally get in the game by not putting my First,Middle,Last name, and enter a bunch of random letters for my ship name.First mission is going well untill I get to the shuttle bay of the crashed constitution class to find that it is closed before i can even get in it. I log off and back on to fix this issue.I check the mission logs to find there are only 6 missions available for the Agents of Yesterday Expansion.... wait what, i team up with a friend for the rest of the missions but was only able to complete 4 with him because every time we loaded together in the turbolift on the way to save Captain Kirk i would fall through the wall only able to beam up and restart the mission over and over. I had to do that mission alone.I come to find out at level 10 you die and have been sent to the 25th century to be a temporal agent, wtf?All of the TOS Ships besides the starting ship are only usable through Zen purchaseAll of the new T6 Ships that are inspired by TOS ships can actually use a TOS skin, but yet there still isn't a T6 Constitution class. lol okBasically this ""Expansion"" is catered to the ""Alt-Aholic"" players in the communuty, this wouldnt be a problem for me to create an alt and do it all again but i have already spent a lot of real money on my current characters ship including upgrading it to a T5-U just for the developers to release a T6 version of it later, not to the mention the amount of grinding for in game currency to upgrade all parts of my ship to the max. I AM NOT going to restart all of that.Anyways the game has gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥long ago when everything became greedy, i mean they even de-saturated the color on the TOS EV Suit you use in one of the mission's to sell a Re-Saturated and well colored version on the market for 550 Zen LOL..But you know what pisses me off the most? TOS era ships get the freedom to name their registry number from 1,000-999,000. but not regular starships. "

												If you are looking for a fun, zany, free-to-play game that involves spaceships blowing each other out of the sky then you can't really go wrong with this one. A lot of people complain about 'paywalls' or the game being 'pay-to-win'. Yeh, it is, I can't argue with this as I've spent quite a lot over my 400+ hour gametime. HOWEVER, if you only take part in PvE, the story and the endgame reputation system then you have no reason to buy anything. You can earn everything in game. Once I realised this I stopped throwing money into it and I've since had a blast not paying for anything. Granted it all takes a lot longer and some things, like saving for the late game ships and equipment, can take hundreds of hours as well as careful resource managment.I should say at this point this is also not Star Trek, at least not for me. If you liked the TV series for the tense diplomacy and starship standoffs, you probably won't like the 'story' aspect of this game (which involves throwing your starship at wave after wave of opponents in never-ending explosive battles - which tbh is awesome :p). If you liked the films, epic, all guns blazing space battles, (see above) then go for it, you will love this game.The community is pretty good, all fairly laid back and the fleet actions  and STF's are a fun. One final point about the 'pay-to-win'. The ships you can buy with real money are hit and miss, some are worth it, some aren't and they are all upwards of £15, the really good tier5+6 ships are around £25-£30. So... if you are thinking of buying a ship, my advice is to only buy the endgame ships (tier5+6) as these are the ships you'll spend the most time in, I wasted money on a middle tier ship and now it just sits doing nothing and didn't really get me anywhere I couldn't have gotten by just playing the game. If you are wanting to buy a ship do some research, ask around and ask yourself 'Do I really, REALLY need this to enjoy the game?' - Most of the time the answer will be no.Despite the paywall, I would recommend this game. It is cheesy, spacey, laser-battlin' good.			"

												Star Trek Online (STO) is a free to play MMORPG for Windows PC.  I have been playing on and off since the start of Star Trek Online,  Just added STO on Steam just long enough to write the review.  I have 1 account that i paid money on and 3 accounts that are Free to Play.  I use the STO standalone game client only.Positves:STO is great if you want to play for FREE as a simple starship captain in the Star Trek MMO universe.  You don't have to pay any real money to experience the complete Star Trek universe.You can make 4 different faction captains ( Federation, Romulan, Klingon, 23rd Century Starfleet ) on 1 account.  The level cap is now level 60.  Plenty of extra specializations and traits you can add to your captain to improve ground and space combat.  It is easy enough to get to level 50 in a short amount of time, but going to level 60 will take some grinding and time.  PWI does give away stuff for STO, Check the website news often, check the store, attend in-game events, check you email, check google for codes.Basic gear is plentyful in mob loot drops and mission rewards provide your higher tier gear.Plenty of free cosmetic customization is available for your captains, bridge crew and ships.Plenty of PVE missions that are soloable and a few Co-Op battle areas.  Plenty of missions and areas for you to explore with you and your 4 bridge crew. There is player created missions in the Foundry to try out.  Plenty of Events to play through out the year.  Free players get a ship each rank up to tier 4. You can buy some extra ships from the exchange, if you can earn enough energy credits or if you find free giveaway codes or earn enough dilithium.  3 types of ships: Escort = DPS, Science = Support, Cruiser = Tank.Has a mini-game that you can send your duty officers and your fleet of ships on their own missions offline and you reap the rewards of their success.STO is Free to Play friendly, not as bad with limitations added to free accounts as other games. Usually the e-mail / chat unlocks with 20 plus hours in-game.  Inventory and bank is big enough, has in-space access to bank and email.  Free players have many slots in the Exchange to sell items.  PWI does give away a few ships and stuff, in event, in the store, reward codes to your email and find reward codes giveaways or for donations on other websites.-------------------------------------Negatives:Free to play accounts are limited in number of bridge officer slots.The game is still very buggy, but it has been Expanded, nerfed, simplified, reworked and changed over the years.  The game is pretty laggy at times, it has not always been.  Lately, The devs keep breaking old things and not fixing anything.  Game client crashes and disconnections happen often now.  But when the game works for you, it is great.If you are into playing PVP, forget about PVP, it is dead because of power creep, new players will die everytime in a match with veteran whale players.PWI is milking this game for money, but if you can buy PWI money cards they can be used to buy STO stuff.  You have to spend real money to play in style or be competative at elite end level content.  Give it a try. Play it for FREE only.for more info:

												I have been waiting for a long time to write a review on sto as my years of playing from before F2P up till now has been a love hate relationship with this game but year after year Cryptic gives us less and less end game content and more lockboxes and broken promises. Whats really sad is how the playerbase seems to have little to no problem with this trend that turned a once solid star trek mmo, into a star trek theme park with cash grabs at every turn. AoY I think was the last nail in the coffin for me. I'm a big fan of TOS and was very happy to hear about it being added to the game. Sadly yet again Cryptic has dropped the ball by making what could have been a great new area only useful up to level 10 and a few missions. I would say its a waste of potential but it seems STO itself is now a waste of the Star Trek IP.			"

												The Game itself is ok, but I found it buggy. This wouldn't be so much of a problem if it had acceptable customer service, which it doesn't. Perfect World's Customer service does nothing for you, except have you jump through hoops, and give you cookie cutter responses. I played the game a year or so ago, and left because the customer service was lacking. I came back to the game a few weeks ago (to discover my old toons, were wiped away, but thats not my complaint) Due to a bug, I lost access to the captain level ships. The GM I contacted was unable or unwilling to do anything to address the issue other than telling me that it would take development time to fix the issue, and then told me to submit a bug report, but that QA wouldn't repond to me. After leveling for several weeks, I found my character unable to proceed with the game, and I couldn't bring myself to continue playing and supporting a company that treats its customers in such a way. There are plenty of other games out there, from companies who know what customer service is supposed to be. I will never play another game with perfect world's name attached to it.			"

												I've always been a fan of Star Trek, and this game offers another path into it.  Its great to see that some of the actors in the series have been part of it by supplying thier voices.  It's definatly a commerical draw in the aspect where by you need to pump a lot of real life money into the game to have some of the cool things, but so far I've been happy with the choices Ive done on a limited budget.For those of us who like single player games, its a good mass multiplayer game to play single player, yet have more than enough real players to make it not feel like a SP game.I also like the development of constant new content and updates.

												Since Star Trek Online is now free to play, there is no real reason to buy it other than to save yourself a 4 GB download. This is a massive multiplayer online game that is part role playing game, part over the shoulder shooter and part star ship navigation and combat. I love Star Trek as we probably all do to even be here reading this. I've always wanted a game that gives you the total feeling of captaining a star ship, commanding an away team and interacting in a universe. Star Trek online feels shallow and hollow in some areas, yet needlessly cumbersome in others.The game is shallow with interactions and choices. The game delegates talking with characters down to a portrait and written text. No voice acting, but maybe I have been spoiled. I take that back, there is some horrible voice acting from Leonard Nemoy to start the game and the holographic doctor that acts as a tutorial is one of the flattest and worst voice acting I've ever heard. Especially when the EMH doctor on Star Trek Voyager uses the same lines with a pop and snap. The dialog is so bland that I just skip through it because everything you need to do is marked with an exclamation point. It would have also felt better to be able to interact with more random objects like scan flowers that are not marked and have a 1% chance every hour to find something. There are still interactions like anomalous readings that open up a wave pattern mini game that is very easy to say the least.Right off the bat it is a disappointment as you are thrown into a conflict with the Borg who in the Star Trek universe should not be for beginners. Nor should they fall easily, but you might as well have a fly swatter for all the Borg you'll encounter.Luckily if you have a problem with the missions, there is an actual mission editor. You can submit your missions and have them put into the game which is a nice touch.Like any MMO, you get to pick a race, pick a class from three (red, blue and yellow). Everyone seems to pick red. Each race has special traits and you can customize your look with excessive detail. It all feels very superficial.When you're not walking around and talking, you're either flying a ship or shooting things. The shooting is good and pretty easy even if its one dimensional. Point your phaser at the target you want to die or blow up and keep firing til its dead. Shooting civilians doesn't matter... and it should. You get an away party that you make up of crew members that you find or recruit throughout your play. Its a fun micromanagement thing and your allies are pretty competition and takes away from a MMO when your party is made of computer characters. The ability to just jump into someone else's party to replace the computer would have been nice.You have some basic controls to fly around, but it seems a little cumbersome, throttling up to go forward and then going to impulse... Flying around objects and toward objects to blow them up or beam off survivors. The visuals are beautiful here, but the fact you're over dead space makes things seem pretty lifeless unless there's a space battle going on.Space battles are where the game excels. You have 4 ""power"" settings... attack, defense, speed and balanced. They all do what you'd think to make it easier for you to survive. In a space battle, your star ship has 4 shields, front, rear, left and right. Taking too much damage to one shield will leave your ship vulnerable and easy to kill. So you need to maneuver around the ship you're facing firing off phasers to drain their shields and torpedoes to finish them. Oh and aft weapons as well. The weapons have cool down times just like any MMO. Some space combat missions feel like a slog when you're on your own... kill 4 enemies here, fly there, kill 4 more enemies, fly there, kill 4 more and go back and they respawn... 1 ship vs 4 quite frequently. There are no quick battles until you level up. Then there are massive battles MMO style where its 10 players vs 1 super ship or 10 players vs 10 ships then 10 more then 10 more then 10 more. There is a noticeably slowdown on my laptop for those.You can visit your bridge and ship interior from your vessel, but there is little life there. There are plenty of NPCs and big hollow areas, but no one speaks and its more of just a little head nod that... yes we have your ship interior. Perhaps in further stages of the game the bridge opens up, perhaps when your ship is boarded by alien hostiles... but that is just a prayer that's what happens. Perhaps drama of your ship filling up with deadly gasses and you and a party need to save everyone. Oh and another glaring detail is the fact that when you start the game you pick how your uniform looks... why is it no one else from my crew is wearing the uniform I have chosen? Am I the rogue ensign captain that does as he wishes?The missions greatly vary but after a while they feel very copy and paste. Some missions are well thought out with plot twists. Other missions seem one dimensional, like space battles where you need to destroy 4 satellites protected by a squad each... then fly to pick up dilethium that is guarded, then drop off dilethium but you can't, because your transporters are being blocked by a jamming station that is guarded, so when you return after destroying the jamming station the dilithium drop point is guarded. Constant space battles are not a good thing. Neither are the missions where you are exploring random planets where 2 of which have been baron and devoid of life or action. You are sent down to scan 4 objects on one with no enemies and barely anything to look at. Another planet had me in a cave with no enemies downloading audio logs that I couldn't listen to... what? Those are the bad missions and the missions seem to each take 40 minutes with sections that take 10 minutes.5 or 6 hours into the game, you get duty officers that you get to send on away missions. These are not missions that you do, but rather as a captain you need to assign the right people for the job. Its a nice little add on, but not needed for sure. The officers have jobs and personality quirks like stubborn, a team player, logical and so on. The missions specify what traits and jobs are best suited for each away mission.In all, with no voice acting for the flat characters and bland dialog coupled with mediocre missions I can't get into it and I'm a big fan of the lore. I really think that the game makers missed the point of Star Trek and that wasn't space exploration it was drama. Sure you travel to far away planets and dogfight against other star ships, but the point of the TV series and movies was the characters and this game has flat characters. The game doesn't really feel like an MMO. After 15 hours I've never really interacted with anyone except for seen them flying by and the big boss battles. Nothing seems to have consequence, there could have been factions and alliances instead of just Federation vs Klingon. Or your own personal alliances like Morrowind.			"

Posted: July 11, 2016
												As many have posted in their reviews, after the game went Free To Play, it started to go downhill, and fast. The introduction of lockboxes, and the quickly escalating spam of premium items, made it nearly worthless to try to buy things using ingame currency, since all the best ships require real money (or, at the very least, a substantial amount of time mining dilithium). I lost interest long ago.However, the reason I'm writing this review is to not talk about the gameplay or how it rates as an MMO, but rather how it measures up to its IP, and whether it's an MMO with a Star Trek branding treatment, or it's a Star Trek GAME that HAPPENS to be an MMO, because I haven't seen any reviews that cover this angle. Unfortunately, in this regard, it fails catastrophically at being a game that honors and respects the IP that it represents.Even back in the very early days, this game pushed my feelings on the Star Trek lore a fair bit; though the storyline at launch was somewhat compelling, it was also pushing against what was invisioned by the creators of Star Trek. The storyline at launch was basically, Romulus gets blown up (as per the 2009 Star Trek movie), Species 8472 (called the Undine in this game) decide to infiltrate the governments of the Alpha quadrant, and as a result the Klingons declare all-out war against the Federation. Though I was iffy on the Species 8472 involvement, as I felt that Star Trek: Voyager wrapped up that thread peacefully quite well, it does feel like Star Trek.Much later on, I also had to give praise to the Second Wave content release, which brings in the Dominion, based on the Star Trek: Deep Space 9 episode ""Sacrifise of Angels"", which asks the question: What did the founders do with the 2,800 Dominion ships in the wormhole, on the way to crush the Federation fleet during Operation Return? Answer: Flies out of the wormhole 40 years later in 2409. Ultimately, it proves to be a rather entertaining arc, and it felt like Star Trek.However... from there, things get pretty sketchy. For one, it introduces enemies that shouldn't even really be around. For example, the Hirogen, who are in the Delta Quadrant, based on Star Trek: Voyager, would need to fly over 30 YEARS to reach the Alpha Quadrant. Though that is feasable since STO takes places about 40 years after the Dominion War (which is roughly when Voyager was launched into the Delta Quadrant), consider that the Hirogen are a species that only travels in very small groups. To fly so far, and to show up with enough numbers to make a significant appearance in the Alpha Quadrant, escapes the suspension of disbelief.Another problem is that there are a lot of enemies. Even when fighting the Klingons, the Federation would have its hands full; previous wars has always pushed the Federation to its limit. Yet, we have the Federation fighting the Borg, the Romulans, the Hirogen, the Cardassians, the Dominion, the Iconians, the Undine (!), the Tholians, the Gorn, the Breen, and I'm sure there's more. Let's recall that, during the Dominion War, it took the combined efforts of the Federation, Klingons, and Romulans at full strength to fend off the Dominion, Cardassians, and the Breen, and to fend off one borg cube (and not a tactical one, don't forget). By the end of the war, the Federation, Klingons and Romulans were completely spent, with most of their fleets, and many billions of lives obliterated. And, let's not forget that, had the events of ""Sacrifise of Angels"" ended up with the 2,800 ships arriving instead of being erased from existance, the war would have been lost. Now, consider that the Federation alone is facing a full-on Borg invasion, plus everything else, and have no real allies to count upon, and you realize how silly this entire game is, in the scope of the Star Trek universe and canon.And, finally, this leads to my third and final problem with this game, and that is this game completely lost track as to what Star Trek is all about. Even in Deep Space Nine, where the Dominion invasion takes up half of the series, and involves many epic conflicts, there was always some time to explore, some time to have interesting political intrigue, and some classic Trek-like storylines, that showed that, even when things looked bleak, that the heart of the Federation, and Star Trek as a whole, was still vibrant as ever. Even when the Star Trek: TNG-based movies had fights in them, most of it wasn't even fighting, but the crew trying to figure out diplomatic or otherwise creative solutions to solve the crisis of the day.Unfortunately, in this, Star Trek Online fails. Though, yes, there are missions that focus more on tasks rather than combat, they are the extremely rare exception to the norm, and almost every mission will have at least one fight, and of those fights, there are almost always more than one starship. Think about all the lives you've killed from your tours of duty; even in Star Trek: TNG, the destruction of ships was always a last resort. In Star Trek Online, you're basically shooting on sight. On top of that, most of the missions involve some sort of war-against-species-of-the-area and trying to eliminate the threats. It gives the feeling of hopelessness, like, will the Federation (and/or Klingons) ever see peace again?(RE: Star Trek Movie)Sadly, the new Star Trek movie series from 2009 and up also follows a very similar path, and involves some sort of epic-level threat, and absolutely no intrigue to make it feel like Star Trek. Though they're great popcorn flicks, they're terrible Star Trek movies.(/Movie)It is these reasons why I can never play Star Trek Online again, and that I hope the new Star Trek TV series completely ignores the canon established in Star Trek Online. It would be interesting to see the storyline of Star Trek in the prime universe post-Romulus, and I hope that when it comes out, it's nothing like Star Trek Online.TL;DR: If you're a Trekkie, save your soul and avoid this game. If you're an MMO player, avoid it because it's pay-to-win.			"

												Oh Star Trek Online, a game I have WAY too many hours in... I bought the lifetime sub at launch back in 2010, which I've more than gotten my value out of. Though my roommates soundly mocked me at the time (and still do). Anyway, the game is overall pretty fun. You're a Star Trek captain flying through the galaxy, exploring strange new world, seeking out new life and civilizations, and becoming the largest mass murderer in the history of the galaxy,  committing genocide on a scale untold. Seriously, you are probably responsible for the deaths of millions, possibly billions of people. All because they know people like to shoot things.The space combat is FAR better than the ground, though ground has come a long way since launch. This is an MMO first and foremost, and to some extent it's pay to win, but as a F2P you can still do everything. The game has been well maintained by the devs over the years, seeing active development and updates. I highly recommend anyone who starts the game to check out /r/sto regularly and join a fleet, specifically the Reddit Fleets are great to start and the RedditChat as a chat channel which isn't filled with garbage, it's actually pleasant and social. I enjoy the game, would recommend it to any Star Trek fan, and anyone that wants a fairly low skill space MMO. 8/10			"

												I played this game at release with a buddy of mine cause we are dorks.  I'll admit it didn't captivate me at release and we only played for a few weeks and then moved on to other games.  With this lul period of MMO's we are in now (2017) I decided to get my account updated and linked to the new owners of this game and i've been playing everyday since.  I'm really enjoying the complexity of all the skills and traits (something MMO's have moved away from since they want to appeal to larger audiences) and have been really happy with it.  I even started watching some people stream this game and was given a T6 ship in a giveaway!  Community seems to be really nice (which is pretty rare in MMO's today).  10/10 will recommend this game to as many nerds as I can find.			"

												Where do I even start with this? This is actually a nice singleplayer game, in a way. The missions are nice, its the Star Trek Singleplayer that could have been, really.But everything else is suffering on the multiplayer department. Tier 6 ships are the way to go-- and you have to grind to hell and back to get these, not to mention the T5-X trap that they laid down as a moneygrab. PvP has been junked by both the playerbase and the devs(Its all about one ""best"" playstyle, everything else has been junked and the playerbase that usually does PvP is elitist as hell, to the point of threatening the devs and the devs generally acting like amateurs when talking back to them).It also has a huge amount of time locked events. If you weren't there to get the items, your character is locked out, and that's what. Hope you're here for the next event because you're gonna regret it if you aren't.Overall, this game gets 5 out of 5 meme points. Good luck, shipwright.			"

												It's the non-canon continuation of the enormous wing of the Star Trek franchise which ended in 2005. STO pays homage to the first five live-action series (and TAS) while also going into new territory, with the main storylines revolving around original characters. The main story (all four of them), which you could probably level up to 60 on, can be played as single player though most of the quests can be done in a group. You'll mainly level up on these story quests, not slave away grinding on monsters. They pop up conveniently and remotely so the action and flow is far more consistent than your typical MMO.STO is very rewarding if you're a trekk(ie/er). The lore alone is worth the MMO format, a game genre which I'm personally no longer really a fan of.			"

												Very fun game with a lot going on. Was not initially expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. The game offers a variety of playstyles, ships, equipment, and crew controls. The fact that you can get a huge capital ship by simply getting to the endgame and not needing to pay for one was a great surprise. The seasonal events were a blast. As a star trek fan is really made me feel at home. By the time i hit max level i found myself actually buying things with real money just so my character would look all the more cool hehe. Definitely give it a shot if you are an mmo or startrek fan.			"

												I've procrastinated about writing a review of STO for a long time. I've logged many hours playing it, and that embarrasses me.This game is stupid. It references every letter of the Star Trek franchise, while almost never getting the spirit of it. The gameplay overwhelmingly focuses on combat; space combat is repetitive, and ground combat is almost idiotic. There are other sorts of gameplay challenges now and then, but they're usually laughably easy. There's a game economy that doesn't make sense in the setting for several reasons, primarily because the Federation was post-scarcity and didn't use currency.There's no role-playing; as common with MMOs these days, there's no way to role-play an interaction between player characters that harmonizes with the storyline, because each character is the unique hero of the same storyline. (Well, one of three storylines, mostly overlapping, with a few minor variations.)(Arguably, there's some role-playing that goes on that ignores the game storyline, but that may as well happen on an IRC channel.)This is, essentially, Cow Clicker in space. The goals players actually pursue mostly involve collecting things, or trying to optimize for DPS, or beating a team challenge in minimum time.That said, I do enjoy this game as dumb fun. The ships are somewhat attractive, and some of the costumes. And occasionally, the developers actually do pull off something creative. The best example of this was the Solanae Dyson Sphere, an impressive play space in which they introduced several new gameplay modes.The most important thing is to ignore the constant calls to spend money in the game. If you enjoy it and are patient, you can get a top-tier ship from a periodic ""event"". Or if you really want, you could spend the money to buy one -- but you can afford a better game for the price of a premium ship in this game. Leave it to the whales to keep the game afloat.			"

												First of all: If you like Star Trek and think flying your own starship would be awesome, this is a good game for you.Personally, I like this game. I know plenty of people who will say it's crap, the devs are awful, the game's engine is bad, and so on and so forth. The graphics are good enough, there's not much lag, and it's generally fun to blow up Borg. Coming from a few other F2P games (*cough* WAR THUNDER *cough*), I feel as though the developers of STO do somewhat care about their playerbase. Game progression is easy enough, until you hit level 50. Leveling up to 60 gets a bit tedious, but you can access the whole game (minus a few not-really-important story missions) from 50. The learning curve is fairly steep - I'd recommend looking at a few tutorials before trying to work in the community exchange. There is, as always, premium currency, but you can change one of the other types of currency into it (for a large ingame expense). There are multiplayer missions with other players, and the harder the difficulty the better the rewards are upon completion. There are eight or so ""campaigns"" that give out some good gear. The ships are accurate, as far as I can tell. I hate long reviews, so this is gonna be pretty short.For me, the most important part of a game is whether or not I had fun playing it. Here, the answer to that is a definite ""yes"". If you don't believe me, try it out. It is, after all, free.			"

												When this game first launched, it was original and felt different to other MMOs.Since it became free to play, it has become a grindfest.It still has some great storyline missions, but as a whole it is now less fun. :(			"

												I been a star trek fan (Trekki) for as long as i can remember from a child and seen every episode of every series and generation and any of the shows props used in the series, which got me into buying ALL star trek games that has ever been released.Now we come to Star Trek Online (Agents of Yesterday) i played this game to some great length and have become addicted to the game, I find the graphics is out of this world and into the next one and the missions and gameplay keeps you on your toes,One of the advantages of this game is you can upscale your ships with new ships and weapons and equipment to fit your needs to complete any mission or task at hand and the sound is fantastic with 5.1 speakers there is hundreads of ships to choose from and from all the races in the shows, and you can change uniforms and much much more.If you are a (True) star trek fan like myself then this game you will love and enjoy for years to come as it lives up to expectations of what star trek truly is.Downside...is you will need to use real money to buy zen credits to buy most of the best ships and crews unless your lucky to get a ship from a locked box which in any case you will need to have a key to open the box which you have to buy with zen credits anyway, also you can register on this game with a payed membership that gives you some perks such as 500 zen credits (FREE) once every month to help you to get truly into this game and more.I think if you are interested in investing some cash into this game to get the best items then you will enjoy it much more, i also think some of the items you buy for zen credits is somewhat overpriced as 1200 zen credits cost around £8.00 GBP or around $12 and 1200 zen credits can go very fast but it can buy you 1 basic ship as most of the best ships cost over 3000 zen credits and bare in mind your new ship will only have the basic equipment installed you will need to upgrade your weapons and consols to make it a supership.But in saying all this you can always wait until the game has sales and buy those much wanted items much cheaper but until then you will have to grind away to achieve anything but to a true trekki it would of been worth it.I find this is a better game then most sci.fi games including ELITE but i hope the devs decide to reduce their prices a bit so it will attract more players to play the game.

												STO isn't perfect, but it's fun.There is a lot of debate about how good going FTP has been for the game. It's certianly possible if someone wanted to invest lots of money there are ships and equipment faster and easier than people who choose to never pay. The economy is fairly exchangable when it comes to the various currency, so it isn't super hard to sell equipment or mine to raise cash.The stories are of varying quality. Some are very good, others less interesting.You can play as a character in the Federation, KDF, or the New Romulan Republic. They each have their special ships and missions, although the Romulans get the oppertunity to get some of the other side's ships.The strength of the game, in my opinion, is the space combat. It can be a lot of fun. You can go quick, agile, and high damage (dps) like with the Defiant class, slower but very durable (tank) like the Soverign class, or a science vessel for buffs, repairs, and a general balance in power vs durability compared to the two other catagories. There's also the bird-of-prey which is somewhat unique as being very customizable. Arming up a Bird-of-Prey to do a lot of DPS is my perfered setup for the KDF.One of STO's weak points, in my opinion, is ground combat. It's gotten better a bit over time, but it has never been on the same level regarding combat compared to the ship combat. There are some good ground combat missions and arena-like situations though.The writers and developers seem to be doing a good job making this game and its stories tie into the TV show, and expanding on stories started in the Star Trek TV and movies, like the Dyson Sphere, the Enterprise C, mirror universe, the liberated Borg from VOY, to name a fewPVP is virtually non-existant. It has always felt like a second thought and had some balancing issues, but it hasn't been maintained or updated in quite a while, leaving the PVP queues mostly empty. It was frustrating at times, but it was also really fun when there well balanced teams or grouped up. For now, however, most of the best content of STO is in PVE missions or random events. There are a few places that have open-combat however, where any of the sides can enter and will be hostile verses other sides, so some unregulated combat against the npcs or players can take place. They're good for testing your builds as well.Overall, while I feel it has much room for improvement, I've always found it enjoyable. PVE is fun, missions are fun, general combat is fun, customizing your ship and its loadout and crew is also fun (for me). If you are a Trekkie and love Star Trek you'll likely find all the references, stories, and cameos enjoyable as well.			"

												Really not good. The player generated content stories are a notable exception. They higher rated ones I tried were very well done.I was hoping for a bit of plot and RPG type development. Instead I just got repetition of the same boring isolated space combat, FPS and traveling from one place to the next. Very low on atmosphere.Most disappointing was going on the bridge of your own ship. You can run around but there is nothing to do and it doesn't look good.... why bother?			"

												I just started to play this and have been very surprised at how fun it is.  Though at level 2 I found a bug that prevents me from playing any more.  You beam down to the Academy after doing some space tutorial missions and my ability to beam back up to my ship was missing.  I searched the hud for a good long while and found plenty of buttons to buy stuff at thier store, but no way to get unstuck.  There's also a transwarp feature that was greyed out.  Effectively imprisioning me at the academy.  I attempted to ask people how to get back but was all but ignored in local.  I attempted to use the Zone chat and found that unless you give them money, you can't use this feature.  I had to make a hot chick character in order to get the Star Trek community to even acknowledge me.  I learned where the Beam Up button was supposed to be.  Which it was not.  I went to the forums and found that I could not post because I was new.  I looked to see if anyone else had this issue and sure enough I found posts that were from years ago that had this same issue.  From what I can tell there has been loads of content created for you to buy, but bugs like being forever stuck somewhere have not been fixed in years.  I've submitted GM tickets in the game and on thier website but I am doubtful that it will be responded to since it has nothing to do with thier store.  It's too bad they don't support thier players.  It was fun while it briefly lasted.EDIT:I was wrong, GM's did in fact send an email response.  Here is the response to a 3 year old progression stopping bug. ===""Hello, Thank you for contacting us.  We are sorry to hear that you are having issues with beaming out of Starfleet Academy. Unfortunately, with being such a new Character, if you get stuck within these first few missions, you may need to re-create your Character. We also advise following the tutorial in the order it was presented and refrain from deviating from any of it until you have finished all the tutorial missions. In addition to that, please let the cinematics (if any) run to the end to ensure that the mission updates correctly. Once you get to Earth Space Dock, please be careful not to beam back to the Academy avoid this issue again. We truly apologize for the inconvenience this has caused.""=== It makes me wonder if a max level character that runs into a bug like this would have to delete his character and start over as well.

												Mostly for Star Trek fans, but if you are a Trekkie and are willing to invest into a MMO timesink this is for you.One of the few truly F2P games. No game content is behind paywalls. Only premium equipment requires in-game purchases and even those can be grinded for free given enough time. In-game currency Dilithium can be converted into Zen which is used for purchases. Exchange rate at this time is about 1:200 (zen to dil, most premium ships cost 2500-3000 zen, which is about 20$ real money) and there is a daily refining limit of 8000 dilithium. So it takes a while, but can be done. Gets easier if you have several characters grinding dilithium as Zen pool is account wide. So Pay-to-Bypass-Grind is more accurate for this game.Only veteran awards require montly subscription (or Lifetime account) but those are mostly cosmetic upgrades and one endgame level ship. Only truly worthy perk is the 500 Zen montly stipend.As far as game mechanics go, this is an MMO like any other. Gather experience, level up, grind for gear, team up, form guilds (Fleets). Both ground and space combat are in the game, though the ground side isn't as interesting. It is the space combat which makes this game a little different from other MMO's. Much like SWToR, the single player missions, or Episodes, are the bread&butter for Star Trek fans. Featuring voice over acting from actual Star Trek actors, like the late Leonard Nimoy, one could not ask for more story wise. Especially the newer content is very well written, and every now and then older content gets revised, the latest 'update' being mid-gameish Romulan story arc, which is now much more story-like as opposed to being just a bunch of missions in sequence. Also features Denise Crosby as Romulan Empress Sela.Most of the game content is PvE. PvP exist, but hasn't been properly balanced or developed in years so not many people play it seriously. So hard-core PvPr's steer clear.			"

												Absolutely fantastic game. I've played for years and yes, sometimes the content in the new seasons leaves something to be desired, and the cost for zen-store content is a bit on the greedy side, but for a free-to-play title I'm happy to tithe forward a few bucks every month for a few extra nice-to-have cosmetic goodies. The foundry (permitting self-written content) is fantastic. The replayability is high and frankly - being able to pop online and fly a ship around the Star Trek universe for a bit provides a nice break from the daily grind. NOT a game for those who want PVP - but since I'm happily well in the PVE preferring body of gamers I've got zero issues with that. There are some variances from Star Trek canon, but the development team at PW seems to have continued to work on keeping to what's reasonable for the universe as Roddenberry framed it. The variety of story lines can sometimes come across as a mash-up that doesn't mesh terribly well, but the quantity and variety vastly outweigh any annoyance at those moments. Highly recommend giving it a go - as a f2p option you've literally got nothing but some time to lose and the chance to get to know a hell of a good game.			"

												One of my absolute favorite MMOs, At least since TOR lost its soul. This is just so absolutely Star Trek. Among all the many and varied story missions, there are fewer than half a dozen which even begin to feel like fetch-quests, and nobody ever asks you to make their special stew recipe.The combat is fun, especially in space, where you can choose and equip your ship to your own personal preference, providing room for incredibly customized tactics, specific to your own build. The Borg, once you meet them, are a terror, adapting to your weapons on the ground and stripping your shields in space with laughable ease.Yes, while you can, technically, get all the cash store stuff without paying, it requires a truly monumental amount of grind for even the most basic item. But. Honestly, if you like the game, if you think it’s worth playing for several hundred hours, or far, far more, actually paying the devs is hardly a great and terrible sacrifice. If you dont like it, well, you get to play through to the end without paying a cent or being negatively effected by it, so it's hardly an issue. "

												I've been playing this game for several years now and it's definitely a wonderful game for all Star Trek fans old and new. I've always wanted to be the captain of my own ship and Star Trek Online gives you the chance to throw in your own character into the Star Trek universe with ease. The story line never gets old and they have recently added so much to the game to make the story line even longer. Levelling up alone is quite easy, but trust me, it's much better with a friend. There are endless possibilities on what you can do in Star Trek Online. You can queue up in special missions to fight lots of dangerous species such as the Borg, Undine and now the Iconians. You can even just explore strange new worlds and beam down to millions of beautiful planets and even throw a beach party on Risa! To be honest you don't even really have to be a major Trek fan to enjoy and like this game and you can learn so much about the Star Trek Universe just by playing the game. So if you're thinking of getting into Star Trek in an interactive way instead of watching seasons and seasons of the show this game is a good way to get yourself started.The new reputation system is very long and requires a lot of grinding but at least you can do different things to gain marks. My favourite places to gain marks are New Romulus, the Dyson Sphere Ground Battlezone and Kobali Prime as you can really engage yourself in many different things such as missions or just shooting all the enemies you can see. Also the new system is a much better way for every one to be able to get the items as the old system was just pot luck and this caused a lot of ""elitists"" to appear in game and this made things harder and more challenging for new players. Whereas now almost everyone can get the items easily and work better together as a team.And, yes, sometimes the game is laggy. But trust me I've played games with worser lag than on Star Trek Online. At least in this game it is sorted out by the creators instead of just being left there. If you want to explore strange new worlds, seek out new civilizations and boldly go where no man has gone before. Then Star Trek Online is the game for you.			"

												If you like star trek and MMORPG, definetely try out this game.If you like star trek but not MMORPG, well, have a try. At least the storyline will satisfy you.If you like MMORPG but not star trek, why not check this game out? It's a good MMORPG.If you hate both, don't play this game then. You can't have fun, why playing it?I just hit 1k hours. The storyline of this game will MAKE YOU CHEER when you see characters you love from Star Trek appearing. The space combat is awesome. The ground combat is not as popular among players as space combat but also very nice. You can enjoy this game the best when you play with your friends, but I have to say that in-game chatting is LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME!! If you want to chat well, you'll have to rely on some other aps.This game has its disadvantages though. First, the endgame period, like many other RPGs, are boring. All you can do is repeating some missions every day. This is not true when you are chasing for higher stats and competing with other players. For me, all the weaknesses don't matter because I LOVE THIS GAME.			"

												Captain's log, Stardate -305822.54I will confess that I am an MMO junkie.  It's a genre that allows total freedom within a world, while offering real world social opportunites.  You could say I've been a connisuer of these games for awhile.  And while there are many good ones, this is a great one.  This is one that boldy goes where no game has gone before.There's certainly peer pressure to spend real money, but no real need to if you're willing to grind.  And yes, while most people from my generation despise it, and at times I do too, it offers a real sense of accomplishment when you can finally afford that rare crewman or high level ship.  You can literally earn your way through the entire game with enough dedication.As we look toward the future with Star Trek Discovery on the horizon, and my personal endeavor to start rewatching old episodes from the various series (Voyager being my favorite), I think America, and the world, need something to help them start looking spaceward again.  It may be a brave idea, but I think that with political climates on Earth close to boiling over again into what would most likely be another world war, the Final Fronteir may very well be our only refuge.Whatever the case may be, I highly reccomend this game to anyone who's ever dreamed of being the captain.  Live long and prosper.			"

												From having played this game since the first day of the beta all the day to just yesterday, I've got to say that the game has been one of the most sporadic, random, and on-a-whim games I've ever seen. There have been periods where Star Trek Online is fundamentally evil and obviously run by a company that does not care for its players, and there's been times where the company has actually put in some effort and been a half decent group in favour for the players. The game content shifts in regards to this-when the company is headed or run a particular way for whatever period of time it runs that way for, the game content and the stuff available to do either improves, worsens or stays roughly the same.At current, the game is good, and the TOS content/missions/ships added is amongst the best I've personally seen in years. Some of its a bit odd and fanservicey, but this is a Star Trek game-who cares if Scotty is magically on the same station you're on? It's Scotty!Overall, this game has some highlights. I'd say if you're going to play this game, play it for the space combat and the smattering of missions that have a Star Trek feel. If you're not into Star Trek, this game is bearable and fun with friends, as you can build your own space station for all of you; alone, though, this game will hold little entertainment for anyone not invested in the Star Trek universe.It's still the best star trek space sim we have out there, in my opinion, and the best star trek game still in circulation. It's also the only star trek game of its kind.Play with friends or if you're a fanatic; otherwise, unless you really like the space combat and *shudder* the ground combat, you're not going to get the most out of this.7/10 in recent times, could fall as low as 5 or 4/10 depending on what content is currently being released.

												As much as I wish I could say otherwise, I cannot in good faith recommend Star Trek Online.  Star Trek Online isn't an MMO. It's a Star Trek themed resource management game with queue based resource gathering missions in-between filling up a dozen progress bars for things you don't even want or need. Your personalized crew that is so plastered over advertisements are nothing more than bland paper dolls with barely any customization options. They are so hardly ever used in the game they might as well not even exist.Thinking you might at least be able to walk around the inside of your ship? Guess again. Outside of your bridge, ship interiors don't exist. It's not like there's any reason to visit it anyway. Everything is queue based.Two years ago there wasn't a single thing about this game that was pay to win. Well it is now. The best ships and gear are locked behind so many resource gates you may as well pay out your nose and skip them or else you'll be grinding for hours.Every system in the game, everything from Crafting, to the ships themselves seems specifically designed to bleed as much money out of you as physically possible. I realize that developers have to eat, but not only do you have to buy a ship, you have to essentially buy it twice to make it powerful enough to do anything.I could give a dozen more reasons why this game isn't worth your time. I will simply say it isn't. Whether you are an old veteran wondering about coming back, or someone who hasn't played at all and is curious, from me, who has spend hundreds of dollars and hours on this game, I am telling you to love yourself.And play something else.

												Short answer: Deffinatly give this a try if you like Star Trek or don't want to pay a lot of money for a good mmo, it wont cost you anything other than some download time!Pros: -It's actually free! Some people have called this a ""pay to win"" game which i find very strange, this is the one of the few games where you can have access to the entire game and become as strong as anybody else without spending any money at all. The way it works is mostly a ""pay to skip the grinding"" or ""grind and sell instead of paying"" which I find to be a very nice system. It makes it so you don't feel preasured to pay for anything and even if you don't want to pay nor grind, you wont fall way behind everyone else, in fact you can still go from level 1 to 60 (the max level) and experience the whole storyline including new content without a problem. -Graphics are not spectacular, but you can play this on an older pc or family laptop, or have something else running the background easy.-Storyline goes very well with all of the Star Trek series, expect to find some familiar characters with their original voice acting. The story takes place a few years after Star Trek Voyager (there will be lots of Star Trek Voyager characters).-Despite the fact there is lots of bias as to what is the best way to play, I feel like the gameplay is actually fairly well ballenced. It's not perfect; some may be more difficult to get good at, some may suck early on but even out later on, but I feel like this is better than some other mmo's.-level syncing option makes playing with friends easier, however someone whos high level still might kill everything in a couple seconds in a low level area.-I personally found the community a bit nicer than most mmo's when it comes to playing in queues. There is not really any tank-healer-dps roles (there can be but it is not neccessary) so you can't blame people for not doing their role, which makes it overall feel nicer.-Space and Ground gameplay: 2 different ways you can play, if you prefer one over the other you can choose to do one more than the other (at least for most end-game stuff), however your mostly stuck doing both in the storyline. Cons:-A bit glichy, however they do eventually fix them which is better than some other mmo's.-Not much end-game content. While there is some things to do such as increasing reputation and upgrading gear, most of the end game content is pretty much just ""increase the difficulty to advanced or elite"". They are constantly adding new content however.-PvP is almost non-existant unless you get some friends together for it.-Some areas of the game can be dramaticly easier or harder on your pc, I might run a very pretty graphic heavy scene in one of the earlier storylines at 60 fps but then run a patrol in the delta quadrent at 8 fps and it's not even that graphicly heavy. Probably not a problem if you have any kind of gaming pc.-Some of my friends in Germany said they had strange problems with translation. -The 3 roles can be rather confusing, there is Tactical, Engineering, and Science. You might think that it is ""Tactical = Dps, Engineering = Tank, and Science = Healer"" but it's not. In fact there really is no clear cut roles in this game. They are also slightly different for ground and space.   -For Space: Tactical can deal a little more damage, Engineering can take hits better and heal better, Science does exotic things such as crowd control, draining shields, and some exotic damage (they also have strong shields).    -For Ground: Tactical can deal more damage (also has an aggro catcher which I find strange), Engineering can create turrets, have pets, and regenerate shields. Science can debuff and heal.    -All these roles can also be mix-matched a bit when combined with a different ship. Example: a tactical officer can fly a cruiser (a type of ship with high engineering) for a mix of offence and defense, or he/she can fly a science ship for some exotic dps. There is no right or wrong way to play, you can focus on 1 thing and play a role, or be more diverse.			"

												As a lifetime account owner and playing through to Vice admiral back in the day. I can say this game no matter what they do to the interface and skill trees, is packed FULL of content. The dev team are very good with new content coming out all the time. For anyone who is a Star Trek Fan You cant go wrong with this. Its a Fantastic game for the price of £0 you dont need to pay to win. It Helps sure but you have a huge variety of ships and their classes. There is one massive oversight. For me this is an immersion breaker. Its your bridge. The Bridge is instanced and is not relative to what you are doing in space at the time. Some functionality makes it useful but it absolutely sucks that you cant manage battles from your captains chair and no ""on screen"" functionality. Dont let this put you off. There is so much content youll be playing non stop for a year before you run out of interesting things to do. Many wierd and wonderful locations to explore both planet side and in space. The Game itself is VISUALLY STUNNING and character creation is a great feature. Personally i think Escort Ships are the best way to have fun in battle as you can get more manouverability, that way it doesnt matter that they have less console slots as you go in guns forward and manage your shield one way until you absolutely need to manage left right and rear. Most gaming rigs with 2gb of video memory can run this at Max settings. Or very close to it.			"

												★★☆☆☆Well, it is a Star Trek themed MMO...  + Tribbles+ NPCs to fill your party+ Crew/party customization+ Freely re-customize your character from the hubworld+ Graphics Engine.  While the graphics and performance are passable, the amount of options, and the way they're instantly applied without any negative impact, is very nice.+ For a free2play game, it doesn't seem especially pay2win or pay2fun.  Only a handful of vanity items, many of which are already available for free.  Though I haven't reached endgame, so who knows how it goes. +- Small single-player semi-unique quest zones+- Graphics and performance, passable but not impressive+- You can freely customize your uniform, but most equipment doesn't have a visual impact+- Fully auto auto-attacks, this helps prevent the staring at hotkey timers problem that most MMOs suffer from, but target switching can fail between kills- Global chat is cringeworthy- PvE queues have cooldowns- Difficult to locate quest objectives- Can't tell which doors are openable- Uninteresting, overcomplicated skill tress, which just provide stat boosts- The bridge of your ship is just a novelty, and not an integrated part of gameplay- PvE Qs don't seem balanced at all, joining low level players with max level players- Selling items is a nonsensical mess, and can't be done directly from the inventory- While there are occasionally dialogue choices, they don't seem to have any impact- For a game so old, there are still quite a few bugs, typos, and general unintuitiveness- Seperate sets of controls for Ground and Space.  These would be better as an optional feature, since for the most part, these modes function identically- Almost all quests are identical.  Read a wall of text from an NPC, warp to an area in orbit around a planet, read another wall of text, fight in space, read another wall of text, beam to the ground, read another wall of text, ground combat, read another wall of text.  Every time.  Read another wall of text.			"

												As a startrek fan i was happy to come across this game, WARNING !!! This game involves tons and tons of grinding ! BE PREPARED ! The space battles are pretty what you espect it to be if you played like other startrek games where you are incommand of a ship for example ""starfleet command series"" STO continues the story about 30 years after voyager got home. And now with the new update it goes even furter then that. Since this is a free to play game, it has it's bugs and glitches some times it's pretty frustrating and somethimes it's doable. They have a ""cash shop"" and it's some times caught on sale pretty decent. compared to other MMO games. If want to enjoy the full exstend of this game be prepared to ""pay"" money for it. Like all f2p games the game design always ""force"" you towards ""paying with real money"" but it's a good game :D			"

												Am MMO that feels more like a single player game than a multiplayer.  Despite seeing players and their ships, most are ultra-casuals that play solo.  Queues are always dead.  No real advancement as you will be doing the same things after max lvl cap that you did to get there.  6 years of the same bugs, unreliable server setup and the mot god-awful, no respect for the playerbase support I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with.  Most support tickets are deleted without player contact unless one is verbally supportive of the company on twitter.Played for almost 3 years after it launched, left for 2 years, came back a few months ago...same game despite ""expansions"" that are no more than a new faceplate for the same tired grind.  The entire game is a grind and it never ends.  There is no endgame, only the same game.  Whatever new skills you learn or ships you fly, you will be using them on the same missions at lvl 60 that you ran at lvl 20.  You'll even need to run the same mission 2-5 times each (or more) to acquire all the items that can be rewarded...not diffferent missons for diffferent gear, the same missions, over and over and over again...then onto the next mission for multi-repeat runs.  Very limited inventory space with hundreds upon hundreds of wholly useless items that will keep your inv full non stop without buying more space or living in front of a vendor.  Player premium currency exchange market is so horridly out of control in price only long established players will really benefit from it before the servers are unplugged (the f2p is there but its a miserable experience now - in the first couple years it was quite good and the ""devs"" kept the market exchange balanced...they no longer do that.) Poor and dated graphics from a decade past that don't even begin to stress an old card like an HD6870 let alone ever even get a gtx 790 out of 1st gear.  Unavoidable cutscenes that make the replaying of missions miserable as you'll spend more time in cutscenes than in the gameplay of most. Sound effects that have  caps...the system can only process X# of sounds but in cases where there are more than it can provide to you it will skip, cut out and stutter while it decides which to make audible and which to mute.  The best sound cards on the market cant force the sounds the client cant process.  It is a click to win game with no skill of any kind required or even rewarded.  Mash the buttons and you cannot lose.   *case in point...I set a mission to advanced level and let my cat walk on the keyboard as I pet her...mission accomplished with no deaths :(  Elite is only more time consuming due to the sheer scaling of HP and resists for NPC's...they get entirely ridiculous...no challenge, just time.There is no more Trek here than in a star wars game, aside NPC names and ship models.  If you can get lost in a grind, this might be the game for you.  If you enjoy watching the same episode of a show 5 times before moving on to the next, it might be a game for you.  If you like to think about your gameplay, enjoy tactics, teamwork, or even communicating with people in an MMO during the few queued events you'll be able to partake in, this is probably not a game you'll enjoy.

												First of all: I love this game. The story is superb and as a die-hard Trekkie, I can vouch that the developers' attention to detail when it comes to the Star Trek Universe is marvellous. It is the continuation of the Star Trek series and films that never was, filling up holes in the story, piecing at first glance totally unrelated episodes together and creating a story as original and Star Trek to the core as you can get. Even the ""title theme"" is instantly recognisable as Star Trek, while being something completely new at the same time. The fact that a lot of known Star Trek actors (Leonard Nimoy - Spock, Tim Russ - Tuvok, Michael Dorn - Worf, etc.) lend their voices to their characters and you get to talk to them and fight alongside them makes my Trekkie heart beat a lot faster (one of the highlights for me was fighting alongside Voyager and traveling to the Mirror Universe).I have concentrated on the story so far as that is the most important aspect of a game to me. I am no expert in different aspects of gameplay and controls and the like, so I leave that to others. But I do enjoy that you have both ground and space fights. not to mention the diplomacy missions, allowing me to engulf myself in RPGing in my favourite fictional universe.So, if you are a Trekkie such as myself, this game is definitely for you. For everyone else, this is still a superb online game (stunning graphics for FTP) with an intriguing story (although you won't get all the in-jokes and references, don't worry, it's definitely not a game you can only understand after memorising each and every dialogue from all five shows and ten films - but maybe it will pieque your interest in Star Trek). I can definitely recommend it.EDIT: Oh, if you're wondering why I have spend so little time on this game if I love it so much: I don't always play it through Steam (gaming on Linux can be a tricky thing sometimes). But believe me, I have clocked A LOT of hours on STO.			"

												Micro transactions and In-game currency debacles have for the most part ruined my experience with this game. If you just want to do normal difficulty story missions and stop playing after that I say go for it. If you want to have any real kind of end game experience or be a part of any PvP matches then be prepared to farm for months if not years or spend hundreds of dollars. Fair warning.  "

												Space, the final frontier, these are the continuing wars of the  Alpha, Beta, and Delta quadrant where you will not explore, you will meet new civilizations every other season, who will have super beef with 'the federation' in fact everyone has beef with the 'Feds' you'll always be fighting, never exploring, you'll trade with other players, make future in game cash spend it [and real money] on snazzy ships, gear and weapons that you will use regularly, you'll join a fleet become an Admiral, work on R&D projects defend against enemies on mass battlefields in ground and space [or 4 ships then or other people on the ground] even play a fair few player made mission/stories then...the fizzle will start to go, you look into builds and make your ships and crew better, and it will come back for a while, then you see the imperfections, the nerfs on ships and gear, ugly ship designs, the same missions of mini raids you'll start to rinse and repeat, see more imperfections, new updates will feel superficial and after a while you'll play sto for a bit...then just turn it offIn the beginning [2010] sto was brilliant, raw, felt like Star Trek, even with f2p added, but these days it feels flat, uninspired, like busy work instead of fun, play 'Sto' for a while and you'll enjoy it, but know this, there is no end game, ground combat is slow and frumpy, and no matter what you'll do with shields, or all other gear you can upgrade you will be forever mega squishy, while the AI enemies will be uber tanky or be able do stupid things [like a single runabout being able to hold a dreadnought battlecruiser in a tractor beam!!]; you'll enjoy space combat for a while, but find pvp is somewhat dead unless with a fleet, in game chat is...odd at times, very odd [I would suggest minimizing chat unless on a fleet action aka s.t.f] the lock boxes and keys to open them = real money pit and in game money pit also, high end ships feel worth it [£25] for a while but, then someone can just as easily destroy you in a free ship, and then not so much. Take sto at a distance try not to get too involved, play it, enjoy it for an hour or two, and then turn it off.			"

												STAR TREK: ONLINE  - 8/10-Have Played for just under 18 hrs, loving it so far. its slightly like playing an offline version of EVE online (focus of both games are different). it has a compelling player Story; you leave your ship; you pick up and personalise crew; which go into combat with you on ground misssions; and assist in space warfare (which is my fav part of game BTW). Overall i've been impressed by the game especially since reading some of the bad reviews.  If you've been watching Star trek lately and are in the mood for some deep space exploration yourself. Give it a shot. I'll summersize the game's good and bad points, baring in mind i have only 17.7 Hrs logged into it so far.GOOD POINTS:. Space combat: customising and naming one of many diff ship types (that youll gain access to later on), and sending them into space to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up is REALLY fun!. Instanced missions: everything in the story is instanced, you feel like its YOUR story, there are no pugs hanging out in the BG messing with your immersion.. Awesome story: The games focus and rightly so! I've started as a romulan, and have been (so far) mainly doing story missions they have been well scripted, the parts that were voiced were ok/good. The content of the missions has been interesting (mainly becasue i get to blow a lot of things up in my ship) but also becasue the missions have weight and consequence. I was establishing homeworlds, negoticiating peace talks. The missions that did involve combat (most/all) elements all had meaning behind them. It definately wasnt a trashy roller coaster kill 100 sheep and report back system >=( so it has that going for it too!. In-depth Character customisation: Wont find many if any games that offer a better level of character customisation. you can literally create a new alien race that is playable on all three factions if you want to.BAD POINTS: . Takes a while to get the bigger and better ships.. When aquring/buying new ships, a lot of them have cash shop upgraded versions with extra station slots and in some cases exrtra weapon slots. (wont matter in cluster ♥♥♥♥ PVP much) but is still kinda pay-to-win-BS. As i wont be doing much PVP myself im not too bothered..Graphics are kinda poor, On Max it delivers all it needs to, the explosions look really nice and the ship weapons are pew-pewey enough, they pass but it would be nice if they were closer to E.V.E's standards.. U.I is kinda ugly, and sometimes confsuing (action bars'n'stuff). Warping. Costs a lot for new players to warp, so dont bother. (thankfully missions so far have been close enough) dont have to wait as long as E.V.E typically to arrive at new sectors.I'm having a lot of fun, i was expecting a terrible game and what i found was actually something very promosing. it wont blow you away, but you should have a nice experience early on anyway.

												*Review edited slightly due to a patch that added confirmation for skilltree choices, I'm not sure when exactly it was patched in.I've been on the fence about which way to lean for a long time, I want to recommend it because I've always been a big fan of Star Trek and this is the only ST MMO, but I just can't.To start with, it has consistently gone downhill since cryptic (the developer) was sold off by Atari and bought by perfect world international. Anyone familiar with PWI knows they're at about the level of nexon for terrible support, outrageous prices, and poor to nonexistent communication. Well, I'll give cryptic this, they do blog posts and announcements about everything, have frequent livestreams, and devs will occasionally chime in on forum topics, but when it comes to support? Good luck. You may or may not get a canned response when you submit a ticket, and may or may not ever get a real person to reply to you after you reply to the canned response, and they know their support is beyond terrible because they completely removed the satisfaction survey people could fill out after their support ticket was closed.The prices for most of the premium content is also ridiculous (especially ships.....$25-$30 per for endgame ships), and even things that are basic in most MMOs cost money here. Want to rename your character? Pay up. But the rename tokens don't even work properly and it shows your old name in a lot of in game dialogue. Did you pick a wrong skill somewhere in the newly revamped skill tree that just made things more confusing? Guess it sucks to be you, pay up for that reskill token. You can buy 30+ character slots, but the game has been made so alt unfriendly with all the reputations and specializations to grind for that it's mostly pointless to play more than one character anymore unless you're really hardcore and can juggle 2 or 3. And the expansion themed bundles? $130 for a few ships, a handful of costumes, maybe a title or two, and some master keys? I don't know about anyone else but I can't justify dropping $130 unless there's some physical goods to go with it.New ""content"" is frequently added to the game but it's almost always just a tie-in to some new cash item, most often gacha style lockboxes which aren't cash items themselves but require master keys to open, which are cash items. Lately any new features are just tweaks to or revamps of existing mechanics, which always cause a slew of bugs that get reported on the test server but usually make it into the live build anyway. Some bugs have been around for years and have never been fixed, eventually cryptic just gave up trying to fix most of them and either labeled them as ""working as intended"" like cloak deactivating on dialogue popups, or just decided to ignore them. This is compounded by the fact that all of the original devs either quit or were let go and the new ones have little knowledge of how the game's base code works. One of them even posted in a forum topic about bugs that ""working on STO was like trying to untangle spaghetti, you're going to end up with a mess no matter what you do.""Power creep has gotten so disgusting in STO that it's even hard for the devs to keep up with it. One of the most popular queued missions (Crystalline cataclysm advanced) has been broken because player damage output can get so high the boss with hundreds of millions of HP sometimes dies before one of the objectives can be completed. A lot of people just shrug and say ""oh well"", but when you consider that the objectives are tied to events that trigger at certain HP threshholds and it often dies before the first one finishes so the second one can trigger.....yeah. But instead of addressing the runaway damage output it gets buffed even more? It used to only be the hardcore elite players that could hit the 75k DPS mark, then it was 100k, now they're pushing 150k and people hitting 50-75k is becoming common. Instead of giving enemies better AI and more skills to use to mitigate or heal damage cryptic takes the lazy route and just increases HP and damage output for them, then puts out the next set of shinies to boost player damage output and the cycle repeats.The game was fun while Atari owned it, and still was for a while after, but it's been turned into just another cash cow that milks a popular franchise. There is very little ""Star Trek"" material in the game in it's current state aside from the general theme, if the ships and outfits were replaced with generic designs nobody would be able to tell it was a Star Trek themed game. There's no exploration (there actually was an exploration system but it was removed because cryptic decided it would be too much work to update it) and the theme to every mission is ""kill them all"", there's no diplomacy options that actually matter (there USED to be diplomacy missions and even first contacts with minor species, but they were removed for the same reason as exploration) since no matter what dialogue choices you make you don't affect the outcome of missions at all, it's basically just flavor text with no substance. The only reason I still play occasionally is I've invested too much time into it to throw it all away, so I log in every now and then to blow things up for a bit or chat with friends.TL;DR:If you think you'd like a generic grind MMO with a Star Trek flavor you may enjoy it, but if you're a Trek fan who's looking for a Star Trek themed MMO, sadly this isn't it.

												The greatest MMO experience I've ever had. I made it all the way to 50 without paying a dime and without feeling underpowered (I met some very generous folks along the way that gave me abosolutely essential tips). The community is the most generous and helpful I've ever experienced, and more oftne than not when you want to sell or buy, you'll get a fair deal. The gameplay is so grabbing, you'll never notice the grind. I actually hit level 50 with only finishing the first 3 missions, the game is just THAT fun to play. I finally did go back, and I discovered a great story, and some great levelled loot that made me greatful I waited until level 50 to pick up. I can't recommend this game more, so in appreciation of how much gameplay I got out of  this title I spent $30 and grabbed a nice Tier 5 ship, upgraded it to T5U, picked up a few Duty Officers, bought some custom skins, eventually ended up spending about $60 total, becasue I felt that this game was worth a full release title's price. Get it, and lose your functioning social life!			"

												Star Trek Online (STO) is one of those games for which I wish Steam had a category of recommendation between ""yes"" and ""no"". Frankly, it's not a bad game and is surprisingly well maintained for a title that's been around for almost a decade, and quite some of that time available as a free-to-play title as well.However, it hasn't really aged well. Sure, there have been patches and even graphical tweaks recently, but it is fairly obvous more often than not that the engine powering this game is really not made for high graphical fidelity. That's not really what irks me, though. What I find more disturbing is the unwillingness of the developers to retrofit the changes they make. When starting a new character (with the exception of 23rd Century Starfleet ones, but also these will get to this point eventually) you will proceed through a series of quests in which all that semi-fancy new lighting tech, heck, even facial animations, are just not there. At least not in cutscenes, which increases the preception of inconsistency even more. Nevertheless, I agree that this game, being an MMORPG, shouldn't be judged entirely solely on its graphics.So, how's gameplay? Well, mixed. In general, I tend to get the feeling that STO tries to cram incredibly many diverse systems into itself. Technically, that's cool - you get to fly spaceships around those parts of the galaxy known from the Star Trek franchise, and in addition you also get to beam down to planets and avdenture around there. Additionally, you also have a roster of officers that you can send off to special missions on which you have no further influence, but which can reward you nicely. And when your level is high enough, you can also do sort of the same with the spaceships you own as well. And then there's factions with which you can earn reputation for completing time-limited or daily missions... and there's still probably half a dozen systems I'm forgetting right now.But perhaps you can guess the problem with that: right, inconsistency again. Many of these features feel very ""glued on"" and one might not notice them at all, or stumble upon that tab over and over, but get told that one's level needs to be higher. Yet, a real explanation of how these subsystems tie into the big picture of the whole game somehow goes missing - in a way, Duty Officers and Admirality are so detached from the actual game that they make formidable meta-games by themselves. Again, that in itself is not bad, but I find it irritating.Oh, and one more thing that goes with all these subsystems as well: the UI. To be fair, I haven't been around for nearly as long as some of my friends and they tell me that the UI had received a major (and apparently well-received) overhaul not too long ago. Man, must that UI have been abyssmal before, given that it is still an ungodly mess. Took me around 50 hours to mostly figure it out, and I'm sure that there's still quite a bit more stuff I haven't even run into. The worst part of the UI definitely is its amnesia. Key binds are stored on a per-character basis, and of course space mode and ground mode (can) use different key binds for the same menus. Also, skill shortcuts, even those not specific to a certain type of ship, are not transferred to newly acquired ships, which often is noticed only when getting into the next skirmish and realising that instead of balancing your shields you're firing a weapon - before getting blown to space debris.My final point of criticism shall be directed towards the game's ""FTP"" economic system. Yes, it's free to play and most content can be accessed without the need to spend money on in-game premium currency. As with most FTP games, that approach becomes tedious at some point, so one may spend money on some shortcuts or convenience stuff. It's basically the same with STO. A positive point to me is that it never felt like pay-to-win to me. Sure, there is equipment (mainly ships) that you can only obtain with premium currency (which can, however, also be traded for one of the other three in-game currencies, speaking of unnecessary complexity in game systems), which never really seemed to have a really unfair advantage compared to the regularly available stuff to me, though (especially given that at least twice a year every regularly online player can obtain rather neat end-game ships for free as well). Nevertheless, while not qualifying as pay-to-win, STO's microtransactions are ridiculously expensive in terms of real money. Want to play more than five characters? Get two more slots for about 10 Euros. Want to have five more ship slots on a single character? Pay another ten. That's really not a lot of bang for your buck in my opinion. Worst about it is that most useful acquisitions you can make with real money are bound to a single character - so in case you're not planning to only extensively play a single character, getting some convenience stuff becomes quite expensive quite quickly.As you may be able to see, there's quite some stuff that's not really recommendable about STO. I will admit, however, that the devs put a lot of effort into some, in my opinion underappreciated details: In many story missions you'll encounter characters from various Star Trek series and movies, and many of them (especially many famous ones, like Scotty or Doc McCoy from TOS) have been voiced by their corresponding actors. There's been a lot of effort put into recreating many assets from series and movies as close to their originals as possible, and quite some attention to detail is visible in many places in the game. The story missions' writing I would call mixed. There is some witty and well-thought-out writing in some missions, others seem rather uninspired or implausible, however. Again, inconsistencies. Another tip: play in English. While localisations are functional, there are some ridiculous (and age-old) translation mistakes, at least in the German version, from what I know.TL;DR: STO is really not a bad game, but I can't really recommend it, mainly due to its horrible UI and cluttered overall experience. Given that it's free-to-play (but not really pay-to-win), it's still worth giving a try if you're Trekkie. If you're none of these, you'll probably only find an overburdened MMO which will provide a mediocre playing experience at best.To me personally, the interface is way too classically MMORPG-like. I'll play it for a while longer in order to get through all the quest content, and a bit more of the meta-game, but can't see me coming back to STO more often than irregularly afterwards.			"

												Beware!  Purchasing Zen via Steam will cause that currency to be locked for a week or more, usable only on items that are untradable (account bound).  That means you can't use the dilithium exchange.  This lock will last until ""your purchase has been confirmed in order to prevent fraud.""  I am currenty at the seven day mark.  I tried to purchase more zen from the official website immediately following and that was locked also even though it has a confirmation number.  Filing a GM ticket will not correct this, as PWE really wants you to not use Steam for purchases.			"

												I love this game. I have about 450 hours logged through Arc and still enjoy playing this game. It does have its flaws though. PVP is dead. The balancing for it was so bad that even the Devs admitted that it isn't what they wanted for it, but only have vague ideas on how to fix it with no immediate plans to make changes. Also the cost of the fancy ships are a bit ridiculous. You could pay the price of an entire game for how much you can spend on one measly ship. That being said, you absolutely don't need to drop a single red cent to play this game all the way to the end without trouble. I never have and enjoy all the end-game PvE queues and battlezones. Seasonal events give free players the opportunity to have end-game ships with a bit of grinding. Honestly, I feel like many Star Trek fans are just some of the hardest to please people on the planet. The game is hardly perfect but I find it enjoyable overall.			"

												For a while, I said I'd never come back to this game after Delta Rising and the whole T6 debacle. But I keep coming back to this as my main MMO, and I never realized why until coming back from SWTOR for a while and just seeing how much endgame content there was. I'll admit, I've bought more than a couple ships in this game, and sometimes I regret it, but most of the time I'm really glad I've helped the game's development and survivability by buying those ships. There's so many things you can do with them to change them up, try different things on the many endgame raids and such. There's tonnes of endgame content in this game, and I'd recommend it purely for that.			"

												My Original Review was Pre_Drelta Rising. I am updating this review to give people a fair chance. Read my original review and see how my attitude has changed, compare with other more recent reviews. I will Try to Keep it short.Game Has too many bugs that can be fixed any more, within a reasonable amount of time that is and of course it would Cut into cryptics profits too much.Delta Rising is basically another name for ""Prices are rising"" - the prices themselves havent changed, but now in order to be competetive you need to spend cash on this game, or you can spend the next 2 years grinding away for all the equipment and ships you need. 2 Years is not exagerating either, I had Top end ships and equipment before DR and after i would need to spend 6 months grinding to get close to it again.STO's Developers are the worst Developers I have ever seen in a game, never mind an MMO that basically requires player Feedback in order to improve. The Dev's have openly stated that do not take player feedback and generally ignore the player base because negative feedback makes them feel bad....Well they should feel bad, having their heads burried in the sand for long they have turned a Great PvE and PvP game into a boring repetative game that basically says ""We are Free to play - but you HAVE to give us all your money to have the best of the best"". I'm all for paying some cash now and again even in an F2P game, so are others, if you like the game and enjoy it people are willing to put some cash in every week or month or however long to support the game and the Devs who made it, but why should we now after all this?.....I would be surprised if there was an orignal Developer left at Crptic now....most of them have left and Cryptic covered this up with ""They were moved to another department"". I loved this game, spent a lot of money and hours on it. I fell like these Devs have destroyed the Once great STO and I wish for the Life of me CBS would Pull the license from cryptic and sell it to someone more competant as it isnt even Star Trek any more..... I cannot reccomend this game to any one....unless they want another full time job and have atleast $70 cash per week spare to throw at this....even if you do, dont give it to people who dont listen.....Farewell STO, I hope to you see taken on by a more intelligent, not entirely money driven Dev Team...Original Review below for Context:Good All around and a true ""Free to Play"" MMO game, There are many things to do and content is generally upgraded quartly, but you can always get a heads up by visiting their test server (Tribble Server).The content (if you play for hours and hours each day) will last you about 1 month as you play the story content to level your character up to 60 (max level), beyond this you start reputation and specilisation systems which all though are a grind (found in many MMO's), do give you access to some of the best gear and ""special powers"" in the game.To add to more ""free"" top-end items you can join a fleet, either start one from scratch with friends and build your Starbase and Fleet Holdings (extra Starbase maps) from the ground up (will take a long time depending on how many active players you have/recruit or how much money you decide spend), or you can join an already Top Tier Fleet and have instant access to some of the best equipment the game has to offer, this includes ships also.Some of the best ships are only accessible from Lockboxes which are opened by Keys (125 Zen from the Z-store or around 2.3 million Energy Credits ""EC's"" on the Exchange) or from the Exchange - (Trading Part of the Game) - in which you need energy credits the ingame currency in which to trade with players for those ships/items and also for certain craftable items and rep systems.As the above statement may make it seem you have to spend money this is a part truth, spending money is a shortcut, if you have the time and patience you can spend the time and effort grinding out another in game currency ""Dilithium"" which can be earned in a number of ways, not only does this currency buy you some sub-top level ships and used for top level items, it can also be traded in the Dilithium Exchange - this is a player driven market in which Zen is traded for Dilithium and Vice Versa. So in essance....you don't need to spend a penny on this game if you have the time....The content is replayable up to a point, you WILL get bored eventually but more content comes out all the time which will quench your thirst for Trek. PvP on the other hand had the potential - but various new contents and implimentations have virtually made it a never ending Power Creep which I Believe will never end - As an advocate of PvP and its community this disapoints me, resulting in my dimihsed hours of late. One day i may return but for now the game has lost my interest even with the new content, Until PvP once again becomes playable that is.All in all - the graphics are good (except in space pvp where with multiple players using many abilities the games engine is unable to to cope with the amount of particle data being flushed in). Content is good and has replay value for even experienced players.Hardcore players will get bored quickly as they usually are drawn to PvP. PvE Players will love the content and play for years.Make no mistake...you will spend money at some point for something cannot resist....As with any game it could stand to get some improvements - in my opinion it doesnt have enough open world exploration that we all expect from Star Trek...""To boldy go where no man has gone before"". There are no new worlds or civilizations to discover except for what the developers release as new conetent, so having an open ""universe"" to explore with random events rather than scripts would be awesome.Despite the flaws of PvP there is still and active community - Check out my Youtube Channel and if you play for PvP join the community (OrganizedPvP - in game chat channel) - www.youtube.com/STOWillPvPForFood is my channel and the official channel of OrganizedPvP.Hope you find this review useful guys - i wrote as much as i could with out writing a full 10 page review xD.Ingame Handle - Parker@jacknm1			"

												The first 50 levels are actually really good.  The plot is great, the spaceship combat is unique and innovative, and you can even replay it with a new character type for decent replayability.  The catch is, the endgame is basically P2W.  To be more specific, you can work hard for anywhere from 2 to 6 months (I've never had the patience for the latter), or you can fork over twenty bucks, just to get a new ship that's the appropriate grade.  Up until then, you get regular free upgrades every ten levels, but the last one is at level 40.  They really want to get players to pay up.  In fact, even if you don't pay a cent, the only way to get tier 5 or 6 ships is via purchasing things from other players who did, in actuality, pay for what you're getting for free.  This is so they (the other players) can get cash faster by paying real money for in-game money in a round-about fashion.To summarize:Pros:Great PlotGreat Early to Mid GameModerate ReplayabilityCustomization of Skills and AppearanceLots to do!Star Trek lore for the hardcore fans, but not too shabby for us casual fans.Awesome space combat, decent ground combat.Cons:Endgame Gear requires either ludicrous amounts of grind, or lots of cash.Endgame content is highly repetitive.DPS players are often elitist, ignoring the importance of teamwork and other team roles.Game difficulty spikes endgame (because you don't have the right ship for your tier - rectified (?!) by paying $20).Overall, I'd suggest to play it and have fun while you can, but be ready to bail when it gets too repetitive or troublesome.  Or, y'know, blow your money on this game and auto-win, but then you've got no content left anyways since you just skipped it, soooo...			"

The combat system is very good, you get to fight both on the ground and in space. The character creation is a very important aspect for me in an MMORPG, and it does more than pleasing me. The quests usually aren't boring stuff that you do to level up. Not the best MMORPG I've ever played but it's still worth checking out.			"

												This game does a decent job of being entertaining sadly the dialouge feels bland after the first game ""arc"" as i call them after that it feels like faction choice never mattered. Star Trek Online's free to play model is very friendly to free players since you only loose access to some races for the Federation you can't play as a Klingon, Catian, Joined Trill, for the Klingon Defense Force you can't play as a Ferasian and Joined Trill, and for the Romulan Republic you can't play as a Reman so you aren't missing much unless you like those races. The class system is decent since any race can be any officer (Tactical, Engineering, and Science) and each class can get kits which allow you to pick the skills you want to use the highest is 5 kit skills after level 50 after that any skills you gain later are inherent skills that can be upgraded but racial traits change depending on what class you choose and while this is good it makes all classes seem the same after you start picking traits yourself.

												Star Trek Online is by far one of the best MMOs that I have played.Personally, I'll try out an MMO for a couple hours, maybe play here and there later, and then uninstall because I've lost interest. But not this.Cryptic has done a great job in developing this game. There are a few bugs here and there, but nothing too game-breaking. The story is very well done and is the part that keeps my attention. The leveling is also stellar, in most MMOs you'll sit there for hours and hours grinding to get to the next level. Or it sets you on a quest and the area is for level 20+ and you're level 10, you'll have to grind for days just to get to progress the story. Not with STO.Each mission in STO does require you to be a certain level, BUT each mission also levels you up just enough to get to the next. And with the DOFF system (which is very easy to get the hang of) is an easy way of getting XP. I've known a few players who have gotten some of their characters to max level and not even leaving their faction's homeworld by using the DOFFs. The story is also interesting to say the least, it wasn't so good that I couldn't keep it off my mind, but it was good enough to keep coming back.TL:DR The story is great, the developers are cool, and the leveling is stellar.9/10			"

												The older this game gets the further it evolves away from the guiding principles of Star Trek. Where people don't work to get rich but to better themselves. Where exploration is the main goal. This game is getting more and more battle oriented and is all about getting currency. Be it Energy Credits, Dilithium, Lobi Crystals, Marks, various Commodities and Resources. Not counting the pay to win part where you have to spend real money to but ships and gear. The two faction Federation and Klingon uses ships from all kinds of species in their fleets, except each others. Be it Hirogen, Kazon, Undine, Ferengi or Cardassian. There is a semi-faction for the Romulans but they have been forced to be part of either the Federation or Klingon fleets. All the game is about now is grinding.			"

												I decided to play this game on a whim awhile back. I tried to play this game before about a year or two ago and it was just a  screwed up cluster of junk on my screen. Now that I have come back and tried to play it again, it seems that a lot has been changed for the better in my opinion.The grind wasn't that bad at all. I never found myself having to grind because of being underleveled and whatnot. By playing the episodes and playing on the event weekends (2x weekends, etc), I easily made it to Lv 55 in about 100 hours. Keep in mind that I casually played this game for about 2 - 3 hours a day.The only thing I bought was 2k Zen, so I could buy my favorite ship, the Excelsior Refit Class. I was Lv 50 when I bought it. I could have gone with a T6 ship, but I already had the free Kobali Cruiser and I prefer the Excelsior Refit due to it's dashing good looks.If there is one big problem with the game, it would be the ground missions. The ground mechanics are extremely boring. They really should focus on just scrapping the current ground system and re-building it with a more dynamic/controllable.			"

												Don't let the low play time irritate you guys. I played this game almost from release and only a week before I finally quit it (Dec 2014) for good I added it to steam so I don't have to Alt-Tab every time someone texts me.It used to be the best game ever in the entire universe. Everybody who played during the first couple seasons will agree with that.Then PWE took over and thrashed it.From what I hear there is no end to this agony, so I decided to stick the boot right in and write a review myself. Not being a man of many words, there is not much else to add. People who played and especially PVPed in this game exactly know why I and many many other started quitting the game after PWE took over.If you never played STO before, then there is only one advice I can give you: run, run as fast and as far as you possibly can away from this game.Its business model is following: everything is for free and you can obtain literally every single item in this game without spending a single Dollar, Euro, Pound, Banana or whichever is your country's currency. Sounds great, right? It is in fact great if you have a lifetime to wait for crafting and reputation missoins while you endlessly grind for dilithium. Of course you can accelerate this process by shoving your real world money up PWE's rear exit. We are not talking 2 Dollar microtransactions, no my friends, we are talking big money here.If you even dream of being something remotely close to competitive in this game then you already play it for at least 2 years and know exactly what you're doing, or you have thousands of Dollars, Euros etc ready to be thrown at PWE.To people who love and enjoy at least decent PVP matches: According to PWE's PR person ""The PVP community consists of 14 year olds living in their mum's basement"". And that's also pretty much how PWE treats PVP in this game. The Queues may pop but what you find there is P2W spam deluxe.Final verdict: Would not even force my special friend Geko to play it, that's how bad it is now.			"

												Don't mind the almost 500 hour game time. I have WAY more hours logged on this game, it's just that I had been using the non-steam game and launcher for a LONG time until I finally figured out it was also on steam. meh. Okay ladies and gentlemen, I've gotta put first things first. This game is NOT, I repeat, NOT, pay to win. Now keep reading.Anyway, let me get straight to the point. If you've never seen Start Trek before you'll be confused at first, because of the fact that you don't know $#!T about anything going on, and you won't understand almost anything in the game. However, the game does an excellent job of introducing all of the storylines and basically everything in the Star Trek universive to you, so basically, if you play this game long enough, you'll become a Trekkie, without even having watched any of the shows.STO also has great missions, which are very immersive and interactive. Once you're done with one storyline, there'll always be many more to complete, as the STO team uploads new ones almost every 2-3 months. (Don't quote me.) This game is absolutely free to play, which is of course, awesome. Every single weapon and ship can be aquired through a great system. Time and effort. Of course, it'll take much less time to aquire certain ships by purchasing them with Zen Points (Currency that is bought with real money), but it all depends on how you'd like to approach the game. I personally have not made a single ship purchase with Zen Points, and I still have a very strong ship that is capable of taking on any foe. The game also has two im-game currency systems, Energy Credits and Dilithium. You'll be using these two currencies to buy most of your ships and equipment. Both of these currencies are easy to earn and the prices for items are never too high. It has a great ranking-up and skill-tree system, and also has great PvP missions and PvE missions as well. And in PvP, your'e paired up with people of the same level, so you won't get obliterated by people who are much higher ranked than you.There are many many things that I haven't mentioned in this review. The devs have put a great amount of time and effort into this amazing game and I think that they deserve praise for it.       But to sum it all up, you get to run around, shoot lasers at people, shoot bigger lasers at ships, get in game credits, buy really cool things, shoot at people more, and play Dabo. Yes, dabo. This game has gambling. What more do you want? Now download the dang game.			"

												Here's the short version; An MMO set in the Star Trek universe that does not really feel like true Star Trek much at all.Allow me to explain in the long version. This review is aimed at hardcore Trek fans that enjoy proper immersion.You go through a rank system; you get given command of your first ship at the first true rank; ensign. There's mistake number one! No one becomes captain of a ship at ensign!The game is 95% combat. No exploration or discovery and a there's a mere smidgen of diplomacy. They removed the exploration features in the game some time ago. If you're into Trek as much as I am, it would be nice to have a ratio of at least 60% combat, 40 exploration and diplomacy. Part of Star Trek as we all know, was about exploring strange new worlds, seeking out new life and new civilisations and boldly going where no one has gone before. You can play some player made Foundry missions which feature exploration, but nothing from the devs themselves.There are no real decisions to make in your actions and through dialogue. Every mission ends up the same way no matter what option in the dialogue menu there is. If anyone reading this has played Star Trek: Tactical Assault, you know that picking dialogue options actually affected situation outcomes and whether you got a gold or silver rating by playing how a real captain should. That key part of being a captain of a starship has been removed.Also, it seems that your bridge officers appear to be much more qualified to be captain than you are. In every mission they practically determine what you have to do or you've picked up some gear that must be used to succeed. There is virtually no decision making that comes from your own mind on how to approach a situation and act accordingly. All you do is basically shoot first and ask pointless questions interspersed that don't change anything.Severe damage to a ship seems reparable in a minute with no penalty to how your ship performs. This allows people to just stroll in and absorb all the fire with no concern to how or how much the ship is damaged. I'm sure the crew of your ship would be ready to abandon you over letting them die needlessly. I would prefer it if crew were reimplemented but became a much more integral part of gameplay such as if lose half your crew, you won't be so efficient. But they also removed crew back in the season ten update. I would prefer it if your damage carried through until the end of a mission. Also, if damage affected systems like EPS conduits and weapons banks and the like, throwing you into a state of heightened panic of your ship being blown to smithereens.Another thing I dislike is the ability to push your ship far beyond its designed specifications through the use of abilities that can instantly repair hull or rapidly regenerate shields. I don't dislike all abilities, some of them definitely make sense and are acceptable, but there are a few which one bridge officer could not pull off.Apparently you can just change out parts of your ship no worries without spending months in spacedock. Warp reactor not up to your standards, just remove and replace, simple as that. Ships are designed and constructed with certain components, some of those can't be removed easily. I would prefer it if you were assigned a ship and forced to stay with the default layout. It just helps with the immersion that you're not a revered captain but instead, just there to do your job.And now, this brings me to my final point. Your ship's weapons and shields are always charged and ready to be put to use. Way to go trying to avoid a hostile situation with all your weapons armed and pointing at the other ship. There are also no alert statuses so you can't select between green, yellow and red alerts; which is undoubtedly one of the integral parts of Star Trek's combat. Yelling red alert and 'charge weapons, energise defense fields' was something I was looking forward to, but alas, doesn't exist.So that ends the long version of my review. If you like to be immersed in a game full of Star Trek, go and play Star Trek Tactical Assault or something else, not Star Trek Online. The feel of Star Trek is squandered by the limitations and playstyle of an MMO.			"

												Honestly the space combat is wonderful, a beauty to play and if that was all that was in the game I would recomemd this game to everyone that I know. The thing is the ground combat is very unpolished, trully making those sections very boring and tedious.  The other issues I have are that the design of the ground spaces and the very little help of the mini-map make even getting through the tutorial a chore.			"

												I have no idea why I like star trek online. As it is its a grind fest to do anything with real money and to get a tier 6 ship it's 30 bucks at the minimum and it's only for 1 character on the account. The in game economy is highly inflated compared to real world Germany after WW2. But the space combat is fun as well as hitting borg with a sword when wearing a environmental suit but that's only fun for how weird it looks. The player community is nice and helpful as well. "

Has its ups n downs. Lots of friendly people and some unfriendly. If you like space mmo its fun for awhile at least. Probably abit laggy if you dont have a good computer with a good connection.

												If you are not well versed in the Trek Universe, mainly the concepts regrading the technology you will not enjoy the game.  Don't bother and go play World of Warcraft or some other MMORPG that you are more equipped for.    It's basically like any other MMO these days, just using the Star Trek skin. Without the Star Trek knowledge you will find barely any fun and a very large learning curve in regards to weapons, ship and player abilities and so on.   If you ARE a trekkie and have not yet played, then you are not an actual trekkie.			"

Posted: April 8, 2015
												Reviewing Star Trek Online is an interesting experience, because it's a little hard to put my finger on why I play it sometimes.Let's start with the basics: it's an MMORPG.  In a lot of ways, it's a very conventional RPG; a levelling system, more grind than a flour mill, regular bug-filled updates (which, to be fair, get fixed pretty quickly - the big, noticeable ones, at least).  It's also got two and a half factions which don't like each other, and since it's F2P, it's loaded with microtransactions.It marks itself out with having both space and ground mechanics, being almost entirely instanced, and through being Star Trek.  Let's face it, if you're here, you're almost certainly a Trekkie to begin with.The cons:1. 'Micro'transactions.  This game is not cheap.  I've played over 400 hours and not bought anything from the C-store, and I don't feel particularly helpless, but endgame ships will set you back around $40.  Admittedly that's a one-off payment, and any future characters can use that ship without restriction, but it's still a fairly large investment.2. Endgame balance is horrible.  The Special Task Force missions (read: raids) have almost dead public queues due to horrific imbalance in capability between a newly minted Lvl 60 player and an experienced and well-equipped endgame player; we're talking not a difference of 25% or so, but in the order of 1000% or more.  This has a few nasty side-effects for obtaining important gear; not insurmountable, but certainly frustrating.3. Complexity curve.  The game itself is relatively simple, but there are a lot of behind-the-scenes mechanics that are not even slightly self-evident.  These aren't a big obstacle to gameplay until lvl 50 or so, but it can make the experience feel sluggish and frustrating.  Browsing of the STO reddit is highly recommended if you want to stick with the game.4. Ground combat is subpar.  I personally don't think it's as bad as some people make out, but it's not nearly as fun as space stuff.  There are a few exceptions (personal cloaking devices combined with plasma flamethrowers are immensely entertaining) but it just doesn't feel as polished and developed.  Fortunately it's also a lot more forgiving in general.With that in mind, let's get to the reason why I keep coming back to this thing.1. Space combat is excellent.  Once you get used to the interface (I know some people find it awkward) it's very fluid.  As a long-time Eve Online player, I can honestly say that I prefer the STO mechanics; managing flight controls, a wide variety of offensive and defensive powers, and wrestling with keeping the enemy lined up with your weapons while keeping your shields boosted is a wonderful challenge.  It's also pretty as sin and really feels like Star Trek.  Diving at a Borg cube as the Defiant with all cannons blazing or seeing phaser fire bloom off your Galaxy as you maneuver at a stately pace around a hostile D'deridex is a great feeling.  Some of the powers also really give a suitably epic feel.  Using Torpedo Spread engulfs entire enemy squadrons in fields of photon torpedoes, while Fire At Will will make every beam you have fire at every enemy in range.2. Flexibility.  When making a character, you pick faction (Federation, Klingon or Romulan) and a 'class'; Tactical, Science or Engineering.  In World of Warcraft, that would be it: you'd have just picked your playstyle for the rest of the game.  Not so here; your class only governs a set of basic powers you have, and what powers you can use in ground combat.  You still have the full range of ships, weapons, secondary powers and equipment available.  Just because you picked an Engineering 'tanky' character doesn't stop you from flying glass cannon Defiants, and a high-damage Tactical can use the resilient, sluggish Galaxy.3. Events.  This is the one saving grace for all the high-cost real-money ships; on a regular basis, you'll be able to grind for special limited event ships.  These are high-end and very effective; one of the recent ships is considered by some to be one of the tankiest ships in the game.4. The story is actually pretty good.  MMO storylines tend to turn me off; they're clunky and ignorable.  While that certainly applies to a fair amount of STO, there are some excellently crafted set-pieces and missions.  Being kidnapped and brainwashed, seeing friends massacred after a peace conference goes wrong - and let's not forget the Romulan tutorial, where everyone you know is killed or kidnapped as you barely escape in a rusting hulk of a warbird.  Mass Effect it ain't, but I've been pleasantly surprised.5. Speaking of which, you can tell that it's written by real Star Trek nerds.  Despite an incredible range of enemies, locations and concepts, just about everything can be tied into one of the episodes or movies.  Two of the endgame enemies are spun off from a couple of stand-alone episodes of Voyager, but they feel in-character and match up with what we saw of them in the series.  The Elachi, a recurring enemy for Romulan players, were designed from a single episode of Enterprise where we barely saw them, but the elaboration works perfectly.  Creepy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  You'll also hear some very familiar voices - Worf, Sela, Harry Kim, Tuvok, Spock (RIP) and a fair number of minor characters from the series have lent their voice talents.6. Levelling is fairly painless.  I remember attempting to get through WoW and giving up around Lvl 40 (Lich King era).  By comparison, STO has far fewer missions, and you can get a character to Lvl 50 in a week's casual play.  50-60 is a lot more tedious, but it's a lot less noticeable; you've unlocked all the important things, and it would be fair to say that the game really starts at 50.  Everything prior has been a warm-up tutorial.7.  Endgame gear.  Many games require endless farming of a given boss in the hopes of a drop.  STO completely drops this idea; endgame gear is all obtained from Fleet (guild) equipment or the Reputation system.  Endgame content merely provides the means to afford this equipment.  It's entirely predictable, and I personally would prefer to know that I need ten runs to get what I want, rather than roll the dice of potentially getting it first time, but likely needing to run fifty times.  I get enough RNG nonsense from Warframe.In conclusion... STO is by no means a perfect game.  That said, I would be comfortable in saying that it's one of the better offerings on the market.  Give it a week, and you'll be pleasantly surprised - or at least, you won't be bemoaning your lost time.			"

												I wanted a new MMO experience, and as a hardcore trek fan, I immediately leapt to this game thinking that it would satisfy the itch. While undoubtedly more loyal to its source material than any other star trek game I've ever played, this game really does count on its franchise name, rather than the actual merits of the game, to draw players in and create the experience. One of the very first enemies the starting missions will have you fight are the borg, which I and the NPC ship that was joining me for the quest defeated easily. The game constant throughs the most terrifying and iconic aliens of the Star Trek franchise at you (such as the borg, species 8472, the klingons, ect.), as if to remind you that this is in fact a star trek game, and you merciliously gun them all down. Part of what made those enemies so terrifying on the show was just how out-matched the federation ships were against them. When you see a borg cube one your screen, you should be weeping and just as scared as Picard was when he faced off against them, not happily blow one up after another with two other ships. The appearance of these enemies strikes me as fanservice--and bad fanservice at that, which there is plenty of throughout the game (did I mention that the captain you work under in the starting zone constaly refers to you as his Number 1?) If they had spent even half the time they spent thinking up stupid references trying to balance the combat and making the multiplayer exciting (which, by the way, you'll either be curb-stomping your way through or getting curb-stombed, there is no in between or concept of ""fair fights"" or ""evenly matched"" opponents, but no one really does PvP anyway) they'd have a great game one their hands. In trying to make the game as ""iconic"" as possible, and not spending more time working on how to make the game as diverse, challenging, and as balanced as possible, the devs really delivered a watered-down Star Trek experience here. TL;DR?Beam me up, Scotty! There's no Star Trek game down here worth playing!			"

												If you wished that star trek was all about blowing stuff up, this is your game, otherwise, eh. It's really hard to actually roleplay as a captain when all you do is go in, destroy some stuff, go out. No choice in the RPG aspect, only what ships and subsystems to use. The space combat is actually pretty fun, and the reason I play the game to this day.			"

Otherwise it's fun with nice space portions and ground is kinda there to.It has multiple Classes: Tac - the useful dd one, Engineer - implodes less than the others and Science - which is the heal/cc guy which is kinda just there. Also you can choose your ship independantly from your class so yay for squishy tanks and DDs trying to tank and going boom.In short I like this and recomend it, unless you have, like me, that ""oh shiny new ship"" sickness.

												My relationship with this game is love hate based I love the new story arc they have introduced, however the grind really takes the wind out of my trekkie sails, it's a shame really because the scope for really good pvp is there they just need to be let free with dev and community ideas. These days though despite what the last ep said earlier in the year the power creep and blatent money grab in order to compete at the top is just too much which is funny since it does claim to be f2p for the most part lol. Now I understand they have to make money but it shouldn't  feel like we are all being shook for cash!			"

												Vast and complex universe, lots of playstyles supported, most content optional, buggy.There's a ton of content to play without paying a dime, but PVP and the highest-end PVE has a ""pay or grind to win"" element.Vast open universe (which lost significant content in the form of ground and space nebula missions that were evidently too hard to maintain) with various regions - be aware the regions do have difficulty levels. The ""season"" story missions scale with your level but do so unevenly, and rewards do not always scale. Fleet membership offers potential huge bonuses but requires a lot of resources.The ships are amazing (some of them), many of the story missions are too, a few are insanely irritating. You can skip many story missions. There is a ""reputation"" system that is pretty grindy but offers a lot of rewards.There are bugs in this game that have gone unfixed for *years* and impact play, rarely is there a response to a trouble ticket, dev does not put enough resources into maintenance.Game works remarkably well on low-spec hardware (played on a T2390 laptop with X3100 graphics and a Turion 64 1.8 with ATI X300) this is largely because of the ability to turn graphics down to where they look like a mid-90s game!The low spec capability and huge amount of story keep this game a recommend, the bugs almost doomed it.

There is alot of differences. you can create you own missions for instance. and let other people play it. When it comes to MMOs like this there is 1 downside and indeed Star trek online suffers from that: Grinding for Levels. However. the Locations it provides for these Grindextravaganzas variate alot. like you got Borg Infested Defera for instance. I give this game a solid 7/10 rating and i do reccomend people to play this.			"

Posted: August 20, 2016
												I've played this game so much I need to justify my time with a review before people start looking at my play time and believe I somehow enjoy this game enough to endorse it and encourage others to play it.To make this clear - no, I do not think you or anyone else should play this game no matter how much time I spent and possibly continue spending in this game.This is a subpar MMO and doesn't even get good marks on the sci-fi MMO scene with several other examples being higher in quality and time investment.  The game's mechanics are at this point extremely dated and were dated when the game was released.  At this point, the developers have no idea which direction to take the game or what sort of players to encourage, satisfied with keeping things in the status quo.As far as value goes, the game is free to play and free to patch.  However, a lot of things in the game require a bit of investment from actual money out of your actual wallet.  Current ships and equipment with current mechancics require you to either pay for them or to grind the real money currency with in-game activities.  This grind will take an extremely long time as there is a currency cap which makes you either buy more character slots or wait a long, long time to buy a current ship.  This extends to everything out of the cash shop - which you need to go to for end-game ships, you either need real money, a lot of time grinding the time gated currency, or a lot of time spent grinding the in-game currency.  If you're smart you'll be able to do it, you'll also understand the way you're being gamed by the system and may feel disinterested in continuing.The combat and mechanics are a little dated, the graphics are servicable enough but there are some crash problems on modern systems, and older systems, and systems where you don't set the graphical options properly.  Ground combat is hilariously imbalanced, and space combat is ok, if a bit clunky.  Other space sims have much better and fluid mechanics, but this is a combat transitioned to an MMO and ok is a passable requirement.The endgame in this game is a repitition of the same short instanced encounters and a lengthy reputation grind to get better and better gear with the future promising more grinds and rep tracks.  You can also grind currency or spend time goofing off with friends.  As far as the choices go, goofing off with friends and nerding out about star trek is probably the preferable activity.The game is not without its positives.  The missions, while set up with pre-planned and cut-and paste mechanics are very well written and enough care has been put in the story to entertain and keep any fan of star trek playing.  In my opinion the writing in the Romulan storyline is one of the best written things you'll find in sci-fi gaming.The other thing I enjoyed or found surprisingly enjoyable was the mission editor.  This is one of the few MMOs with a mission editor and user-created content.  Some of the content is terrible but some of the content is very well done and well written by the community.  Playing around in the mission editor can be something rewarding for anyone with the patience required to develop interesting work.In all, this is a very poor MMO which I don't think anyone should play.  Much of the gameplay is pulled from and copied from other MMO's and replicated in an inferior form.  The Star Trek content can have some interest for fans, but it will lack the staying power to keep you involved.  The only reason it has its hooks in me is because its one of the few Star Trek games you can find.  Even if you are interested in it for the star trek content, you should still just play the missions for the story and forget about the rest of the game when you run out of story content.			"

												                Lots to say about this game. I have been watchikng Star Trek since I was little and still I do today even when I was born in 2000. The customization is great. I love it. Tons of people you can be, backstories to make, and adventures to unfold. I will admit the tutorial for me was a little blad it was the normal walk there, then walk back, then go fix something then walk back, but I still loved every second of it. Me being a huge pve player loved this game because of its pve. This isnt a normal Sci-fy mmo game. This consists of WoW, Defience, Star Wars:The old republic, and some other mmo favriotes. Not only for its quests but for the story line that goes along with it. The features are great for example, Oh your bored just walking on land? Why dont you go into your own personalized ship and fly around for a while. This is all I should have to say to get people to play this game I mean, what other game can let you fly YOUR own ship around the universe? Enjoy my fellow gamers.			"

												Ok so I love the intellectual property of Star Trek.  I greatly enjoy the ship based EVERYTHING of this game, and on the strength of that alone is why I played it so much.  Unfortunately, the ground missions, the controls, and a lot of nuances within the game are not very friendly to new players.  By this I mean there is not a lot of in game tutorials with how to get ahead with regard to end game content (resources, factions, etc), and I ended up seeking a lot of information online & on youtube.  This is forgivable to my mind, but did make for some moments of ""what is this in my interface, and how can I use it?"".Bottom line if you enjoy Star Trek this is definitely worth a try.  With it also being free to play there is no downside.  Leveling is not a chore, and the story arcs / seasons kept me interested & moving forward.			"

												STO has had it's problems. On release it was buggy with poor controls and balancing. I'm pleased to say that the issues are mostly in the past, and the transition to free to play has been handled very well. I've put a huge amount of time into this one, and have greatly enjoyed my experience both alone and with friends (although being an MMO, friends are recommended). There is an entertaining mix of ground and space combat, and branching dialogues with plenty of customisation options for your character, ship and play style. Due to the numerous and ongoing updates there is now a pretty large amount of content to play through and keep you entertained.To date I've never felt like I HAD to buy anything using real cash. From the starting levels through to the endgame, everything can be completed without paying a dime. There are a fairly large selection of ships, outfits and other customisation options which do require you to shell out some cash, however there is never the feeling of ""pay to win"". Should you be willing to spend a little, Cryptic have catered well and there are some items which you may enjoy. All in all, a solid free to play game. Worth a look - and for free, why not?			"

Two level 50 characters. I'm not a hardcore gamers in STO, I only play because I enjoy it, and I enjoy star trek.When I first started the game I was a bit annoyed that the federation and Klingons were at war, I also didn't like the whole romulus as gone bloom. I would have preferd a game set right after Nemisis, were Feds and klingons were allied as they were after DS9.I would have preferd it to be more Dominion, less borg, less romulan. I get they are trying to be everything star trek. But trying to cram every lore from star trek into the game, is to much. I would have preferd it to simply add to the aftermat of Dominion wars. not all this other stuff.But all this is smaller stuff, it's still the best star trek game made. its stll my favorite and only MMO I can play.

												Star Trek Online has made a lot of improvments over the last five years.  What started out as a clunky mess full of good ideas and half formed systems has been refined, remade and polished into one of the most fun Free to Play MMOs out there.  Space and Ground combat has been redesigned to be fun and challenging rather than plodding and tedious and the rate of expansions and new Episodes (story missions) means that there is always somethign new to try.That's not even taking into account the wealth of player created content in the Foundry missions (some of which are excellent) and the option to make missions yourself!  The game offers a lot of options and different activities with enough to meet the desires of almost every player type, Crafting, PVP, RP, PVE and even raiders.  Give it a download and have some Trek fun!Live Long and Prosper			"

												 Can I just say, if you really love Star Trek, and you really love  MMORPGs, you will love this game. I am a huge fan of anything science fiction. When i discovered this game and found out that you can captain your own ship, I nearly exploded from excitment. The game did not disapoint. In the following paragraphs I will state things I enjoy about this game, and the very few cons that I have.          Pros- This game lets you captain a starship and fight any enemy the federation has ever faced. You fight Klingons, Romulans, Borg, Gorn, Cardassians, and even more! The stories do an extremely good job of putting you in the shoes of a captain and the space combat is fantastic. This game is extremely customizable and hundreds of different abilities for space comabt, and ground combat are available making each players build unique! Some people complain that once you reach level 60, the game is a cash grab. For people that aren't patient, yes it is. They complain that in order to receive tier 6 ships, you need to spend money. This is not entirely true becasue every year there are two or three events that give you the opportunity to win t6 starships. Sure, its a long process to win them but in the long run it's worth it! Or, if you've been a veteran for a decent amount of time, you may receive a free t6 ship from arc games thanking you for playing their game. Thats how I got mine! Also, going back to the campaign, the Iconian War story is fanominal! Also you can captain Klingon and Romulan ships. Nuff said.           Cons- I don't have many issues with this game except for a couple small issues. I think the ground combat could be a little better improved. Unless you're extremely duked out in shields and weapons at level 60, you will die alot. That being said, I do agree with some of the issues that many people have about the game being a cash grab. Yes, you can get free t6 ships, but if you want a t6 ship without waiting, it will cost 30$ of real money. Thats way too much to spend for just a decent ship in an MMO. For people that may not be as patient, this game is such a cash grab.          Overall, I have enjoyed this game alot. There is so much to do in it and its space combat is extremely engaging and addictive. If you aren't the most patient person out there, this game could potentially become a cash grab but if you have the patience at level 60, you will receive a t6 ship in time. All in all, get this game. Its so much fun!			"

												In general a good game. Really wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't know what Star Trek is.. but in general, i would take those people outside to be shot anyway. Almost a different game from what it was at launch, still, for the Hardcore Trekkers, nice game.. if you don't mind the odd content drought now and then.. and for that, the Foundry comes in very handy. Looking forward to Season 7!			"

												Been a Star Trek fan since I was really young and watched most of TOS (The Original Series) and the TNG (The Next Generation) that was weird to start but it grew on me and now TNG is my favourite :) this game totally encompasses the whole Star Trek world from battling with all the villains we all know and love, I love the DOFF (Duty Officer) system where you can just hop on like I do for a quick check and do more and still gain XP to level up or you can do so many missions it's unreal :) so I totally recommend this game it's free to play or if you want you can buy a few things like ships and so much content, so to be plain and simple I love it as I love Star Trek :) enjoy			"

												Really fun if you're a fan of any Star Trek series. If you don't watch any of the shows and aren't really into them though, you probably wouldn't like this game. I used to think it was just another mediocre MMO until I got into Star Trek and gave it another shot. You get to captain your own ship, name it, name and customize your crew, have space battles, the whole (deep space) nine yards. Oh, you can also visit Deep Space Nine in-game as well. Quark's is still there. All-in-all a great F2P MMO. I look forward to seeing what else is in store for it.			"

												It has huge storyline across 3 fully developed campaigns. the space battles are incredible, the variation of ships is staggering and the graphics are beautiful. the game does suffer however because of its ground combat because you will find yourself dying over and over to try and complete a mission. so summarise if you love star trek play this game. if you love sci-fi play this game. if you like giant laser fights play this game.

												Pretty neat MMORPG.WHAT I LIKENo mindless, repetitive grinding required. There are LOTS of missions to go around and they are fine to level you up to the highest levels. Once you reach those levels, there are STILL more missions to go around. Lol.Ground AND space combat. <3Lots of customization options for character and starship appearance and equipment.All the customization options yield a variety of different playstyles, so there are lots of things to try.Co-op play is actually beneficial, and there are events in missions that only specific classes (tactical, engineering, or science) can do. If you have a buddy who plays a different class, then you can take advantage of more events than you would playing alone.WHAT I DISLIKEPaying into the game definitely yields an advantage, especially in PvP. However, for the most part, it SEEMS that free players can still acquire the fancy combat equipment and what not by putting more time and effort into the game. There are aesthetic elements that can be acquired only with Zen (the currency you get by buying with real monies), but they don't really affect the outcome of battles; they're just for looks.PvP can get really annoying with hardcore players who have MUCH better equipment than newer players, and who will not relent, thereby spoiling the experience for others.After a while, it can get repetitive. The vast majority of missions involve space combat, ground combat, then space combat, travel to a different system, and have more space combat.Overall, I like it, but wouldn't pay for it.			"

												STO has had a rocky history in the sense that their main source of income now seems to lie within these things called ""lockboxes"", which are essentially online gambling machines. There are a number of prizes one can get from opening a lockbox and of course a top prize but the trick is that in order to open one you need to spend real world cash to get keys. They are reasonably priced, but the chances to get the top prize in a lockbox are nearly a thousand to one. For most people, you're either extremely lucky or rich enough to keep throwing money at the game for more keys to get the prize you want.My biggest issue is not with the concept of lock boxes, but rather that the devs development of the lockboxes has seemingly overriden development of normal cash shop items, like ships and other items you can just buy instead of gambling on.Otherwise the game is fantastic, my steam profile only shows something like 153 hours on record but I assure you I've been playing since beta before they had even moved to steam. Space combat is solid and fun, ground combat's a little less polished but still quite amusing. The story arcs are well written and especially some of the more recent content, even touching. You may see people complaining about this or that within the game, but for many of us if we didn't think the game was worth it, we wouldn't bother complaining. All in all, if you even vaguely like Star Trek the game is worth your consideration.			"

Posted: January 10, 2016
												So, I decided to finally write up a review for this game. I figure that around 370 hours of play is enough to be able to know what I'm writing about.So, the first question you have to ask of Star Trek Online: Does it feel like Star Trek? The short answer is kind of. The long answer is yes and no. Whilst it has familiar staples of the franchise, it is also lacking in some elements. For example, more exploration that DIDN'T invariably lead into combat encounters wouldn't go amiss. I won't say it doesn't feel like Star Trek, but it feels almost exclusively like seasons six and seven of DS9 and season three of Enterprise. It has some Trek aspects, but it feels more like a Trek skin for a generic Space MMO and action based MMO. It does, however, have some nice fan service in appearances by existing characters, with several, including Spock, Worf, Sela, Tom Paris, Harry Kim, Seven of Nine, Neelix, the Doctor and Miral Paris, being voiced by their actors from the shows. An opening narration by Leonard Nimoy and an EMH voiced by Zachary Quinto are also both nice touches.What's worth considering on the lack of Trek feel to this game, is that it is somewhat remedied by the foundry; the user generated content is, in my experience, of great quality more often than not. In fact, there have been occassions where I've felt the foundry content had come out better than the content released by Cryptic / Perfect World / Whatever they want to call themselves now. A prime example is the Breen missions; whilst a fun little arc, some of the missions involved in it can be awkward to play. That's not to say all user created content is amazing and infinitely better than the stuff the studio puts out, just that it often has a more Star Trek feel to it.My next point is in regards to the playable classes. At the start of the game, you pick one of three factions, between Federation, Klingons and Romulans. It's worth noting that, while playing as a Romulan, you play as a member of the new Romulan Republic faction, NOT a member of the Romulan Star Empire, so if you're hoping to be the bad guy, your bubble's burst, I'm sorry. Each of these factions have their own stories, with the Federation being my favourite, the Romulans proving suitably intriguing but the Klingon story feels somewhat closer to how they have been portrayed in Trek before, so I find myself with a bias towards them over the Romulans.Once you've chosen your faction, we then get into the actual classes, broken up into the three basic areas of Starfleet; Tactical (i.e. Worf, Tuvok, Reed), Operations (i.e. Scotty, Data, O'Brien) or Science (i.e. Spock, Jadzia Dax, T'pol), with each filling their own role not quite typical of MMO's; Tactical tends to work best with the smaller, faster ships with run and gun tactics, Operations works with the big cruisers and dreadnoughts, and Science works with a sort of intermediary with more buffs. That's not to say you can't play a Tactical character in a Dreadnought (I do!) or a Science character in a light escort, it's just their abilities are more geared towards the ship types mentioned before.My one gripe with this game is the micro transactions; they aren't micro at all! Zen works out as almost 1p per 1 Zen, so when you see a ship for 3000 Zen, you're looking at about £30.00! Of course, Zen can be farmed via Dilithium mining. However, at the moment, it is 260 odd Dilithium per Zen, with an 8000 per character per day cap on amount you can refine; that translates to a lot of grinding for Dilithium. It doesn't help that the Z-store ships are noticably better than those found in the ship store that you get a free ship from as you go through. Wit hthe introduction of the new T6 ships, this is more noticable than ever, and I hope to see some real F2P T6 ships implemented soon!Overall, it's a good enough game. It's not a great Star Trek game, but it does pay fan service in the right places at least. My final opinion is; I'd reccomend this, but Trekkies, be patient with it, it'll take roughly as much patience as the Trek reboots do, so if you enjoy them, you'll enjoy this, if you don't, maybe give this one a miss.

=IntroductionStar Trek Online, a game I have been playing since around 2012 I believe and not a bad one at that, STO has made significant improvements to the graphics, functionality and overall gameplay, I enjoy this MMO and play it to chill out with friends or just to waste a few hours pew pew some Iconians.ContentStar Trek Online has a plethora of content which has been added over the years, with more missions, campaigns and the ability for a user to create their own missions that the community at large can play, this is known as the foundry. There are countless quests on which you can undertake as well as different characters at your disposal, for example you can play as a Federation, Klingon, Romulon (Fed aligned or Klingon aligned) and 23rd Century Federation. This gives you enormous amounts of things to do within the game with missions alone, however there's more, for instance you can PvE queue which is STOs equivalent to a raid in some respects allowing you to group up with others and complete the queues objectives for loot and other rewards. With a plethora of missions to complete as well as guild gameplay and other satisfying content there is plenty to do in STO. One thing that lets the game down is its ground section, although ok it is not the best but has improved over the last few years, thanks to the developers continued support for the game, as well as this the game recently underwent a graphical overhaul.PvE Queues and the ExchangePvE queues are the main way of getting yourself nice loot as well as marks, marks form a part of a reputation system that you grind out to get set items (think World of Warcraft) it involves set missions that you queue for with others and complete for marks which you put towards getting more XP within the reputation system which in turn grants you more unlocks, I like this raid like system and have a lot of fun with it however a downside is that until you hit LVL 55 in game you only have access to a small portion of the queues, post 60 you have access to Elite queues which require META builds and coordination to complete. The exchange is the player market allowing you to sell and buy items and ships for EC or energy credits, it is a simple system much like a hub trader in other MMOs.Ships, Weapons and CraftingSTO offers a huge selection of ships from the Star Trek universe, with Sovereign Class ships like Enterprise E to Shinzons Scimitar Warbird there is plenty to choose from, however aquiring Tier 6 ships (at the time of review the highest tier or ship) a lot of work and time is required, or alternatively you can buy yourself a ship, as for me and the group we play with we nought ourselves tier 6 ships, for £20 it is worth it and it is just like buying the game itself at that point also, however this can also be a negative as it means that newer players that have progressed to LVL 55 will have to do quite some work to access these ships with the Dilithium market etc. I'll explain more in another section.Weapons in STO are tiered, from I to XVI, with loot quality from Common to Epic like many other MMOs, weapons will have different attributes and abilities which improve the higher the tier they are and also how good the quality is, this brings me to crafting, an extensive system within the game and quite fun, you level up your crafting in the R&D panel which allows you to craft every ship and ground module you need in the game, levelling up these can be done by crafting items and also researching, which grants you a decent amount of XP, more crafting slots unlock when you reach specific points within the crafting screen, such as having three separate specialties at level 10 for example, crafting requires good Officers however, BOFFS and DOFFS within STO play a huge role, these are Bridge Officers (they give you your abilities in space and ground combat) as well as Deck Officers (these give you bonuses to specific crafting etc) having goof DOFFS allows you to craft better items which have good stats. Crafting within the game is fun and rewarding as long as you stick at it, much like Eve in some respects you can queue a crafting project and come back later to collect it.Guilds/FleetsFleets in STO are clans or guilds, a fleet can construct a Starbase which grants benefits such as access to fleet ships, enhanced versions on their ordinary counterparts, however starting a fleet is not easy as you require people to be actively putting things into the Starbase upgrades and keeping everything topped up, being a fleet leader requires effort and commitment to the game if you want to succeed. Being in a fleet as an ordinary player can have benefits such as a community of people to group with or access to fleet ships, DoFFS and BoFFS as well as other benefits, the fleet system is expansive and engaging if somewhat grindy.SummarySTO is a solid MMO that you can have a lot of fun with as an average player, there is plenty of content to keep you interested and coming back for more. With a fun PVE queue selection as well as missions it can keep you busy, on top of crafting and trading on the player market. Pros and ConsPROS1. Fun space combat that feels satisfying and looks great2. Great crafting system, plenty to do3. Graphics are not too bad at allCONS1. Can be grindy2. Ground combat pretty poor3. Can be hard to get late tier ships without paying for itAll in all I recommend that you give it a go, after all it is Free!			"

												This game (whilst with its flaws) is what i can honestly say to be one of my all time favorite MMO games to date. I have yet to find an MMO with the atmosphere of satisfaction and wonder this one does. It is a true follow on to the overall Star Trek franchise and can be said as one of the most cannon Star Trek workings to keep ticking on with the true feeling and fantasy sci-fi kept within.At a performance standar the game is prety easy and fun to control leaving the payer with the option tho change his/her controls if the have an significant problrms with it.The gameplay is pretty fun too. It is always improving with the game itself allowing the constant expansion of the franchise's own universe involving the timeline (25th Century) so that you can't simply say that youve already seen it or that its all been done before. Another thing i like is that the nature of the game features seasonal events than will constantly bring in new gameplay and all new missions and storyline to enjoy.However, there are some issues i have with it. Mainly being that in order to advance thouroughly through the ranks and continue with certain missions and aspects, you are almost required to have 4 other consecuative friends to join you just so that you can make a fleet. Now i know thats just what MMORPG's tend to do but this slight detail means that I have to a)Continue the game with that ship I have owned for around 2 months or b)I simply join some other random clan in which would require me to talk to other people. I know shocking but considering that i dont have enough time to participate in the constant flow of events they would be asking me to join i would rather not.Regardless, over all an enjoyable fun game that i can always rely upon for some relaxation and enjoyment if requiredPersonal Rating: 9/10			"

												STO was a great game at one point.  It's a fairly mediocre game as of late.Many bad/questionable choices have caused major imbalances in the game, frustrated long time players, and shown that PWE/Cryptic is trying to heavily monitize the game at the expense of the players.However, that being said, there is much good to be said about STO as well.1) Decent storylines that pick up where the TV episodes and movies left off.  Cryptic has done a great job of revisiting many of the lesser known races in the STO universe, and bringing many unfinished story lines to a close.2) Ships, ships, and more ships.  All the amazing ships we know and love as well as quite a few retrofits/refits that bring our favoties up to par with the 25th century.  I love taking out my 23rd century Excelcisior class cruiser and wiping the floor with the Borg or even other players.  Nothing is more embarassing then a 200 year old ship tearing your brand new top of the line cruiser to shreds.3) Decent player base.  Social interaction is recommended, but not required.  You can go a long ways without ever having to say hello to another player.  However, joining a fleet should be one of the first things that you do, so that you can get further, get better gear, etc.4) Decent selection of real world money ships, costumes, etc.  Some of them are obvious money grabs, but some of them are just plain awesome too.5) Seasonal events like the Summer event at Risa and Q's Winter Wonderland help break the slowness in 'seasons' (aka expansions).6) Ground combat is 'okay'.  Its not up to par with the space combat, but it is certainly playable and how you best explore the main story lines.All in all, if you like Star Trek, then you'd probably like STO.  If you've never played an MMO before, or don't have much experience in the Star Trek universe, you can try this game, but be prepared for a learning curve.			"

												40 hours in.I would recomend it. It feels like I am playing in the Star Trek universe. I LOVE playing with the starships.It feels like a mess of systems with a weak focus, but that may be because I like single player games as opposed to MMOs. (I feel similar about The Old Republic) Although this one is less focused due to the dual systems of space and ground combat. Which means that both are less developed that might be expected if the game only used one of those.That said, both space and ground are not bad, but really don't feel like a part of a triple A title.It's free! so give it a shot.If you love star trek, you will probably enjoy it. Otherwise it may be best to give it a pass.			"

												I'm not going to sit here and write out all the pros and cons of this game as plenty of other reviews have done that for you. I will however state with all the hours I've put into this game, it's one I simply keep playing. However, it's not consistent like most MMO's. It's one of those games you can walk away from, come back when a new line of content episodes comes out, event goes on, etc, and jump right back in and enjoy what's new. Star Trek Online is by far not the best Star Trek experiences, but it's certainly not the worst. It does lack the other facets we generally see in the main shows. However, it does put you in direct control of your favorite ships, most of which you can get without paying a dime. There isn't a single ounce of content within the game you can't unlock without playing the game and putting forth a bit of effort and time. That being said, all the story content is always unlocked and free to play and enjoy. Wether you just poking in from time to time to enjoy the new episodes the go live (often featuring voice actors from the shows and movies themselves), or committ the long haul and build up a fleet, build a starbase, and other assets and grow a mass armada. Star Trek Online can provide a nice enviroment to jump into and enjoy wether you're a trek fan in the slightest or not.			"

												I had played this for seval hundred hours a few years ago, got bored, and left.  I decided to come back to see if things had gotten more interesting.  What I found is, if you're a new player, it is nearly impossible to do much of anything in this game anymore.You will spend hours waiting for a pve que to fill up to get currency for a grindy reputation system that everyone who plays already has finished.  The EC exchange currency has been devalued to a point where anything useful is unobtainable without saving for months, or possibly years, due to the lack of ability to collect valuable loot because no one does pve ques.  The crafting system will take years to complete without any money invested, or you could throw money at the game and it will still take a year and a couple thousand dollars, just to allowed to have the random chance at something that may or may not be useful.  Many more examples exist, but to sum up the problems:  Lack of players makes a grindy game an impossible grind.  If you've never played before, don't waste your time.  If you haven't played in a while, it's more waiting for the same thing you've done already.			"

												If you scratch beneath the surface of this game,you end up with a hole right through it.In the ""episode"" missions (which are the only way to get to level 10),you are little more than someone watching on tv-you can't fail(there is one mission you can fail,but that's a fairly high level one),as you keep respawning until you succeed.You have no influence over the outcome of them,as they are scripted in much the same way as though you were simply a viewer-in one of the earlier Klingon faction missions,you APPEAR to have 3 choices at one stage but 2 of them fail leading to the third choice which is the only one which allows you to progress.The pve queues can be fun,but you don't qualify for the majority of them until you reach level 50!This game is STRICTLY for massive fans of the tv show.

												My first review on here.I played this game since an old friend introduced me to it when it went free to play years ago. Even bought a lifetime supscription for the hell of it. It was on and off. It reintroduced me to Star Trek, and it can be fun to play even with some of the big problems it hasI'm going to revise this review and make it shorter and less bias. It does have some of the original cast members from the shows providing their voices of the original characters like Worf, Nog, Tuvok, etc. And Morn is played by well...Morn. It has an active but small role playing community where one could feel like a real character in the Trek universe. The guild or fleet system is pretty robust with many benefits to fleet members like access to ships and gear that only fleet members can get. The game's crew does regularly add new content almost monthly. And there is plenty to do here like random events, play adventure zones, fight in battlezones(yet few of these are pvp zones), practice your character's crafting or R&D, and play STFs and other more team-based instances with firends or complete strangers.To top it all off, it is ALL FREE! Almost anything can be bought without using any real money whatsoever. You will have to prioritize what you want if you want to play to earn, but one can just get whatever they want in the game just by grinding it. I wish I discovered this before I bought the lifetime supscription. Biggest DOH moment in my life. LOL!XD. But I still payed some money here and there to support it anyway.Now for the negatives. This game does get vary buggy. So buggy even old bugs will come back from time to time. Many of these bugs are funny, but some are game breaking like a broken mail system. And there are bugs and borderline exploiting bugs that have never been fixed for years. The community can get a bit too negative or toxic in places. And the gameplay can get unbalanced as its  seems to be about damage and not much else.Even though I give this game a thumbs down for all those cons, this game can still be vary fun. And this game is vary generous for an MMO as its vary possible to get whatever one wants without paying for it at all if one knows how to budget and set in-game financial priorities. For that sense, I recommend this game 100%. But a fair warning, it will have some serious rough edges that can hurt your experience.			"

												Have been a Star Trek fan since the 80s. When I found Star Trek Online, I never dreamed that I would enjoy it so much. It is a game to get lost in. The amazing thing is that it is free-to-play. If after playing it this way, you decide you want to benefit from some paid for items, you can pay at any time. It is as simple as calling for a turbolift.			"

												This game had such potential. I pre ordered it. Well after giving it up for a year or so, I returned. My account and all record of it was gone, so every cent I spent on it *poof* gone. I made a new account and started playing again anyway. This game is so glitchy, so buggy and so laggy it is unreal. It's almost like they use middle school kids to program the game. Respawns will warp you ahead in the mission then the game will not allow you to return to the previous area, forcing you to restart the mission entirely. This game is bug, space fight, glitch, lag, bug, bug, ground fight, space fight, lag. Pretty much in that exact order.			"

												Star Trek...Nuff' SaidI've been playing this game since before I had a steam account (for years in fact). I can safely say that this a fun and entertaining game. You don't have to be a Trekkie (or Trekker) to enjoy this game. There is tons of content and loads of customization.Because of the customizations, sometimes in hubs people are dressed very immodestly. Also, at times, the local chat gets pretty raunchy.Live Long and Prosper. - JMJ -			"

												Great game a bit slow to start but once you reach commander level like the 3rd level? the ship and weapons become so much fun to use, massive space battles are so fine tuned with the amount of abilitys you can use from bridge officers that you can upgrade.If you are a fan of the show you will love it!! if you are not a fan of the show its still a great game toplay around with sapce battles mmo lots of people to interact with pve, pvp. and lot sof armour sets and weapons to look cool on your ultra customisable character.

												The missions are a bit repetative in nature, and will eventually get old. Missions that include puzzles don't provide enough hints to complete, but can easily be looked up online as the answers exist on the web. One thing this game has going for it though is the XP rate, it takes no time at all to get to the max level (60) if you avidly complete the missions, which typically level you up once per mission, as well as recieving a new starship every 10 levels? Hell yeah! Also, a lot of new content opens up for you once you reach level 60, and it's claimed to be where the actual fun of the game begins, and I dare you all to find out why...			"

That was a mistake.  There were multiple bugs in the first two parts of the new character missions and when I got to the third part there was a option right at the beginning to beam down to Starfleet  Academy from the Spacedock.  I accidently hit the button instead of the one to skip the cinematic and got stuck down at the Academy.  I sent in a ticket and their repsonse to me was to delete my character as there was no way to get back up to the Spacedock from there.  What?  Why would you even make that an option in the tutorial missions?  I really should have listened to the reviews on this one and stayed away.			"

												Star Trek Online is for trekkies seeking to captain their own ships. As a hardcore player/trekkie this game does that but the problem is it takes a lot of its time on space battles and on hostility against other races. Sadly, it's an MMO and we can't avoid combat as one of the main parts of the game. It would be great to explore other options such us being medical officer to being a captain of a medical ship. Having a science vessel and focus a lot on scientific journeys. Grab a battlecruiser and go head to head with the Klingons on PvP (spoilers: sadly because of the new seasons it will decreasr the number of it anymore). However, in my opnion, the story is great and explores the events and ideas which CBS decides to ignore in the television and movies, the events after Voyager. Despite the limitations of its engine, STO still provides good storylines and dialouges during your journey on become an admiral. The endgame content is also great which will make you busy and have fun. Unfortunately, if you hate doing everything over and over again, it's a grind system you'll hate. You have to grind a lot of things just to get decent stuffs especially in reputation system which kinda annoying. But for me it's still great how they put everything you want in game for free you just have to grind for it (both in good and bad circumstances). The gameplay is good and understandable. If you are a new player it provides you with enough knowledge on how the game works through tutorial story arcs (I find the Romulan tutorial arc the best intro to the game since it tells a good story while teaching you how things are done). I find a lot of complains in graphics and cash grabbing. In my opnion the graphics are optimized for low-end devices (i compared the holodeck and tribble server graphics which holodeck did lowered some graphical standards which is really helpful for players with no luxury of higher-end stuff). On the note of cash grabbing i can say that it's totally based on the person on how he plays. Before the new dawn season i was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off because how bad my toon having crap ship and equipment. Turns out it was my fault for not being careful on making a skill build. After new dawn, which made a new skill system, it really improved my toon a lot. I had more skills more skill bonuses and such. Even with non-epic weapons i can still do pretty huge impacts on pves and pvps. Last but not the least, yoy can pretty much get everything for free (on the bright side you can have all the ships in the game in  the tribble server if you want to).Overall this game is 8/10 for me			"

												MMOs are tricky things, and what they do more than anything else is excel in one area and totally crash and burn in another. Star Trek Online is, in this regard, a quintessential MMO. When you are piloting your ship, its an engaging, albeit repetitive experience that is well executed, beautifully rendered and full of promise. When you walk around on your own two feet, you have to wonder why the developers even bothered. Recent reworking of many portions of this game have improved the overall experience, but the planet-bound experience is pretty miserable. The graphics for the 3rd person experience are shockingly bad, the movement is relatively humorous, but not necessarily in a good way, the animation is weak and the combat while better than you might imagine, the AI of your ""crew mates"" is disappointing. In contrast, the space-faring portion of the game is, if you pardon the pun, stellar. Certainly flying in circles during drawn out battles can be boring, but there is enough going on, with the strategic choices, the balancing of shields, positioning in 3 dimensional space to best use your speed, or lack there of, weapons and special tactics can make even the more tedious battles at least moderately interesting. The space map is less pretty than it should be, but it's certainly not terrible and transwarp travel can get you around quickly at least in one direction. there is some charm to having access to some of the known ""landmarks"" such as DS9 as well. Other aspects of the game are generally typical affair - items are colour coded, a la everquest and world of warcraft, and as a free-to-play, most the desirables are available, for a price. For free, the game is worth it for the space alone. For a full fledged, MMO experience which will capture your imagination and keep you coming back for more? Go elsewhere. Even for free, there are better choices.			"

The problem is the content looses its luster, it is way too grindy, pvp is almost non existent and hard to access, and pve action well, just dosent have that many mechanics, the game trys to stay fresh by selling you new space ships, but skimps on content. The devs got to overzealous with this game, and paid a steep price.			"

												Most of my time logged in this game is pre-DR. Since DR was released it's like cryptic has taken the time to make the Mac version (sue me) unplayable. Here is how I launch the game on my 2012 MBP with 16gigs of ram and an i7 processor. 1) Launch game from steam2) Watch launcher crash3) Verify program files. Failure to do so will result in the launcher crashing on startup, no exceptions.4) Launch game again. Launcher will now create two separate instances of itself, with one of them going unresponsive immediately.5) Launch the game via the launcher. 6) Sit and watch the game load for 5+ minutes. If you alt+tab out to a different program, the game will crash. 7) Once the game has loaded, play for five-fifteen minutes before the game crashes while asking for your administrator password (??????)Before delta rising, I'd recommend this to anyone. Now, I can only say ""stay away""			"

												Reviewing my prevous review: The game has gone down to disgrace, everything you can do in the game is grind, if you want to do anything in the game yourself, you are forced to buy credits from ""that type of sites"" so you can proceed on grinding on your everyday reputation marks, dilithium, and items.Buying anything in game is not worth it, as if you dedicated one day to grinding with end  game gear, you could propably sort of save 40 euros if used in comparison to the money they would like you to give to them, that however would mean nobrainer zombie mode for 8 hours straight, buying from ""offsites"" would save you maybe around 75% money and get you more bang for your buck, at the moment the money economy is horrible in that sence.Content: Latest few releases have been horrible, they released abilities that have no place in PvE content, but make the game impossiple for everyone else in pvp, for example, they released a PASSIVE trait, that gives you 100% critical hit chance on hull penetrating abilities, outcome: more♥♥♥♥♥♥for pvp content. They also added ability that stuns all enemies for 30 seconds, inside AoE. who uses stuns or disables in PvE in this game? NOBODY! more stuff that makes the game harder for everyone else has been added, that is just 2 examples.With addition to the endless grinding, they released update with new level increase, from level 50 to 60. as result, all your items are outdated, last 3 years of gridning and upgrading to your best gear was turned into waste, have fun, spend 300 euros to game to upgrade your items with the new crafting system or alternatively spending another full year into getting more dilithium so you could possiply upgrade your items to highest mark.In addition to all the bad releases to PvE, and PvP content, speaking of PvE content, instead of releasing something new to PvE, they made PvE content harder by increasing the amount of damage and health the enemies have, what changed? NOTHING! 5 man Glass cannon teams are still rolling in PvE, you still don't need ANY crowd control in PvE!Many of my veteran friends that have played multiple years, have had ton of dedication for the game, but have stopped playing... I just heard that another 6 of them got permanently banned from forums due to them complaining about the current status of the game.I am done, and hope that nobody will touch this game anymore.			"

												Star Trek Online has been consistently high quality. I am a lifetime subscriber with no regrets. Expansions in this game are gratis. The new ships are not. If you treat the game like Pokemon, you can by the Legacy of Romulus or Delta Rising packs to get access to everything (and some exlusive perks), but you need not do this. Almost everything you want can be earned in game.Lets be clear about the busines model though. You want F2P and refuse to pay anything? You will be punished by an endless grind for Dilithium to sell for Zen to buy the ship you want. Dilithum is capped at 8,000 refined per day. The average going rate has been around 160 Dil per Zen lately. At this rate, if you wanted a Zen ship worth 2500 Zen, you need to sell 400,000 Dil, or spend 50 days to earn it. Now you have your ship! Keep grinding that Dil so you can get the really good gear on it! Everything that is important costs Dil.On the other side are Zen sellers. People who put $5 on their account and buy 80,000 Dil on demand. These are Cryptic's customers. I have seen a lot of complaints about this, or claims that is is Buy2Win. It's not a competition, and without a revenue stream there would be no game to play. Remeber that when you sell Dil, you are requesting other people subsidize your play time and the economy that controls this is regulated to Cryptics benefit.One of the negatives of this game is the parent company. CBS has a strong hold on certain aspects of the game. Want to fly the NCC-1701 at endgame? Sorry, it's a 1st tier gesture that costs 500 Zen. Romulan T'liss Warbird? Same deal, no dice. You get this wonderful ship to start, but you have to use the T'varo from Enterprise, which is technically and ""older"" model. Want to play an android like Data? Flat no, the reason given is that Star Trek is about the human experience. The current Enterprise (NCC-1701-F) is actually captained by an Andorian these days...So the big positive, if you chose to embrace it, is that STO is a ""popcorn"" type game. There are loads of content, but most of it has no impetus. Jump into a PvE queue and go. Jump into a system and do an away mission. It all earns you experience, energy credts, various faction marks, and of course Dilthium. Play one mission or play all night. There is no requirement for heavy investment of time like other MMOs.Overall, I recommend the game. There are nits that you will see as well, but they grow over time. Many quality of life changes are in flux with each update, so the game is actually improving. If there is something that could be done right now to make it better, it would be to create daily seed missions that drive and reward people for the content they are currently missing by waiting for it to be spoon fed.

												This is a game I played with the intent to dislike it. I mean, a franchise I did not care for, a MMO, sci fi setting..Guess what- it didn't happen as the world was well presented, immersive, and I was given total freedom to set up my character, own my own ship, and even configure that one to my likings generously. You can play it entirely free, the added bonuses of subscribing and/or buying cash store items tend to be rather marginal, I ended up paying mainly to support the developers, but at its core it is still a nice looking RPG-style thing with variety between character-ground combat, or exciting ship to ship fights, and no need to do boring grind quests as you can level up with an interesting storyline mission. There is still ongoing support for this, too. watch out though, you might learn a bit more about the series than you wanted..			"

												As an avid Star Trek fan I had high expectations for this game, sadly these were not met. During the development it look exciting while Perpetual Entertainment was developing the game however when Cryptic Studios picked up the game and later released alot of the ideas that was making the game exciting were not present.Ultimately if you are a Star Trek fan you may enjoy this game for the lore if nothing else.

												I cannot recommend this game enough to all lovers of Star Trek, outer space, spaceship simulators, MMOs, RPGs, and futuristic battles! It's even pretty good for people who like single players--for the most part, people will ignore you in group places like Earth Spacedock, unless you talk in instance chat or interact with them in some way, and the rest of the time you can go off into your own mission instances.The game is free to play with optional purchases, and is actually fun even without them. Dedicated players can earn some of the paid items by grinding the Energy Credits and buying stuff from other players on the exchange, so there's a lot of flexibility. It's a lot of fun to play with friends, with whom you can form a fleet and gain other benefits, like fleet credits to purchase things from your fleet store--But the biggest benefit of playing with friends is buddying up to run enjoyable missions together and have a blast, or maybe have an impromtu party in Club 47 in Earth Spacedock. (no kidding!) Other fun things are pets that follow you around, and breeding tribbles (yes!) by keeping a tribble in your inventory and adding a food item. If you add one tribble and one food, you can control which tribble eats which food and what they breed. There are charts showing what tribbles breed what offspring for what foods, for the dedicated breeders--but if you just want to casually breed them, just throw one in your inventory or bank with a load of food and watch them breed--like tribbles! lol Petting tribbles gives you (and your bridge officers) buffs that last for about an hour, long enough to run a mission. The buffs can be extra damage output, damage resistance, or health regen--or even a combination of the above! (Klingons can't get these buffs, sadly, since they and tribbles have a mutual dislike). For the fashion-minded, there are many uniforms (from all the TV series and movies!) and off duty uniforms that you can get/buy and mix and match! And after you've got the perfect outfit, visit the arms dealer or weapons master to get upgrades and armor--or jaunt over to Vulcan, Andoria, and/or Risa for some fun exploring and a vacation! You can investigate logic on Vulcan, engage in Andorian hand-to-hand combat and see their parks, or play on the beach at Risa! While you're doing all that, if you're not using the new in-game voice chat to talk to all your awesome buddies, you can tune in to one of the star trek radio stations to hear some great music and humorous trek related ""commercials""! Lovers of crafting will find a cool crafting system based from Memory Alpha. Captains scan systems to find ""anomalies"" of different types from which crafting is done, and when they find some, they get to play a mini-game of matching a wave frequency in a limited time to gain more of whatever they've found.For those who look for the rare and limited, there's some rare items, ships, officers, and equipment gained from particpating in various events, doing some harder missions, or higher level crafting, or lock boxes from the store.You start out as an ensign at Starfleet Academy on Earth (if you play Federation--if you play Klingon you start on Q'ronos and you can now play Romulan too) and gradually make your way up the ranks, getting better and better ships, gear, and bridge officers. There are two modes to the game--a spaceship simulator type space mode, and an RPG/FPS type ground mode. Everyone plays both at different times in missions, just like the TV series' and movies. Definitely give this game a try--it's got a lot to it and you might like it for its game qualities even if you don't really like Star Trek--buf if you DO, you won't want to miss this. :)			"

												Great MMORPG. Great example how F2P should look - every piece of story or content is free, so you can go throught all of game without paying with some restrictions (less space in inventory and bank, which can be worst restriction). Even prices are quite reasonable and there are only two area, in which you would really want invest - inventory space and maybe bank space, also maybe extra slot(s). But beside that you can be enough with things, which you find in game - equipments, ships etc. And althought it is little grindy, you can earn dilithium in game, which can be changed for Zen (Zen is used to buy stuff, which isn´t avaliable for normal credit). If you fan of Star Trek, it is without question that you should atleast try this game. You won´t regret.			"

This game has a very short tutorial which to players, is very enjoyable and not complecated what so ever. This game has a very wide range of customisation and spaceships to fly and fly in style. The flight and fighting sequences are set as a unique hotkey system meaning that you press different keys to proform different fighting moves. This is very uniqe and very enjoyable. The flight system is very basic, it consists of pressing buttons to either fly faster or slower. This is very FUn. Overall i think this game is a master peice so i give this a 10 out of 5			"

												Yea its ""Star Trek"" and it has actual story line to the three major powers of the Star Trek Universe.Even though it ends up being more combat then Star Trek would normally have been in compairison to the TV shows..STO can be a little ""grindy"" for levels and gear.   So you have been warned.Other then that, some people have difficulty with the space combat stuff.Either because they cant remember to actually click their ships status window to rebalance shields, or they have difficulty navigating a ship in 3D using a keyboard.But on the plus side of all this.  Star Trek Online is 'very customizable'.  Your UI, your character, your bridge officers, even your ships.  Technically speaking you can also customize your own fleet.  Oh and theres minigames in the game to find and play.Not exactly a positive but the game does have an ingame item store, usually you get these ""Zen"" points by buying them, but you can infact buildup Zen by playing the game and selling off some rare ingame currrency for the stuff.Most missions in games are up to 5 players.  However some ""raids"" or STFs are up to 20 players.			"

												Do you remember the launch of this game? What a snowball bad start right? Klingon not finish no story line in klingons also pvp based. And the lag disconnection issues account that was so bad i even cry a little because i love star trek. However 2014 The game is change a lot. New contend new ships new missions new events is it good yah it is, is it the best hell no. But its for sure 200% better than at start. The Free to Play model is fine its not pay to win because you`re doing more pve than pvp at the end pvp is not worth looking for in this game so ignore that one. Still you can pvp but its cheesy bad that you think Elder Scrolls Online is better. However there is a downside to everything like every mmorpg the end game is really the endgame you can farm special items or crew or whatever you want to do. So thats the downside of the game however there is also a more elite missions you can do or turn your story line to elite to get better loot.You can change everything not only your ship or you but even your crew your deck of the ship and even costum your engine increasing it at your taste. There are cookie builds on the net to squeeze the maximum of your char and ship. But thats your taste of gaming. Give it a chance play its free you know no money is needing to it. Perhaps if you like it badly you can buy a great ship you like. Fear deal right?			"

												Star Trek Online is the first MMO I've ever given a really fair shake to. Generally, the MMO formula doesn't appeal to me, but after reading several positive reviews, I gave this one a try.The game itself is very attractive, especially with the graphical settings turned all the way up. This is definitely a Star Trek universe, with lots of visual cues  from the TV shows.This game delivers lots of solo content, which is what piqued my interest. And it's true, this MMO is mostly a solo venture. You'll see other ships flying around, and other people at stardock, but you rarely interact with them. It's like 1,000 people playing solitare together.Star Trek Online has a compelling space-combat system. You can really trick up your ship, too, if you care to. But this doesn't save the game from it's very repetitive missions, and very complicated economy. End result: I lost interest. Total time invested, about 10 hours. "

												UPDATED 11/20/15:  Several new changes to the game have been made, and so far, they seem to be positive ones.- Separate personal space and ground traits.  FINALLY!  No more switching traits during a story mission!- Armadas.  These are in essence ""metafleets"" of up to 13 different fleets each.  One is an Alpha that can invite three Beta fleets, and each Beta can invite three Gamma fleets.  Each fleet can donate toward other armada members' projects.  This feature has potential but I don't believe it's been fully realized just yet.  It does come in handy for using fleet marks when your home fleet is already at max level on all projects.- Dry Dock.  Allows you to free up active ship slots for use.  Only complaint I have with this is that the equipment on a ship being dry docked doesn't stay with the ship but returns to your inventory.  Use of the loadout feature can mitigate this, but loadouts are still a bit buggy for some players.- Admiralty.  Basically, this is a duty officer (DOFF) system using ships instead of people.  Each ship in your inventory generates a card for the Admiralty system with fixed engineering, tactical, and science specs.  Missions show the required total amount of each spec, and you can slot up to three ships on each mission.  It has a pretty good XP return on some missions, so it takes some of the drudge out of leveling from 50 to 60.As of late, it does feel like the devs are listening more to the players and making useful changes instead of just cosmetic ones.  The storyline is maturing well, though it does seem that exploration is again taking second place to combat, even though Cryptic indicated this season would be more about exploration.  I'll withhold judgement on that until the season has progressed further.Dilithium prices for ZEN have skyrocketed since my original review.  On average, they're running in the 220-240 dil / 1 ZEN range.ORIGINAL REVIEW (12/27/2014)For those who eat, drink, sleep, breathe, and live Trek, Star Trek Online is as close as you can get to being a part of the universe, short of time travel.  This isn't to say that the game doesn't have flaws, but overall it works quite well.PROSYou get to fly and even (somewhat) modify canon starships, plus some pretty cool designs not seen in films or on TV.The game is rich with content...in fact, it's a bit staggering just how much you can actually do in game.  Colonization?  Yep.  Ground fighting?  Got it.  Space battles?  You bet.  Exploration?  It's in there.  I strongly recommend that you read and bookmark the Star Trek Online wiki.Customization of both ships and characters is possible, though more extensive customization will cost you eventually (either money or lots of grinding).  Still, the amount you can do in F2P is good.The story arcs are interesting for the most part, and mesh well with canon Star Trek.  Finding out what happened in the Delta Quadrant after Voyager had been there is a good example...you'll also get to find out what happened to the Jenolan Dyson Sphere after Starfleet sent two science vessels to study it, how some of your favorite characters turned out and what they're doing circa 2410, the name given to Species 8472, and other tidbits along the way.Some of the special events are fun and funny, especially the Winter Wonderland event in progress as of this writing (12/27/2014), and offer decent rewards.CONSIf you don't like grinding, don't expect to get too far too fast.  There's plenty of it.  For example, you can collect all the dilithium ore you want, but you can only refine 8,000 per day plus a few small bonuses here and there.  As you unlock reputation levels, refined dilithium is required to purchase the stronger and better items...some require 15K, some require 32K, and so on.  That means you're going to be doing lots of minding...er...grining...er...GRINDING.To really customize ships and characters, you'll be spending ZEN (Cryptic's currency) which costs either real money or LOTS of dilithium.  Typical cost as of this writing is 165 dilithium to 1 ZEN.  Considering that most of the best items for purchase run anywhere from 500-2500 ZEN, I'll let you do the math.There are a couple of long-standing bugs in the game (read the wiki and the game site for more info) that can be either a minor nuisance or a major pain, depending on your tolerance level.PET PEEVEI thought dilithium could be recrystallized as early as in Star Trek IV, which was confirmed in TNG.  So why do I have to keep mining dilithium for everything?  Can't I just reuse a small amount?  :POVERALLRecommended.			"

												I love this game it's awsome i suggest it to everyoneEdit 1.I have been playing this game since 2012 I absolutly enjoy this gameBut lets get into basics about it's features and how much it's enjoyable ,It has been around for almost 5 years now as of this review edit It has PVE and PVP content both enjoyable with the right people it has 3 factions Fed, KDF, RP ( RP - Romulan Republic not Roleplay ) , Most of the Missions are Enjoyable about 98% mostly the Romulan republic ones since they're the newest storyline the game has a strong Community don't let anyone fool you , The game's mechanic's are ok i give them a 4/5 , the game's Graghics are old based on the cryptic engine from of course cryptic they have not upgraded to a new engine yet hopefully will do so , So I give it a 3/5 with that the storylines i give them a 5/5,  the support system Hasn't improved since it was like on the last website and has actually degraded since it transfered to arc games so i give that a 2/5 as for the playerbase there is a strong community of trolls such trolls are part of some Fleets ( Guilds ) and are highly disruptive and can impair your gameplay significantly  I highly suggest you avoid them there is a fragile community of roleplayers fragile because What i recently just said ( the Troll groups atleast the main branch are Starfleet Dental, Nerds of prey, and Shutup wesley )  ( I'AM NOT POINTING OUT ANYONE OR DISSING THESE 3 FLEETS I'AM ONLY SPARING PEOPLE FROM A VERY UNHAPPY TIME BY WARNING THEM ) but unlike some troll groups these are highly avoidable and can be ignored easily if you wish, As for other unmentioned features and mechanics etc I give them a 5/5 , This game is only enjoyable as you make it if you make it hard and difficult then the gameplay will NOT be enjoyable there is an expansion now that raised the Level cap from Level 50 to Level 60 Levels 1 - 50 are essentially easy to get through if you stick to getting 10+ Level's a day you can be level 50 in 5 days or less as for Level 60+ thats more difficult it can take as long as a MONTH to get there from 50 - 60 , I highly suggest when leveling to do patrols first before the main mission'sEdit 1, ( Update )This just an update for the review under edit 1, I recently tried to play the game and found it very buggy and laggy as well as when moving rubber banding all over the place and lots of people have been reporting this issue to no help at all from the devs or Gm's the people who run the game ( PWE ) do not care for the game anymore all they do is post content rather then fix the content they already have making more bugs and issues as they go and making the game more unenjoyable all they want is to lure people in to spend money on ships and other items rather then fix the content and bugs the game is also super unbalanced thanks to the last expansion ( Delta Rising ) which they have yet to fix and have not given any tips as to if they are doing so I still enjoy this game so i will continue to play it but until they fix this issue i will not be spending a dime on the game I still recommend it because the more people that play the game and the more that experience the issue and report it could push the devs and gm's to actually fix the problems.

												Loved this game. I've been playing since 2012 and this is literally one of the best free MMOs around. The ground combat mechanics are not exactly my taste as a I prefer FPS, but space combat is amazing. My only complaint about space combat is that it is set on a 2-D plane (as in you can't do barrel rolls with your ship or fly around upside down and what not). The story arcs are also great and I'm glad that they have revamped the older stories to make them more interesting. I do not like the fact that you have to basically pay to win in PvP and kind of ruins the fun.  All in all, STO is great in general. Many people favor ship to ship combat over ground combat, others like the latter, and really it's all up to you.			"

												I am a Star Trek Beta player with a lifetime edition and stopped playing at some point. If you start reading my review you might think ""why is he not recommending the game after listing all the cool features?"" Continue reading and you might discover the sad truth behind the wall of content.Back in the days I played Klingon fighting proudly for my faction. The crafting system is fun and also the Officer missions. You can send your crew to get recources for you or even different currencies you can spend for equipment. The stories are really cool and I can recommend the Missions which take you back in time to experience old star trek episodes. I recently joined again to see what changed. They implemented a lot of new features, quests and events so a PvE player might be very satisfied BUT if you are looking for PvP you should look elsewhere. The entire game changed from different fighting factions to a bunch of excel sheet reading damage maximizing grannys in pink pyjamas. They only maximize their gear to get better gear and to sit in their space stations dreaming of big fights which will never happen as nobody ever plays any PvP. So if you look for a complex game with seasonal events and story you are at the right place but you will never use your gear in player combat ever again. So even if I have a lifetime abbonement I will not bother downloading the game again. The Peace corp took over the game which is sad and destroyed the game at least for me.			"

												If you're a Star Trek fan, then you'll want to play this. Obviously, PW makes their money by having microtransactions. However, despite this, it's still equitable for the F2P player. As the game description says, it's like being inside the show. Sector narration is done by Leonard Nimoy, Michael Dorn reprises his role as Worf and there are other familiar characters. If you're a Star Trek fanboy like me, then you'll see this game as a time suck. It's not the most visually stunning game out there but it's a lot of fun.Edit 1: Recently, Tim Russ reprised his role as Tuvok during a Dyson Sphere event. Edit 2: Now that I have more time on record, I can add a few things. My view about the game above is still the same. However, I will take the time to add a few things. As I said before, it helps if you're a Star Trek fan to begin with. You get to play with the ship types you saw in the different series and you get to visit the places you could only see on TV. I will caution you that the story takes place some 30 years after the events of the last Star Trek movie (no, not the new ones...I mean Nemesis). If you take that into consideration, you'll realize that it's a whole new take on the franchise. Edit 3: I mentioned before that there are microtransactions. Really, the best ships are there and it wouldn't hurt to drop some money on Zen to get a few of them. That being said, you seriously don't have to. What you're really paying for are the consoles that come with them that give you some neat abilities. When you hit max level, you can get all kinds of equipment by running PvE/PvP queues that evens the playing field. So, you don't need to buy anything at all. Edit 4: With the Legacy of Romulus update they did, the current mechanics seem to favor the Romulans since you can choose a side. Their ships seems to have the advantage in fights and function in multiple capacities. That being said, the disparity isn't actually there. Each race has their strong suit and each race is deficient somwhere.			"

												I honestly don't know what steam says my play time is. I have been using the old STO launcher from before ARC or Steam.  I played the game for about two years.  I truly loved it until the latest cash grab that came with the level cap increase to 60.  There are places where you can see the amount of money necessary to get the former end-game gear to the new end-game gear without spending a full year grinding to get it there.I loved the game, played competitively in PvP with a lot of great people.  I was not a free player.  Probably spent around $3-400 on this game before the cap inrease.  Now it seems I would have to spend around $80-$120 more to get any one of my many ships to their new potential...Or spend nearly a year on the grind.I'll miss it, but I won't be touching this thing ever again.  This one goes out to Lag Industries and the Sad Pandas!  I'll miss you guys!			"

												I've been a long time player of STO, a subscriber with a lifetime subscription and and a huge Trek fan.While the game does have its flaws, the game was fun to play. Up to the most resent update, Delta Rising, is a game breaking update, for many, it forces the game to crash to the desktop while loading, and while some work arounds involve running the game in safe mode, this is impossible to play.Cryptic broke the own damn game and are doing nothing to fix it, Delta Rising was released in October last year, 3 months an they have done nothing to fix this. My set up ran this game at a reasonable framerate (around 30-40 fps) and with graphics around high. When Delta was released, my setup HAD NOT CHANGED. Nothing. After, crash city.Until Cryptic fix this, avoid like the plague.			"

												With a new set of scopes and ideas this game has come back to about neutral. Since i can't write a positive review yet of this game I will not change my review to Positive from this change. As a first round STO player and a lifetime Star Trek Fan i am always hopeful and always engaged in trying to make this game work.The Delta Rising Update for STO which allows for a level increase and the additions of specializations does absolutely nothing for the Game Play. Most of the missions t hat i have played so far follow the same principal.. Destroy one enemy here come reinforcements. Good now you have done that repeat 5 times in the same mission. I don't mind the battle i don't mind the play i do mind the lack of any player insight into the game. I was soured and trying to get a better feeling for this game before Delta rising come out and now that i have i can honestly say im going to find something else to play. Continue from changes to Legacy of Romulus:As a long time STO player, I had given quite a bit of time to developing a charachter, with the ""a new accord"" update it basically cut my player abilities in a 1/3 setting my charachters abilities and specialities far back. The ability to switch out a trait now for a different one does me absolutely nothing as i specifically chose specialities and reputation groupings that i had. Now my charachter is in dire straights and having had these changes my desire to play STO has plummeted. I'll check back in a while to see if I can get back into it but as of now the changes have ruined my appetite and desire for this game. Was a recommend until these ne			"

												It's free so give it a try, but don't give them your money.I had an issue recently where an in-game item that I had paid money towards was accidentally deleted because of a bug. The support department refused to return it, didn't have the decency to tell me why they wouldn't/couldn't and even threatened to ban my account if I pressed the matter.The developers of the game openly have contempt for their players calling them morons, exploiters, whiners, you name it. There seems to be a real toxic attitude behind the scenes at certain levels of this company.For a review of the game...I'm a life-long Star Trek fan. I came here looking for a fix after not being impressed by the new movies and I found it for a while. There is plenty to explore and the ships are done well and can be fun to fly.Then you start to realise that every mission is essentially the same. Warp in, kill a few waves of bad guys and warp out. Starfleet don't do diplomacy or exploration anymore, they just kill everything. No questions asked.The endgame is the same. Repeating the same few missions over and over to gain slightly better equipment to do the same few missions over and over but slightly quicker. Everything is a pointless grind. The only real reason to stay is the friends you make along the way.To summarise, it's a moderately ok space shooter that plays upon your nostalgia and love of a tv show with skins, music and a bit of voice acting. Everything is a grind and hidden behind timegates and endless grind/paywalls. To make any real progress you either need a fat wallet or to play the game like a full-time job.There are far better gaming experiences out there.			"

												In current state the game is unplayable. Random error crashes with no actual error report. I currently cannot play any romulan class as the game instantly crashes when i try to log in.Deleted all local files, wiped and reinstalled. First time re-launching the game launcher ""error found do you want to verify all files"".. I just downloaded the ♥♥♥♥ing thing! It seems they cannot even release a stable enough client atm to allow anyone to play the game.having said that, when it actually works....do I reccomend... yes and noStory play is fun and interesting with a different set of arcs for each three factions. space battles are fun and the avilability to alter the mission difficulties increases the challenge. Ultimately, it has everything start trek and much more when you include the player build foundry missions.Having said that, the main issues come at end game where everything is limited by dilitium.. which wouldnt be so bad, but you are limited to converting 8000 per day forcing a very slow and at times infuriating grind.The micro-trasactions are horrific. A new ship will set you back £25 or your equivelent ~2500zen if you buy on discout times.whilst you can conert dilithium to zen in game, at an average 300 per 1 zen you're looking at 750k dilithium for just one ship, which at 8k per day means its not going to happen.this al lgets offset by any upgrade of items (which are max drop XII) to XIV also requires dilihiumVery little in the game is actually ""free""i would reccomend the game for the story arcs as an rpg, outside of that, unless you're willing to part with a lot of ££ don't expect anything spectacular to happen as you just wont have the time.space battles = goodgame play = goodstory = goodinsane unachievable grind without spending a lot of real ££ = awefull			"

												Star Trek Online used to be better before Delta Rising. The main offenses after the new expansion lie in the realms of balance. Release after release, there seems to be very little deliberation about releasing new items and mechanics. They are, for the most part, terribly broken. PvP is utterly a joke, and even PvE now suffers the consequences, as the empty queues can tell.Many other systems are equally aggravating. Crafting and upgrading, both tied behind time gates and random number generators. When you craft or upgrade an item, you cannot choose the mods - they're random. Which may turn your crafted item into vendor trash, and your resources spent for nothing. Not to mention the terrible long time gates -- 20 hours to craft a single endgame item. I haven't seen any of this in the other good MMOs I used to play.To not be completely negative about this, certain areas of the game get proper attention and listen to player feedback. They're mostly related to art: costumes, ship models, and environment. The new Club 47, released a couple weeks prior to the date of this post, is truly awesome. But you can only go so far dancing all night long in this game, if anywhere.As a fan of the game genre (flying a starship, having a crew), it is sad to see this game being destroyed by poor development decisions. If you are a fan of Star Trek (I am not really), you may find the stories interesting.			"

Due to multiple changes of ""ownership"" over the registration/login system, my account got all screwed up.

The ship-to-ship combat is buggy, the game overall is laggy, and the content that has been added feels unfinished and unpolished.Despite the fact I was unjustly charged $300 for an account I can't use, I still think I came out in better position not having this game in my library.

												This is a fantastic game, fun to play, with a wide and mostly varied userbase. Well, at least until you run hard into the paywall at level 50.

												I'm a long time player and have only seen this game improve. There have been a few hiccups here and there but ultimately the game only gets better. They have a great free-to-play model. If you have the time, anything in the game can be had without spending a dime. The best  end-game gear is earned in game, not by purchasing it in the cash shop. So, no...this game isn't 'pay-to-win'. Cash shop ships, costumes, personnel, etc... can be purchased as a free-to-play player without spending a cent. You just have to earn in game currency known as Dilithium, and then trade it in the dilithium exchange market for Zen (which is the cash bought currency used in the cash shop). There are a few exceptions to this. There are a few rewards for subscribers and lifetime account holders that can only be had by purchasing or subscribing, but none of these rewards are game breaking, nor do they effect game play.			"

												Star Trek online is a game which follows in the footsteps of the franchise T.v shows in that the story and characters are always respectful of the lore but like the new movies alot of the plot revolves around time-travel and dimensional travel but so what, it seems the new season is focused on previously untold and unexplored concepts around Millenia-dormant threats from numerous ancient races which push the boundaries of the  lore. I think many of the story mission sagas would actually make good comics or novels but most players lament not having conversation choices impact the story in a significant way, even though there are many opportunities to play as evil or good. The lengthy Rep system and new Research schools and specialization trees cretainly breathed life into the game for dedicated players, as well as new ships available to all players who complete events during winter and summer. ""No player need be left behind"" in terms of ships and equipment, if you trade longer playtime for an outright buy. Important here to note is the store in this game has exorbitant prices, a ship can cost you $30 dollars only to be outclassed later and there are many ""packs"" that range in the hundreds of dollars, ""WTH""? right? but believe me, I've played a long time and any player can earn and buy any ship the free way and it won't take THAT long maybe like a saving a month in-game at the most for a good ship. Lock box ships can also be purchased on the exchange I know many people who get them this way. All in all, what with events and discounts and giveaway's and dedication, I don't feel leftout as a non-subscriber and over the years I can say the game earned what I spent, at least I wasn't dumb enough to get into Lockbox keys but If you want to gamble 100's of dollars you deserve a good ship! crazy. Anyway, Graphics are good with many story options, some actually stunning enviroments like summer Risa, hours of fun for Trek fans or sci-fi ship combat fans, although ship combat is some of the best I've played, its done in a third person view with a more stategic take in that the skills and manouvering you use in combat are all important since all  combat is auto-aimed. Same with ground combat strategy is all important and headshots non-existant but for a skill tree which gives a crit bonus for aimed shots.  Anyhow, I would say check it out, I don't offer many criticisims because the game is quite open ended and everyone finds a different nche of activities they like, Over-all it's impressive work but I would say suffers like all MMO's because they also incorporate alot of ""mindless"" grindiness into into it, if you know what I mean, something like being presented with a mountain of dull paperwork to do to get some rewards but again it's up to the player if they ""feel"" like it or not.

												Ah~ STO. I've played STO on and off over the course of it's lifetime and still find it fun to play.Star Trek Online is an MMORPG set in the Star Trek universe. In STO you have two types of gameplay: Ground and Space. In ground missions you and your Away Team beam down to planets, derelict ships and stations and asteroid bases and clear them of hostiles all while receiving nice little spoonfuls of lore, story and EXP/Loot. Space combat pits your ship against other ships for similar rewards. It has all the staples that you would come to expect from a modern MMO. >Group Finder>""Guilds"" called Fleets>Party system>Auction House>Huge amounts of cosmetics for your character>Extensive crafting system>Fleet Bases (Guild Halls) that you can upgrade.>Hundreds of ships (Each with customizable looks)The only downside is the dated graphics and game engine. The gameplay, however, is fantastic and quite fun. Explore anywhere at any time. All in all, it's one of those games that if you enjoy it, you'll find yourself coming back for more.			"

												Fun game (mostly - apart from elements influenced by the cash shop) but by far the worst customer service you'll find.All up I would have spent a bit over $300 on the lifetime sub and various ships. But when my main character became really badly bugged, affecting something I had spent money on in the cash shop - and it was affecting other players too - could I get them to fix it?No.I bugrepped it. Months went by. Nothing. I bugrepped it again. Waited again. Nothing. So I lodged a ticket with customer service. After jumping through hoops (taking screenshots etc.) to prove there was a problem they told me they couldn't fix it and I should bugrep it. Which I'd done. They also specifically told me never to contact CS again about this problem or any like it.Email records from CS were produced.So nearly a year later I lodge a complaint with BBB. PWE's initial response was dishonest - saying I should have contacted CS, as if I hadn't. They then ignored BBB's attempts to follow up with them for several months until they gave up and advised me to lodge a complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission.Meanwhile in their forums, their head of community relations took to slagging me off and perfectly innocent posts of mine were being moderated away. And their developers tried to make me out to be unco-operative, when I had been anything but.Eventually in the thread about this bug I told them about BBB's advice to complain to the US FTC. Voila! The bug was fixed fixed. That's all it takes to get bugs fixed in this game. A year of bug reporting, CS tickets, complaints to consumer groups and threatening them with an FTC complaint.I had played and enjoyed the game for a very long time (outside Steam), and spent a lot of money on it, but when a company behaves like this - well no game is worth that. Plus given how aggressive and dishonest they were in relation to the BBB complaint and in their forum, I could never trust that they wouldn't mess with my characters.Steer clear.			"

												I know I don't really have the hours recorded on steam but I played this game for a year or two before the Romulan expansion, the community was great, including the resident troll named Butts :) (I have to admit, his trolling was kind of endearing and I kind of miss the way they trolled it had a semblance of respect for people who weren't butt hurt about it LOL).Also, I've played twoother PWI games, Forsaken World and Perfect World and yes, in some of these games you CAN earn currency to buy what the P2W players buy BUT it's going to take you forever and a year to actually get the currency all the while P2Ws are kicking your♥♥♥♥♥everywhere in PvP, superior gems and the like.My very first review, here we go:The Good:- The Community was great- Very friendly even if I wasn't a Trekkie.- The ship fighting was great, I loved every minute of it. (Buff, buff, buff, Guns to lower shields. projectile to destroy the hull, cloak, rinse and repeat)- The character customization had a lot of options. (What I thought was tanned was actually kind of Orange LOL)- The missions were also pretty great, just the right amount of challenge.- The inside of the ships were magnificent.- Pet Varens in one of the ships.- Space and ship graphics were good.- And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ your guild house is a massive space ship/station, that is all.The Bad:- The non-ship combat was clunky. (Clunky drop kick was my favorite thing.)- The grinding was just... Mind numbing.- Character graphics looked weirdly like rubber.- The physics for out of ship combat was weird.The Ugly:- PWI's Free-to-play but pay-to-win scheme.Would I recommend this game? The honest answer is yes, it's a good game and if you have money to spare or parents who can spot for your game cards then why not buy a few account upgrades or IRL cash ships. If you're into the long term grinding experience then you can eventually buy ships that are decent with in-game currency. Yes, you can complete the game without shelling out cash except for buying the DLCs.Do I hate the PWI experience? A little bit, yes.Will I not recommend this game simply because it's a PWI game? No, the game deserves it's praise and it's time, Cryptic made this game, not PWI. PWI is simply milking the game for all it's worth because they're a business and that's how they choose to run things.			"

												I've been playing this game casually for quite a while now. I've had nothing but good experiences with this game. The depth, and scale is amazing, and the player-made ""Foundry"" missions provide an extra layer of depth to the already story-rich gameplay. Playing Dabo on Deep Space 9, flying around the Risa Summer Resort with my floater rental, and generally exploring the galaxy are a few of my favorite things in this game.I chose to disregard the negative reviews I saw before trying STO out, and I'm glad I did.

												Played a tonne of this just after it went F2P and before it went on Steam.Really enjoyable space combat game combined with a pretty lackluster ground combat portion. The story missions are pretty enjoyable compared to most MMO's, and make you feel involved in the plot rather than just as a witness to it. Also unlike other MMOs you aren't stuck doing gathering/kill quests to advance, but instead you are doing stuff to advance storylines. It was refreshing to play through an MMO that felt more like a proper story-based game.At times it feels like a strange fanfic of what happens next in the original universe, but it's still Star Trek. Sure the DS9 and Voyager continuations can make little sense, but it's still a fun time to see those characters return.If you're a Star Trek fan there is more than enough in here to delight you for a good long while.

												Star Trek Online: Agents of Yesterday - What a steaming pile of crap. I've been enjoying the STO universe now since it's release (even pre-ordered it). It's the only place where I can still immerse myself in the Star Trek universe I've come to love. And while it's not a AAA title, or even a B title, it has always done a fairly good job at remaining true to the universe and being an enjoyable little game. Unfortunately, Agents of Yesterday, in my opinion, is their first complete failure to produce anything good. For starters, I've never held any interest in the TOS universe. If someone made a TOS game, I'd most certainly completely ignore it. So right off the bat, this expansion has already failed me.Add in the excruiatingly bad lag that this expansion introduced to all the instances, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Star Trek reboot movie ships, and the most ridiculous explanation for making them equivilant to 24th century technology and we're already off to a terrible start.Not only this, but in order to take advantage of all the new story and content, you cannot continue with your pre-existing character. Oh sure, 24th century characters get to run a couple of missions for Daniels and access to three new instances, but we practically get left out of any content for the 'season'.This is one embarassingly pathetic expansion.Edit: Corrected spelling mistakes.

												Unashamedly hocking a staggering array of in game purchases surprisingly doesn't detract so much from the best Star Trek game I have played to date. The single player missions can be frustratingly obtuse, and ground combat isn't much fun at all - but pretty unavoidable.  That said, the game world is huge and thre is tons of content.  It's free to play, so why not give it a try? 3/5			"

												Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of you, your crew, and your starship. Your ongoing mission; to explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life, and new civilizations. TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO ONE HAS GONE BEFORE!This mmo set several years after the events of the amazing TV series puts you into the Star Trek universe, where you create your captain, pick your crew and pilot your own starship across the cosmos as a member of Starfleet, the Klingon Defense Force, or the Romulan Empire. Explore new systems, sign treaties and decimate your enemies while piloting your favorite ships from series and customizing them to your own accord. The gameplay starts off a little slow, sense you start off with the worst ship in the game and then end up fighting the strongest enemy in the Star Trek universe just in the tutorial alone (in the Starfleet storyline anyway) but as you level up, grab some upgrades, comission new bridge officers and then acquire better starships it gets REALLY REALLY FUN. Plus, the PvE is also the absolute best of any mmo I've ever played.			"

												I haven't played Star Trek Online since it launched back in February of 2010. I can say without a doubt that I was excited for this game when I first pre-ordered it. And then I played it. It wasn't the worst MMO I had ever played but it definitely didn't live up to my expectations. The ground combat was clunky, the early story and missions were boring and there was little to no voice acting. About the only thing I did like was the ship to ship combat. But that couldn't save it for me. I just couldn't bring myself to buy the full version. Now, 4 years later, I find myself picking it up again after hearing about how many changes have been made. It piqued my curiosity so I began to play last week. Trust me when I say, this isn't the same game that I decided against buying 4 years ago. Pretty much everything has been revamped. The game is now in it's 8th major update since launch, so there's quite a bit of new content. Starting out, the first thing I noticed that the whole intro has been scrapped and is now completely different. Instead of finding yourself in the middle of a Borg attack, you are now an Ensign at Starfleet Academy, who has just graduated and been given his (or her) first assignment. You have been chosen to be the First Officer aboard a not-so-new Miranda Class ship. Your first mission is to go out and collect some data samples with your cadet crew. Then things go wrong.The story is engrossing from the very first moments. It's a major step up from what used to be. Then there's the C-Store. Currently, the game is Free To Play, which is good for someone like me, who's on a budget. Usually I hate the Free to Play options in games because I feel like my version is severely diminished. That's not the case in Star Trek Online. As a matter of fact, aside from some nifty cosmetic stuff and things like different styles of ships, I haven't really seen anything different between the Free to Play stuff and Paid subscribers. There are a few things, such as more costume slots or extra Duty Officers, which are nice but not necessarily hindering you if you don't have them. What really impresses me about the C-Store is the ability to buy Zen (the currency used in the Cash Shop) with in-game Dilithium. Admittedly, it's at a pretty steep cost. About 125 Dilithium per 1 Zen. That means that if you want to buy the cheapest item in the C-Store, you'll need about 31,000 Dilithium saved up. Which is going to take you quite a bit of grinding. But still. The option is there and that's more than most other games will give you. Overall, I have been having a blast. Currently I've only made it to Level 20 (Commander) and I have yet to join a Fleet but that hasn't stopped the fun from rolling in. The only thing I could really ask for is some good PVP or better PVE Instance queues. But that's not to say I wont keep playing. At the moment, I am going to give it a 7 out of 10. I've seen some bugs but those are nothing that can't be fixed in later patches.			"

												STO is a very well executed space MMORPG. The story is relatively engaging for an MMO, and the graphics are nice. If you are even a little bit of a trekkie, there is a great deal of fun to be had here.That said, like most MMOs, it gets samey rather fast. It takes longer than most, which is something I really have to give the developers a great deal of kudos for, but eventually, you're going to feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again. Something that helps combat this is that it has the concept of user-created missions. You can actually get on a special account type and create missions for others to play. These range from the awesome to the ""meh"", and is another unique feature to STO.The fact that this is free to play, and the paid addons are reasonable, makes it definitely one of the better MMO's out there. If you liked Earth and Beyond back in the day, you'll probably like this. Recommended!			"

												A pretty good representation of the Star Trek series, especially for an MMO. While it is free to play, it does a good job of avoiding the play to win formula, if you are on my steam list and decide to give it a try, let me know. High level players can sync up to low level players to level match both ways, and they even both get credit for the missions tailored to their level.			"

												I came to this game back on the free to play launch.  I for the most part played nightly up until a year to two ago.  While the game is a great game one of the biggest down sides that caused me to stop playing the game is the constant grind to level up just so you can play the next story driven mission.  Sure it is easy to level up but it just gets old doing the same thing over and over again just to get to some new content.  The game when I came to it wasnt too bad but with the release of the fleet bases the game became a very huge dilithium sink which is now starting to level off some as dilithium values have dropped as majority of people have already finished their bases.I do recommend this game because you can put many hours in it but be warned you will have to do a grind to get to some stories as the story missions do not provide enough XP to level up from one story to the next.

												Surprisingly good. I have not tried PvP, but throughout the PvE/story missions, I have never felt pressured to spend any money on the game. You unlock a new ship every 10 levels, and new ships are occasionally available for free during event missions. Every ingame thing you might need (gear, bridge officers, deck officers) is available from (relatively easily) obtainable resources in game as well as money.  The endgame isn't lacking in PvE, as of this writing there is a battlegrounds area for ground combat, and plenty of task force missions for space combat.In summary, the game is worth taking a shot at, even if you aren't a diehard trek fan.

												If you're a Trek fan, there's a lot to love.  You'll recognize people, places, things, and plots from across Trek's 50 year history, you can even play a TOS-era character as an alternate start method.  Gameplay is very combat heavy, but this *is* an MMO. The F2P model is very fair (if you're not trying to PVP at a high level, anyway), and you can finish the game without spending a single dime if you wish.  Zen (the store currency) can be bought with in-game resources, but even not counting that you can use entirely free ships and weapons to finish the story and dive into the endgame, it's just a bit harder.  The endgame grind can, admittedly, be a slog.  Mostly in time, not in repetiveness if you plan it right, but it's still there.  That grind is only as important as you want it to be though.STO is not without its problems, but that's not uncommon with MMOs.  Yes, there's bugs, yes, it can be laggy, but for most people it's not so bad as to hurt the experience.  If you want a fun romp full of Trek nostalgia, STO is worth a look.			"

												If you like Star Trek then this is game is a must play... you may really fall for it and want to keep playing. I played this several years back and I must say it has come a long way in how the game unfolds and is presented. You really feel like part of Star Trek universe with the music, voice work, and the types of missions you get. I still don't have a lot of time in but because it is totally free to start playing it is easy to recommend.  The ship battles are pretty cool and have rather simple but still rewarding strategies even at the beginning. It isn't complex but again if you like Star Trek it gives you that feel like you are having those battles in space with a star ship. I'm hoping as you level and continue to explore there will be more depth.  The ground combat is pretty weak. Presentation is better and the integration of all the parts is so much better than a few years ago it is comendable. Still it's a shame the quality isn't even up to where Star Wars online's work is and not nearly as fullfilling as a Rift, WoW or Guild Wars 2 scheme.  I like that despite some of the weaker pieces the game still has that Star Trek flavor that makes it worth playing for those who like the movies and TV shows.			"

												This was the game that got me back into gaming back in 2011 after a long hiatus from games. In 2017, the game engine and play mechanics has aged pretty badly (they weren't astounding even in 2011). However, if you enjoy pretending you are in Star Fleet flying your ships around, it's fun to collect all the ships and play dress-up with your captain and crew. It might be a different experience after Free2Play launched, which makes the experience feel ""less pure"" because a lot of things are now unlocks that used to be part of the core subscription experience, but it is not as bad as Free2Play Star Wars: The Old Republic (ugh). I'm rating it a YES because I have fond memories of it and enjoyed it as a game that is a scaffold for my own storytelling in the Star Trek universe. It has a very flexible, if dated, character editor and you can create your own missions in ""The Foundry"". It won't cost you anything to try it as it is F2P. If you are looking for a polished game with more rewarding action gameplay mechanisms, however, I would not recommend it. It is probably the most polished and complete Star Trek game out there now, but there is little competition. MASS EFFECT this is not.			"

												STO has been my game of choice since participating in the closed beta. Though it suffered from a difficult start and bumps along the way, the game has continued to evolve and grow. The PvE aspect of the game has become expansive and can seem a bit overwhelming at times for new players. With so many systems integrated over the years from Duty officer missions and abilities, Reputations systems, countless gearsets/combinations, greatly improved crafting system finally in place, and of course the missions both official and player created, the game feels mostly complete and whole finally. Like any MMO it will continue to evolve and not always in a direction everyone will be happy with. That said the Development team generally gets it right. The free to play aspect is among the best I have encountered in all my thirty years as a gamer and the last ten or so with my encounters with free to play models. There are items a player would need to purchase for endgame such as ship upgrade tokens, fleet modules, and a removal of the energy credit cap. All items mentioned can be purchased with either cashy money or in game dillithium converted to game currency through the dillithium exchange. Now for the bad. The PvP is woefully lacking in improvement and attention since launch. While it can be entertaining the public qeues are so one sided and have been since a few months after launch. Abilities are often unblanaced to a fault. Often you are stuck with either the cookie cutter flavor of the month builds, abilites, Duty officer combinations. Even if you have a great build you can expect to lose unless you have a mostly coordinated team all geared and built to provide the DPS and support needed to win. I would not recommend PvP to any new player without first consulting with a PvP group in game sadly. As for the bad part of the PvE side, The Special task Force missions and Advanced Qeues have become a DPS race. You need to participate in advanced Qeues to get items needed for reputation gear. Often if you need reputation gear you are not in a position to contribute much to the team. another. Another issues is the complete lack of need for the Enginner and Science professions in game. In space missions and PvP they are vastly less valuable than a Tactical captain because they cannot produce the same kind of DPS. Having had thirty eight Max level characters before Delta Rising and Six after fully geared and tested to a minimum of 15k DPS and some to as high as 35k (Good but far from great measured by the Infected Space Advanced Standard) and often coordinating for PvP and having written a few of the build guides over the years I feel qualified to say this. It is just the nature of the game for now and may change with balancing as time goes on. On a final note for the PvE is a lack of attention to some bugs, though not game breaking, they can be irritating.All that said if you are still here I completely recommend this game. The good vastly outweighs the bad and I will continue to play so long as this is true. See you out there.			"

												Yes you can probably see that I've played this game... a lot. The writers keep coming out with new content and events to keep you interested long after the standard missions have dried up.Character customisation allows you to redesign your character again and again and with new costume options available to everyone fairly soon after you dive in you can keep tweaking that look to match your characters' personality.The best experience however is to play in a team as this will bring greater rewards and teach you a thing or two. If teamwork is your thing then join up with an established fleet or take the plunge yourself and create a fleet just for your friends. Fleet management is, I will warn you, a time consuming and stressful at times vocation but it can and does bring its' own rewards.So many dimenions to the economies of the various currencies out there to mention here but a shrewd investor can actually make Zen (PWE's in-game currency) from the dilithium market.Overall, I'd recommend this to my friends as you have the option of playing for free and if you like it, you can always spend a bit of pocket money on improvements or even a new ship.7.5/10			"

												This game is free, so that should pretty much set  your standards low enough to like this MMO. I'll say straight off the bat that the ground combat is absolutely crap in this game, you might like it... It's 3rd person (can kind of have a 1st person view if you press enough buttons) and the AI is about as smart as ReplyGirls on youtube. But the SPACE COMBAT is amazing. It looks brilliant, it feels rather solid and you'll have a blast with it.It's set many years after the events of The Next Generation (Picard, Sisko, Janeway if you have any idea about Star Trek).The uniforms in this era look like Latex crap, but you can wear late uniforms from First Contact and customise how you look.Also this game/MMO absolutely craps all over Star Trek and everything it stands for. Just enjoy it as a game, don't ever consider it canon.I put many hours into this game because I loved the ship battles, that's it. Give it a try. It's free for crying out loud! ;)			"

It is the only StarTrek game that I have personally found where the entire trek universe exists and you are able to imerse yourself in their world. I would recomend this game to anyone who loves startrek, if you arent a trekkie then it may frustrate you a little bit. There are still some bugs with the new expansion pak, but like with any PC Game there will usually be a few bugs here and there. I am confident these issues will be resolved.			"

												You can see that i have spent a lot of my time on this game and i have come to the conclution that star trek online is a very good game to play with a small group of friends and level up together and do all the missions and side missions.however the end game (that is acheved relitivly quickly) is rather dull and there is not much content even though they have just released(ages ago ) an update that add new and exiting stuff but there is not much drive to contiue playing. MY BIG ISSUES WITH THE GAME:at the end of the game there is a large ""pay to win"" element that will most likely irrtate most players that play the game. also toward end game ship  customisation becomes less and less until there is none(or next to none). Even with the game having its issues if you love star trek, MMORPGs or both you will most likely like this game.Famous voices from next generation can be found i game :)			"

												While the ground combat is largely a eyesore the space content is quite a lot of fun if a bit complicated later on due to the sheer number of skills to keep track of. I recommend STO to any fan of star trek, or fans of space ship games - the quests are also fairly interesting and quite rewarding even if the ground content feels clumsy and largely in part hurts the game. Interestingly enough the ability to visit your ships interior is quite entertaining on its own, its unfortunately that the bulk of the items within cannot be interacted with but you can invite people to visit it all the same.

It took me until I reached Captain to fully understand the intricacies of the game, but now I've got it, I'm loving it! I've put in ~60 hours of game play and I haven't spent a penny. In summary, for a free game, even if it was a paid game, it's a great one to have. Hours of fun, prepare to become addicted. It's like STBC, but better.			"

												-As of November 21st of 2015, this review is woefully outdated. Be aware-Actually one of the more decent MMOs I've played. Strangely compelling.Even so, there basically is no endgame. Well, actually, there is, but the endgame really is just there for the sake of itself. You grind missions to get better gear to grind missions faster to get even better gear to grind the missions even faster, ad nauseum.Levelling up to endgame is fun but fast, and is really only there for the sake of getting you used to endgame, which the game still doesn't do extremely well. Skills in particular can be confusing to level.All in all it's a solid game with solid mechanics though, most of the powergaming bits can be ignored for the sake of its core gameplay, which is blowing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything in a spectacular fashion. Not very up and coming of a Starfleet officer, I think, but as a Klingon or Romulan is definitely fitting.As for the IP, STO uses the Star Trek universe to its advantage and makes fans of the series feel right at home, while not alienating people who've never watched an episode of Trek in their lives. Even so, the aforementioned tonal contrast between the Starfleet of the shows and movies and the more Imperium of Man-style gung-ho militaristic Starfleet of this game can be jarring but still doesn't ruin the experience (for me at least).As for the Pay2Win question, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I have seen of the F2P monetization model. Everything the game gives you for free is more than viable for every single PVE confrontation in the game. Even so, getting the very good stuff is still free. Explaining STO's currencies and economy takes a while, but basically it goes like this: -Energy Credits are the GP of Star Trek Online. They're gained mainly from selling random loot you don't end up needing. They can be used at NPC vendors and the player exchange, which sells everything from high quality equipment to rare ships usually only acquirable from Lock Boxes or the Lobi Crystal Consortium (more on those later)-There's this stuff called Dilithium. It takes dedicated effort to grind for the unusable version, which is then converted to the usable version at a rate of 8000 daily. Dilithium is used to do pretty much everything endgame.-Zen is the paid currency. You buy it for $1.00/100 Zen. You buy advanced ships and other helpful sundries with it.-You can exchange Dilithium for Zen. Players buy Zen and want your Dilithium because they don't want to grind it themselves. You want their Zen because you don't want to buy it. You put your Dilithium up and offer it for Zen, and someone grabs it. Or vice versa. The economy of Dilithium/Zen exchange rates are dictated by supply and demand.-Lock Boxes (basically Mann Co. Supply Crates) can be opened with Master Keys, giving you a random goodie (sometimes an extremely good ship) and some Lobi Crystals. Lobi Crystals are bound to your account, but can be used to buy things on the Lobi Crystal Consortium, things like desirable equipment, advanced consumables, and even good ships. Master Keys are bought from the cash shop, which you can get the currency for by exchanging the grindable currency.Again, everything in the game can be gotten for free. If you have enough time you can have the best equipment in the entire game without ever paying a cent.All in all, Star Trek Online is one of the better examples I've seen of an MMO doing things right. It had a rocky start, but has grown into a great game. I definitely recommend trying it, even if you don't really like Star Trek.			"

												Star Trek has always been a dream MMO for me to play and when I first saw this I knew I had found my one home on the internet.I installed it and created my account and I was truly amazed by just the amount of immersion they have built into the game. Ypou start by creating your character, You can choose between Federation, Klingon Empire or Romulan Empire... I picked Starfleet of course!Upon creating your character I was expecting your normal 6 races that were peoples most favs but I soon learned that you could go as far as being Andorian and even a Trill(Joined or not) BUT it does not stop there, They have also included the tools to create your own Alien Race complete with special abilities custom looks and the lot. Imagine Spore Creature Creator in an MMO! The Tutorial began and I was celebrating graduation from starfleet Academy which for me was a real shame because I would liked to have spent some more time and perhaps even my first 10 levels just learning about the game and the Star Trek Universe. I mean would you take up the chance to do a class on Warp Engineering?This is where the excittment stopped for me, There is ground combat but I refuse to even Awknowledge that part of the game as its severly lacking in every possible way. (I remember one time I was being chased around a tree by a Klingon... all my friends just stood and laughed at me) Space battles are extremely intense and provide a great bit of stress relief though I felt there could have been a little more.SUGGESTION: Not something I can really complaoin about but I'm going to rant and suggest it here... this is Star Trek and there is no ability to command your ship from the captains chair... I want to be able to walk around my ship issuing commands to my crew, not steering and fighting in 3rd person from outside the ship!Now that is all I can say but would like to also note it is a Theme Park MMO and I find these rather boring so this is not one I have played a lot of but it is one that has earnt itself a spot on my shelf and it will remain there defiantly.

												It certainly has it's weak points; repetetive missions, occasional bugs and some poor gameplay, although that's confined to ground missions. On the plus side, this is easily the best looking, most expansive and most realistic Star Trek game ever, that offers the best way to expericne the Star Trek universe yourself. Team games are also a lot of fun, especially death macthes. On top of that, it's easy to learn, highly customisable, and doesn't require you to throw money at it. Sure, you can pay your way up to bigger ships, but you loose the sense of achievement of ranking up. You're more likely to like it if you're more into the ships than anything else, but overall it's an authentic and enjoyable game.7/10			"

												One of the best MMORPG with excellent free-to-play model. You don't have to pay a single dollar throughout the whole time, everything can be obtained ""manually"". Create your captain (Federation, Klingon, Romulan) and venture Star Trek universe - it is hell of a fun and if you like sci-fi and especially Star Trek, you WILL get addicted to this game. 9/10			"

												This game is so fun and uses both space battles and and ground combat in a very simple but fun way. Ships are fairly customizable in the way you use them. There is the slight issue however of once you hit a certian point it is very diffucult to progress. If you want any ship other than the one given to you by ranking up you will either need to spend real money or spend alot of time to mine dilithium. Other than that the game is great and I strongly sugest you play all 3 factions as they all have a short story behind it.			"

If you pick up a mission when you were level 10 and you want to finish it at level 15 the mission will have enemies of level 15 and rewards of level 15. You don't need to fight with other players for the glory or the fortune or both. And there's co-op and PvP and... BORGS!!!!			"

												When you hear the words ""Free To Play"" the first thing that comes to your mind  is usually ""Sounds like utter sh*te."" This game punches the F2P system in the head. It's a great game and I full endorse it. Nothing is quite as fun as nuking other ships in space and then beating their captains up with a giant blade... thing... with more blades on it... in front of the entire crew. If you're not into Star Trek I would still recommend this game. Try it. You'll like it.			"

												One of the things that has always bugged me about MMOs is the long distance running to turn in quests. First they send you on a stupid quest to exact some justice on some lame fool who did something bad (insert short mission story line here), and when you finally get the guy and retrieve the spoils of battle from his cold dead corpse you have to run for days back to the quest giver to turn the mission in. So, for over an hour of gameplay you actually only played the game for maybe 5 minutes.  Not the case with Star Trek Online.In this space faring MMO you are the captain of your ship. You get to go out and have adventures and all that of a regular MMO with the flare of Star Trek. Along the way you can meet some characters from the shows. All that is to be expected. What was surprising was they way can get your quests. Like most MMOs you can walk up to a quest-giver and talk to them and they will give you the quest. In Star Trek Online you have the option of Calling them from your ship and selecting the mission from the list of available missions. It's almost as if the creators knew that you'd be a long, long way out in the middle of nowhere and wouldn't want to continually run back to to them just to turn in a quest. It is Star Trek, after all, why not just put them up on the main screen, Number One, and we can get on with our mission?Overall the graphics are basic for what systems can pull these days, and the voice acting in ok. The gameplay is a MMO game so you quest a lot. If you are a fan of Star Trek like me then you can forgive the game a lot and play for fun. At the sweet price of free, you don't even really need to be a fan to try it and see if space adventuring is right for you. Just keep in mind, if you are looking for the next blockbuster MMO to scale the mountain and dares all to knock them off of it, you're looking in the wrong place. This game is made for fun not necessarily to dazzle or impress you.			"

												The game has a lot of nice custimizable features for your character and crew. As long as you keep getting new equptment it's actually pretty good at keeping your quests to not being too hard for your level and having a lot of activities to do. For the most part the community is very helpful and nice but there are a lot of horrible people as well to watch out for but it's not very previlient.There are some quests who do feel over powered and just can cause you some problems but if you just get friends to help it'll usually cut the difficulty down, which is the nice thing, you can do your quests with friends and help each other out very easily. There are a couple things you can't do together but for the most part you can do a lot.Creating your own stories is a lot of fun as well though I haven't messed around much with the feature.			"

												This game is free, so that should pretty much set  your standards low enough to like this MMO. I'll say straight off the bat that the ground combat is absolutely crap in this game, you might like it... It's 3rd person (can kind of have a 1st person view if you press enough buttons) and the AI is about as smart as ReplyGirls on youtube. But the SPACE COMBAT is amazing. It looks brilliant, it feels rather solid and you'll have a blast with it.It's set many years after the events of The Next Generation (Picard, Sisko, Janeway if you have any idea about Star Trek).The uniforms in this era look like Latex crap, but you can wear late uniforms from First Contact and customise how you look.Also this game/MMO absolutely craps all over Star Trek and everything it stands for. Just enjoy it as a game, don't ever consider it canon.I put many hours into this game because I loved the ship battles, that's it. Give it a try. It's free for crying out loud! ;)			"

I would recomend this game to anyone who loves startrek, if you arent a trekkie then it may frustrate you a little bit. There are still some bugs with the new expansion pak, but like with any PC Game there will usually be a few bugs here and there. I am confident these issues will be resolved.			"

												Very fun game with good story lines and lots of stuff to explore and enjoy. There are a lot of things you can buy with real money (aka zen) but you can aquire zen by selling in game currency (dilithium) If you have multiple characters, you can farm dilithium much faster since the base rate you can refine a day is 8k per character and a little more later if you are in a fleet and or a vetern lifetime player. So basically you can buy anything in the game that costs real money, without ever spending any real money. It involves a little grinding but nothing you cant do easily once you have a lvl 45+ character. Cap is 60 now. I have over 1200 hours in the game since it has gone to steam and I played it pretty much since open when you had to pay a monthly fee to play. They are always adding new stuff though there are times in the past they were a little slow on end game stuff but it looks like they are picking up the pace again. Its free to play so you cant go wrong for trying it out. You have ground missions and your bridge officers that go with you to help you on them and you have space missons. Both are a lot of fun. You can also increase the difficulty of missions if you feel that they are too easy. Up it some and they definantly wont be too easy. Plus if you do, and you die, you take damage and you have to repair it, though it doesnt hinder you too much until you start dying a lot, which i have done before back when I was new to the game and didnt realize that I accidently turned it up to max. I got destoryed..... and a ton of damage debuffs... basically shooting blanks at that point and so were my officers. Anyways, its a great game and a lot to do. Try it out and if you need help, just hit me up @dacra is my handle for my characters. Good luck :)			"

												As with everything in the known universe, nothing is perfect but as far as Star Trek games go this gets pretty close!If you are a fan Star Trek you will love this game, if you love MMORPG's but not a fan of the Trek franchise you will still really enjoy this game. That said you should understand that although this is a free to play game, if you want any of the high end really cool stuff (weapons, equipment, ships etc...) you will have to pay real money for them, but don't let that put you off, the developers of this game have put so much really cool free and easy to obtain stuff into this game that you don't need to spend anything but time to get. also you can play the story without having to buy anything.You can tell this game has been created with love, and is constantly updating and evolving, this kind of devotion to an MMORPG is not cheap hense the need for in game purchasing which for this game I am only too happy to oblige.Be warned you will lose many hours of your life playing this ;-)			"

												A pretty good representation of the Star Trek series, especially for an MMO. While it is free to play, it does a good job of avoiding the play to win formula, if you are on my steam list and decide to give it a try, let me know. High level players can sync up to low level players to level match both ways, and they even both get credit for the missions tailored to their level.			"

												I've logged about 1,000 hours in this game. It isn't really THAT good, but I very much love it. While it's ground combat is like a lackluster, laggy Mass Effect, it's space/ship combat is the closest I've seen to perfect. It's a lot of fun and provides a huge universe to explore. Loads of fun.			"

												Simply put, Star Trek Online is a wonderful game.  You are given a high level of customization over your characters, crew, uniforms, weapons, and ships.  While you can spend money on items, simple Dilithium mining, grinding, and ship-to-ship combat can provide most of the currency needed to buy items.  Larger battles can provide all manner of weapons and ship upgrades you can sell, equip, or trade.  Story writing is excellent and puts you in several famous locations throughout the galaxy.  If you are a Star Trek fan open to playing in MMORPG, this is the game for you!!!			"

												No matter if it's good or not, I had to play this just because it's based on Star Trek.  Grew up watching the old Star Trek series, and greatly enjoyed the Star Trek: Next Generation series as well.  Playing a Vulcan, Tactical Officer named Warondar..of course.			"

												Over all enjoy this game. Unlike other MMORPG's there is a special feature in this game where players can create their own custom content. This is in the form of maps and missions. With in these there are missions or goals, tho the rewards for these games are standardised by STO (star trek online). If your a fan of star trek online then you'll more than likely enjoy the game for a long time. For even beginers (F2P Free 2 play), there is enough slots open to play 1 character from each faction. With in the game you have choices of engineering, tactical, and science captain. There are similar ships to choose from with appropreate abilities. If you want a little compairison, think of tactical like a fighter, engineer like support/aid/tank (not as high dps as tactical), and science to be along the lines of support ability wizard/cleric (offencive/defencive) Most of the game is available to play for free. In fact you can level up to the maximum level and pilot some top end ships. However special or eliet type ships are much mroe time consuming to get. There are story lines for federation, klingon, and romulan factions (playable). Then as you level up there are chapters about older star trek oddities like tribbles. Missions with the actual Warf as a voice actor. Borg missions, species 8572, volcan, and much more. My personal favoret is to visit deep space 9, Earth space dock, and to fly around where ever I want. I think this game as at least compairable to most other mmorpgs with pets, quests, items, character customization is far supperior than most. There is a lot of content that is available to those willing to spend the money to get it. Rather than monthly subscriptions there are free to play accounts, Monthly subscribers, and life time memberships.  The Life time member enjoy certain rewards and perks continuesly while other perks become available immediately on purchase.			"

												**REVIEW POST UPDATE 7/20/2014 6:46 PM (PDT)**A few months have passed, and so many new things came to the STO Universe. Such as more inventory space for free, and bank space. We are currently in Season 9.5 A New Accord. The .5 generally brings some modifications to game performance and what not. We should expect some new things, in Season 10. For now however, I have been exploring the STO Universe, making new friends, discovering new things, and more! I still do greatly recommend the game, for newcomers to STO, you guys get an updated Tutorial :3, but have fun, and never give up!*REVIEW POST UPDATE 4/6/2014 1:12 PM (PST)*The game has greatly improved over the past year that I had been playing it. Although, the Dyson Sphere can use some work, as there is a huge bug where the ground below you spazzes out, but other than that, a very great game. You might see other people that are Vice Admiral(Level 50 [Max Player Level]) and might make fun of you or something related, just ignore them. There are very few Vice Admirals' out there that would help newcomers into the STO Universe. I became one of these people and help any newcomer that I see that is in trouble, when it comes to a mission, friendly stroll in Sector Space, or some casual talk. I think every newcomer into the STO Universe, should remember one thing, Never give up. What you see there, was something I learned when ranking up within STO. If you need any help, low level or not, you can always message me In-Game(If online), or send me a Friend Request through Steam, message me and I will get back to you ASAP. I really care to help out newcomers into the STO Universe, it's a really fun and addicting game. So just download the game, and come on and join us!			"

												STO is a very well executed space MMORPG. The story is relatively engaging for an MMO, and the graphics are nice. If you are even a little bit of a trekkie, there is a great deal of fun to be had here.That said, like most MMOs, it gets samey rather fast. It takes longer than most, which is something I really have to give the developers a great deal of kudos for, but eventually, you're going to feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again. Something that helps combat this is that it has the concept of user-created missions. You can actually get on a special account type and create missions for others to play. These range from the awesome to the ""meh"", and is another unique feature to STO.The fact that this is free to play, and the paid addons are reasonable, makes it definitely one of the better MMO's out there. If you liked Earth and Beyond back in the day, you'll probably like this. Recommended!			"

												Yes you can probably see that I've played this game... a lot. The writers keep coming out with new content and events to keep you interested long after the standard missions have dried up.Character customisation allows you to redesign your character again and again and with new costume options available to everyone fairly soon after you dive in you can keep tweaking that look to match your characters' personality.The best experience however is to play in a team as this will bring greater rewards and teach you a thing or two. If teamwork is your thing then join up with an established fleet or take the plunge yourself and create a fleet just for your friends. Fleet management is, I will warn you, a time consuming and stressful at times vocation but it can and does bring its' own rewards.So many dimenions to the economies of the various currencies out there to mention here but a shrewd investor can actually make Zen (PWE's in-game currency) from the dilithium market.Overall, I'd recommend this to my friends as you have the option of playing for free and if you like it, you can always spend a bit of pocket money on improvements or even a new ship.7.5/10			"

												I came to this game back on the free to play launch.  I for the most part played nightly up until a year to two ago.  While the game is a great game one of the biggest down sides that caused me to stop playing the game is the constant grind to level up just so you can play the next story driven mission.  Sure it is easy to level up but it just gets old doing the same thing over and over again just to get to some new content.  The game when I came to it wasnt too bad but with the release of the fleet bases the game became a very huge dilithium sink which is now starting to level off some as dilithium values have dropped as majority of people have already finished their bases.I do recommend this game because you can put many hours in it but be warned you will have to do a grind to get to some stories as the story missions do not provide enough XP to level up from one story to the next.

												Surprisingly good. I have not tried PvP, but throughout the PvE/story missions, I have never felt pressured to spend any money on the game. You unlock a new ship every 10 levels, and new ships are occasionally available for free during event missions. Every ingame thing you might need (gear, bridge officers, deck officers) is available from (relatively easily) obtainable resources in game as well as money.  The endgame isn't lacking in PvE, as of this writing there is a battlegrounds area for ground combat, and plenty of task force missions for space combat.In summary, the game is worth taking a shot at, even if you aren't a diehard trek fan.

That said you should understand that although this is a free to play game, if you want any of the high end really cool stuff (weapons, equipment, ships etc...) you will have to pay real money for them, but don't let that put you off, the developers of this game have put so much really cool free and easy to obtain stuff into this game that you don't need to spend anything but time to get. also you can play the story without having to buy anything.You can tell this game has been created with love, and is constantly updating and evolving, this kind of devotion to an MMORPG is not cheap hense the need for in game purchasing which for this game I am only too happy to oblige.Be warned you will lose many hours of your life playing this ;-)			"

												Personal Rating: 6/10I've yet to play more of this game and I'm definately looking forward to it. While it is missing some essential characters such as Kirk or Spock, the impeccable voice acting and character emotion is amazing. Naturally, like all MMORPG's there is a lot of collecting x amount of y monster. But it doesn't feel overdone or underdone in this game. I'm not a Star Trek fan but I'm enjoying it! The combat is fluent and the dialogue is near-perfect.However, there are only two things wrong, small things, but non the less they are essential. The frist point being my character has no voice and for such a star studded audio presentation it deterierates into laughable situations where it's a very serious moment, everybody panicing and there's me, stood there, emotionless and voiceless.My second and final complaint it the ship. I hate controlling the ship, it just feels clunky and I can never get it to the right speed.But other than that it's a thoroughly enjoyable game (so far) and I'm looking forward to playing more of it. Unfortunate lack of Simon Pegg though.			"

												This was the game that got me back into gaming back in 2011 after a long hiatus from games. In 2017, the game engine and play mechanics has aged pretty badly (they weren't astounding even in 2011). However, if you enjoy pretending you are in Star Fleet flying your ships around, it's fun to collect all the ships and play dress-up with your captain and crew. It might be a different experience after Free2Play launched, which makes the experience feel ""less pure"" because a lot of things are now unlocks that used to be part of the core subscription experience, but it is not as bad as Free2Play Star Wars: The Old Republic (ugh). I'm rating it a YES because I have fond memories of it and enjoyed it as a game that is a scaffold for my own storytelling in the Star Trek universe. It has a very flexible, if dated, character editor and you can create your own missions in ""The Foundry"". It won't cost you anything to try it as it is F2P. If you are looking for a polished game with more rewarding action gameplay mechanisms, however, I would not recommend it. It is probably the most polished and complete Star Trek game out there now, but there is little competition. MASS EFFECT this is not.			"

												This is, actually, a really good game. I was quite surprised. Even if you are more the single player type, it works just fine since I am not into the whole MMO games thing that much.It is easy to play as a single player only game for the story missions and PvE is fun when you have the right people and communication.PvP is pretty much Pay-2-Win and I do not think it is worth wasting time for.This game handles the Star Trek lore pretty well but it is off on its own ""Alternate Timeline"" for TV show trek fans.The KDF are the best faction but they hardly get any DLC unlike the Federation side which is getting constant updates and new items.Overall a fun game when leveling up and playing mission, but once you hit the top levels there is very little to do other than replay levels and dreaded farming for resources.

Can't beat it for free. It really replicates the Star Trek experience like no other. It's good enough to stand on it's own as a single player game.			"

												If you like Star Trek then this is game is a must play... you may really fall for it and want to keep playing. I played this several years back and I must say it has come a long way in how the game unfolds and is presented. You really feel like part of Star Trek universe with the music, voice work, and the types of missions you get. I still don't have a lot of time in but because it is totally free to start playing it is easy to recommend.  The ship battles are pretty cool and have rather simple but still rewarding strategies even at the beginning. It isn't complex but again if you like Star Trek it gives you that feel like you are having those battles in space with a star ship. I'm hoping as you level and continue to explore there will be more depth.  The ground combat is pretty weak. Presentation is better and the integration of all the parts is so much better than a few years ago it is comendable. Still it's a shame the quality isn't even up to where Star Wars online's work is and not nearly as fullfilling as a Rift, WoW or Guild Wars 2 scheme.  I like that despite some of the weaker pieces the game still has that Star Trek flavor that makes it worth playing for those who like the movies and TV shows.			"

												As with everything in the known universe, nothing is perfect but as far as Star Trek games go this gets pretty close!If you are a fan Star Trek you will love this game, if you love MMORPG's but not a fan of the Trek franchise you will still really enjoy this game. That said you should understand that although this is a free to play game, if you want any of the high end really cool stuff (weapons, equipment, ships etc...) you will have to pay real money for them, but don't let that put you off, the developers of this game have put so much really cool free and easy to obtain stuff into this game that you don't need to spend anything but time to get. also you can play the story without having to buy anything.You can tell this game has been created with love, and is constantly updating and evolving, this kind of devotion to an MMORPG is not cheap hense the need for in game purchasing which for this game I am only too happy to oblige.Be warned you will lose many hours of your life playing this ;-)			"

												This was the game that got me back into gaming back in 2011 after a long hiatus from games.

												STO has been my game of choice since participating in the closed beta. Though it suffered from a difficult start and bumps along the way, the game has continued to evolve and grow. The PvE aspect of the game has become expansive and can seem a bit overwhelming at times for new players. With so many systems integrated over the years from Duty officer missions and abilities, Reputations systems, countless gearsets/combinations, greatly improved crafting system finally in place, and of course the missions both official and player created, the game feels mostly complete and whole finally. Like any MMO it will continue to evolve and not always in a direction everyone will be happy with. That said the Development team generally gets it right. The free to play aspect is among the best I have encountered in all my thirty years as a gamer and the last ten or so with my encounters with free to play models. There are items a player would need to purchase for endgame such as ship upgrade tokens, fleet modules, and a removal of the energy credit cap. All items mentioned can be purchased with either cashy money or in game dillithium converted to game currency through the dillithium exchange. Now for the bad. The PvP is woefully lacking in improvement and attention since launch. While it can be entertaining the public qeues are so one sided and have been since a few months after launch. Abilities are often unblanaced to a fault. Often you are stuck with either the cookie cutter flavor of the month builds, abilites, Duty officer combinations. Even if you have a great build you can expect to lose unless you have a mostly coordinated team all geared and built to provide the DPS and support needed to win. I would not recommend PvP to any new player without first consulting with a PvP group in game sadly. As for the bad part of the PvE side, The Special task Force missions and Advanced Qeues have become a DPS race. You need to participate in advanced Qeues to get items needed for reputation gear. Often if you need reputation gear you are not in a position to contribute much to the team. another. Another issues is the complete lack of need for the Enginner and Science professions in game. In space missions and PvP they are vastly less valuable than a Tactical captain because they cannot produce the same kind of DPS. Having had thirty eight Max level characters before Delta Rising and Six after fully geared and tested to a minimum of 15k DPS and some to as high as 35k (Good but far from great measured by the Infected Space Advanced Standard) and often coordinating for PvP and having written a few of the build guides over the years I feel qualified to say this. It is just the nature of the game for now and may change with balancing as time goes on. On a final note for the PvE is a lack of attention to some bugs, though not game breaking, they can be irritating.All that said if you are still here I completely recommend this game. The good vastly outweighs the bad and I will continue to play so long as this is true. See you out there.			"

If you pick up a mission when you were level 10 and you want to finish it at level 15 the mission will have enemies of level 15 and rewards of level 15. You don't need to fight with other players for the glory or the fortune or both. And there's co-op and PvP and... BORGS!!!!			"

												Here is a suggestion, if you drop support for mac, then dont say it supports mac. You see, this game dropped mac support and made an announcement on their website, yet they still distribute a mac version. The launcher works, perfect, and it downloads the game, which is very large and takes forever, but it downloads. Then when you try to open the game in the launcher, it crashes with a weird error. After reverifying and looking up the code, you eventually figure out they dropped mac support wasting about a day to download the game. It would be a lot easier if they just got rid of the mac version which they dont support...			"

												Star Trek Online has a very interesting story line. It picks up after all the movies and tv series and I like that, it lets me and other players see what happened after all the events we saw take place from the entire series. I enjoy the ship models, they're enjoyable and the textures and the way they move and handle are awesome and it sometimes to me atleast feels like i'm piloting the real deal. I actually get excited when interacting or meeting some of the characters from the tv series and movies in the game like worf, spock, tuvok. Its very nice to see those characters in the game and to see how their roles have changed. I even like the fact the borg are in the game and are as tough to beat as they were in the show.I defienetly recommend this game for any star trek fan.			"

												Great nostalgia, various ships, obviously having ones from the shows and movies, Single player is easy but fun, though I could see it getting repetitive. Go to a system, fight off ships, beam down kill the bad guys and free the people, oh the bad guy escaped, beam back to the ship fight him off in space. But there is plenty to do besides main quest's. Defiently recommend for fans of the shows. Not seeing a lot for the newer movies, except the option to have lens flare.Edit: As soon as I post a month later they come out with JJ verse ships and gear. I have to update as well intially its a bit repetitive but it gets alot better down the line. I still recommend. I myself dont mind F2P, there are certainly games that have that system that are worse, Warframe comes to mind. You can easily earn good gear in STO just by doing fleet missions			"

												I bought the game back in 2010 during the initial launch and wasn't very impressed with the game and quit shortly after. After putting the game out of my mind for almost 7 years I decided to jump back in to it and give the game another shot. I had heard from some close friends that the game was actually good now.I really enjoy the game. The story arcs are pretty good, the gameplay is very enjoyable with good space combat(the ground combat is mediocre, but it offers a nice break from the space combat) The F2P model is very fair and you can buy anything from the premium store(named the C-Store) with the use of in-game currency. They have pretty regular promotions(couple of times a year) where they give away free ships, just recently during the 7th anniversary they gave away a batch of Tier 5 ships(1 Klingon ship, Romulan ship and Federation ship) worth about $20 each for free and during special events they give away new, unique Tier 6 ships for free.The game is also very alt friendly(they actually encourage you to make several characters) Any ship you unlock through the premium store(with either real or in-game currency) are unlocked account wide.The game isn't without flaws though. Like most games, Star Trek Online has a loot box system which you can gamble to get unique ships only available from boxes. I'm personally indifferent to loot boxes in games, but I know a lot of people despise them. But you can also buy these ships from other players(through the Exchange, which is the games Auction House system) for in-game currency. These gambling ships are on the same power level as the ones bought through the premium store, but they are different in that they are not unlocked account wide.This is honestly one of the best F2P games on the market right now, and if you're a fan of Star Trek looking for a new MMORPG, I'd highly recommend it!

												I like this game.  I played it before Perfect World, when it was only Cryptic, too.  It's changed a lot.  There isn't 3 hr mandatory quest chain completion issues that nobody except me seemed to complain about.  Way back then, if you got an hour and half into certain quest chains and you had to log out, you had to restart the quest chain all over again.  I didn't like that.  At some point, I had enough crew members to do quests and there were quests to do.  It was quite joyous, because I never needed to risk some multi-hour chain quest as if I was in a dungeon crawler.  However, I'm a complete loner in the game, and at lvl 56 I just play to level up.  Statistically, I'll make friends at some point in the game of course.  The fact that I can essentially be an invisible man at lvl 56 does speak a bit to the depth and detail of the game.Unlike WoW, I don't play auction, and I literally have maybe three captains.  I don't even use the bank.  You can see by the hours I've played that I've been somehow more efficient than most in the game, but I don't invest in gear or anything like that.  In fact, I haven't even placed my 'talents' since the last update that reset the talents.  The newer Admiral quests add something to questing, so the crew quests didn't get boring.  However, the newer Admiral quests really, really, really like a lot of very nice expensive ships.  Either that's a lot of grinding or that's a lot of cash, and I don't feel like doing either, so they get done much slower.The only thing I really want to do is try to have to ships that have higher crew maximums so I can have more crew for quests and options.  However, 400 crew to me is pretty good because I don't really want to grind for the much higher crew maximum options.  In this crew maximum sense, a single $20 can go amazingly far, but then you'll be taunted in the sense that you want to fill the maximum just as quickly as you raised the crew maximum.  Slow and steady with a dose of efficiency works just fine.  I do think the game is fun, I really do.  This game has a lot of places to run around and look at things when you find yourself bored.  It's quite nice.  There's also a safe mode that's windowed that will work on little 11inch screen 2 in 1s.			"

												There's a lot of stuff to say about STO.First of all, it's absolutely huge, the story alone lasts for many hours already, and the content is constantly being expanded, partially even with things like player created missions. I like Star Trek a little in general but I never was a big fan of the series or anything like that.The graphics in the game are generally pretty good in my opinion, and some of the systems (like the fluidic space) are actually eye candy. The character customisation is pretty cool, but it's restrictedin unnecessary way.Also, expect bugs. Many bugs. Most will be to your disadvantage but every so often the game might glitch out in your favor.True to a really big MMO there are a lot of places with a lot of things you can do, and it'll take a hundred hours or so just to try everything out.I'll save myself listing Pros and Cons, as enough reviews have already done that.Also, beware of the Gorn jokes.

												1.well starting 8/2014 its updates with more and more monitization and more heavy monitization did i mention more monitization2. about 4/2014 the basis of the whole game as a power creap game started growing by 10/2014 the delta rising expansion the game became mostly about power creaping like more than 99% of your time consumed with power creaping3.i started playing in 8/2013 threw arc the time i played this game excessive then after things started geting amped up with monitization a update broke half the contents of my account customer service was really bad thay basicly made the point thay are crooks and refused to help me even with a lifetime subscription perchased and over $800 aside that invested C. do not invest in this game you will regret it if you dont like repeating activities 1000s of times to find it got you nothing but 100s and 100s and 100s of hours waisted time and painfull disapointment in the theme this game is not worth the downloadi would even say this game and the company managing it are con-artists and never show respect to paying customers or the fact thay invested in the game. it even looks bad for valve/steam that does care about thare customers on some level witch is 100% more than i can say for pwe/cryptic to be offering support to this company that pritty much will rob you for wanting to invest anything and tell you to take a hike after taking your cash			"

												I have never gotten to max level in an MMO before I played this, but this game suffers from some serious flaws. The end game content is very grindy, especially compared to the experience of leveling up a character, your UI WILL be filled with way too many windows, and ground combat is subpar to space combat. That said the episodic quests are outstanding and really make up for a lot of the game's flaws for me, and the free-to-play model is the best in the MMO business. A solid but unoutstanding MMO with plenty of fan service and a very good atmosphere, along with Cryptic's outstanding character customization.			"

												This is a great game with really cool gameplay but it has one problem. Every 30 to 45 minutes, the game will crash. This is not a normal crash, the game will stay in the bottem bar (I have a Mac) and it won't close. If i try to force quit it, it dosen't work. The application will stay in the bottem bar and won't close. Eventully, it closes itself (after about 3 hours). Please help.			"

												This game is clearly pay to win.  While you can play through the game without spending anything purchased ships and items have clear advantages over the ships you aquire  through regular means.  Ground combat is hidiously designed and clunky as hell.  You'll find there are significant delays between ordering an attack and executing it.  The game offers a choice between ""RPG mode"" which does all the aiming for you and ""FPS"" mode which allows more action oriented combat, but there's almost never a reason to leave the aimbot mode.Locations are generally uninteresting, and the game often doesn't reward exploration of any kind.  Puzzles in the game are often too easy to be considered interesting, and too long to be considered anything other than extremely annoying.  In fact, so much about away missions is annoying that you'll find yourself skipping as much text and dialog as possible just to get back in to space quicker.The redeeming feature of this game is the space combat which is well executed and visually pleasing.  It's possibly the only interesting part of the entire game.Like many other people, I figured this game would have a strong PvP element.  I chose to play as a klingon because the idea of engaging ships in raw comabt was appealing.  However as it turns out PvP queues are almost always empty and the likelihood you'll get to try PvP is almost nil.  I asked around about why PvP was so dead and .. SURPRISE: it's because the game balance is broken, and every experienced player knows it so they only play PvE.Missions are mostly wooden and uninteresting.  Sometimes you spend a lot of time annoyingly running between two points.  90% of the items sold in the game require currency that you either have to pay for, or is difficult to figure out how to acquire.  The currency you get the most of (energy credits) is mostly worthless for anything other than buying items which won't be better than the drops you get or speeding up travel which can be very slow over long distances.This game had the potential to be something special, particularly with the space combat which will suck you in - at least at first.  However it drops the ball in so many ways you'll wonder why you bothered to waste time with this dud.			"

												At the start of the game its really good good graphics, cool aspect, and really good voice acting, however when you get out of the tutorial bits it is ENTIRELY pay for pretty much everything unless your willing to pay $5 for some money(in game) in the later missions you wont really get far same goes with your crew and your gear. Throughout the entire game you will have the same crappy ship and bad gear and pretty much EVERYTHING can kill you in one hit not only that but if you try to run unless you bought a good ship you go very slow compared to the other ships and you end up dying and really cant get anywhere in the game. So overall i would not recommend this game AT ALL.			"

												If you are a Star Trek fan, you owe it to yourself to give this game a try... for free. It tends to lose itself in the background noise of every other MMO around. It does nothing really special, but it is fun to try to design your own ship and uniforms, and pick your own crew. The only real criticism of this game is the same that I have of every MMO: you are not unique. You have the same gear, access to the same missions, and are captain of a starship just like every other player. Areas around planets and space stations are clogged with dozens of starships, all captained by players. I feel this is evidence of a systemic assumption in MMO design, that players don't want to work for anything. I feel it would have been far more compelling if they required you to work up to being a captian with your own ship.From a technical standpoint, I have constant issues with the servers being down. I often get significant lag followed by the termination of my connection and (when I try to log back on) the server is down. This is not an occasional thing. Just about every time I sit down to play. I'm pretty positive this is not an issue on my end, as I don't encounter this problem anywhere else. As a result, I've not been able to play this game as much as I'd like.Over all, I think it has some value in the idea that you get to see a lot of cool Star Trek stuff. And, if played for free, this can be worth while (and the reason for my recommendation). But I wouldn't pay for a rather bland game with so many server issues.			"

												I am forced to decide between recommending the game or not, so I'll say yes, however, it is a huge ""Yes, but""You will need a lot of tolerance for grinding. Or dump a lot of real money into the game which I don't recommend, stuff is not cheap.The main problem for me is the 8.000 Dilithium cap a day (that's not much at all). It is clearly designed to slow down your progression in order to annoy you, wear you down and make you spend real money. This is a disgusting business practice, a bigger joke on the player than horse armor. Technically you can get everything in-game, but it will deliberately take forever. I can understand for some players this to be a game breaker.Also, you will need patience or the ability to have fun figuring stuff out. The economy, the UI, several features are kinda hard to grasp for new players.I personally mostly have enjoyed the game during the 3 months I have played the game, since I have played Wow for a long time I have a huge tolerance for grinding. The Space battles as well as story and parts of the customization are cool. And I will continue shooting a beam rainbow, even if it is not optimal damagewise.			"

												So ive played this game since release, i dont play it much anymore. I do recommend it as a single player/lore experience.level up, especially the Romulan faction really immersive hash some great moments.  That being said, end game is where this game comes to a halt, you quickly get to the point and thats micro transactions, its full of them.  Has some of the coolest ships but they need to get bought.big points - leveling is immersive- space combat is amazingly fun- Romulan faction i highly recommend.- Events are fun- progression as your leveling is fluid, has some great throw backs to   the varied star trek series.a huge con - end game, youll know trust me.- And ground game, very lack luster,theyve made several attempts to to improve this, with no   luck.

												I like this game.  I played it before Perfect World, when it was only Cryptic, too.  It's changed a lot.  There isn't 3 hr mandatory quest chain completion issues that nobody except me seemed to complain about.  Way back then, if you got an hour and half into certain quest chains and you had to log out, you had to restart the quest chain all over again.  I didn't like that.  At some point, I had enough crew members to do quests and there were quests to do.  It was quite joyous, because I never needed to risk some multi-hour chain quest as if I was in a dungeon crawler.  However, I'm a complete loner in the game, and at lvl 56 I just play to level up.  Statistically, I'll make friends at some point in the game of course.  The fact that I can essentially be an invisible man at lvl 56 does speak a bit to the depth and detail of the game.Unlike WoW, I don't play auction, and I literally have maybe three captains.  I don't even use the bank.  You can see by the hours I've played that I've been somehow more efficient than most in the game, but I don't invest in gear or anything like that.  In fact, I haven't even placed my 'talents' since the last update that reset the talents.  The newer Admiral quests add something to questing, so the crew quests didn't get boring.  However, the newer Admiral quests really, really, really like a lot of very nice expensive ships.  Either that's a lot of grinding or that's a lot of cash, and I don't feel like doing either, so they get done much slower.The only thing I really want to do is try to have to ships that have higher crew maximums so I can have more crew for quests and options.  However, 400 crew to me is pretty good because I don't really want to grind for the much higher crew maximum options.  In this crew maximum sense, a single $20 can go amazingly far, but then you'll be taunted in the sense that you want to fill the maximum just as quickly as you raised the crew maximum.  Slow and steady with a dose of efficiency works just fine.  I do think the game is fun, I really do.  This game has a lot of places to run around and look at things when you find yourself bored.  It's quite nice.  There's also a safe mode that's windowed that will work on little 11inch screen 2 in 1s.			"

												Overall, this is a very solid game. The space missions are fairly fun, the plot is interesting enough, but unfortunately, during the time I played, it still lacked some meat. Ground missions were not very entertaining--especially as I wanted to be *in space*--and once the main arc is done, you're out of decent PvE content to do with a friend. That, then, leaves space ""events,"" PvP and guild activities, the last of which depends wholly upon how organized your guild is. Most fall woefully short.			"

												Star Trek Online, or STO, is a game set in the space age with giant ships, a whole selection of races (Not Racing) and a vast galaxy to explore! I will recomend this to people who like Star Trek and to people who don't really know anything about it as through the story telling you will get to grips with basics of Star Trek knowledge. This game is still being updated regulary and has seasonal and daily events that add hours of gameplay added onto the 100+ hours of storyline, side quests and PvP. As this is a Cryptic game the customization is superb from the ships you fly to the crew who fly it. Now this game plays in two ways, one way is with your ship and the other is on the ground. As this is a mmorpg you can get together and play with your friends and play through the missions together or you can play on your own. This game is completely different to other popular mmorpg's as this brings another aspect to the gameplay as it's not just a grind fest on the ground but in space with a whole galaxy to explore meeting different races and player along the way. Now when you start the game you can pick from 3 main races, Starfleet, Klingon and Romulan all having different quests, ships, planets, weapons, armors and gameplay styles so they all offer a different way to play. Now as this game is made by Cryptic it does have some Pay to Win ascpects or in this case pay to unlock before unlocking as about 60% of the items and ships you can get from the 2 non payed currency, zen being the payed one. I am going to give this game a 8/10 as it has 100's of hours of gameplay, regular updates and a vast community; but let down by its small glitches.			"

												My opinion? I would say about 7/10.First, as a Trek fan I enjoy that it continues the story of the Prime universe, and that there are tons of call backs, references, and even cameos.Now, when I started, I admittedly felt like the controls were a tad awkward, but once I got used to them. I've found that that's all I really needed: to get used to them.The space combat is highly reminicent of what's seen in the shows/movies, even including attacks/abilities that can be traced to commands given by the various captains across the generations.The ground combat/missions could be better, but I personally find them tolerable.The graphics are good, but not fantastic, and it tells a good story overall.Also, if you love the ability to customize virtually everything(no, that's not an exageration), you'll get a kick out of this game. You can customize your outfits, your ships(with some restrictions based ship's class/type etc), alter your bridge officers, and even create your own species.The crafting system is a bit tedious, and materials are hard to come by, but it's not horrible.Now, if I had to name my biggest issue with this game, its the same as most MMOs: the microtransactions. By using real money to by 'Zen'(100 Zen = $1), you can unlock a lot of stuff, but some of it is kinda petty and/or overpriced. For example if you want to get a new ship past level 50(that's appropriate to your level), you better be willing to pay out $25 PER SHIP. Granted,, there are other ways to secure new level appropriate ships, but most are geared for LV 50, and require grinding for special currencies to aquire.Also, I have to say I've notice the community tends to be a bit juvenile.  Even though there do appear to be some more mature people among the community, by and large I would recommend just soloing unless you really need help.So, overall the gameplay is enjoyable and good for Trek fans, plus it also has some good storytelling and decent graphics. But, the petty money stuff and largely immature community are a bit offputting. If you are a Trek fan, or just love MMOs with lots of customization and decent story, check it out, and enjoy some nostalgia.If you aren't a Trek fan, can't stand stupid players, or hate microtransactions...feel free to give it a try, but it may not be for you.

												So ive played this game since release, i dont play it much anymore. I do recommend it as a single player/lore experience.level up, especially the Romulan faction really immersive hash some great moments.  That being said, end game is where this game comes to a halt, you quickly get to the point and thats micro transactions, its full of them.  Has some of the coolest ships but they need to get bought.big points - leveling is immersive- space combat is amazingly fun- Romulan faction i highly recommend.- Events are fun- progression as your leveling is fluid, has some great throw backs to   the varied star trek series.a huge con - end game, youll know trust me.- And ground game, very lack luster,theyve made several attempts to to improve this, with no   luck.

												Oh God.OH GAWD!!!!PLEASEPLEEEEEEAAAAAASE send this game to that horrible circle of hell reserved for the ♥♥♥♥♥iest of MMO'S!!!!!!!Let me see...LAGL...A...G...And my system SHOULD blow this game out of the water...Auto-combat. Click on they enemy and watch them die. Or... attempt to click on them before watching them die because you're running at 5 fps and the enemy AI is having a seizure... TERRRIBLE (and I mean terrible) voice acting. Wierd Camera. Really Generic Quests: ""here, go kill this three of these Giant Beetle Things and report back to me..."" I'm sorry, did you mean ""click on these giant beetle things and watch them SLOWLY (and I mean slowly) die while you frantically search a miniscule bar 0' equitment and attributes for some non-existant secondary weapon that will speed up the process a little!?"" No? CUZ THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE PAST TWO HOURS!!!!!!!!Point n' click flying +Really Bad Lag don't mix. AT ALL... Overall, avoid at all costs, even if its free. There's some ""pay-to-win"" crap in there too, by the way, I just didn't encounter much of it because of my limited time playing the game...Yeah... its not just boring, or a ripoff (of time, that is), or bug-ridden, like normal bad games are, its PAINFUL to play. Like rubbing a cheesgrater against your forhead and staring at a wall of LED lights for hours on end.			"

												Star Trek Online is a great game. The gameplay is fun and the missions are very diverse and innovative, and one of my favorite mechanics is the foundry mode where you can create and upload your own custom missions which are super fun to play. Although some very annoying things happen with the game itself like frequent crashes/freezing, there's this little bug that makes it where your mouse arrow is in the wrong position so you cant click on thin gs because the arrow isnt where it looks like it is, but otherwise the game is great and although some of the MMO mechanics need working on (I'm looking at you Red Alerts) the game is very innovative and fun and rarley seems repetitive			"

												I've been playing this game for at least 5 years by now, but not on Steam so my ""hours played"" are no where near reflective of my actual time in game. STO is a good game and offers lots of stuff to do, lots of ships and gear to aquire, instances to run, etc. The ""ground mission"" graphics and gameplay aren't amazing, but the space battles are where this games strength lies. the community is impressively civil, and people actively try to help each other, which is rare in most MMO's. The publisher- Cryptic isn't especially great and doesn't respond to tickets or emails, or seem to really care what players think. There is definately a p2w dynamic at play, becasue grinding certain ships would literally take you years. All that said, I still recommend this game if you are a Star Trek fan. If you aren't, then this probably isn't the game for you.			"

												I just wanted to re edit this review as I have spent a lot more time in game and think it deserves a bit more time.Firstly I think this is the best mmo out there and its free! It is so in depth, I have put 70 hours into the game and im still finding stuff out. It is highly customisable from yourself to your ship to your ship crew.  The stories are excellent if your a fan of Star Trek which I am, theres loads of reference to all the franchises with episodes of time travel to get your origianl series fill.The ship battles are my favourite. This isn't Dota you have a full array of abilities to chose from, my Naga gets a lot of use. I am really enjoying the Science vessel it is my kind of play style and feels like a character in itself. There are hundred of different ways you can play the ships. Having a science vessel but then having a tactical team or a mix of all. You even chose the different officers on your ship which then opens up different abilities which you can choose from.You get duty officers alos which you can send on mission and this can level you, get skill points and dilithium.I havent finished learning the game, there seems like there is much more and they are always improving it and adding new seasons.

I like the game just certain things bother me with this game.. the amount of time it takes to farm certain currency is truly time consuming. Nearly all items are CASH shop based. The ingame currency used to buy items and upgrades has an 8k daily limit. which is like a penny a day when you see the price of some items. The game is design for you to make ALTS and FARM/GRIND to increase your currency intake.			"

												Only online style games ive played are Defiance, LOTRo, WoW all three are worthy, good games. But there was something about STO that i just love, the fact you can basically play the entire game without spending a penny [and this doesnt mean you have to spend hours and hours grinding on mulitple characters] As i am a fairly new player to a game thats been out for over 2-3 years it meant i could jion a fleet that had experience, helpful players. I love the game, by far one of my favourites, since getting i got the 1 month Gold sub, as this unlocks many things but then most stay open if you go back to silver [f2p] ive bought some of the ZEN [which is paid with real world money] as i fancied a new ship and as i enjoyed the game so much without spending a penny i thought £20 to have a 1 month GOLD account and then enough ZEN to buy a special ship was worht it. Theres so much to do, and it gets updated regularly, and at certain times of the year they have events where you can get free ships, costumes etc.			"

												Very fun game that definitely scratched my Star Trek itch, but not as much as I would like. Its really awesome to get your own ship and bridge crew and the space combat is very enjoyable. I don't really like the ground combat as much as its too mmo like. Which is my main criticism of the game that it is most definitely an mmo so don't go in expecting it to be just like your favorite episodes.  Its also very combat intensive, but there are definitely cool quests and moments that invoke the spirt of the shows.  I definitely recommend picking this up (especially since its free and doesn't lock away a ton) just know what your getting yourself into.			"

After all that I really did enjoy playing. My steam account showed 38 minutes play time even before I got the game to even work. It now shows I played a total of 58 minutes.. Where are my other 4 hours? The other thing is that you can't manuvre your spacecraft in a up and down complete circle. you go down and then it stops. You go up and then it stops. I am in space and can't do barrel rolls. What gives? And why would it till right side up if turning left and left side up when turning right? I am not flying an airplane in an atmosphere. (At least a plane can do barrel rolls, except maybe a few oversize ones. OR pilots wouldn't even try to barrel roll a 757, Not enuf room or power to complete it)			"

												k - if you think you like to view and/or fly the ships, this is it.   if you put in $, you can expand just about anything. not thrilled by that, but, i understand the needs of business and new content isnt free to make, so, i understand for upgrades, and the way they do it you STILL need the levels to ""fly"" the bigger ships.   its ""THE BEST eye candy"" for star trek ship fans to date. the 2nd part is a ground combat, KINDA like elite forces.  upgrades can be bought or won in combat.  im not impressed with the ground combat overall. its not bad, but most maps feel like the same few rooms in a different layout in fed.fed campaign is the most fun for ship combat, but the ground combat is, well, covered above. , but most maps feel like the same few rooms in a different layout.  i understand they are the very first written ""scenes"" and adventures, but, after the other 2 races, this now feels lacking. they also have ONE mission (space) where you have to go help people in the expanse.  i have yet to FIND the places to go, and i have searched in a grid pattern vertically and horizontally.  i have found 2.  this single mission sucks.  the rest are ok. PU-LENTY of starship combat, which is why this is the primary i play. random starship combat means if i want to go fight, i fly there.  in the other races, i cannot enter the same combat area's, EXCEPT the main ""starbase que"" areas (one or 2 per sector), thereby reducing my starship time.klingon campaign is a bit more linear than feds, a bit more fun, but little extra ship combat.  the storyline is easier to follow than feds.  i havent found any missions that are downright annoying yet on the klingons. romulan campaign is linear, levels are pretty easy, but you have to finish one piece for the next piece. no random combat in space (yet atleast - very linear) (a bit of a bummer), but its nice and everything makes it feel like a good story.  i think this may be the easiest to go up, as i did so faster than klingons, and much faster than feds (who i think take the longest).overall i do like playing, but, i would prefer to not have feet touch the ground, and stay in my ship.fed starts w reliant, then you can choose from thereklingon starts w ship KINDA, i dont want to spoil it.romulan doesnt START with a ship, but you get one within a few levels.

												If you ever wanted to know what happened to the ""original"" time-line after the events that sent Spock to the ""new"" timeline, this game will fill your curiosity. Suffice to say, the annihilation of Romulus, and the wound it causes to the Romulan Star Empire has had ripples through the Quadrants. And that is without the Borg reappearing, and Species 8472 planting infiltrators throughout the powers you know. And behind it all... well, I'll let you play and find out.Now the game has undergone a few changes over the years. Additions of some foes and storylines have caused others to be truncated, not always in a good way (the Cardassian section seems to have lost some of the storyline, and that left over has not always been completely rewritten to take those losses into consideration). The two major changes are the ability to play a Klingon Empire character from level 1 (it began at level 21 when I started playing), and the addition of the ability to play a Romulan refugee character, who leans more towards democracy (and indirectly to the Reunification movement started by Spock).Also the addition of ten levels, and a reputation system has caused a slight power imbalance to be created between new players and veterans (and those with easy cash flow). And while the space combat sections are perhaps the best I've ever seen, the ground combat areas are less so. And if you have experience with a game like SWTOR and their storyline (and at least the appearance of options), the dialogue can be a bit troublesome (you also don't have a Voice).That said, I still find the game fun.

												k - if you think you like to view and/or fly the ships, this is it.   if you put in $, you can expand just about anything. not thrilled by that, but, i understand the needs of business and new content isnt free to make, so, i understand for upgrades, and the way they do it you STILL need the levels to ""fly"" the bigger ships.   its ""THE BEST eye candy"" for star trek ship fans to date. the 2nd part is a ground combat, KINDA like elite forces.  upgrades can be bought or won in combat.  im not impressed with the ground combat overall. its not bad, but most maps feel like the same few rooms in a different layout in fed.fed campaign is the most fun for ship combat, but the ground combat is, well, covered above. , but most maps feel like the same few rooms in a different layout.  i understand they are the very first written ""scenes"" and adventures, but, after the other 2 races, this now feels lacking. they also have ONE mission (space) where you have to go help people in the expanse.  i have yet to FIND the places to go, and i have searched in a grid pattern vertically and horizontally.  i have found 2.  this single mission sucks.  the rest are ok. PU-LENTY of starship combat, which is why this is the primary i play. random starship combat means if i want to go fight, i fly there.  in the other races, i cannot enter the same combat area's, EXCEPT the main ""starbase que"" areas (one or 2 per sector), thereby reducing my starship time.klingon campaign is a bit more linear than feds, a bit more fun, but little extra ship combat.  the storyline is easier to follow than feds.  i havent found any missions that are downright annoying yet on the klingons. romulan campaign is linear, levels are pretty easy, but you have to finish one piece for the next piece. no random combat in space (yet atleast - very linear) (a bit of a bummer), but its nice and everything makes it feel like a good story.  i think this may be the easiest to go up, as i did so faster than klingons, and much faster than feds (who i think take the longest).overall i do like playing, but, i would prefer to not have feet touch the ground, and stay in my ship.fed starts w reliant, then you can choose from thereklingon starts w ship KINDA, i dont want to spoil it.romulan doesnt START with a ship, but you get one within a few levels.

												o k, ..get through the tutorial missions and there seems to be much fun here. Game wont always every attempt load,but runs pretty good. It is free,but I'd say spend 10 $ and get the 2 xtra crew slots...that will leave you w a little xtra coin for a bigger ship later on,if you dont spend it.  Lotsa bad reviews ..must be the grinch crew cause this game is interesting and indepth. There is as much foot action as u want too, away teams!  How bad can  it be..there are phaser assualt mini guns and huge green amazons walkin around;)			"

												Very fun game that definitely scratched my Star Trek itch, but not as much as I would like. Its really awesome to get your own ship and bridge crew and the space combat is very enjoyable. I don't really like the ground combat as much as its too mmo like. Which is my main criticism of the game that it is most definitely an mmo so don't go in expecting it to be just like your favorite episodes.  Its also very combat intensive, but there are definitely cool quests and moments that invoke the spirt of the shows.  I definitely recommend picking this up (especially since its free and doesn't lock away a ton) just know what your getting yourself into.			"

												If you ever wanted to know what happened to the ""original"" time-line after the events that sent Spock to the ""new"" timeline, this game will fill your curiosity. Suffice to say, the annihilation of Romulus, and the wound it causes to the Romulan Star Empire has had ripples through the Quadrants. And that is without the Borg reappearing, and Species 8472 planting infiltrators throughout the powers you know. And behind it all... well, I'll let you play and find out.Now the game has undergone a few changes over the years. Additions of some foes and storylines have caused others to be truncated, not always in a good way (the Cardassian section seems to have lost some of the storyline, and that left over has not always been completely rewritten to take those losses into consideration). The two major changes are the ability to play a Klingon Empire character from level 1 (it began at level 21 when I started playing), and the addition of the ability to play a Romulan refugee character, who leans more towards democracy (and indirectly to the Reunification movement started by Spock).Also the addition of ten levels, and a reputation system has caused a slight power imbalance to be created between new players and veterans (and those with easy cash flow). And while the space combat sections are perhaps the best I've ever seen, the ground combat areas are less so. And if you have experience with a game like SWTOR and their storyline (and at least the appearance of options), the dialogue can be a bit troublesome (you also don't have a Voice).That said, I still find the game fun.

												EXTREMELY AWESOME!!!! This is hands down THE BEST Star Trek and Sci-Fi game to date. And the fact that it works with old computer systems is great for players who A: don't have money to upgrade and/ or want to and B: It is cononical with Trek history.  It is by far my favorite game on the computer.  And Also Trek is 999999999999999999 times better than Star Wars.			"

												I only played for 4.5 hours my first time playing. Took me a couple days to get it to even load up and sync, update and patch. Then refused to even start to play. After all that I really did enjoy playing. My steam account showed 38 minutes play time even before I got the game to even work. It now shows I played a total of 58 minutes.. Where are my other 4 hours? The other thing is that you can't manuvre your spacecraft in a up and down complete circle. you go down and then it stops. You go up and then it stops. I am in space and can't do barrel rolls. What gives? And why would it till right side up if turning left and left side up when turning right? I am not flying an airplane in an atmosphere. (At least a plane can do barrel rolls, except maybe a few oversize ones. OR pilots wouldn't even try to barrel roll a 757, Not enuf room or power to complete it)			"

Federation has more ships options then the klingons, and Romulans have very crappy selectionHEAVY GRIND FEST OR LOADS OF REAL CASH FOR ENDGAME ITEMS,SHIPS ETCPVP DeadIm split down the middle with this game. I like the game just certain things bother me with this game.. the amount of time it takes to farm certain currency is truly time consuming. Nearly all items are CASH shop based. The ingame currency used to buy items and upgrades has an 8k daily limit. which is like a penny a day when you see the price of some items. The game is design for you to make ALTS and FARM/GRIND to increase your currency intake.			"

												We, I've played this game for just under 700hours at the time of writing this! Do I recommend it. Of course I do.For a free to play mmo star trek does it for me. It's not to complicated and I can fly around it a space ship and shot stuff and other player with my laser and torpedo's. Job done I'm happy.What Star Trek Online is a out of great content all of which is obtainable in game, although its a fair amount of farming and there is a time factor, but it is all achieveble. They regularly run event for free content or discounts or leveling buff, its almost annoy. The main quest is interesting and if you've watch Star Trek Series then it will make you smile and there is tons of end level content(duh 700 hours). It may be a bit old a date compared to some of the other MMO around but it is enjoyable and varied and for that it enough for me.They game is free, give it a good if you don't like it no harm, although I will say that the tutorial phase it a bit slow(first 5-10 level) But it gets better. Bear with it.			"

												Love this game. Stays true to Star Trek style without getting to MMO gimmicky. For a long long time (years and years) there was no level cap increase, which I liked. It made it not about levels, there was just new expansion packs, missions, story and new epic ships, gear, and classes. Made it more about the gameplay and less about grinding.Pros: Giant emersive star trek universeRidiculous amout of missions and contentRPG style for both your main character, you bridge officers and your ship adds a nice changeSpace combat is awersome. dynamic fights and strategy plays a large part in success not just better gear. yet still simple enough and not to complicated like Wing Commander where on top of everything else you need to learn to fly. Cons:PVP is very limiting. there are two factions at war, but PVP feels like a trapped collaseum of bashing each other till another ship explodes, pvp matches are also limited to how many people can fight. Compared to other MMO RPGs with PVP where you are running around with 30 or 40 other people it feels less MM and more like a group of friends came over for board game night. Ground combat: ground missions add a great change to space missions for sure, and the unique skills, puzzles, and enemies types keeps things interesting. and while I have seen some people group for ground 'raids' to get crystals and gear, the game makes it less enjoyable to actually participate in ground combat and has no insentive for ground PVP so no one really does it.Crafting: crafting has changed a lot over the years in this game. the first version was cool cause it was very 'Star Trek' like with various types of crafting each with sub crafting types, very star trek specialization. I liked this for this reason, made me feel more apart of the star trek universe. However, and understandable so, it made being able to craft everything incredible difficult (if thats what you want, its not for me, but I know lots of MMO gamers who do) and required 100's of specific and different crafting materials. So they changed it. simplifed a bunch of it, and reduced mats, and got rid of the sub specities.... then I took a year off the game and came back,... and it was changed again... even more simplfied but also now completly useless. None of the craftable gear was anything you would ever want to use. The had changed the way the 'fleet' bases worked and all the gear that was worth 'crafting/buying' was now sold at your fleets starbase. (the rest of the gear worth getting became reputation gear from the borg/omega/romulan expansions).Last con: this game has changed owners so many times and each time different people try to do different things with it and it has changed the way the game is played.  Perpetual Entertainment started working on it for the first 4 years, i signed up with them to be notifed when the game was ready and for beta testing, When Cryptic Studios took over development after Perpetual went bankrupt and started their codebase from scratch, I was never informed and the list I signed up for on the website was never transfered over and it was kinda ridiculous when I found out I had to sign up again. Atari did a really good job of adding new missions to the game but when they no longer wanted to be in the MMO ring they sold the game (and other MMOs) to Perfect World Entertainment, who already owned a vast array of MMO games. Although PWE has done some really good things for STO (the last two expansions were great), they changed the in game currancy and micro cash transaction system to match their exisiting games that clearly make them money, and they baught STO to make them money so it makes sense but it also made STO less like a star trek MMO in a star trek universe and more like a very 'gamey' environment, where everything was setup to game you into buying things. Which completly changed the dynamic and how the game was played in a not so positive way (if you were enjoying the star trek universe anyway). Its still a great game, just feels more like a futuristic sci-fi game now and less like you are in the star trek universie. I list this as a con because who knows who will own it next or what they will do with it.			"

Ok so I am a huge huge trekkie and loved this game in 2014. It was awesome to fly these awesome spaceships I grew up watching and walking around on all these different planets and such then.....the newness wore off as you can pretty much make lvl 1-50 1 lvl a mission and you can only replay so many times before it just gets boring. There is alot to do when you first reach max lvl(which is 60 but will take you longer to make 50-60 then 1-50) you have the PvE missions for marks to advance thru your rep systems and crafting and patrols but again after awhile of the same thing every day it gets old I guess but prior to this in Nov of last year I said what the hell and dropped a huge chunk of change to go lifetime as I was liking the game so much and had invested real money for ships and whatnot so it was all good....then.....Delta Rising came out and suddenly everthing was different, they revamped main mobs to make it really hard in the PvE missions to win without dying 30 times which is ok to a point but then people started leaving....and more people....and do not let cryptic fool you STO does not have one of the largest up and coming player bases just the opposite. So, both my fleets (fed and kdf) both crumbled as mass people left the game due to unstabilities, bugs and the fact that it seems the devs are not concerned with fixing the current issues instead, they pump item after item into the zen marketplace (real money) trying to bleed people dry. If you plan to just play here and there and love the sto world then I say go for it but do not look forward to investing your time to make it your primary game however, to each thier own and you like others may not agree with this review and thats cool. Overall, STO is not a wothless game and with over 2k hours I can say I have enjoyed the hell out of it till late and hope that cryptic changes their ways before its too late because I would love to see this game regain its former glory! SPACE COMBAT: The ships are nice to look at though the fed ships tend to all sort of look the same they are awesome to look at with the renderscale turned up. Combat is functional and easy to pick up using main attacks combined with abilities aquired by different bridge officers. One of the recent changes I do like alot was the ability to train a bridge officer with all the skills they are able to learn and change them on the fly rather than having to have multiple officers with different skills. each shi[ has 4 sided shields guarding its hull unlike eve and whatnot with a single shield that drains from all damage no matter the facing. Groups on the Federation side are still relitivly easy to get for PvE mark missions. I do like how you can go to the bridge of  your ship and look around and on most fed ships can go to the different decks and such.GROUND COMBAT: Here I feel there is alot to be improved as you fight either in 3rd person targeting each target manually or you can go to FPS mode by pressing B allowing you to aim and get more involved. there is quite alot of different gear you can equip giving you different abilities and skills. I do feel that there is somthing missing from combat here and it feels kind of rough in fights. There is a battlezone where after 50 I think you can go and fight dino's with lasers and the ability to call down orbital strikes lol but they are fun to fight.OVERALL: Until the devs step up and fix some issues and start listening to us the players I can not recomend this game at this time . Try this game out if you dont plan on spending any money or dont plan on it bieng a primary game, if you are a trekkie you will prolly have some fun at least going and reading the planet lore for system to system : ) . Hope this helped somewhat and hope you have a great day even if you decide not to play!			"

												easy and engaging, with so many side stories to keep you entertained for hours and hours.the ship controls are easily mastered and the learning curve is comfortable. follow the storylines until you get promoted a couple of time before running headlong in to red alert situations, these invariably put you on a borg incursion which can be hectic at low level...saying that, i ran in with my first ship and gave it beans, died, a few times, but certainly showed starfleet spirit.when you begin to upgrade your personal equipment for away missions, do not forget to upgrade your away team members also.Although updates to the game can mean a lengthy wait while downloading, especially if you haven't played for a few weeks, the constant adition of replayable side missions makes it a game you can easily come back to and enjoy again and again. two thumbs up to this game			"

												I've been playing this game on and off for around three years, have a lifetime sub, and five alts to my main. My hours on Steam are not accurate as I have played this through the STO launcher, Champions Online launcher, and Arc. As someone who has well over 1000 hours invested into this game, I feel obligated to tell you this game is in no way P2W or paywalled. The people who say these things are either bad at the game or can't be bothered to get dilithium and buy ships. NO ship is overpowered, bar the Scimitar which is just ridiculous. Some ships excel at their role, yes, but there is no overpowered. PVP is dead, so anyone using that as a measurement is fighting against people who have invested time into their characters.On to the actual review. STO is a Star Trek MMORPG developed by Cryptic Studios, a company that is really passionate about their babies. There are glorious space battles to be had, as you go from ensign to admiral over your character's career. You start off against the Klingons in tradition Trek fashion and things quickly escalate. Missions are divided into arcs that act almost as seasons, with some very impressive set pieces that are played around with.The character customization is almost overwhelming, with just about every species having a place and the ability to customize your own alien species. This customizability extends to uniforms and bridge officers, who are like your companions in other games. You choose their looks, their weapons, and their abilities. Every character, yourself included, is divided into three careers: Engineering, Science, and Tactical. These give you basic abilities that you can use regardless of your ship, all of which are fairly useful. Tacs excel at damage, sci  toons can pull some space debuffing magic, and engineers are gods of fortifying their hulls with extreme amounts of health. Any captain can pilot any ship, regardless of what type of ship that is. There is no forced progression path into a certain ship.I'll touch on ships here, since that's what we're looking for. There are dozens of ships ranging from Tier 1 to Tier 6. You get a new ship every ten levels, stopping at 40. 40-50 is T5, with everything above 50 being T6. T6 ships can be bought for real money, earned frome events, or bought by converting dilithium to zen. The conversion rate is around 160 dil per zen, which fluctuates a fair bit. T6 ships cost 3000 zen, which might seem like a lot because it is. You can refine 8000 dilithium per day as a basic player, so it'll take a while to earn and refine that much. Once you fall into a nice pattern, this isn't something that seems grindy.The difficulty of the game is fairly low, although the average player might have some difficulties if they aren't aware of how the game works. This is a simple, but shockingly deep game. Don't worry about loot until you hit 50, then find what you want to do. The game doesn't have to be just about damage, everyone has a place. Check out r/STO and r/STOBuilds if you have problems, and join RedditChat ingame.You may see me flying around as Johnny B. Obvious@prrah-khet, so feel free to add me as a friend and ask as many questions as you need. As long as you are willing to learn, I can help you. See you out there, cadets!			"

												Love this game. Stays true to Star Trek style without getting to MMO gimmicky. For a long long time (years and years) there was no level cap increase, which I liked. It made it not about levels, there was just new expansion packs, missions, story and new epic ships, gear, and classes. Made it more about the gameplay and less about grinding.Pros: Giant emersive star trek universeRidiculous amout of missions and contentRPG style for both your main character, you bridge officers and your ship adds a nice changeSpace combat is awersome. dynamic fights and strategy plays a large part in success not just better gear. yet still simple enough and not to complicated like Wing Commander where on top of everything else you need to learn to fly. Cons:PVP is very limiting. there are two factions at war, but PVP feels like a trapped collaseum of bashing each other till another ship explodes, pvp matches are also limited to how many people can fight. Compared to other MMO RPGs with PVP where you are running around with 30 or 40 other people it feels less MM and more like a group of friends came over for board game night. Ground combat: ground missions add a great change to space missions for sure, and the unique skills, puzzles, and enemies types keeps things interesting. and while I have seen some people group for ground 'raids' to get crystals and gear, the game makes it less enjoyable to actually participate in ground combat and has no insentive for ground PVP so no one really does it.Crafting: crafting has changed a lot over the years in this game. the first version was cool cause it was very 'Star Trek' like with various types of crafting each with sub crafting types, very star trek specialization. I liked this for this reason, made me feel more apart of the star trek universe. However, and understandable so, it made being able to craft everything incredible difficult (if thats what you want, its not for me, but I know lots of MMO gamers who do) and required 100's of specific and different crafting materials. So they changed it. simplifed a bunch of it, and reduced mats, and got rid of the sub specities.... then I took a year off the game and came back,... and it was changed again... even more simplfied but also now completly useless. None of the craftable gear was anything you would ever want to use. The had changed the way the 'fleet' bases worked and all the gear that was worth 'crafting/buying' was now sold at your fleets starbase. (the rest of the gear worth getting became reputation gear from the borg/omega/romulan expansions).Last con: this game has changed owners so many times and each time different people try to do different things with it and it has changed the way the game is played.  Perpetual Entertainment started working on it for the first 4 years, i signed up with them to be notifed when the game was ready and for beta testing, When Cryptic Studios took over development after Perpetual went bankrupt and started their codebase from scratch, I was never informed and the list I signed up for on the website was never transfered over and it was kinda ridiculous when I found out I had to sign up again. Atari did a really good job of adding new missions to the game but when they no longer wanted to be in the MMO ring they sold the game (and other MMOs) to Perfect World Entertainment, who already owned a vast array of MMO games. Although PWE has done some really good things for STO (the last two expansions were great), they changed the in game currancy and micro cash transaction system to match their exisiting games that clearly make them money, and they baught STO to make them money so it makes sense but it also made STO less like a star trek MMO in a star trek universe and more like a very 'gamey' environment, where everything was setup to game you into buying things. Which completly changed the dynamic and how the game was played in a not so positive way (if you were enjoying the star trek universe anyway). Its still a great game, just feels more like a futuristic sci-fi game now and less like you are in the star trek universie. I list this as a con because who knows who will own it next or what they will do with it.			"

												Awful. This game is overly complicated and confusing. I wanted sooo badly for this to be a decent and fun game but its not.  It's a slow moving digital trainwreck.  The missons are boring and glitchy. The functions don't function half the time and all fighting requires little more skill than clicking the mouse super fast.  On the plus side its free so all you'll lose are those hours of your life that you'll never get back. "

I personally am not a big fan of MMORPGs, so I don't really have much room to judge, however compared to games like Starwars the Old Republic and Guild Wars 2, I feel like the game isn't that great.If you like a slow paced MMORPG, play this because it's not very fast paced at all and is continually making you be focused and thinking about what you're doing.

												It's not perfect, but it's pretty good, and it's all we've got.Good things: classic Trek universe, lots of freedom to customize your characters and bridge crew, little or no need to team up until endgame (so it's mostly your ship, your adventures, your story), great ""Featured Episode"" series with high production values, ""duty officer"" system as addictive as FarmVille, some great player-made missions in the Foundry.Bad things: Current owners (PWE) are more focused on extracting as much profit as they can with gambling schemes (lockboxes) and selling ships and other items in the cash shop than producing more story content. Klingon faction woefully neglected  since launch.  Endgame still monotonously grindy.  All the not-so-great missions in the Foundry.			"

Star Trek OnlineSo I have played this game for quite a while, but I will try to be non-biased. SO, HERE WE GO.Pros Solid Leveling System, (although it does go to grinding later in the game) Lots of Customization (unlike most MMO-RPGs, the character customization is done through the talior shops. This means that Costumes are purely cosmetic) Game has a great Space Combat System Character Creation: You can choose from 3 factions, Klingon Empire, Starfleet, and Romulan Republic. Past factions, you can choose from 3 classes, Tactical, Engineer, and Science. There are also a bunch of races, including: Human, Betazoid, Talaxian, Andorian, and so on. Meh Story 4 Player Co-op Active DevsCons PvP is Dead Strange Mini-Map PvE Queues have long wait times Meh Graphics Meh Story GrindingMeh Meh Story Men Graphics Optional GrindingConclusionIt's a good game, a really good game. Not GoTY Material, but still great. Just buy it please!(Please join Mars Defense Perimeter)EDIT: as a side note the game does microtransactions, but i completed the main story on my first character only spending $10 (Spent on purely cosmetic items).

												I really wanted this to be good...it got repetetitive...fast. I think the most amount of time I spent on the game was in the character creation screen. I personally am not a big fan of MMORPGs, so I don't really have much room to judge, however compared to games like Starwars the Old Republic and Guild Wars 2, I feel like the game isn't that great.If you like a slow paced MMORPG, play this because it's not very fast paced at all and is continually making you be focused and thinking about what you're doing.

												Well, I used to play this Star Trek Online back in 2015 when I was 15 or 16. I think Star Trek Online is a really awesome game  (In my opinion) like I can explore others planets and go to other sectors and stuff! I give this game a 10/10!			"

												It's hard to say that I recommend this game, but since it's free to play, you're not out anything if you download it and hate it.I've played this game off and on for years, but I finally just downloaded it via Steam. I did have some trouble opening up the game the first time; the game froze on the loading screen. I just opened the game in safe mode. (Options > safe mode). That fixed the issue.Here is a bit about me, which will impact my review: I would call myself a fan of Star Trek, but I'm not a hardcore fan. I've watched all of TOS, some Next Gen, and I haven't watched Voyager or DS9. Therefore, a lot of the references go over my head (since many of the enemies are ones that I'm not super familar with) but that hasn't hindered my enjoyment of the game. If you're a hardcore fan, you may love this game, or be super frustrated by the way it throws the Federation into war against almost any alien race that moves. If you're into gaming, you'll probably be frustrated by the controls, which don't always respond well.There are three playable factions in the game: Federation, Klingon, and Romulan. I have enjoyed Federation the most, the other two don't seem quite as well developed, or maybe it's just my personal preference.I have played through most of the new expansion that lets you create a 23rd century captain. The levels have been pretty underwhelming. The story is okay, and some of the voice acting is good, but I've encountered many bugs that range from humerous (including seeing my character in her undies) to frustrating (getting stuck on a panel and having to re-start the level). The rest of the game, from what I've played, has fewer bugs, but expect to have to restart a level or two while you go along. The 23c addition is great for me, being a TOS fan. It's enjoyable to see the costumes, the retro-styled spacedock, and having the chance to hang out with some TOS characters. The levels have their problems, but the nostalgia is strong and makes it fun.Other reviews rave about the space fighting and hate the ground combat. I'd have to disagree. The space battles get very tedious, and they don't require much skill unless you're fighting a ship that's significantly higher in level than you are. You can set all of your weapons to autofire, so you just have to steer your ship in circles while you wait for the enemy to die. Yes, the ground battles are clunky (especially in terms of how combat works) but it's great to see alien landscapes. The levels are very controlled, you don't get to go and explore the world on your own, and most levels keep you boxed in by rock walls or buildings, but the designs of the planet surfaces are fun to see. Missions themselves range from well-written and engaging to extremely boring, tedious, or frustrating. It's worth playing through the bad episodes to progress to the good ones.My federation character is level 53 (out of 60) and I didn't spend any real world money. Believe me, the game wants you to. If you want a great ship, you'll have to pay for it. You can also pay for special costumes (including ones seen in the movies and tv shows), pets, weapons, lock box keys, and more. My advice: sink a lot of hours into the game before you decide to buy stuff with real money. Some of their ships and other goodies are hideously expensive, so invest wisely. While my review sounds very negative, the game is worth a go, since there is some good content to be found, it's free to play, and most Star Trek fans will find something to enjoy.			"

★★★★☆ Pretty solid gameplay, if a bit repetetive. Awesome story arcs.Usually, I'm a late adopter when it comes to games. It took nearly two years for me to get Grand Theft Auto V, I've only recently gotten Left 4 Dead 2, and I'm still trying to convince myself to get Spore. But after years of playing in the online virtual world ""Second Life"".. and having a lot of fun hanging out with Star Trek roleplayers in SL.. when this game was announced, well.. I went a little crazy.I pre-ordered a lifetime subscription. During beta. I can only speak to the game's features as a ""gold"" member.. but what I can say is that this game is pretty epic.. for what it's trying to be.I had very limited experience with MMO type games prior to STO. I've since learned that some of the 'failings' of my initial reactions to STO were just indemic to the whole MMO drama (flawed animations, no lip syncing to spoken cutscenes, combat that was rudimentary in some areas, or overly power based, etc).Once I got USED to what MMO's are like, I returned to STO, and to be honest, I really do love this game. The graphics are gorgeous, the ship and costume customization options are pretty amazing, and once I got used to all the various powers and systems and things, it can actually be a lot of fun. The story lines can be a little cheesy in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way.. there's often a little sarcastic comedy thrown in that keeps doing throwbacks to the various series.The graphics for this game are what amaze me most tho. Every single screenshot I take, looks like something off the cover of a Star Trek novel. Whether it's a space shot, or a picture on an alien planet, walking around starfleet academy, or whatever. It is truly a lovely game.Honestly, if you love Star Trek, and you like MMO's, this game will probably be a great fit for you.And hey, it's free to play. Give it a try. "

												I've been playing this game since the beginning and I honestly can't really recommend it.  If you decide to play this game be fore warned that it's got issues like, login faliers, launcer failiers, lagging and rubberbanding, repetition, never ending loading screens along with server not responding messages, and finally the need to grind for anything of value in the game.  I know there are a few people that run this game with no problems and if that's the case good for you, but the reality is and you can consult the forums for this game most people have issues and its better to know that if you decide to download it and play.

												I've spent over 3 years on this game, I feel ready for a review. Sadly a negative review. Two years ago the game used to be simple and smart, the combat mechanics were easy to learn and you could become a master in several ways. Spending real money wasn't necessary if you were playing at least once per day.Then, this perfection started to slowly fade: they released lock-boxes (another pay to win way to obtain the best ships), significantly increased the costs of equipment, introduced tons of bugs (some fixed, but not all) and released new P2W stuff like rain. Moreover, they completely ruined PvP (actually, Devs never cared about PvP, now is unplayable) and, above all, made Engineers and Scientists useless, or at least much lower than Tacticians, since the only thing that currently matters is DPS.I'm Leader of a good Federation fleet, 100% Free To Play (yes, I haven't spent money for it yet, but it's extremely hard) and currently a better player than 99,999% of the community. I keep playing this game because I became friend with other players and this is the only Star Trek MMORPG existing, but at its current status I wouldn't suggest this game to anyone.Hope my review will discourage you from installing this game, trust me, there are better games around.

												It's a mixed bag but there's more good than bad and it's getting better every day. Some of the missions are brilliant fun, and some times it's like being part of the universe - good voice acting can bring you into great immersion, fun space fighting can be tense and exciting and other times it's even better because they do things in the game they couldn't pull off in the shows... but...  for every amazingly mind blowing fun adventure there's a couple cardassian trudge fests too, and for every breath taking battle with amazing space scapes in the back ground there's a another mission where you go to point A, kill 3 things, then do that again for point B, C, D, say something different at point E, then go back to kill and move for F and G. Is it worth checking out? Absolutely. Should you expect everything to be awesome? No. But there is Awesome in there, and if you love the series, it's worth joining the adventure for a while and doing the ""seasons of episodes"" (the quest lines) and if you're lucky, then along the way you'll find a nice fleet and get the other possible awesomeness from all this - there's some great people in there too... just not in the newbie zone =)And it's worth saying twice - This game is genuinely getting better over time. The developers work on new content, on improving what's there, and adding new game play options as well. If you get bored and take a break for a year - it's a whole new game when you return. For that reason this is one of the few games where I'd recommend *either* a lifetime subscription or just getting a month at a time - play for a month or two, then come back later to whole new content, it's a great game to dip into.

												this is a fun to play, well made game that will be fuf for trekies and regular gamers alike. the missions are fun and well made, there is a decent variety of gear, ships and skills available, however, many of them are premium ships. putting money into the game is NOT necessary, and even the premium ships are possible to aquire in game thanks to a player run exchange for trading in game resources for premium currency, however... it will take weeks of grinding to get enough to buy them. as awful as this sounds, there is just enough variety and the combat is just satisfying enough that even what should be a grind is rather enjoyable if you let yourself get into it. it is not quite pay to win, rather pay to get ahead. the combat is somewhat unrealistic, the physics and controls feel quite arcade like... but it's still plenty of fun. there are ships for all different playstyles, everything from hard hitting, fast and stealthy but fragile warbirds to powerful all around battle cruisers. personally, i play a battle carrier as my main ship, and find it quite enjoyable. there is several ways to set up your ship and crew to be competitive, eveything from beam weapon focused ships capable of engaging targets at wide angles to fully torpedo focused warships capable of decimating unshielded enemies with massive volleys of torpedos, and whose main method of bringing down shields is using shield drain abilities.pros:-fun space combat-plenty of content-enough lore to satisfy trekies-multiplayer co-op is fun and beginner friendly-clan system is relitively well designed-multiple competitive playstyles, even in indiviual ship classes-even ""premium"" ships may be bought with in game currency with enough patience-although perhaps a bit too grindy, the grinding is actually enjoyable-most premium items in game that are NOT aquirable without spending real money do not give any real advantage in combat, someone with enough time on their hands can get to the level of a wallet warrior without paying a centcons:-ground combat feels like an afterthought, not very well designed, although still playable-the very best ships and the very rarest items in game require either a lot of time to grind out or you to open your wallet-controls can be a little confusing at first-pvp is rather limited, although this may not be an issue with some players such as myself			"

												Okay so I have logged in 71 hours so I think its safe to say what i think about this review.ProsIts free game.The space battles are amazing and very exciting.Ground battles  is just awe, the game developers did a good job.Theres a thing called the exchange, where I make loads of money selling my loot takes about a few hours for almost all your stuff to be sold.Very detailed the aliens and textures are amazing.its plot is very intresting dragging in klingons  orions romulans undine and devidans im sure there is going to be more (im a starfleet commander).ConsSome of the worst camera angles ive seen in a ground battle im firing at a ememy and all of a sudden my officers go in front of me and i click them and im litterly looking wherever there going.Will become a grind  after a while  filling your inventory fast.Fleets are hard to make needing 5 friends (ingame)to make one.its becoming a littel pay to play(yes not win) its still easy to play without paying but wants money so you can have more officers. CounterWill become a grind  after a while  filling your inventory fast. COUNTER The exchange helps.Fleets are hard to make needing 5 friends (ingame)to make one.COUNTER the community is friendly.Overall ill give it a nice 8/10 replayabillity is multipul with  the factions. hope to see you on this game andLive long and Prosper "

												If you're wondering if you should play this game there's only one word I can think of... Don't. The controls during away missions are poor. Servicable, but poor. Controls during space battles/events are even worse though, and that's where this game is suppose to shine. The story is rather bland. Then there's the immersion breaking stuff you encounter if you actually enter your ship. Things like the interior of a klingon bird of pray having halls large enough to build the parthanon in. The clunky UI doesn't help much either. There's a very good reason the game went from pay to play to free to play as fast as it did. This just isn't a good game.			"

It feels like single player game mostly unless player choose to do pvp.- Storyline is little-bit too complex to remember and process by normal people.

												I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone,This game has alot of aspects which you do not meet in many online multiplayer games, the game might be very 'pay 2 win' at first but as soon as you start playing this game and get bettar at it you will learn over time that you can easily win from 'pay 2 win' by simply playing alot.This game can offer alot, space battles, ground battles, PvE, PvP, custom Star Trek-related missions, Star Trek lore fitted into it nicely, great graphics, the game runs great on most PCs and even on my weak Acer laptop, the game will fit even people who do not like or do not know Star Trek at all, the game doesn't need you to know any of it as they will learn you what you need to know and allow you to play it freely, if you want you can do side missions which will give you more knowledge of the actual movies and series, but this is of course not necessary.A short sum-up:Pro's:- Graphics- Optional storyline- Alot of area's- Frequently updated with new content- Short install- Easy to play on any PCCons:- Weekly maintenance, preventing you from playing the game at times.- Can have a bad connection at times.- Good and active Fleets are hard to be find, people expect you to automatically know things alot or they leave you alone, you need to play with friends and some 'vetted' friends so you know how to do it.The golden tip:Play the tutorial real carefully and don't rush anything, you will get real useful tips that will help you through the entire game.

												If you like space ships, have some fun with this game. However, the devs have essentially bolted a microtransaction/grindfest on every aspect of their game now. If you do decide to to put some money into it, buy your ingame currency through the ARC store. It is a pain but if you try and go through steam, PWE doesn't like that and will lock any gear you buy with the currency to your account. Such a thing isn't bad if you're just upgrading your own ships. But if your intent is to sell the gear on the exchange, maybe you want one of those shiny lockbox ships, you're sol. Give the game a try, just watch out for their greed hammer. I for one, don't recommend it.			"

												This game was once very good. However, in the last update, the game has stopped working for me. Cryptic has refused (not through words, but through actions), to fix the bug that is plauging myself and so many others. If they were to fix this game, I would be happy, but I'm not optamistic			"

												First off I started to play it 5 days ago and I am already a level 25 Klingon and have a tier 3 ship so yes it is adictive.Star Trek On-Line can be a little overwhelming at first stat of playing with all that is going on and I am stil learning and trying to grasp it all. There is research to do with your officers, setting skill points for yourself and your officers as well as promoting them. There are joint effort missions like Borg invsions to beat. You have away missions on both ships and planets. You can explore the inside of your ship real time and interact with all department heads in each area plus your bridge crew. All ships are fully customizable from interiors to exterior colors. You get a free ship choice on each Rank level you make. All in all I am saying a good game and you really can accomplish a lot with the total free play. But I have to admit there are a few aspects that you might want to put a dime or two into it like for the lock box keys and increaseing your inventory size because you can loose some stuff once it is full and you forget to sell what you do not want. You can play dobble, drink at bars, interact with people on planets and many star systems to explore. And missions are easy to find and get tossed at you often. All I can say is try it out for free see how you like it and then go from there.			"

												(While the review shows ive only played .8 hours of this game through steam i own a hard copy of the game i use to install so its not listed on steam. And i have played since closed beta.)Overall quality of this game is bad. Ive been with this game since its beta and it was shipped unfinished to meet a contract deadline, they (the devs) admited this. Major problems from the beta are still present in the game now years later. devs barely update the game at all and when they do it normaly breaks it worse for a few months then it goes back to what it was before with like one spelling error fixed in one converation nobody reads anyway. The games ingame store makes the game pay to win, but all that money you are paying them they are not putting towards developing the game.  Feature episodes (their version of a tv show episode) which are kinda like mini events that move forwards the timel ine of the game and cost alot of dev time can most of the time out of a 6 weeks for 6 parts series be completed in 30 minutesabout 5 min for a part some of the parts are purely walls of text to read and complete in less then 2 min.Actual gameplay of this game is in a word repetative. Go here kill this. Go here collect this. Go here kill this to collect this. Completely missing the point of the story telling that was any of the TV shows, starfleet rarely uses lethal force or force at all to achieve there goals but thats all you do in this game. Once in a blue moon you come across an interesting quest line but most are sub par, literaly narrow hallways with the entrance on one end, 4 groups of enemies to kill and a conversation at the end. Time to max level in this game taeks about 4 to 6 weeks. Ground combat in this game is a joke it lacks anything to make it fun, boreing interiors for all but 6 missions. Space combat is not in much better shape but at least they spent time here usualy interesting looking locations but still repetative combat, enter mission - kill 4 groups - conversation - leave.Dev comepletely fail at understanding how to make a game. There are enemies in the game that have a 0% chance to miss you and deal 10 times your health and sheilds combined both in ground and space. This is to add ""challenge"" to the game when in reality they skimped out on making the game made it kill you so you would have to eather try again and hope you DPS it to death before it can react or you grind some repetative mission to crap xp to become higher level then the guy to go back through the whole mission again to kill him and continue the sub par story that you dont even remember why your in the same exact looking base killing another dude.While most of this game is complete crap they have at least done some interesting things to the cannon star trek story line and is at least worth playing for a month to get the story if your a star trek fan. And some of there latest content that last big update adding the delta quadrant is rather good story and gameplay wise they actualy broke there own molds for missions in this last update, the main enemy in these missions is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to fight in space since it can one shot even the most tanky crusier you have with a massive nearly unavoidable AOE in space, but other then that its rather good. Also while this game is lacking in most areas it is a fun game to paly with friends. Also making your character in this game uses one of the best systems ive ever seen in a game you can control almost all aspects of your characters looks. The create your own missions portion of the game called the foundry is also an interesting idea and fun to do some times. More often then not the community comes up with better missions then the devs do.I do not recomment this game for anyone at this time, maybe in a few years it might be worth recommending to people but not at this time.

Posted: June 1, 2015
												First thing i want to add is, don't be fooled by my playtime, i actually have more than 5.000h of playtime in this, but steam for some reason refuses to count playtime for me except rarely.This would be an even more gigantic review if i touched everything that is wrong with the game, but i'll just stick with the issues that were added with the current expansion and are obviously driving people away from the game, and it will still be a long review, so be warned.This game used to be one the most casual, if not the most casual F2P MMO out there, it was forgiving and extremely fun, all this changed with the ""Delta Rising"" expansion, which turned the game into a grindfest, padded enemy HP to the point of hilarity and added forced countdowns in almost every new mission or queue in order to force you into taking a certain amount of time to complete stuff, it doesn't matter if you're extremely well geared or not, you'll have sit there and wait, and to boot on ""advanced content""(mid-tier content), they made ""optionals"" non-optional, if you fail them, mission failed, so if you're unlucky and some idiot in your team decides he wants to ruin it for everyone, he can do easily by shooting something he shouldn't or something like that, and this pretty much killed queued content which went from over 300-500 people playing at any time to around 20-30 at most, cryptic explicitly said they would keep advanced content as hard as the old elite(they promised it in fact), but they lied and increased the HP by 500%(later lowered to 400%, after months of complaining), meanwhile the new max gear tier will give you a 60% damage increase.They also nerfed exp gain across the board, and added ""specializations"" which in theory are supposed to be optional, but with the new ships(which use said specializations) and the fact they're incredibly good, it means you HAVE to get them, and they also take forever to get, since cryptic did everything in its power to make sure it does take a ridiculously long time(if you try to get them playing normally, you'll be lucky to get a single point in a week, which would take years of playtime to complete it all, and in 8 months they released a completely new one and expanded a previous one, and have clear intentions to release more, let that sink in for a bit).They also released a new tier of ships completely turning the previous end-game ships, obsolete(we're talking about $25 ships here), now before you say ""every RPG releases new stuff that makes old content obsolete"" remember this, STO isn't a regular MMO, your ship IS you, your player character only really matters on ground combat which isn't the focus of STO, on space all you get are ""captain"" abilities and some minor traits(think of them as minor passive buffs), most of your space abilities come from your officers and some consoles which can be equipped in ships. now some will tell you that the new tier doesn't actually makes the previous one obsolete since you can ""upgrade"" ships of the old final tier(some cryptic herself said), this is a lie for the following reasons(with one single exception):1 - The new tier still has another extra skill slot for your bridge officers(this is very important), the upgrade on the old ships doesn't give them a new slot.2 - The new ships have ""traits"", some of which are hilariously p2w, but the most obvious one is ""all hands on deck of the tactical version of the command battlecruisers(across all 3 factions) which to keep things short, allows you basically cut down your captain abilities cooldown by almost 50%, if you're a tactical captain(which are already the best type), you have 3 DAMAGE buffs, 1 targeted resistance debuff and another ability that gives you cooldown reduction on all your tactical abilities right down to their global cooldown(see where this is going?), just to give an example you'll be able to use your main captain ability(attack pattern alpha = +50% damage) every 45 secs , instead of every 1min and 30 seconds(it lasts 30 seconds...). You don't need to actually use the said ship to use the trait, all you need is to buy it, then ""level"" the ship(which is quite fast if go somewhere where you can destroy many ships).3 - Every new ship can use one of the specializations(atm there are intelligence(incredibly strong), command and pilot), the old ones can't, and cryptic made it clear they never will be capable of using it, in other words if you're using old ships, you're locked out of new game content, isn't it amazing?Now for that exception, there is a ship called the scimitar, which is by far the best ship in the game due to the sheer amount of damage you can dish with it(which is kinda fair, since it was OP in the movies too), but make no mistake, cryptic has made it clear they intent on releasing every old iconic ship as a tier 6 version, so you can re-buy everything again(isn't it nice?), so its a matter of time till they re-release the scimitar.Cryptic also added ""crafting"" which is basically RNG-based gambling so you can get a weapon with the mods you wish, you also need to use it if you want take your weapon to highest tier, which is VERY costly, even more so if you're trying to get them to increase in rarity(unless you happen to be a bored billionaire from dubai or something, don't try to increase rarity, its stupid).So to summarize, cryptic took a game with a booming population, which had a very casual, forgiving and fun playstyle, and turned into a boring grindfest, outright lied to the playerbase, and refuse to fix it, even though the population continues to drop as a direct result of said changes. Cryptic has been trying desperately to reverse this by doing everything BUT reversing/improving on what they did, its not working and it will not work, because in the end, the game is still boring.My recommendation? stay the hell away from this thing, if you insist on playing this trainwreck, be a romulan tactical captain aligned with the klingons, get a scimitar and the 1000 zen nausicaan ship of the klingon side, it will give you the best console in the game, the plasmonic leech, you don't need anything else.I'll change this review if cryptic fixes those issues... which i seriously doubt will happen.

												I have played this game for over two years and up until the latest expansion I would have had no problem recommending this game.With the latest expansion a large number of time-gated upgrade systems and level-gated episodes were introduced. At the same time the in-game currency system was revamped making it harder to purchase the gear you will need at higher levels. The rewards systems cut the amount of in-game currency that was paid out and the leveling system was slowed down by a factor of 2/3rds.Players have started to leave this MMO and the team missions in the game are now so empty that it can be an impossible task to launch any of them. As this is a multi-player game, having no other players to join in with is a huge problem.			"

												I really, really wish I could recommend this game.  Despite its grindiness and numerous issues, it's still a lot of fun...when it works.  To put it simply, the netcode is absolute trash.  Minor connection hiccups that cause 1-2 second lag spikes in other games will cause this game to immediately drop its connection and force you back to the login screen, and often it will take several minutes and multiple attempts to reconnect.  Unless you have a top-tier, highly reliable internet connection, STO is simply unplayable outside of very limited off-peak hours.  If you have fantastically reliable internet, go ahead and give STO a try.  Otherwise, don't waste your time.  It's not worth the frustration.			"

												Although the game is enjoyable, one first has to surpass a host of technical challenges and issues - most of which plague users after the game is installed. These include gameclient.exe errors, random crashes to desktop (without a report feature), crashes to desktop (which do trigger the report feature), disconnects, and memory leaks.In the 36 hours preceding this review, my client crashed out 23 times on an Asus 673JH-A1 with up-to-date drivers, making STO one of the buggiest games I've ever encountered. (This also takes the prize from Trion's ""Defiance,"" which gained quick post-launch notoriety for its bugs, glitches, and other game-breaking features.)Company technical support, or lack thereof, complicates the picture. Cryptic is known by this point as ""Chronic"" due to their persistent inability to launch a major patch without breaking at least one major feature - leading to at least 2-5 subsequent patches to fix whatever was originally broken. Technical support is also nonexistent, meaning you're on your own for troubleshooting and support.In short, definitely would not recommend this game.Update: After not playing the game for about 4 months, I reinstalled it on a whim and was promptly met by 3 crashes in an hour. At this point I'm giving up. No game is worth this level of aggravation.			"

												This is my first review So im gonna come out guns blazing.First off after so many weeks of playing and leveling finaly this game has let me down. Infact so much its not only unworthy of carrying the name Star Trek But Its got way to many issues that need desperate fixing.First off anyone thats getting connection issues. I agree That means Connection issues with some of the servers like the account server need to be resolved.Secondly Any maintanence ect. Shard maintanence being done needs more clear posting and further more Why do such a thing with the server up. Take the server down if your gonna do Maitanence damnit.And finaly whoever says this game needs a new Engine. They are right This game is in desperate need of a new engine and badly.Bottom line Cryptic you have let me down and a few other users down with your handling of this game you damn basterds.			"

												The continuing adventures in Gene Roddenberry's classic sci-fi series, taking place in the original timeline, not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ J.J. Abrams one. Starfleet has gone back to war with the Klingons (because why not) and you get to pick your side (you can also play as a Romulan, but they have to pick a side 2-3 hours in anyway).Voyage on a starship you get to name, as an Ensign, and command, because everyone else dies. Explore strange new worlds, that are neither strange or new, just cookie cutter. Seek out new life and new civilizations, except that sounds boring, we'll just give you some super easy ground and tedious (and still easy) space combat.Go boldly where everyone else has gone before, yet you'll still be alone, as there's no reason to party up. Ever.			"

												Amazing game when it launched.  I played when subscription was a thing,  enjoyed the effects, the control system, and you had the choice to pick between the nice, well thought out ship designs from the shows and movies or the bizarre ugly new designs.And then free to play happened, and everything became pay to unlock, which bugs me especially since all the ship models you need to pay to unlock have to be stored on your computer.  Fortunately the most of the non-canon designs that you had to pay for were of poor design quality anyway.  If subscription comes back and all the pay to unlock becomes play to unlock I will start playing again and be able to recommend this game.			"

												I got this game a long time ago when it first came out. I was and am a long time ST fan so I was very excited. After getting the game I was surprised how bad it was. Space combat was super tedious and slow, quests were all the same and everything was confined to small areas. How am I supposed to boldly go where no man has gone before when I'm confined to a small area like its an instance? If you've ever played the DnD MMO then you will know what I mean. It was the first MMO that I didn't play out the free month. They would have had to change pretty much the entire game for it to be good. By all means get the game and play it, but do so before you shell out a dime of your money.			"

												Bland and uninteresting. I'd like to start by saying I absolutely love Star Trek, the very premise of the franchise, I love everything about it. I downloaded this game (after ages of being put off of it's 10GB installer, which is a valid reason I feel with terrible download speeds) and my word, I could not be more disapointed. I had hoped for another Bridge Commander with a few ""Mass Effect-equse"" battles. In reality, the ground combat is just awful, essentially pre Mass Efffect 1 combat, and we all know how bad that is. The space combat is similar to Bridge Commander, but nowhere near as fluid. The quests are literally pointless and only serve as a use to tell you to get around the very vast galaxy. The first few minutes are just laughable, the plot is completely unrealistic, even in a Sci-fi world. Sadly, the point I wanted to get to, PVP, with massive PEW PEW PEW space battles, wasn't obtainable. As you have to be a certain level to even have a hope of joining a lobby and then being able to actually survive the Pay-2-Win. Why on Earth they didn't just remake Bridge Commander I have no idea. That right there is a gold mine. After 6 hours of play, I could take no more and freed up some space on my HDD. I wanted to like it, I really did, but it just feels so outdated and unnatural to play. Hopefully they'll be a nice new Star Trek game out in the future.			"

												Im going to lay out the short and simple of it for anyone curious about this title. It's good! It has an ever growing end game,  regular free content drops,  regular free item giveaways and special events open to ALL players not just subs or spenders,  the game itself is free with /THE/ best free to play model i have EVER seen.  The ever expanding story is good and you feel like you are a captain shaping the fate of your galaxy. The leveling process is quick and painless allowing you to focus on a good endgame featuring queued missions,  a newly revamped crafting system,  duty officer missions (a game within a game where you send your crew out to perform tasks on timed away missions,  they can suceed,  fail,  become injured,  die! Better duty officers provide special bonuses that improve your space or ground game by slotting them)  a newly revamped character trait system with meaningful and very well balanced traits to give to your captain that make very noticible changes in their abilities or give them whole new abilities!  This game is highly recomended for anyone that enjoys start trek.. You got nothing to lose on this game,  its a no brainer.			"

												I have always loved Star Trek; and as such, that will tend to make my review biased. However, I think it is fair to say that I will lay down what I feel about this game in a rather fair form. For the longest time, there have not been many great attempts at recreating the Star Trek universe in a game. Some of the best Star Trek games I would argue; go back to the late 1990's and early 2000's; where Star Trek Armada, Klingon Academy, Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force and Bridge Commander were some of the best titles. Later down the road; such as the mid to late 2000's, you had some titles but none were particularly worth playing. Star Trek Online comes around, and yes: The launch was dissapointing for many who expected it to be a in-depth Bridge Commander style game; not to mention other details seem to have went missing from the game. This is partially due to the collapse of Perpetual Entertainment and the acquisition and development over to Cryptic. The game originally was a monthly fee based game; but eventually it turned Free to Play. I played it for a while years ago but have since been convinced to pick it up and see how it is.I have to say, I am quite impressed with it. The game overall makes you feel like you are in charge of a ship and you even go under the sensation of living in the shoes of a captain; the amount of things to do and the quality of the mission narratives makes the game rather interesting and not so much a typical boring MMO. Pros:1. Free to Play system is fair. (There is purchase content, but it doesn't upset balance.)2. Customization galore. (Ships, uniforms, officers, loadouts, etc. Lots of cosmetic choices.)3. Solo friendly environment. (You don't need to be with others to succeed. You can team up; but the game doesn't require it.)4. Large Officer roster. (Bridge officers that can operate your ship's systems. Assign teams to go away on missions outside your ship.) 5. Space combat mechanics. (Want to focus shield energy on a given side? Want to increase power to weapons? You are in control.)6. Not a grindfest game. (Want to hit the level cap? This game doesn't make you spend countless hours of your life to get to that point.)7. Foundry missions. (User generated missions that have their own plot and objectives. They can vary in quality; but it is player freedom.)8. Star Trek MMO. (Star Trek fans like this. This is totally not obvious, right?)9. Mission types. (Not every mission involves combat or fighting, some are simple scan or repair missions.)10. Mission narrative. (Some missions make you think of yourself fulfilling the role in a Star Trek episode.)Cons:1. Player community. (It is a free to play game, so this is sort of expected. Players get too political sometimes and often immature. Sometimes it is difficult to make inquiries in chat, etc. Not everyone likes this kind of environment.)2. Enemy bosses. (This is more of a annoying trope than a real problem. Enemy bosses such as the ""villain"" type always seem to escape you.)3. Linear missions. (There are plenty of them that offer different solutions to a problem; but many missions don't have multiple outcomes.)4. Away team issues. (The away teams that you bring into combat will never try to revive you unless they are not fighting. Sometimes Away team members don't maintain unit coherency.)5. Some visuals. (Some planet textures on even the highest settings still look blocky and ugly.)6. Customer service. (The customer service is known to be on the poor side. Lack of sincerity and cooperation when issues arise in cases.)Overall, this MMO is definitely worth playing; even if you are not into Star Trek; the game itself is quite entertaining and full of things to do. There is a lot of purchase content; but it isn't required to actually succeed in playing and enjoying the game.			"

												Bland and uninteresting. I'd like to start by saying I absolutely love Star Trek, the very premise of the franchise, I love everything about it. I downloaded this game (after ages of being put off of it's 10GB installer, which is a valid reason I feel with terrible download speeds) and my word, I could not be more disapointed. I had hoped for another Bridge Commander with a few ""Mass Effect-equse"" battles. In reality, the ground combat is just awful, essentially pre Mass Efffect 1 combat, and we all know how bad that is. The space combat is similar to Bridge Commander, but nowhere near as fluid. The quests are literally pointless and only serve as a use to tell you to get around the very vast galaxy. The first few minutes are just laughable, the plot is completely unrealistic, even in a Sci-fi world. Sadly, the point I wanted to get to, PVP, with massive PEW PEW PEW space battles, wasn't obtainable. As you have to be a certain level to even have a hope of joining a lobby and then being able to actually survive the Pay-2-Win. Why on Earth they didn't just remake Bridge Commander I have no idea. That right there is a gold mine. After 6 hours of play, I could take no more and freed up some space on my HDD. I wanted to like it, I really did, but it just feels so outdated and unnatural to play. Hopefully they'll be a nice new Star Trek game out in the future.			"

												I tried playing the most recent expansion and it is complete garbage. The quests are buggy. The story is boring and unoriginal. The enemies were lame. This game is not worth playing anymore and they are just sucking it dry.			"

												Let me start by saying that having played MMOs since they were a ""thing"", I HATE free to play games. They have single handedly ruined the MMO genre. Instead of buying the game like Guild Wars 1&2, or paying a monthly fee like WoW, it's considered totally normal now to be nickel and dimed to death while you play a shoddy bug ridden game until the developer abandons it to go make another WoW clone and start the process over again. It's even leached into the single player market with needign day one DLCs to play the damn games. All these free to plays should have stayed sub based with unending trials, free accounts limited in level and gear, or should have gone the buy to play route. Thats said, nothing I can do about it, the market is what it is, here is my review of STO:I've played this game off and on since launch, before it was on Steam and went free to play. It's gotten quite grindy at endgame, but what MMO isn't. You'll probably love this game if you like Star Trek. Ground game is decent, ship combat is a lot of fun. Character creation is very good also, as per any Cryptic game, play as any of the iconic races or an alien of your own creation.Very fair free to play model also, imho one of the fairest. Expansions are all free. Everything in the cash shop can be earned ingame with time. The cash shop consists of mostly cosmetic items, along with ships for every tier, and quality of life upgrades, such as inventory and bank space. The only must buy item would probably be a tier 6 ship for endgame. Up until then, you get a free ship every ten levels. I only say must buy because you will hit max level long before you have saved up enough to buy it for free.They do go on sale, and the in cash shop currecy ""ZEN"" will go on sale once in a while also. But, you can wait and save dilithium, the main ingame currency, for a few months and trade it for ZEN to buy a ship. Why not wait til a sale, drop 20 on the game, and buy a ship and a costume? You've paid more for games that only provided 20 hours of gameplay I'm sure, and the developers really do deserve money for their work. Now, about the pay to win calls claims from people..Yes, it works the other way and you can also trade ZEN for dilitium, which is used in upgrading your gear. It's less ""buying"" gear, and more about speeding up the upgrade process. The thing is, it's not required. You can do all endgame with the highest available MK gear without upgrading it. It makes it so you can do daily mission and reputation grinds a little faster on alts and it makes your wee-wee feel bigger. But really, why spend real money so you can upgrade all your gear to max, skipping most of the game, to then cry you have nothing to do in game? The grind is there for a reason. Don't like the grind? Maybe you should rethink playing MMOs.Call it pay to win if you want, To me, pay to win is paying cash to obtain items that can't be earned in game, or buyign gear that is locked behind raid progression. That's not the case here, but whatever. If you think speeding up what is basicly crafting pay to win, I will never be able to change your mind. Stay away from the game.I think there should always be something you have to pay for in a free to play game. See the games that try to be super fair and only put comsmetic stuff in thier cash shops? They are either suffering from no income or already dead, because if people don't have to pay, most will not pay. Since when does free to play mean free to access all content anyway? Why would a company make a game and then expect nothign in return? Yet, when they do want something in return of thier product, they are villianized by cheap spoiled children. If that offends you, stay away from the game.8/10, Probably a 7/10 for non Trek fans, but it's free, so at least try it. Only game I know with ship to ship space combat that isn't Eve.			"

												Despite the Cryptic Engine not being the most innovative graphics engine out there, the game has some of the most fun space combat I have tried out of the non ""FPS"" types.Cryptic keeps pushing out content patches, new ships, and the class costumisation is one of the most in-depth I have ever found in any game. It's heaven for theorycrafters. Every so often however, Cryptic might release a new skill or item that makes one type of build the flavour of the month and in one case it can shadow all other builds, which are left in the dust.That's always the risk in a game where every class can access virtually every skill.The game merges two types of gameplays, the ground combat and the space combat. They work and feel different and you are able to concentrate only on one if you don't like the other. While levelling you might need to do a little bit of both, so depending on your tastes it might be either welcome variety or a minor annoyance, until you get to end game and are completely able to pick what kind of content you want to play.The ability to walk around your ship and starbases also allows plenty of opportunities for RP if you are into that. Talking of which the character costumisation in this game is on par with games such as Aion, if not better. The graphic style is not Asian, but when you can pick things like the length of your fingers, you know you can do almost anything.The game isn't necessarily pay to win, although items from the Zen store do have their advantages. If you have the time to grind, you can exchange in game currency for Zen (which you can buy with real cash) but the process is considerably slower.Overall Star Trek Online is an underrated game which has kept me busy for way more hours than most other MMOs I have played. In fact only one other MMO managed to beat it.			"

												If your a star trek fan this game is for you best part of the game is the character creation was expecting more from the space flight. There are older space sim games that perform better on flight and combat never enjoyed the game at all my advice play the game first before investing any money in the downloads.			"

												The devs are extremely arrogant and do not listen to the player base. This game was excellant and had great potential up until the release of Season 8: The Sphere; Legacy of Romulus was genius and I personally married it. Ever since then, their definition of ""Expansion Packs"" and ""Seasons"" has become seriously skewed and the content in these supposed major updates is the amount of a hotfix or 1/2 a season about 1.5-2 years ago. Long Story short, this game is going downhill at an exponential rate. Save yourself some headache and don't play it.			"

												This game use to be really good, one of the best Sci-fi mmo's out there. But now, not so much.. From what I've gathered is the Delta Update broke pretty much everything that wasn't broken and made what already was much worse. PVP is dead. Ship balance is all ♥♥♥♥ed up end-game. Before Tier 5 was the best, they were expensive but it made sense for them to be. Tier 6 however, ♥♥♥♥ed it all up. From what I've gathered the pilot spec on a ship with a tank build is broken as all hell in PVP. The game is loosely Pay-to-Win, I say loosely because you go through a process to get zen coins which are needed to buy top tier items, but the process is painfully slow and on a single accout, you'll never see a profit. It takes up two two months across multiple accounts just to make enough Zen to buy a tier 6 ship. Constant lag spikes and random rubber-banding that shows no sign of being fixed anytime soon.Ground combat is awful, hands down one of the worst I've ever seen. Again, no sign's of that changing any time soon. Many of the planets are bland and boring with no point behind being able to go to them. Worst contender is Andoria, outside of what I think is melee PVP, there's nothing there. No Top tier melee shops, no nothing. No one ever goes there. Upgrading your gear seems to make game shops pointless, at least to me. Why waste 5,000 EC on a plasma array when you can make a better one for free?.Upgrading later on can be extremely slow. Only 3% of the game is voiced, which is fine if it wasn't.. All over the place? You could be having a scripted conversation with your First officer, they have a voice that covers the first three lines of the script then the rest of the paragraph has no voice over, it's just odd is all. All that is forgiveable if it wasn't for my last point, THE GAME IS BUSTED!!. For many users the game wont even load up anymore. It's always crashing, can't even get to log-in screen without it crashing, there are no long-term fixes. Re-starting the game only works a few times, after that not even Verifiying files or re-installing the game will fix it. In short, this game was once a great game, then delta came along and ruined it all. If I was in charge, delta would of been a update that revamps ground combat, squash bugs and glitches, offered up more Voice-over and improved PVP.			"

												Alright. Not going to lie...I'm a bit of a geek when it comes to Star Trek.  This MMO continues to surprise me. Namely, I started playing it when it first launched (and it was a subscription based MMO). Cryptic did a good job, but to be honest, they launched it too early, and it felt like it was halfway done.  The Federation side had a good amount of content, but the Klingon faction, did not.  So after playing it for about a year, I took a break from it (a year plus break).  Coming back to it after so long, even after it went F2P and Cryptic was bought by Perfect World Entertainment, I must say, Cryptic has done an excellent job in expanding the universe.  Not only did they launch a third faction, the Romulans, they also fully fleshed out the Klingon faction.  They also updated the trait system, kit system, and R&D system, while continuing to create Featured Episodes.  That, along with a more robust Foundry (a system that let's the community create playable missions to share), I must say, I've gotten hooked on this game once again.			"

Same thing I went and checked my account to make sure and it said cancelled. So i tried one last time.Card was declined. Turns out, as the person from support told me, they take your money from your account before payment actualy goes through and you have to wait 10 days to get it back. There was no notification of this, nor any warnings that money had been taken. I find this shady and off. Now I must change my next ten days because of an error on their part and will not recive anything for this.Just because I wanted to support a game I play. Thats absolute Bull			"

												This game relies way too much on micro transactions, yes I know that they need money to produce content, and the only reason why games like WOW are able to pump out new and awesome content is because of their required subscriptions. However, I am not here to criticize their business practices, I am here about the game. The combat is really repetitive, the story is lax, repetitive and unoriginal. Don't get me wrong; I LOVE Star Trek, the shows are incredable (excluding DS9) and really fun. Space combat is fun at first, but after a while, you wanna die from the tedium. Though the ground sections are the worst, they tried to make it fun and interesting, but failed. Traveling to system to system is extraordinarly boring, you can fill those gaps with meme sesions, but then you realize even the sh*itiest memes are better than this game. They really tried, but the game became so stale, and they focused more on pumping out more content, when they should've focused on the issues the game had already.			"

												Star Trek Online - Nerd Wet Dream, or so it should beThis game lack everything that we love in Star Trek, well except for shipsThis game lacks so much of great stuff, from great stories, quest, side missions, total waste of opportunities.So let's start with quests :As we know Star Trek is not a warring universe, yes there are Borg, Romulans, Klingons and other warrior like races, but as member of UFP you should be seeking new lifeforms, seek out new civilizations, to boldy go where no man has gone before. but no you act as A klingon without honor. let's go with what you do in all quests, You warp in the system, scan something, oh what a suprise orion pirates/borg/romulans/klingons,  ""Captain should we try hailing them and negotiating, or maybe give them warning"" - second in command""Nah forget that fire all torpedos "" -youCome on this is star trek not Starship troopersAfter that you normaly teleport to a planet to kill more Klingons/Romulans/Borgand ground combat, just feels wrong and unresponsiveBut they let you at least skip all of the quest (and by doing quests you can get really fast last lv and start doing fun stuff)So whats fun in this game?Space combat, grinding for the ship gear. Well as for the space combat there could be more complicated but if you just put fire all on space and you just spam thatlitle bit left litlle bit right, it's just normal MMO just where your charachter is Ship, not you "

ST:O is a cash wh*re being passed around and exploited for the franchise. OK, OK profit is what companies make but ive never seen such a bad p2w concept in my life! PVP is completely ruined and dead because of it. Plenty of PVE crap being pumped into it though so if that enough for you be happy and rejoyce. Also open up your wallet!			"

												This game has become a bugfest. There are bugs almost everywhere in the game. The developers don't care about fixing them. They turn a blind eye to feedback from the playerbase. On the forums topics are being locked that provide negative feedback about the game. They only focuss on filling their own wallet's. They keep adding broken content and the amount of bugs keeps getting bigger. They fix 1 bug? 10 new bugs appear to replace the one they fixed. Their hardware is crap. Everyone gets disconnected from the game every few hours due to ""server not responding"". Yet the developers keep saying everything is working as intended and that the problem always lies on the side of the customers.The 5 year anniversary is the latest example of Cryptic's incompetence. The first 48 hours after the 5 year anniversary launch the game was unplayable because of the high amount of players logging into the game at the same time. What was the developer team's response? They told us to wait 2-3 days until everyone has finished patching their clients. Yet again this new content is filled with bugs and some of it isn't even playable because missions can't be completed.I have never, ever seen an MMO go downhill as badly as Star Trek Online. MMO's are supposed to be stable due to the high amount of players playing the game. But with Cryptic? With them: ""everything is working as intended"". I'm a big fan of Star Trek, and this game is the closest thing a Star Trek fan can have to an MMO representing the Star Trek universe. But it all gets ruined by a company that is only interested in filling their own pockets. I have endured this mess long enough. But enough is enough.If you are curious about the game but not familiar with the world of Star Trek, It's not worth it. If you want to see what the world of Star Trek is like, don't go see it through this game.			"

												After playing this game for about 3 years, I`m speachless. It is a real shame what this game turned into; endless grinding and deep pocket is a MUST to stay competitive (in PvP). Even if you don`t want to do PvP, but PvE only, pwe will find way to suck money out of you. Dev support is teribble, and bug fixes are just things that players can dream about. I can not stress this enough, DO NOT download this game at all. All that being said, I have enjoyed spending time with great communities on their TS3 servers, but I`m sure there are great communities in other games as well!			"

												While the early part of the game is fun and perfectly balanced problems arise in the addon and expansion content added after the Perfect World Entertainment acquisition and transition to free to play. The main issue I have with the game is the ""power creep"" added to late game content and how some items and ships are clearly more powerful than any other alternatives, especially the content that free players have access to. The base game is fun, and worth exploring if you are a Star Trek fan but as you progress to end game more and more of the content will be locked behind a paywal till eventually your reach a point where you will be simply inferior to someone who has dropped cash, from a little to a lot, to improve his or her ship or crew. Through the various systems in the cash shop you can directly buy power in-game. You still have to level to use this content, but the paid cash shop content is clearly superior than anything any free player has access to, some of the rarer, more expensive shops OP to the point of imbalance.

												Star Treck Online. Wow, what a great starting point for a game, and honestly, they did really well with living up to it's franchise...Only problem is that they became extremely money hungry, selling very good weapons and such for real currency. Still though, I WOULD give this game a good review, for all the fun i had with it. but after taking a year haitus to play other games, i came back wanting to play with my little brother, who loves star treck, only to find out I had been banned for ""selling in game currency"". I may have been hacked, no big deal, happened to me in GW2 as well. So i contacted their support about it, in response i got a rude message saying that I shouldn't have been selling currency, and that my ban was permanent (I believe the message was copy pasted). This combined with the old graphics and pay to win mentality killed it for me.TLDR; Good game that has terrible managment and support.			"

												Probably the best MMORPG I've played so far.  Still, it suffers from what other MMO's suffer from:  Grinding, people, quadratic leveling, and lost time.  I have heard people say it has one of the best Free-to-play mechanics out of many MMORPG's in that nothing is really locked behind a pay wall.  You just need to grind until your crotch is shiny and radiates tremendous amounts of heat.  While I can't recommend this to anyone who wants to have a life, I can say it's a pretty dang good MMORPG.  Also, I never encountered any Russians or Brazilians, so there's that.			"

												Was looking forward to a good all round blast, but the game is not what it seems.Lots of bugs, and loads of stuff that is not explained to you.The game is very deep, for insatnce at lvl 10 you get a new ship, at lvl 11, 21 crew who can assign duties to, but that is not explained to you very well, TBH a damn nightmare.Made a fed character at lvl 10 I was told to go, and do PvP training, but I did not want to do that, but that is all you can do.This to me just spoilt the story I was following.Go on to local chat in zone ask anything, and you will get no replies, as i Did.It is in all essence P2W.The greed machine will give you loads of nice ships, if you want to throw your hard earned cash around.After all PWE,Cryptic, and WOTC, made a complete mess of Neverwinter.= with the lvl 6 mod.Calling all areas at lvl 60 now 70, but too damn lazy to make any new content for lvl 70.Plus they sacked all there staff who made mod 5.Dungeons are now a mess.I had posts closed, because I had a go at the devs, and the company, almost got banned.They will not have anything said aginst the devs, stuff like that is closed, or deleted by them.That to me I find chieldish, as there are, so many MMO's out there who just listen, or take it on the chin, but not PWE, or Cryptic.They will tell you that they make the decisions, not YOU, no matter how you moan.Look on there forums hard enough, and you will see it, got to admit I was shocked not nice at all, and no need for it.Am I still playing???, Yes, sad really, but I will not give them a penny, as I know when I hit lvl40 it will be impossible, and I'll get one shot all the time, then I'll just go find something else to have fun on.To me games should be fun, but not with anything PWE, or Cryptic labelled they take the fun out of it.GL, Take Care, HF :).

												With well over 500 hours on this game i feel that i have to write a review. Firstly lets just say this, if you are not a person who likes to grind do not play thing game. This game is for people who really enjoy startrek universe. The game at times can be boring or diffucult at times but there are so many different things that you can do from PvP to PvE and even player-made content. You do not have to use mircotransactions to purchase anything as they have a few big events every year that reward some decent ships. The community is big and it is never hard to make your way into a fleet/clan. Overall i give it a 10/10 just because it is one of the best StarTrek games out there.			"

												If your looking for boring buggy story missions taht you have to log out and relaunch the game for the missions to finally work that the developers have not patched or fixed and if you want buggy and repetitive pve and pvp missions that the developers have not bothered to patch or fix and if your looking to spend a ridiculous amount of money to level up, buy ships, buy more inventory space, buy more bridge officers, buy more dilithium than to repetitively grind dilithium in order to exchange for zen which can become prolonging and tedious ect. then this is the game for you. I spent 25.00 on a ship that i had to buy after reaching admiral because the game does not provide you a free ship after reaching admiral.  I would not recommend anyone to download and play this game even if it is free it manages to take your money.After a while this game starts to make you realise what the hell are you doing with your life.  Your better off spending your money some place else.			"

												Star Trek Online is a very interesting game, to say the least, but has loads of issues. First of all there is immersion-breaking pop in with characters, entities, special effects, and entire scenes. What I'm talking about here is when the screen transitions from one scene into another it doesn't allow all of the entities to load before coming in from black. So you're frequently left watching strange pop-in with stuff. There are also numerous control-specific things that just feel... off... like clicking over and over to attack, instead of being able to just hold down the button, to give one example. It is a great looking game, and worth the price of admision (it is free after all) but I wouldn't really recommend it as something worth spending any significant amount of time playing.			"

												""Fleet Admiral and 6-year long loyal Veteran's Log - Stardate 94754.01 (Earthdate 24 Feb 2017)This will be my final uninstall of the game.Star Trek Online, over the past few years, has had some major issues, graphically. No matter how compatible and powerful my laptop and my PC are to run Star Trek Online, the game still has crashes, infinite loads or graphical issues in game. My laptop is fully capable of running DirectX 9, and DirectX 11. However I can only run DirectX 9 due to an infinite loading screen whenever I try to switch out the DirectX version to 11. (It will freeze after the 'Cryptic' load, where the title of the current Season is displayed, with 0-1fps appearing and disappearing constantly).Furthermore, updates and patches are tempremental with my settings. Some patches, maybe most, are harmless to them, and I can get back in game and not have an issue. But many, well, they break my install or my setup. Safe mode is the only way it runs, and that's not something I signed up as Veteran for. So for the past few years (on my laptop - we'll get to my PC later) I've remained on DX9 because it's been the most reliable. Although, even with this, I've had to at numerous times re-install everything to get it to run again without any issue. It is frustrating but being that I've been on this game for so long, casually, I've always tried again. Oh, and, reader, spare me the obvious fixes like verifying and such, I've tried everything I could find out and one way, shape or form it still will never work like it should.The latest patch though is the final patch I will ever let Star Trek Online install. Still running the old and retiring DirectX9 for this game, I get into the game fine as usual. However, another major issue has cropped up - the entirety of missing textures. All ships are invisible minus decals and effects, as well as the legs and face and hands of all my characters (just a floating torso and arms uniform, with a floating wig to boot). I tried to experiment with the settings. I tried switching to Dx11 and Dx9 experimental, and as is always the case, this causes the crash at the Current Season title/loading screen. Of course, Safe Mode works, however I don't see why I have to run that every time I want to play the game from here on in.As for my PC - I gave up long ago. The case was the opposite in terms of DirectX versions - it would only run DirectX11 despite full compatibility should I want to downgrade to a lower DirectX version (though with a PC as high-end as mine I'd have no need usually). Just as with my laptop, patches would be tempremental, with the same types of crashes and infinite loads. Exactly the same. Everything! Minus the opposite DirectX versions I use. I gave up on it long ago. I have better next-gen games to play anyway so I didn't have much patience to have to re install all the time.So I bid Star Trek Online, and the crew of my ships, a final farewell. The errors and crashes and general temprementality of it all is... well, I wouldn't say not worth it. The game is Free To Play. But as a One-Time subscription purchaser, and having put a good bit extra of my real money into the game to show my appreciation despite it's issues, I can tell you, reader, that it is Free To Play for good reason now. Don't even put a dime into it. If you can get into the game of course.""I'm not reviewing the content of the game here quite frankly. If that bothers anyone, then feel free to read the rest of the comments and countless reviews online that describe the content itself to make your own decision.			"

												The game is a neverending pile of garbage. Wonky gameplay that gets repetitive pretty soon, uninspired missions that become grindier as you progress through the game (yes, they add kill X enemies mid game and not in the beginning, it's like they ran out of ideas and went ""oh, ♥♥♥♥ it"").AI is terrible too, with friendly officers getting stuck annoyingly often. Quests also suffer from constant bugs one way or another, sometimes even progress stopping bugs.Graphics wise it's outdated, which is not entirely a bad thing, but is paired with terrible acting and direction in cinematics, giving it some below amateur feeling that you can't wash off.And last but not least, the user interface is more of a bother than a help. Things like huge symbols in minimap that simply wont let you see what you are suposed to see, to everything looking pretty much the same and thus making it harder to even understand them, or weird design choices like not giving a more direct approach to equiping kit abilities, having to realize on your own that you are suposed to try random keys until you get P and see a selection of avaliable skills.Basically, if you can skip this entirely you won't regret it, it doesn't get any better as you progress, it only gets worse.

												Spent many hours on this great game. Just came back to it after leaving it for several years. For a free to play game, it offers a fine storyline, and a lot of replayability as different Role Play Moddels, as well as playing for Star Fleet, the Klingons or the Romulans. Spending money on this game is optional, as it does not interferre in any way with the main story line. But when searching for the strongest items, you can choose either to earn in game Dilithium (which might take you a long while) and transfer that into ZEN, or just straight up buy ZEN coins.			"

												Here is the pro to the game:- Leonard Nimoy narrates and is the voice in the datalogThat is all.If you know nothing about Star Trek and are looking for a space RPG combat game, this still is a poor choice but not the worst.  However, for a game based on a franchise that were resolved around conflict resolution, problem solving and ingenuity, this game took out all three and decided to make a space combat game.  The characters are unimaginative and the missions consist of Space Ship combat - ground combat - Space Ship Combat, lather-rinse-repeat.  It's not about exploration, it's about being the Federation's enforcement.  Not worth it.			"

												I wouldn't have recommended this game before the ""Agents of Yesterday""  addition. I love TOS, so the chance to do 6 (and ONLY 6)  TOS missions was great. Having no desire to use a crappy tier 1 ship, I blew $10 and spent half on immediately getting a TOS Constitution. So they got their $ from me. I hope to see more TOS content, and there is some when you travel back in time...but 6 + a few more missions isn't really alot at all. Getting into the future of post TNG/DS9/Voy Trek (which the greedy Paramount are being hypocrites about; if they rebooted Trek, everything including TOS is erased,) gives decent content and stories. But not loads. What do you want? Diablo3 was a cold dog turd. It got repetitive and boring pretty quick. I'm not sick of this game yet. As far as ship to ship battle.... Play Klingon Academy if you're a Trekker. (The only reason I don't instead, is that I've already played it to death.) Play this game if you're a console gaming Trekkie. (The only reason I do is that I'm a Trekker starving for good Trek games. This will do, for now.)			"

												What I liked about STO (Star Trek Online) is impossible to say. After all, I never got that far because tech support was unable to answer a simple query concerning which domains to whitelist (other than perfectworld.com) in order to get it running on a secure system. Let's start from the beginning:.My system is specially set up so that JavaScript, etc.,  runs correctly on my system only when served from a whitelisted domain. From any other domain it gets shut down - which is how I know that STO is served, in part, from unspecified domains other than perfectworld.com and these other domains are, consequently, not whitelisted by my security. .What takes the cake is that, when I asked tech support for the domain names which needed to be whitelisted for the game to work, they responded by stating that the game works for “millions” of other people - which dodged the question by employing an argument by irrelevance; a form of sophistry known as a fallacy. I have to wonder if these guys even bothered to read the support ticket I lodged (given their total failure to comprehend the problem I raised) and why they couldn't simply address my question (as opposed to addressing some purely imaginary complaint).  .Now, when support techs start engaging in sophistry, it can mean that they are more interested in griefing the customers than doing their job. Moreover, this reflects very poorly on management, for obvious reasons; principally because it demonstrates the attitude that they can do no wrong and it is always someone-else's fault which, ultimately, gives rise to a fundamental disrespect for the customer base..The bottom line is that I recommend strongly against STO and, moreover, I will not be reviewing this game again until I see some sort of evidence that key management changes have been made which facilitate policy implementation designed to ensure that customers are not systematically marginalised for the apparent crime of asking for some technical support.

Action - Adventure - Science Fiction - Gene RoddenberryStar Trek Online is... nothing like Star Trek, now give us dat money! - Perfect World EntertainmentSadly, this game has barely anything to do with Roddenberrys Star Trek apart from some name dropping and voiceover works from the actors.It is heavily combat focused, to the point where almost every single mission will require you to shoot down hordes upon hordes of goons both in space and on the ground.The missions and tasks you perform in this game are linear. All of them. Avoiding combat, alternate solutions to the tasks at hand, using technobabble to get out of a tough situation are not here - You rarely even get fetch quests for most of the storyline as the game reduces you to ""go there, kill everything"".And to add insult to injury, the post-scarcity world of Star Trek has seemingly been taken over by the Ferengi. Not only is there a player economy based on ""energy credits"", but a multitude of currencies including ore you mine with a daily cap for refinement, premium currency Zen, Ferengi Lobi Crystals and many many more.Now all of this would be bad but okay if the game offered any kind of depth or fun gameplay, but instead it sadly can't even hold up to the lowest of Korean grinding MMO standards. Forget about playing a healer or a tank - DPS rules supreme. Ground combat is even more dumbed down.It is painful to say, but Star Trek Online which once set out to be the continuation of the original timeline of Star Trek has become little more than a skinner box of shallowness and pay to win mentality. Instead of boldly going where no one has gone before, this game chose to remain at home and stick crayons up its nose. And it asks for 20 Euros for a single starship.			"

												I have a Mac Pro (2013 model) - top of the line, but the Wine wrapper has enough issues that it doesn't do much but crash.  Lowering settings, replacing drivers, uninstalling/reinstalling - this is not a good sign for the game's future.If you're going to support a game on certain platforms, make sure it works on said platforms.Edit: I've spent the better part of two days trying to troubleshoot the issue.  This is common to have issues with Macs.  The Wine Wrapper doesn't commit a true scan on anything on your system when launching (for example, whethere I have an on-board graphics card or a behemoth, it doesn't care).  Again, for PC users - you might have a blast, especially for a free-to-play model, but I stand by what I said.			"

												As a die-hard trekkie I really wanted to like this game, but it's not for me. Some games have something so off from the get-go that make me lose all interest in them immediately. In this case it was the scale of the ships compared to the player. When you are in a starship it should not look like you are in a grand city with high vaulted ceilings and walls. To be at scale it would be like your ship was the size of a planetoid. Ugh.Did I give this game a fair shot? No.  Will I play it again to get a better idea of what it's all about? No.You, on the otherhand may love it. I have a couple of friends who really enjoy it.			"

												I've played this game for 700 hours, and have played this game to win. I've played this game to max out my level, achieve the highest score, get the most out of my characters. Before I explain why I dont like this game,I would recommend this game if you are looking to have a fun time, if you are a casual gamer and a star trek nerd, you should definately give this game a shot. You can play through the campaign and have fun with your friends easily without spending a dime. Anything beyond that, I am not so sure, unless you like grinding your organs to mush. So, if you are in it for fun, and not to win it, then absolutely go on and download this game, skip the rest of what I have to say. Now, if the above does not apply to you, I would not recommend this game if you are looking to do what I did in this game, play to win. Before I start my review of the game as a whole, which might turn into a rant, let me say one major turnoff to all non-casual gamers, and that is that this game is SUPER DUPER POOPER SCOOPER Pay 2 Win, it's really pay 2 win, and every update that the devs stick into the disgrace of a game that it is right now, make it more and more pay 2 win.Originally created in a sort of rock paper scissors manner where you needed different classes of ships and types of captains to win in pvp or pve, (which mainly become the game after the storyline, and becomes a repetitive grind anyhow), the developers are slowly getting rid of this concept. It is common knowledge among all veteran players of this game that all that matters if you really want to win, is DPS. The usefulness of players that run ships like cruisers and science ships is so miniscule compared to those of escorts (the tactical officers main ship), and high dps cruisers, a more recent addition, (disgusting imo), that at high levels, after long hours of grinding, you will find yourself obsolete as anything but an escort player or tactical officer. This problem is so large that you will find that when you enter PvP especially, that players will exploit the broken game mechanics enormously, pairing different equipments, bonuses, and abilities, (there are so damn many), in ways that they are not intended, but allowed by the developers, that they are impossible to beat. The exploitation of everything at high ranks, the balancing of statistics to get the most out of escorts and such, really retracts from the star trek atmosphere. There are so many flaws I can go on and on about in the game, and before I run out of breath talking about this one flaw, exploitation, ill just lay them all out for you:1. Players exploit the game at high levels2. The game is unbalanced for different playstyles at higher levels3. Most players are at max level so you cant do anything in pvp 4. After you finish a set of missions, you will find yourself grinding the same PvE events for countless hours for just a few pieces of borg tech for example, unless you deem yourself a wallet warrior. 5. The in-game economy is very limited and boring.6. The actual storyline is repetitive and sparse.7. Broken game mechanics brings little variety to ships (if they want to win and be useful)8. They are always adding new ways to spend money or grind your organs to mush, they add plenty of new ships, plenty of new equipment, and new missions to get equipment, they hardly work on REALLY fixing the game and polishing it's mechanics. Instead of revisiting problems, they will simply expand. For example, if cruisers are underpowered because tanking and drawing fire is useless in PvE, they simply increase the damage of cruisers) 9. Besides the main storyline, side missions or personal missions are just as boring and typical, almost 100% of them are just rinse and repeat. Go shoot some ships, shoot some people on the ground, and run around pressing F to do some scan sci-fi stuff.10. Did I mention scans and the F key? Yes, everything besides shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥up, (which is easy because your character and ship locks onto everything automatically, making every enemy encounter just repeated buttons to press over and over, even with autofire on you are simply using your simple and boring abilities over and over to kill your enemy, waiting for abilities to recharge, rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, grind GRIND GRIND!!!!Sorry, went on a bit of a tangent. Anyway back to the F key. Anything besides shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥up is basically going around, pressing the F key, whether you are healing wounded patients or scanning asteroids, you simply press the F key and wait for the bar to reach 100% and yay thats all. This isn't completely true, there are a few things in the campaign and side missions and stuff in the game that require a bit of skill, but 90% of these tasks have the same mechanics, and the way they are set up (easy as hell and boring to tears), you can probably set up a couple of macros to solve them anyway if you really cared. There are only a few instances in the newer campaigns that aren't the same damn easy puzzle, repeated over and over. The only useful mini-game is the one that you use to go dilithium mining, and that one is... Ok. :)Back on course, I think the #1 problem is the broken mechanics at higher levels:You will encounter players using dyson ships (completely STO-unique ships), firing romulan weapons (disruptors), using only beam weapons, (because multi-weapon ships are useless besides the occasional special weapon, and torpedoes are largely useless too thank you game mechanics), using borg ship modules, while using tholian engines and shields. Now this above issue isn't just an isolated thing, like you will see one in a handful of people doing this. Absolutely not, unless you are a low level player that doesn't know what he is doing, when you achieve higher ranks of Admiral, which everyone does pretty quickly, you will find that everyone is forced to do completely uncharacteristic things. You will find starfleet ships using antiproton weapons, and only antiproton cannons, or only antiproton beams, because adding a torpedo to a weapons slot would be useless, as torpedoes are quite useless without wasting plenty of skill points on them anyway and you need those skill points for beam weapons becuase torpedoes do nothing against enemy shields. (I could go farther but that would probably bore you)The worst thing that ever happened to this game was Perfect World Entertainment acquiring it from the original creators, Cryptic Studios. From the stories told by my clan mates, who have played this game from the creation, the game was a lot better, focused a lot less on giveusmoneygiveusmoneygiveusmoneygiveusmoney with PWE.I quit it a bit ago after getting fed up with all of the♥♥♥♥♥♥updates that were just excuses for PWE to make more money.

												Before I talk about STO, let me quickly give you an idea of where I stood on MMOs and Star Trek as a franchise before I started playing this game. MMOs:I have tried pretty much every free-to-play MMO under the sun, and tried a couple paid ones as well. I've tried WoW--didn't care for it. Tried every Perfect World game—none of them grabbed me. The only MMO I sunk any time into before STO was City of Heroes/Villains. I played that game off and on for years and put hundreds of hours into it, and it was a fantastic experience. Still think it's one of the best MMOs ever made, and may it now rest in peace (P.S. NCsoft can go suck a fat one for shutting it down). Star Trek:Besides catching half an episode of Next Generation on TV as a kid here and there, I had never watched Star Trek. I was mostly indifferent about the franchise as a whole, and my vague childhood memories of Next Generation painted it as somewhat boring and confusing show. How wrong I was. Around the same time I was thinking about giving STO a shot I decided to watch a specific episode of Star Trek: The Original Series on Netflix because it was listed as a prime example of a now common science fiction trope on tvtropes.org. I've fallen into a deep, dark hole. I'm almost done with the original series, I've watched the first few episodes of Next Gen, and I've bought a Star Trek history book about the first 150 years of the federation. I'm a full-on trekkie now, apparently. Star Trek Online: So, the question is, how good is the game? My opinion is that it's very, very good, but that if  you don't like the source material you might not like the game either. It is pretty standard MMO fair in a lot of ways. You click on things, you hit hotbar keys, you click on glowy interact-able objects, etc. However, it does enough to differentiate itself that it winds up being a pretty great game, though it may not be different enough if you have no love for the source material. It's not, for instance, breaking into the new action MMO as hard as, say, TERA, but it does have a third-person shooting mode where you can 'aim' at enemies that I think is rather fun, and you have a dodge-roll by default. The game is split up into two modes of combat—ground mode, and ship mode. This is something that takes a little getting used to. For a while I really disliked the ship combat and wished it was nothing but ground, but after getting used to it, and after unlocking better ships and  more ship abilities, I've come to enjoy them both equally. Just give it time. And once you're at the point where you enjoy them both hopping back and forth between the two adds a lot of variety to the gameplay compared to any other MMO I've played. It's like every hour you're switching to a different game. The progression system has a few more layers to it than most MMOs thanks to that split in the combat. When you level up you're putting points into your captain, your ship, and the four members of your 'away team' that you bring with you on ground missions, and which provide hot-bar abilites during spaceship combat. You're getting loot for yourself and all your away team members, but also for your ship. Just the basic ship that everyone gets at the start will have gear slots for: tactical console, science console, engineering console, shield, engine, two fore weapons, one aft weapon. It only gets crazier from there as you start aquiring ships that have more weapon slots and more engineering consoles, and even hangars where you can put little dog-fighting ships that will fly out of your main ship and star wrecking stuff. Now, let's talk about your away team for a second. Having a squad of A.I. with you at all times is pretty cool, and makes you feel like a captain from the show. You can train them in different skills, and they're basically how you choose what ship abilities you want. On the ground they're another phaser to help you kill stuff, and they have abilities related to their class. You outfit them with gear, just like you do for yourself, and by employing old-school JRPG trickle-down economics, getting one great new gun could mean your whole away team is in for a slight upgrade As far as classes go, there's three, and they only really determine two things—what hotbar abilities you can get, and what skills you can train crew-members in (although you can also train them by 'using up' a new crew-member, which can be bought or received as a quest reward). Any class can use any weapon. So...yeah, I like this game a lot. It has a lot of easy to understand systems that are layered on top of each other to create something with a lot of depth. I love that I have more than just my own, single character's progression to focus on. When I level up I have to consider if I've been having trouble recently in space or on the ground, and drop points accordingly. You have to keep your away team in mind. That new gun that dropped might not be as good as yours, but is it better than something one of your guys has? Some people will hate this aspect of the game and think it busywork, but I love it. The world feels big, while actually being rather small and instanced. The sector map design when you go to warp looks cool as hell. There are references and fanservice dripping from every pore of this thing. If you like Star Trek at all, and you actively want to try and get into an MMO, you HAVE to give this a try.			"

												Was very excited they made the game available for Mac. Downloaded it and it appeared to be fine. Booted it up and saw it needed 11GB of patches!!!! 11GB !!!!!!!! So I persevered through the HOURS of downloading the patches. So I figured the game would run flawlessly for 11GB of patches.Well I was dead wrong. It is aweful. Lagging and GLitching like no other. I started the game and as soon as the cut screens began, peoples bodies were missing. Audio was cutting in and out. I continued persevering and hoped that those were the only problems. Once again I was wrong. I got 2 minutes in and it just froze and crashed. I booted the game up again and it did the same thing. Time after time.After 11 GB of patches the game still runs like crap and wont even work for me. Don't waste your time. Cryptic developers really sucked this up. Bad. I'm beginning to think they are just bad developers. But seriously. Don't even waste your time.			"

												Let me start out by saying I love this game. I read the reviews and decided to pick it up on Stream, as it was free to play, and I was a big Star Trek fan. And it was great... at first. You can level really quickly, though part of that was due to the Delta Rising promotion they had going on when i joined, and the ships were great. Then I got to level 50, and was given access to the Delta Quadrant and Dyson Sphere. All the sudden, the wonderful mission's I'd been completing turned into 5-6 part grinds spanning over different areas, in different systems, in different sectors.... and I had one that I spent almost 2 hours trying to complete because even though I have the best ship in the ""free"" fleet, it does not match up to these enemies. So, unless I feel like spending money of upgraded ships and weaponry, I've gone about as far as I can in the storyline. I still plan on playing from time to time, but these missions are gonna be left undone, and my faith for future ""seasons"" highly in doubt.			"

												Big, lore-heavy (and Lore light), and goofy. It's not the subtle intergallactic diplomacy styling of the TV shows; Star Trek Online takes more after the movies with more action and more conflict.This isn't a bad thing, the space combat has become more and more satisfying over the years and the complexity of situations improve every mission.The ground combat has improved enough to be fine, but isn't the most enjoyable part of the game. This is where the crew you bring on missions are helpful; they balance a lot of the quirks out and allow for some customization. In reality, if you take ground combat partially seriously it's alright and there's no real penalty for wiping on mission so the problems are ignorable.Since the game has been around for a few years, the ships available are many and wonderful. If you wanted to fly ships from the Dominion War perfect! Want to play a period-specific Enterprise from earlier shows and movies? They have that too. Everything comes with balance considerations, but careful outfitting and a casual play style make many of them servicable or at least different.			"

												as far as Free to play games go. this is the best mmo i've played so far (not really saying much since most are terrible) the character customization makes it so that you can have your character configured in almost any way you want, both their skills and their physical appearance. same goes for the officers, best of all everything is technically obtainable with ingame currency. there are some cons however. the ground combat gets very repetitive in the missions. but if you do get bored of the super repetitive missions, there is always the foundry. and the space combat is probably the best part about the entire game.in conclusion i think you should at least try it since it's free.

												<Generic MMO Caveat>Pretty much anything late game requires in game purchases to not get thuroughly probed by Iconians.</Generic MMO Caveat>This game isn't bad, for Star Trek fans everywhere to enjoy. There's plenty of free content, and you can technically play the game free to play.Technically.But if you're looking to do so easily, you're probably going to be either grinding Dilithium/Energy credits, or breaking out your(or your mom's) credit card.<Warning>I do not recommend, nor endorse, stealing your mother's credit card to buy a Starship. You might get a more thurough probing than what the Iconians have in mind for you.</Warning>			"

												This is not a very Star Trek game.Too much pew pew. The style is repetetive and boring. Also, some of the lore doesn't hold up very well. The plots of boring and pretentious. I'm a huge Star Trek fan, but even I can't like this.It's free - I can't stop you. Just don't hold your breath for a Star Trek adventure.Also.PAY TO ♥♥♥♥ING WIN.			"

												STO is probably one of the best f2p games on steam. There is so much to do. If you want to become a sucessful starship captain you can do that, If you want to blow up borg for the sake of it, you can do it. If you want to become a millionaire you can SO much to do, and they constantly bring out new updates. Great game 10/10			"

												Let me start out by saying I love this game. I read the reviews and decided to pick it up on Stream, as it was free to play, and I was a big Star Trek fan. And it was great... at first. You can level really quickly, though part of that was due to the Delta Rising promotion they had going on when i joined, and the ships were great. Then I got to level 50, and was given access to the Delta Quadrant and Dyson Sphere. All the sudden, the wonderful mission's I'd been completing turned into 5-6 part grinds spanning over different areas, in different systems, in different sectors.... and I had one that I spent almost 2 hours trying to complete because even though I have the best ship in the ""free"" fleet, it does not match up to these enemies. So, unless I feel like spending money of upgraded ships and weaponry, I've gone about as far as I can in the storyline. I still plan on playing from time to time, but these missions are gonna be left undone, and my faith for future ""seasons"" highly in doubt.			"

												Was very excited they made the game available for Mac. Downloaded it and it appeared to be fine. Booted it up and saw it needed 11GB of patches!!!! 11GB !!!!!!!! So I persevered through the HOURS of downloading the patches. So I figured the game would run flawlessly for 11GB of patches.Well I was dead wrong. It is aweful. Lagging and GLitching like no other. I started the game and as soon as the cut screens began, peoples bodies were missing. Audio was cutting in and out. I continued persevering and hoped that those were the only problems. Once again I was wrong. I got 2 minutes in and it just froze and crashed. I booted the game up again and it did the same thing. Time after time.After 11 GB of patches the game still runs like crap and wont even work for me. Don't waste your time. Cryptic developers really sucked this up. Bad. I'm beginning to think they are just bad developers. But seriously. Don't even waste your time.			"

												One of the few MMOs with a really strong story, i really like the episodes which are rather long. Also the Agents of Yesterday expansion gives a really nice 60s flair for the new TOS faction (the assets and even the camera effects look like the old series) sadly there are only missions up to rank 10, but totally worth creating a new character!At first i had my doubts with the F2P model but compared to other games it is really fair, up to now i did not spend a single cent and all is miss is cosmetic stuff. Even the endgame ships that can be bought for money are not stronger than the ones you get without spending money, some of them just look cooler. "

												I just got a new computer so my hours played are shown as a little low. Before I played directly from the original game client that launched with the game. I've as since, downloaded the game through Steam. I've been playing STO since the very beginning, I've always been on and off(that's what she said), and I suppose having a lifetime membership has helped in that regard. After a number of updates, the ground combat, skill system, and crafting have went through a number of improvements, and I enjoy them how they are now. You can play ground combat like a shooter or traditional mmo, but feels good to mix and match now and then.Space combat is the real treat, and plays differently depending on how you equip your ship and what type of ship you use. Large scale battles can be a very nice spectacle to behold.The story of the game starts off about 30 years after the last original timeline movie(Star Trek Nemisis),  and the original timeline events spoke of in the 2009 movie, as such, Romulus has been destroyed. Each story sequence helps explore different aspects of each of the different show storylines. It's also been great to hear Star Trek Alumni reprise their roles.I'm still having fun in Star Trek Online, and will put hundreds more hours into it. You don't have to spend real money if you don't want to, but if you're spending time in the game, it might be nice to give something back every now and then. Star Trek online is a great game for fans of the franchise, unless they don't like space battles or the idea of ground combat. But keep in mind, there are also a few diplomatic missions as well and puzzle solving. That's it from me for now.-Live long and prosper.			"

												So right off the bat, I'm going to make the claim that if you're a Star Trek fan, you'll find something to love about this game.Whether it's the episodic campaign that draws heavily upon the series and films. Or the vast overworld that allows you to beam down to many of the iconic locations you've come to know and love, such as Deep Space Nine, Starfleet Academy, Earth Stardock, Risa, and, taken directly from the most beloved film of the series, Paradise City from ST V. (Kidding.) Or just being able to run around your own ship or shuttle, most of which are inspired by, or are of the same class as, the ones from the show/films, and pilot it around the galaxy. There's something in this game for everyone.Since most people here have already covered the big parts of the game, I'll point my own personal list of Pros and Cons:PROS:- Fantastic Campaign: The devs for STO are big time Trek fans, and you'll definitely discover this once you start making your way through the campaign of your choice: Starfleet, Romulan, or Klingon. Each episode is formatted like an episode of the show, most of which are heavily inspired by plotlines from the show and films. Some of the episodes even continue the stories of some ST characters. Some devolve into shoot-'em-ups, but most -- especially the recent ones -- are 100% Trek, on par with the show. There are also player-created missions available to play through by way of the Foundry, which is awesome and something I wish more MMOs would incorporate.- Frequent Updates: Cryptic update the game with major episodic content a few times a year, most of which have featured actors reprising their roles from the series, such as Michael Dorn (Worf), Tim Russ (Tuvok), and Denise Crosby (Tasha Yar). Leonard Nimoy also narrates many key parts of the game in-character as Spock. Each new episode has added new story content, dailies, and general updates -- and all of them have been free. We've had one full-fledged expansion, Legacy of Romulus, and another one on the way in October called Delta Rising.- The Star Trek Experience: A lot went into making the game feel like a genuine Trek experience. The general atmosphere, the scale of the overworld, the missions, the visuals, locations, and characters. You take command of your own ship, and you can pretty much roll up any character you can imagine: from the stock races, such as Human, Vulcan, Romulan, Klingon, Betazoid, Trill, Orion, etc., to a custom alien race that you can define. There are also a lot of RP opportunites: Dabo(!), asteroid mining, ship interiors, and seasonal events. Just a lot of great stuff.- F2P Model: If I had to make a list of the most ethical F2P MMOs on the market... it would be a short list, but STO would be near the top. All of the story, PvE, and PvP content is free, as are all the updates. Most of the things Cryptic are making money off of are cosmetic items (uniforms, ship interiors/exteriors), ships (but the free ships are just as competitive), and services like inventory space, character slots, bank space, etc. The two things that I would count against it are the lockboxes, which can be easily ignored, and the two races locked behind a paywall, though with nearly infinite races available to you, it doesn't make much of a difference in my opinion. With a model like this, I've been happy to support it since I started playing.KHANS:- Sector Space: Initially, it's no big deal, but after some time you start to realize how unintuitive Sector Space can be, sectioned off the way it is. Can you land here, orbit, or do nothing? Why are there invisible walls in space? There's an event here, but is anyone participating? What does the event even entail? Cryptic have stated in the past that they want to give Sector Space an overhaul, which would be awesome, but we still have it for now.- Instance Stagnation: There are a lot of PvE and PvP instances to queue up for. People play a select few, but most have stagnated -- not from lack of players, just lack of interest. I'd much rather them not be there if no one's going to play them, so that Cryptic would be able to put more focus on the ones people still enjoy.- Community: Do yourself a favor and find a good fleet that you can get along with, because the community in STO, at least the vocal part, might just drive you insane. This is nothing new to online games, but it seems abnormal in a Trek game. Part of the reason might be how fragmented chat is in STO, which makes moderation rather difficult. Making chat universal across individual sectors would make things better, I think, but for now reading ESD chat might just make you go blind.I think that about covers it! Like I said, if you're a Star Trek fan, you owe it to yourself to give this a try, especially now that we're on the verge of a new expansion.Live long and prosper!			"

												Oddly enough, I'm not a Trekkie by any stretch of the word (Star Wars diehard here), but this game is actually very fun. I will give a bullet list of the pros as well as the cons and hopefully it will be beneficial to those interested in playing this game:The Good-Extensive graphical settings-Space and ground combat-Robust character creator & outfits-Foundry (player-created) missions-Massive ships to customize and exploreFor a game that is five years old, it's actually holding up quite well. It doesn't compare in visuals to a more recent MMO such as Elder Scrolls Online, but it scales quite nicely and you can make it look fairly good by MMO standards. What sets this game apart from most MMOs is the dual gameplay of space and ground combat. It keeps the experience fresh and interesting as you are constantly jumping back and forth between shooting enemies with phasers to blowing ships into oblivion with your cruiser.Without a doubt, this is by far the most in-depth character creator I've ever experienced. There are a decent amount of presets for faces, but where it truly shines are the sliders. There literally is a slider for everything. You have control to make your character look the way you want and this will literally keep you busy adjusting and changing for hours. The amount of outfits is also quite extensive, although much of it is behind the gameshop currency. I was informed, however, that everything is obtaining in-game if you work for it.The tutorial for Starfleet was actually quite enjoyable, even if it was essentially a rip-off of the recently rebooted films. I didn't enjoy the Klingon tutorial nearly as much. Too stereotypical ""bad guy"" in my opinion. That aside, where the best content is actually found are the missions created by players, not the developers. I'm still not that high of a level, but by far the most fun I've had were completing foundry missions. They seem to scale to your level and they offer a decent amount of experience. Some can be rather long, so make sure to check the estimated time for completion at the beginning before starting.The Foundry creator seems to allow players to create and build virtually anything they want, so it leads to infinite amounts of quality content created by the players. Very smart and cost-effective as the best content generally is that which is made by the players, not the developers. Last but not least are the ships! Depending on your class will determine what class of ship is appropriate for you. Everything a Trekkie would expect is available in the game as well as plenty more. The ships are also massive with a fully-explorable bridge, crew deck, and various other locations. You can also change the appearance of the bridge as well as the exterior design of the ship and its colors.The Bad-Simplistic gameplay-Slow progression-Relatively steep learning curveDue to the scale of the game with the dual gameplay, the depth in both is rather lacking. While the space game is actually quite fun, it really is nothing more than a button masher so far. The ground experience is very much the same way, although it does have an RPG mode and a FPS mode to change how you shoot enemies to make it more engaging. I would have liked a better integration between ground and space similar to JTL in SWG where exploration in your ship isn't a different instance and multiple players take on various positions in one ship, instead of everybody being a captain of their own ship.After you reach level 10, the developer-made quests seem to either come to a close or trigger much less often. This will lead to you having to explore on your own doing patrols, foundry missions, PvE queues, or deepspace encounters. So far it would seem patrols might actually provide the best amount of EXP, although foundry missions are by far the most entertaining. I highly recommend leveling with a friend if you have one to join you.While the tutorial tries to do a decent job of explaining the foundation of the game, there is just too much to cover. As is the case with most older MMOs, you'll need to ask a lot of questions to players who do know or try researching on your own. I wouldn't let that veer you away from this game, however. So far, I've enjoyed it quite a bit. I had absolutely zero expectations going in and found myself pleasantly surprised by what the game offers.Final thoughts:Again, I'm not a Trekkie, so this is merely the perspective of someone who has played a lot of MMOs and found the features in this game to be quite pleasing. It is F2P, although everything seems to be obtainable through hard work (besides Borg, you need to be a lifetime member for that). The game is definitely worth visiting if you are just looking to have an interesting and diverse experience with plenty of content to keep you busy.			"

												Before I talk about STO, let me quickly give you an idea of where I stood on MMOs and Star Trek as a franchise before I started playing this game. MMOs:I have tried pretty much every free-to-play MMO under the sun, and tried a couple paid ones as well. I've tried WoW--didn't care for it. Tried every Perfect World game—none of them grabbed me. The only MMO I sunk any time into before STO was City of Heroes/Villains. I played that game off and on for years and put hundreds of hours into it, and it was a fantastic experience. Still think it's one of the best MMOs ever made, and may it now rest in peace (P.S. NCsoft can go suck a fat one for shutting it down). Star Trek:Besides catching half an episode of Next Generation on TV as a kid here and there, I had never watched Star Trek. I was mostly indifferent about the franchise as a whole, and my vague childhood memories of Next Generation painted it as somewhat boring and confusing show. How wrong I was. Around the same time I was thinking about giving STO a shot I decided to watch a specific episode of Star Trek: The Original Series on Netflix because it was listed as a prime example of a now common science fiction trope on tvtropes.org. I've fallen into a deep, dark hole. I'm almost done with the original series, I've watched the first few episodes of Next Gen, and I've bought a Star Trek history book about the first 150 years of the federation. I'm a full-on trekkie now, apparently. Star Trek Online: So, the question is, how good is the game? My opinion is that it's very, very good, but that if  you don't like the source material you might not like the game either. It is pretty standard MMO fair in a lot of ways. You click on things, you hit hotbar keys, you click on glowy interact-able objects, etc. However, it does enough to differentiate itself that it winds up being a pretty great game, though it may not be different enough if you have no love for the source material. It's not, for instance, breaking into the new action MMO as hard as, say, TERA, but it does have a third-person shooting mode where you can 'aim' at enemies that I think is rather fun, and you have a dodge-roll by default. The game is split up into two modes of combat—ground mode, and ship mode. This is something that takes a little getting used to. For a while I really disliked the ship combat and wished it was nothing but ground, but after getting used to it, and after unlocking better ships and  more ship abilities, I've come to enjoy them both equally. Just give it time. And once you're at the point where you enjoy them both hopping back and forth between the two adds a lot of variety to the gameplay compared to any other MMO I've played. It's like every hour you're switching to a different game. The progression system has a few more layers to it than most MMOs thanks to that split in the combat. When you level up you're putting points into your captain, your ship, and the four members of your 'away team' that you bring with you on ground missions, and which provide hot-bar abilites during spaceship combat. You're getting loot for yourself and all your away team members, but also for your ship. Just the basic ship that everyone gets at the start will have gear slots for: tactical console, science console, engineering console, shield, engine, two fore weapons, one aft weapon. It only gets crazier from there as you start aquiring ships that have more weapon slots and more engineering consoles, and even hangars where you can put little dog-fighting ships that will fly out of your main ship and star wrecking stuff. Now, let's talk about your away team for a second. Having a squad of A.I. with you at all times is pretty cool, and makes you feel like a captain from the show. You can train them in different skills, and they're basically how you choose what ship abilities you want. On the ground they're another phaser to help you kill stuff, and they have abilities related to their class. You outfit them with gear, just like you do for yourself, and by employing old-school JRPG trickle-down economics, getting one great new gun could mean your whole away team is in for a slight upgrade As far as classes go, there's three, and they only really determine two things—what hotbar abilities you can get, and what skills you can train crew-members in (although you can also train them by 'using up' a new crew-member, which can be bought or received as a quest reward). Any class can use any weapon. So...yeah, I like this game a lot. It has a lot of easy to understand systems that are layered on top of each other to create something with a lot of depth. I love that I have more than just my own, single character's progression to focus on. When I level up I have to consider if I've been having trouble recently in space or on the ground, and drop points accordingly. You have to keep your away team in mind. That new gun that dropped might not be as good as yours, but is it better than something one of your guys has? Some people will hate this aspect of the game and think it busywork, but I love it. The world feels big, while actually being rather small and instanced. The sector map design when you go to warp looks cool as hell. There are references and fanservice dripping from every pore of this thing. If you like Star Trek at all, and you actively want to try and get into an MMO, you HAVE to give this a try.			"

												This might be one of the most disappointing games I have ever played, comming from the standpoint of a gamer. It is one of the poorest quality games out there in terms of bugs, both minor and game breaking, it has the most basic endgame, and pvp has never been, and likely never will be balanced. The graphics are overly taxing for their quality, and lag issues plague a percentage of players constantly. The only good things that I can say about this game from the view of a gamer, is that the free to play system is tastefully done. One does not need to pay a single penny in order to play and enjoy the entire game, but it is worth it if you do wish to pay. You can acquire credits for the real money store by just playing the game, so even though some of the items offter a small advantage, they are obtainable for anyone willing to invest the time (most notably end game ships). The other thing I find great about this game is that it is always adding new content, while not super amazing it is enjoyable for a time, and features some great voice acting talent, who would be familiar to anyone who knows Trek.This game becomes better from the standpoint of a fan of Star Trek, and is very much worth it to play if you are one. Overall I recommend this game to anyone who just wants to have fun with Star Trek, or for a casual gamer who just wants to have fun in general and does not care so much about overall game quality. I do not recommend this for a pure gamer just looking for another game to try, or for a unique gaming experience, because you will not find that here.I do feel it is fair to note that the game has lately increased in quality, while it does not yet change my opinion of it, It might become better in the future.It is free to try, so, why not?

I'm sure others will find enjoyment in it though, there's no immediate things that pester you to buy anything and I was able to play a fair portion of what I did play without any nag screens of any kind.  So if you like space games, give it a try, its free after all.			"

												This game is very good, once you get used to the controls and play style. I give is around an 8.5 out of 10. Graphics could be better, yes, but this is an MMO, and for what it is, I think they've done quite well with it. I love the pre- and post-warp cutscenes and the transporter animations most, and some of the storyline talking cutscenes the least.The free to play part is a plus, too. It's a quality game, definitely, and doesn't simply lock you out of portions of the game just because you're free to play while others are premium, in fact, with enough effort, I'm sure you could accumulate enough dilithium to trade for substantial amounts of the premium in-game money (zen), which you can then use to buy the bigger, better, shinier, more premium things in the game.On a personal note, I'm happy with the game, and I'll be happy to continue playing. The best part is, once I tire of Federation quests (if I do), I can just make another character and experience Klingon or Romulan quests (you have more than enough character slots to make characters for each side). I think it's great that there isn't an entire side locked up for premium/paying users' use only, I think (though some races -- like the Joined Trill -- are locked up).Being free to play, I feel perfectly safe suggesting this game to anyone. If you don't like it, all you have to do is stop playing, because you didn't have to spend money on the game in the first place!			"

												When screenshots of the planned ""Star Trek Online"" game were first teased almost a decade ago, it looked like a simulator for living in the Star Trek universe, much like the original Star Wars online game experience before it got ruined by patches and so on. A true sandbox for Star Trek-ness. However, it was taken over by another developer, one known for making comic-like games and generally actionning and arcade-ing things up to the max. My heart sank, because my favourite Star Trek games before then were games that simulated life on board your starship of choice.Bridge Commander for PC was one of those games, I'd go back and download all the old Star Trek games now and then and play them just to see if any were good, and some were excellent. Another was the Interactive Technical Manual/Captain's Chair set of games, which made it so that you could walk through little 360-degree photograph simulations of the ships and learn all sorts of things about everyone. Also one game that gets little to no cred is the Elite Force expansion for PC also, which took the Star Trek Voyager game and made it so that you could explore the ship, mess with the systems, play on the holodecks, and so forth. It took a good 3 hours to push every switch, which isn't long, but it's a good slice of life if you want to experience a walking simulator about ST:VOY. Also the new VR game looks to have some of that spirit - maybe.Star Trek Online is the antithesis to all of that. There's no classic roaming about and taking in the scenery, no smelling the roses, and for some reason the corridors are ridiculously huge - all the bridges and so on are blown up to the size of small soccer fields, even the one for the shuttlecraft looks like a basketball court you could do laps in. It's inulting to me as a veteran gamer, since I'm stuck wondering - ""what, are they expecting so many casual players who have never tried to play an online game before, that they had to make it so they wouldn't be frustrated walking into walls all the time? is it literally made for mentally challenged people?!"" I've never seen a game put so much freaking walking space everywhere. The transporter pads which are supposed to be somewhat uncomfortable to stand on with 5-6 people are suddenly these huge affairs the size of a moderately-priced living room. O_o; smhNo, you could say that STO tries to bring back the feeling of Original Series Star Trek, with Kirk facing a new escapade each episode and generally the ships and life and so forth falling into the background. I used to despise the Original Series for being too fast and loose with ... well, logic itself, frankly. Sometimes, most of the time in fact, the things the crew encounters and their reactions to it make a lot of sense. But now and then there was just no sense to what they were doing at all, and what my mom calls ""60s values"" were everywhere - people getting angry for absolutely no reason, being ""chivalrous"" (almost mocking) towards female crew members, and so on. I've recently watched TOS in its completeness and I have a much greater appreciation for it now, I found the fun in it as it were. But even Roddenberry seemed to back off from the feeling of the original, considering the way that the early Trek movies became almost pedantic affairs about Shakespeare and philosophy and politics. I like those best I think, out of all the Trek stuff that's been created, but this game seems to mostly if not entirely abandon those principles in favor of BANG! BANG! Space cowboys to the rescue!The thing is, it works. The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager all seemed to want to be saying something more fun and action-oriented than they actually did, esepcially in the episodes involving scary new species or little special events featuring warzones. It's like there was this anxious little boy hidden away inside the hearts of the producers, and every now and then he'd come out and for several episodes we'd just have a general romp around the galaxy, with torpedoes blasting around and so on. That's where Star Trek Online shines. It takes the time period from those series and tries to make it work as a series of TV-style episodes, which are crystallized into about a dozen quest chains (yes, that's all there is in the game for my faction, but they are relatively long - several hours at minimum each, more like 12-20 hours for some). Want to see Denise Crosby finally getting some serious attention in any Trek franchise? Well, here her performance as Empress Sela is charming and impeccable.The difference between STO and the actual TV shows is that while some of the best story arcs in the entire Star Trek universe - all the 29th century nonsense, the Year of Hell characters, the DS9 take on the Mirror Universe, and so on - were mostly ignored after their individual episodes and two-parters, the creators of Star Trek Online took the most interesting and audacious ideas and expanded them into significant things which affect everyone on a daily basis almost. More fun, more action, more romping around, more crazy conspiracies and interesting intrigue than the shows were usually willing to do. If the original shows were vanilla-flavored, this is artisinal chocolate with jalapeno sauce. The difference between fan theories and the actual material, especially when it comes to Star Trek fans, is that the fans come up with intellectual extensions that make it cool for nerds but are impossible to justify when you're marketing to a general audience who are just expecting to turn on their television sets and get a decent story. This does the fun nerdy ""footnotes section at the Memory Alpha wiki"" stuff that hopefully you've wanted to see (if you're a Trekkie).I tend to love and play (and review!) games which are kinda poopy when taken as a chance to fulfill one's hopes and dreams about what a person can do in a virtual world, but are immensely enjoyable when played on their own terms. This is a game which is best played on its own terms. It tries to take the pre-reboot storyline and tie it together with almost everything that's ever been created in Star Trek.. happening all at once, in a coherent storyline. For the most part, the writers (who are these gods?) manage to tie a whole bunch of ridiculously contrived continuities from the creators into something much more coherent than it originally was. It might slip past you if you don't care about the plot or aren't paying enough attention, but seriously, this game turns BAD (with a capital B!) episodes from the TV shows into something that makes sense and can actually form a long story that ties in with others. Play it for the episodes and very little else, and you'll find a fanfiction-style work that ties things together with amazing detail.My only real complaint is that literally nobody plays the PVP anymore, as far as I can tell. Want to use that amazing new ship you bought for more than your own personal masturbation in the latest quest line to be released? Well, tough. Apparently enough people ruined it early in the lifecycle of the game that you just can't find anyone to play with anymore. The PVE Queues the game has, where everyone defends against the Borg or whatnot, are full 24/7, and an excellent way to level (you can get 90% to the level cap within 12 hours if you just keep running them!). However, the PVP queues are at zero, zero, zero, zero, zero for every match type, all day and all night, with little to no flukes where there are suddenly more people in them. There's just nothing. I really wanted to try PVP even if it sucked, but I guess it's back to living through some pretty interesting Star Trek episodes for me. :) Which is both a blessing and a curse, as is most of this game.Accept STO as the flawed piece of semi-trash that it is, and you'll find plenty of treasures within, it just might be best to wait for enjoying them until you're in the mood to appreciate something that might not be perfect.

												• Gameplay is somewhat repetitive and clunky.• The parts of the game that require you to interact with the UI are so confusing that after 20 hours of play and reading the beginners' guide on the official wiki, I'm still confused to the point of anger.• The universe Gene Roddenberry created was post-scarcity, where money no longer existed to divide people.  The irony of Star Trek being a ""free-to-play"" game is you're constantly reminded of your financial limitations in real life and confronted by players who can drop $350 to buy the DLC, and the vast array of upgrades available to buy in-game.

												as far as Free to play games go. this is the best mmo i've played so far (not really saying much since most are terrible) the character customization makes it so that you can have your character configured in almost any way you want, both their skills and their physical appearance. same goes for the officers, best of all everything is technically obtainable with ingame currency. there are some cons however. the ground combat gets very repetitive in the missions. but if you do get bored of the super repetitive missions, there is always the foundry. and the space combat is probably the best part about the entire game.in conclusion i think you should at least try it since it's free.

												Big, lore-heavy (and Lore light), and goofy. It's not the subtle intergallactic diplomacy styling of the TV shows; Star Trek Online takes more after the movies with more action and more conflict.This isn't a bad thing, the space combat has become more and more satisfying over the years and the complexity of situations improve every mission.The ground combat has improved enough to be fine, but isn't the most enjoyable part of the game. This is where the crew you bring on missions are helpful; they balance a lot of the quirks out and allow for some customization. In reality, if you take ground combat partially seriously it's alright and there's no real penalty for wiping on mission so the problems are ignorable.Since the game has been around for a few years, the ships available are many and wonderful. If you wanted to fly ships from the Dominion War perfect! Want to play a period-specific Enterprise from earlier shows and movies? They have that too. Everything comes with balance considerations, but careful outfitting and a casual play style make many of them servicable or at least different.			"

Captaining a ship and customizing it with weapons and all that jazz and then getting to beam down to a planet and put a beat down on baddies is satisfying. Getting to upgrade to a new ship always feels exciting also. With that said, that is what you are going to be doing. Killing enemy ships over and over again while upgrading your own and then occasionally killing a few bad guys on a planet while your second in command tells you things that you dont really need to know because you are just going to skip the conversation anyway so that you can shoot at people. Good game. Provides entertainment. Best played with another person.			"

												A must play for MMO/Star Trek fans.  It is one of the better MMO's, and it will keep you entertained with various quests all over the uinverse =D  My favorite part is the combination of questing in your starship, and on land.  Also, really cool dynamic team questing when you're in a group of 2 or more.			"

												This is a very good game, not overly greedy for as far as F2P games are concerned. It has excellent storyline depth and the ship to ship combat is fantastic. The ground combat is fun and has depth, but nothing overly special. I personally do not enjoy the PvP in this game. "

												I have been playing this game since 2010 yes it gets boring and the grinding makes you wanna bash your head through your moniter but it has so many redeaming quality. Player customazation, player driven economy (AKA Ferangi Driven Economy),  tons of PVE content and story but the best feature is this anything that you can get in the Zen store you can grind for or get on the exchange minus the lifetime sub/sub stuff.

												as a star trek game, there is none better (sad reality is that it's true). space combat is done very well, ground, not so much.several endgame events to keep people busy, especially if you focus on the space ones.the only real downside i find to this game is Perfect World Entertainment. their business model for a F2P game, makes it more of a Freemium game. all the new stuff that is added to the game is added to the ZEN store (premium currency).they do update the game with new episodes and story arcs but the ships worth having are only obtainable by buying them with Zen.before cryptic was bought out the game had alot of potential as a subscription based MMO but as with most MMO's these days it went F2P and microtransactions everywhere.i am recommending it solely for the work Cryptic has done.

												Though Somewhat likeable, I got stuck on a mission, with a MASSIVE difficulty Spike. So I roamed around the Galaxy, without anything to do, as I could not find a single THING TO DO! I grew bored of the game, since I could not find any quests... ANYWHERE. This is a Good MMO, against most other MMO's, going for a sort of TPS Mass effect, AND some Ship Combat. I like it, but there isn't enough interaction, and things to actually do, in this game. I shall give it a 6/10. It is your basic Shooter, with Quests, and Rouge like Elements added to the mix. A... Ok attempt, at trying to do so, but fall SHORT.			"

												I had a lot of fun with this game, and I never paid anything but my time. If you are a Star Trek fan, you have nothing to lose, and you'll probably enjoy what they've done with the franchise and your personal story. I was tempted to buy cosmetic upgrades because I am a nerd (""Ooh they have Kirk's jacket from Wrath of Khan! I want it!""), but I never felt like I had to pay in order to win. You definitely CAN - you can pay real money to buy upgraded ships with special technology - but I never felt pressured to do so.I really like the crew management element of the game - essentially, the special abilities of your ship are determined by your bridge officers. Bridge officers can be requisitioned from Starfleet or acquired on missions, which I thought was a nice touch. You can customize your bridge officers appearances in a very satisfying way, from their appearance and uniform to their stance. I got a boring Trill medical officer and made him much more interesting by making him twitchy and neurotic. Once you've customized a uniform for yourself or an officer, it's easy to save the outfit and apply it to whoever you want.The rest of your crew - rank and file - are mostly just pegs you can shuffle around to complete timed tasks and projects, with a variety of little rewards. I enjoyed this 'Starfleet Spreadsheet Simulator' in kind of a perverse way, sending my little dudes to formulate warp bubble theories and whatnot, but it's mostly a time-waster.The main problem with the gameplay is this: the ship-to-ship combat is much more polished than the away missions, but away missions are where you will spend most of your time. The on-foot sections of the game have very awkward and inconsistent level design. If I could delegate those bits to my redshirts, I would mostly do it, and enjoy the game more.I put it down when I didn't feel like playing it anymore, and I haven't picked it up again since, but I enjoyed the time I spent playing it. It didn't feel addictive or manipulative.tl;dr : Try it if you like Star Trek. It's actually free and not fee-to-pay.			"

												If you want an honest detailed review on a game that has been around forever. Then here it is. Star Trek Online is a game that requires an Enigma!. It is begging for a STO2 reboot. Simple put it is a  game is set in the 25th century, 30 years after the events of Star Trek: Nemesis.[4] Star Trek Online is the first massively multiplayer online role-playing game within the Star Trek franchise that has some wonderful pros for free players and a lot of cons for players as well.A good mmo.PROSA: Space Oombat even today is wonderfully done and fun to watch. Fast paced and great effects for its time.B: Alot of small games meshed together, tactical, strategy, like Duty rosters with its own game, research with its own game and crafting. A lot to do, with so little time.C: Visually a gorgeous game for Star Trek fans, capturing the ""Next Generation"" colors, panels and sounds. D: Plenty of story mode straight through missions. You like choices you have them. Even a foundry to create your own misisons. However it is down for upgrading I am toldE: Solid game control, graphics and easily adaptable even by the older systems around.F; Custom character building with 3 playable factions and 100s of character designs, play as a ferengi, romulan or even a orion. Plenty of character choices to please even the loyal ST fan or novice player.G: Exploration, fun planets to discover, and wonderful bases and visuals. Fleet system to build on your own or join massive established guilds.CONS and there are plentyA: Game has alot of fragmented games and unfinished ideasB: grinding can be too annoying for you to stay withC: Bad decision initially to have your main character a mute, unlike lets say KOTOR which your character speaks and is central to the choices and actions of the storylines your involved in.D: Poor voice quality, however some classic voice acting, great to hear a Leonard Nimoy or the classic Mrs. Roddenberry's computer voice, Stars from the shows narating missions. So some good and bad there.E: Ways around all issues. Huge learning curve with the total gameplay, but easy to pick up after a weekF: Lousy promotion system in that it is way too quick to move up. Your an admiral in a day. You will learn that T6 ships rule and you will be screaming for a free one, Guess what join a fleet ask how to get big credits fast and you should have one in a week. That simple.G: PVP is terrible for a ST game amd you may get tired of the grinding. It is all Dill, dill is gold, so wasting it is an ugly option. However there are tricks to getting rich and getting dil, like all games if you ask.OVERALL: In my opnion, this is a game for Star Trek lovers, mmos have their pros and cons and if your already heavy in one another maybe too much. If you don't like Star Trek, then this one is not for you. I commend the years of effort to make this game. They deserve credit for such an accomplishment. However, the engine they chose to build on, just too many mistakes to overcome. Star Trek Online is dieing for a reboot like Guild Ways, but for FREE, not a bad game to try. See the workshop for gameplay videos to look before trying. The newer your system the easier it is to play, but even the old Vistas and older models handled the game just fine. Star Trek Online is a good game, with plenty to like and plenty not to like. Good enough for a thumbs up and free is never a bad thing.MY SCORE 2.5 out of 5			"

The flying of the ship was really hard, for me. I felt lost in all the talking to this one then another I had to do to get anywhere. For a multiplayer game, it took way too long to even get to a point I felt I could join up with anyone.			"

												This might be one of the most disappointing games I have ever played, comming from the standpoint of a gamer. It is one of the poorest quality games out there in terms of bugs, both minor and game breaking, it has the most basic endgame, and pvp has never been, and likely never will be balanced. The graphics are overly taxing for their quality, and lag issues plague a percentage of players constantly. The only good things that I can say about this game from the view of a gamer, is that the free to play system is tastefully done. One does not need to pay a single penny in order to play and enjoy the entire game, but it is worth it if you do wish to pay. You can acquire credits for the real money store by just playing the game, so even though some of the items offter a small advantage, they are obtainable for anyone willing to invest the time (most notably end game ships). The other thing I find great about this game is that it is always adding new content, while not super amazing it is enjoyable for a time, and features some great voice acting talent, who would be familiar to anyone who knows Trek.This game becomes better from the standpoint of a fan of Star Trek, and is very much worth it to play if you are one. Overall I recommend this game to anyone who just wants to have fun with Star Trek, or for a casual gamer who just wants to have fun in general and does not care so much about overall game quality. I do not recommend this for a pure gamer just looking for another game to try, or for a unique gaming experience, because you will not find that here.I do feel it is fair to note that the game has lately increased in quality, while it does not yet change my opinion of it, It might become better in the future.It is free to try, so, why not?

If you can get passed the loading screen and you REALLY like Star Trek then I would recommend it.  It is NOT for fans of MMOs as it is HEAVILY Star Trek based and is not really a very good MMO.  It is an ok game, but a lousy MMO.  The missions are repetitive.  The AI is pathetic.  The story is laughable.  Still it is typical of a Star Trek game.  In other words, it is really only for the few remaining fans of Star Trek who haven't been scared off by the reboot movies.			"

												I have played this game since beta and have a Lifetime Membership, I just don't use steam to play I launch using the Star Trek Online Client.  So I probably have a couple weeks worth of actual game play time.I used to like this game and I will always be a Star Trek fan but as much as I wanted this game to suceed it has always fell short.  One it's left many promises unfulfilled even after years and the fans asking again and again doesn't matter.  What made the game good was it's stories which made me feel like I was in a interactive Star Trek episode but they have now all but stopped the featured episodes in favor of these large exploration zones, that would be alright if a player felt like they were accomplishing something but for example the Dyson Sphere your given a general objective clear out the enemies you do that and the enemies just keep respawning beind you in the same place making it feel like you're accomplishing nothing, no sense of progression.  There is no real attachment to your crew or ship, this is one of the unfullfilled promises from the developers, other than the bridge variants the rest the ship is exacty the same no matter what class or size ship you are in, there is nothing really interactive or things to do inside the ship and doors and hallways are disproportationaly large making it feel off.  One of the worst things they implemented was the Doff system which makes the make feel like Facebook's Farmville where the player has to constantly log in every few hours to re-que missions to earn better equimplent and skills.  These Doff missions also require resources which require grinding of a few missions hundreds of times to det top tier, this gets boring real fast.  The game has severly suffered from lack of PVP, it's in there just there is no real point to it and it's not really fun with no real rewards to playing it.  One of the worst is Cryptic won't let you post any negative feedback on their forums about game improvement or critiques doing so will get the person a warning or banned.  There's a lot more but like I said I really wanted the game to succeed but it's just not going to happen.			"

												I am very disapointed that this game is no longer available for Mac. It was fun, I enjoyed it, but in the new edition I can't play anymore because removed Mac as a supported platform. One day I ran the updates, automatically, and the game just wouldn't load anymore. I checked the new specs and they've dropped support for my platform. Thanks guys.			"

												Yeah, it gets grindy at times. Nonetheless it's a fun game overall. Flying your starship, commanding your away teams, failing Duty Officer tasks, it's all part of a great experience if you like Star Trek or spess games as a whole. TL;DR- The Tholians did it.			"

												Now there are a multitude of problems that rear its head with Star Trek Online: Glitches Galore, Not much in game benefits for being part of a fleet, Starfleet feels really obsolete when you unlock the ability to become part of the KDF and Romulan Empire and the pretty much very similar story missions even if you are part of a different faction. This game screams ""Generic MMO"" and has done for its 5 year life cycle. There is one thing though that no other Star Trek licensed or really any Licensed Sci-Fi games have ever done, Made you feel like the Captain of your very own ship and your very own crew that you build yourself through hours of work. For so long i have craved a game that could make me feel like i was part of such a universe like Star Trek's and that i could create my own story and be that Starfleet/KDF/Romulan Captain. If i am quite honest if you are someone looking for an MMO and do not have the faintest idea of Star Trek's lore or have no interest in Sci-Fi then turn away as this will be frustrating and excruciating to the core. But for those who want ""To boldly go where no man has gone before"" and are self declared members of Starfleet then this game will provide hours upon hours of entertainment, even with the games numerous issues. I should know, I have played the blasted game for almost 195 Hours...			"

												I have a Mac Pro (2013 model) - top of the line, but the Wine wrapper has enough issues that it doesn't do much but crash.  Lowering settings, replacing drivers, uninstalling/reinstalling - this is not a good sign for the game's future.If you're going to support a game on certain platforms, make sure it works on said platforms.Edit: I've spent the better part of two days trying to troubleshoot the issue.  This is common to have issues with Macs.  The Wine Wrapper doesn't commit a true scan on anything on your system when launching (for example, whethere I have an on-board graphics card or a behemoth, it doesn't care).  Again, for PC users - you might have a blast, especially for a free-to-play model, but I stand by what I said.			"

												I've played this game about 12 hours, but only completing 2 missions, I was trying to look at stuff and discover things in the game, and I've just played 12 hours in just 2 days of download, In writing this, I've played 32 hours, but that's because I left this computer on overnight to just patch stuff because patching is incredibly slow. This game just has so many things for you to discover, and a lot of things that the tutorial doesn't teach you, but pretty easy to figure out.Pros: Extremely Extremely funGraphics are quite decentDoesn't require much performanceNice storyline, makes it interestingCons:Multiplayer for starter players are difficult, because everyone is high level now and not many people will be playing with you, but single player is also alot of fun. If you read my spiral knights review, I said that no one will play with you if your a starter and it makes it extremely boring, but if you play this game in single player, it's also very fun.Read my reviews, all of my reviewed games don't require much performance as my laptop can't afford high performance games, I have currently 8 reviews (Including this one) if you ever have trouble finding games that is actually worth it and fun, just go to my profile, and see what games I recommend, and what games I have a negative thought on it.

												As a die-hard trekkie I really wanted to like this game, but it's not for me. Some games have something so off from the get-go that make me lose all interest in them immediately. In this case it was the scale of the ships compared to the player. When you are in a starship it should not look like you are in a grand city with high vaulted ceilings and walls. To be at scale it would be like your ship was the size of a planetoid. Ugh.Did I give this game a fair shot? No.  Will I play it again to get a better idea of what it's all about? No.You, on the otherhand may love it. I have a couple of friends who really enjoy it.			"

												I've played this game for 700 hours, and have played this game to win. I've played this game to max out my level, achieve the highest score, get the most out of my characters. Before I explain why I dont like this game,I would recommend this game if you are looking to have a fun time, if you are a casual gamer and a star trek nerd, you should definately give this game a shot. You can play through the campaign and have fun with your friends easily without spending a dime. Anything beyond that, I am not so sure, unless you like grinding your organs to mush. So, if you are in it for fun, and not to win it, then absolutely go on and download this game, skip the rest of what I have to say. Now, if the above does not apply to you, I would not recommend this game if you are looking to do what I did in this game, play to win. Before I start my review of the game as a whole, which might turn into a rant, let me say one major turnoff to all non-casual gamers, and that is that this game is SUPER DUPER POOPER SCOOPER Pay 2 Win, it's really pay 2 win, and every update that the devs stick into the disgrace of a game that it is right now, make it more and more pay 2 win.Originally created in a sort of rock paper scissors manner where you needed different classes of ships and types of captains to win in pvp or pve, (which mainly become the game after the storyline, and becomes a repetitive grind anyhow), the developers are slowly getting rid of this concept. It is common knowledge among all veteran players of this game that all that matters if you really want to win, is DPS. The usefulness of players that run ships like cruisers and science ships is so miniscule compared to those of escorts (the tactical officers main ship), and high dps cruisers, a more recent addition, (disgusting imo), that at high levels, after long hours of grinding, you will find yourself obsolete as anything but an escort player or tactical officer. This problem is so large that you will find that when you enter PvP especially, that players will exploit the broken game mechanics enormously, pairing different equipments, bonuses, and abilities, (there are so damn many), in ways that they are not intended, but allowed by the developers, that they are impossible to beat. The exploitation of everything at high ranks, the balancing of statistics to get the most out of escorts and such, really retracts from the star trek atmosphere. There are so many flaws I can go on and on about in the game, and before I run out of breath talking about this one flaw, exploitation, ill just lay them all out for you:1. Players exploit the game at high levels2. The game is unbalanced for different playstyles at higher levels3. Most players are at max level so you cant do anything in pvp 4. After you finish a set of missions, you will find yourself grinding the same PvE events for countless hours for just a few pieces of borg tech for example, unless you deem yourself a wallet warrior. 5. The in-game economy is very limited and boring.6. The actual storyline is repetitive and sparse.7. Broken game mechanics brings little variety to ships (if they want to win and be useful)8. They are always adding new ways to spend money or grind your organs to mush, they add plenty of new ships, plenty of new equipment, and new missions to get equipment, they hardly work on REALLY fixing the game and polishing it's mechanics. Instead of revisiting problems, they will simply expand. For example, if cruisers are underpowered because tanking and drawing fire is useless in PvE, they simply increase the damage of cruisers) 9. Besides the main storyline, side missions or personal missions are just as boring and typical, almost 100% of them are just rinse and repeat. Go shoot some ships, shoot some people on the ground, and run around pressing F to do some scan sci-fi stuff.10. Did I mention scans and the F key? Yes, everything besides shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥up, (which is easy because your character and ship locks onto everything automatically, making every enemy encounter just repeated buttons to press over and over, even with autofire on you are simply using your simple and boring abilities over and over to kill your enemy, waiting for abilities to recharge, rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, grind GRIND GRIND!!!!Sorry, went on a bit of a tangent. Anyway back to the F key. Anything besides shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥up is basically going around, pressing the F key, whether you are healing wounded patients or scanning asteroids, you simply press the F key and wait for the bar to reach 100% and yay thats all. This isn't completely true, there are a few things in the campaign and side missions and stuff in the game that require a bit of skill, but 90% of these tasks have the same mechanics, and the way they are set up (easy as hell and boring to tears), you can probably set up a couple of macros to solve them anyway if you really cared. There are only a few instances in the newer campaigns that aren't the same damn easy puzzle, repeated over and over. The only useful mini-game is the one that you use to go dilithium mining, and that one is... Ok. :)Back on course, I think the #1 problem is the broken mechanics at higher levels:You will encounter players using dyson ships (completely STO-unique ships), firing romulan weapons (disruptors), using only beam weapons, (because multi-weapon ships are useless besides the occasional special weapon, and torpedoes are largely useless too thank you game mechanics), using borg ship modules, while using tholian engines and shields. Now this above issue isn't just an isolated thing, like you will see one in a handful of people doing this. Absolutely not, unless you are a low level player that doesn't know what he is doing, when you achieve higher ranks of Admiral, which everyone does pretty quickly, you will find that everyone is forced to do completely uncharacteristic things. You will find starfleet ships using antiproton weapons, and only antiproton cannons, or only antiproton beams, because adding a torpedo to a weapons slot would be useless, as torpedoes are quite useless without wasting plenty of skill points on them anyway and you need those skill points for beam weapons becuase torpedoes do nothing against enemy shields. (I could go farther but that would probably bore you)The worst thing that ever happened to this game was Perfect World Entertainment acquiring it from the original creators, Cryptic Studios. From the stories told by my clan mates, who have played this game from the creation, the game was a lot better, focused a lot less on giveusmoneygiveusmoneygiveusmoneygiveusmoney with PWE.I quit it a bit ago after getting fed up with all of the♥♥♥♥♥♥updates that were just excuses for PWE to make more money.

												I've played over 200 hours of this game. There is SO MUCH to it. From the moment you create your captain you're at the centrre of a canon storyline, and the game doesn't fail to deliver. EVERY star trek fan should want to sit in a captain's chair though, and doesn't need me to convince them. There is a little something for everyone though. It may sound like a silly aspect to judge, but the single player value to this MMO is insane, which is rare. Weather you party up, pvp, pve, RP, farm, grind or seriously roam around to take the sights it's easy to find something to do. Not just for star trek fans, but as a trekkie obviously worth checking out. Pay to play aspects coupled with ruthless marketing take away from the enjoyment, though everthing purchasable with money is possible to farm or grind for - albeit very tediously. My advice, spend your time having fun with the game until you unlock the end game ships, save up enough game currency to buy keys for lockboxes in auctions and try your luck for high tier ships that way. I ended up purchasing a t6 ship as a reward for hitting the level cap with no regrets. Best:High level of customization and choice 3rd person gameplay while on planet is good, if a little generic. But space battle mechanics are AWESOME. Best space battles in an online game by far imo. Story and lore written in star trek canon, lots of interesting locations, characters and situations trekkies will recognise, but it's not necessary to be familliar with literally any of it in order to enjoyMostly friendly communityGreat graphics, music, voice work, UI, controls, tutorials and a very large, interesting world to exploreDifficult gameplay - not just a matter of spamming a rotation of class abilities-there are tactics involved.Worst:Dev support has left much to be desired, although just for things like gameplay bugs. Community support and store support are dependable. Frequent updates and patching - means more down time, more bugs. Unfortunately most of the updates are made to the store and are designed to make players want to spend money. This would not bother me if previous updates were more stable before attention was made to updating again. A bit buggy. Shouldn't have to explain this. Nothing that breaks the game, but I've had to restart missions enough times that I should probably mention it. Freemium. Hate this. I know it's the future but it takes away from the enjoyment for everyone except the people it exploits. If you don't let this get to you, and indeed it is not SO bad compared to other freemium games, the purchasable items are excellent and there is a large attention to detail and value. Before you purchase anything I reccommend unlocking the lvl 60 ships or higher first. Overall the game is not perfect, may have been better as a subscription game, kinda lost its soul a little bit because of in game purchasing - but the developers and community have managed to keep the game very fun despite the small hangups. The engine and mechanics in this game alone are worth checking out. For the record, this is the only MMO that I've held even remote interest in for more than 6 months. Long story short: It's free, fun as hell, and the main problem is that without spending insane amounts of time mining or spending real money you really can't compare to the players that do. If anyone who plays it and doesn't enjoy it wants their $0.00 back I'll happily refund.			"

												Such a great game, any trekkie fan will foam at the mouth when playing, the storylines are well written and the PVP/PVE is top notch, also the Lore of the game is well adapted from the the numerous tv series' a top top game for any star trek fans.For those just looking for space shooter that isnt EvE online, you've finally found what you're looking for, STO is much more immersive and action packed, (no spending 9 hours mining for minimal gain) the quests and storylines are better written and correlate with each other and tie in nicely with PVE raids and PVP battles.There is also a huge amount of customisability in this game, from a number of different starships, a number of different factions, Guilds, character appearance, character class, crew appearance etc etc (the list goes on and on)Truly a top gam, go and buy it right now!

												I would recommend this game to those who enjoy space battle games, MMOs, or specifically Star Trek! The game contains a lot of elements I enjoy, lacks in a few areas, but mostly is a great game! I tend to take my time, with my own method of how I play the game, making logs for every mission I do. Like an actual Starfleet Officer would do, as far as I know. The whole Star Trek franchise is my 3rd favorite (set of) show(s). The games story throws me off, the Federation allied or has a peace treaty with both the Klingons and the Romulans, I don't know why they are considered enemies. Especially when the 3 sides that you can be on, don't really fight one another. I haven't gotten much into the campaign yet to really know and understand the story, but as far as I can tell, I just enjoy being able to be a Starfleet Officer and having my own ship, and of course making my own logs.Issues I have with this game:1. You can't customize your ship fully. You can, somewhat, but I wish there was a more detailed way to modify your ship.2. You can't change your first officers information. This kind of bugged me, I wish I could change my first officers details just as I can change my first officers appearance, but the game doesn't allow it.3. You can't train your officers in like a holodeck program, which I wish you could build your own training programs and have access to a holodeck program. That way you can train your officers and even earn experience for yourself, maybe?4. You have to buy a lot of things with no free way really to earn a few Zen coins every now and then.Other than the issues I have with the game, the game is really fun and enjoyable! Even for a MMO. Although having it a single player game would have been cooler, that way they probably would of payed attention to how you build your ship, or design your character, and all of that rather than focusing on how the PVP system will work. Like with most MMO's, you can't really summarize the story without going through most of the game. So I can't summarize the story for this game.			"

When you restart your computer, it fails to load. So you have to re-download the launcher from the website and ""repair the files"" before you can play again. ITS NOT THAT HARD TO PROGRAM IN UNIX!

												An all around good game in many ways. First off you have three factions, all with at least a few races in each. Both ground and space combat are solid however space combat is easily the better of the two. There is of course the Federation, the Klingons, and the newest faction which are the Romulans.The Romulans have a story of liberation and resistance against a nearly rogue sect of the now shattered Romulan Star Empire. You fly warbirds which at each new rank grant you a new ability only usable on warbirds. All of them can cloak and a later version can even split into two.The downfall of the Romulans in my eye is that they have no great massive ship of their own. I find the Ha'apax Advanced Warbird a bit lacking in that department. And even though you are in fact forced to join either the Federation or Klingons you cannot actually gain access to their T4 and higher ships. So I must recommend a mightier faction, one of glory and honor. The Klingon Empire.The Klingon story is far more diverse and even includes a small portion of the Romulan story, even including the Romulan end mission around lv32. The story ranges from house rivalries and betrayals to the return of Klingon enemies from ancient lore among other interesting developments. The Klingons are a faction with many mighty ships designed for head-on combat that have hull strength only rivaled by ships you'd have to spend $150 opening gambling boxes to get your hands on. And this does not even diminish their offensive capabilities as their greatest ship is a carrier armed just as well as any warship.The Fedration offers little that can compare to the might of the Klingon Empire. Their ships seem to be designed around a doctrine of agility as many of their ships are far smaller but probably just as effective in combat if used properly.There is also a system for crew missions, where you deploy your crew to go do things like sacking a colony, bribery, espionage, fighting in tournaments, trade agreements, asteroid mining for arguably the most valuable currency dilithium, among other tasks. These all net rewards which vary by the rarity of the mission, its difficulty, who's on it, and of course what the mission is in the first place determines the base set of rewards. You can even send one of your crew to be executed for incompetence as a Klingon, which even though its useless is just great to have sitting there as an option.The visuals are good, the game hasn't crashed once for me, the UI is customizable.All in all, a great MMO.

Product received for free
												Very fun game, i love all of the customization options such as customizing your ship's look and color, to changing how your player and officers look. It has a great star trek feel to the story missions also, almost like you are in the show instead of just watching it. Also the gameplay is really fun, from flying your ship, or going on away missions. Another thing i really liked was all of the references to the shows ( TNG, Voyager, DS9, TOS, Enterprise and the movies) not to mention all of the actors who have voiced their characters in the game. (Michael Dorn, Robert Picardo, Tim Russ, Aron Eisenburg, Jeri Ryan, Walter Koenig, Leonard Nimoy, and others as well. Overall, i highly recommend this game for anyone who likes Star Trek or just a good space game. Although knowing the star trek universe really adds a whole new layer to the game.			"

												The game's sound and visiuals are very solid, actually, and the space combat was reminiscent of the enjoyable Starfleet Command games (no longer in circulation, as far as I know). The problems come from:1) Redundancy. A lot of missions are go to a place and seek out multiple groups of enemies; return when you've killed x number of them2) Ground combat. It's tedious. Additionally, the character movements are very jumpy on ground missionsAnyway, it was fun for a while, but didn't have anything to hold interest. Just more and more of the same grind, essentially.

												I played Cryptic's Star Trek Online from launch and witnessed all the changes including the newest Expansion Delta Rising. It has drastically changed over time, for the most part not positive.First of all, in my opinion, this game has little in common with the spirit of the original Star Trek series and films.It is a standard MMORPG on a generic engine that happens to be in a cartoonish colored version of the Star Trek Universe. You mainly run/fly around click on static dialogs and kill millions of enemies. SpaceAs the game reaches its 5th anniversary, Cryptic's Star Trek Online universe grew to an acceptable size. Unfortunately it is not an unlimited and contigous space. Instead this overall 2D universe is devided into 3D ""Sector Blocks"" (maps) with unpassable hard borders, so that you are hopping from one block to another beiing shown a loading screen as you are travaling through it.In addition, every map gets instanced, if a certain player limit (i tthink 20-40 players) is reached, so that you never will experience the massiveness of MMORPG.GroundI'll skip the ground part. I think, it does not differ much from every other game of this kind except that heavy ""instancing"" and ""zoning"".Revenue ModelIn theory, the Free to Play acccess grants access to the whole content, but you'll be disapointed rapidly. In fact the free access is restricted to storyline, all areas and basic equipment and few basic ships. Everything else has to be either bought or exchanged/upgraded in exchange for diverse in-game currencies. It is possible to earn them, but it is an endless, monotonous, boring and repetitive ""grinding"" and Cryptic did set a limit for a daily income of the main currency called refined dillithium, You are forced to came back and login every day to earn it and even then you will be always short of it. Or simply buy them for real money.Then you have the c-store where you can buy expansion packs, items, most ships and ""services"" which expand your account with real money or exchanges refined dillithium.Furthermore Cryptic invented a lottery/ casino system for special items and ships packed in boxes with unpublished win chances, but they are told to be very, very small. You can participate with using real money among others and can't be sure to ever win.With the latest Expansion ""Delta Rising"" the costs for high-rank equipment increased drastically. And you badly need it to successfully participate in the end-game elite content, where practically the only important ability is, to deal the most damage per second (dps) to the enemy.ConclusionSo if you don't want to stuck at easy difficulty in pre-endgame state, the game ends up being either a second job/chore to earn all currencies/materials/marks/... or a serious cash investment for virtual stuff and Cryptic's casino with equivalent nofun-factor.

												Personally I found this game quite enjoyable. I am a big fan of Star Trek, both then new movies and the tv series. But here are my pros and cons for this game.Pros: 1: Large expansive map with loads of planets and systems to explore.        2: Many ships, weapons, costumes and species to play and experiment with.        3: The ship-to-ship combat is enjoyable and fitting for any play style.Cons: 1: Ground combat is far from perfect. It has its moments but those a few and far apart.          2: Since the game is free-to-play, it will insist on flashing ads in your face at almost every loading screen.          3: The servers can be a bit jumpy and unresponsive at times but after a few seconds they manage to fix themselves.Finally my final verdict: This game is good. Not great but not bad. Its really has its moments if you are a fan the the series. To any Star Trek fans who are considering this game I can heartily recommend it and to any others, why not give it a shot. Its pretty good for a free game.			"

I tried my best to put my rose colored glasses on, and look the other way, but they finally broke. Pros:1: Excelent story line. Even though it is a bit hard to believe in the beginning. 2: Graphics are great. 3: pew pew sounds are great.4: Voice acting is top notch.5: You can walk around inside of your ship. 6: QCons:1: Story can leave a bad taste in your mouth, if you are a Trekkie.2: pvp is lost3: lockboxes.....4: End game grind your ___ off, for days, weeks, months..for one thing5: Dev's are toxic6: S_itty ground battles. (They could have done so much better)I loved it when it was still subbed. But, even then things were off. Now, some of those things are STILL in the game, years later.

												I'll recommend the game as a mildly amusing way to burn an afternoon, seeing as how it was free.  Mildly amusing, that is, if you play Klingon.  You get the option to run about smacking Vulcans and Bolians with a bat'telh and then blow away some much heavier Federation ships in need of an attitude adjustment.  Even on Klingon side, after I smoked a Chimera dreadnaught (one of the biggest boats out there) in a B'rel Bird of Prey (the starter ship) I felt very much like I'd seen everything there was to see here.Playing Federation, on the other hand, was just insultingly silly.  Going from the academy to the captain's chair in the space of an afternoon, in the company of your bubbleheaded teenybopper classmates who all seem to think they're going to be captains too sometime soon, just wrecks all suspension of disbelief.  As does taking an old clunker of a training ship out, running into a Borg cube, and NOT getting owned in five seconds.  Sorry, I don't see how I'm supposed to take that seriously as either a Trek fan or a newcomer just looking to blow stuff up in space.A few very notable nice touches, though the memorial to the Star Trek actors and crew who have passed away was both touching and depressing (the list of names is really, really long...).  It was fun for a bit, and can't say I won't go hunting Feds again in the future, but don't wait up for me.			"

												Short review: This game is absolutely worth your time.  The crafting system is simplistic, the build mechanics complex enough to provide lots of diversity, and the ship battles are ultimately quite fun and engaging in ways that few other MMOs can manage.

Some ships and a multitude of other ship devices and items cost dilithium, which is obtained in-game for free at a relatively slow pace.  This game also features a trade system whereby you can trade zen for dilithium and vice versa, meaning that anything you can buy for real money could potentially be bought entirely for free, with enough time and patience.It takes a LOT of dilithium to do this, naturally (usually 150 dil for 1 zen), so you will be doing some grinding for it.  However, the grinding is not that bad by comparison to typical MMO grinding as dilithium can be obtained several ways (dilithium farming can be done through a variety of daily quests across the entire universe, as well as through duty officer missions and PvE queues).

In my own experience with many MMOs, this one is hardly as ""pay-to-win"" as they want it to sound.  Cryptic gives you a chance at a unique top-tier ship via the lockbox system if you're willing to spend your dilithium on keys for the lockboxes instead.  And on top of that, they even throw events which allow you to unlock a top-tier ship entirely for free (such as during Q's Winter Wonderland) with enough time put in.So suffice it to say you can do far, far worse than STO if you want to talk ""pay to win"".  This game by no means fits that bill, not when you can buy anything in the real money store for free with enough hard work.  It's attitudes like those of the ""popular"" negative votes against this game which help fuel the stereotype of ""gamer entitlement"" that many often refer to.  Truthfully, this is a great game, and you ought not to let these people fool you into thinking otherwise.			"

												I have been playing this game for a couple of years now. I am, and will always be, a Star Trek fan, but...It seems to have been going down hill for a while now. I tried my best to put my rose colored glasses on, and look the other way, but they finally broke. Pros:1: Excelent story line. Even though it is a bit hard to believe in the beginning. 2: Graphics are great. 3: pew pew sounds are great.4: Voice acting is top notch.5: You can walk around inside of your ship. 6: QCons:1: Story can leave a bad taste in your mouth, if you are a Trekkie.2: pvp is lost3: lockboxes.....4: End game grind your ___ off, for days, weeks, months..for one thing5: Dev's are toxic6: S_itty ground battles. (They could have done so much better)I loved it when it was still subbed. But, even then things were off. Now, some of those things are STILL in the game, years later. And, you get told off if you mention them. It may be fun to mess around with, but it isn't a game for true Trekkies, or ppl that really like a good mmo....			"

Where the game really shines is the ship to ship combat and the ambiance of the game.  STO has perfectly captured the sounds, sights, and general ambiance of the source material.  Its F2P so its worth trying.			"

Not bad at all for a f2p game and the daily quests/mission menu is a nice touch.With ship and crew customization it's pretty easy to get immersed in the grind. But at the end of the day that is what mmo's are these days, grinding for end game items with time sinks inbetween. But like I said the ship battles are pretty epic.

												Been playin STO for a long long while ""Bought it when it first came out"" and I have to say that out of all the F2P models I have seen this one is one of the best. You can get whatever you want in the cash shop without spending a dime, you do this by mining and trading on the Dilithium market which is basically a form of currency that you can exchange for Cash Shop Zen. HOWEVER, be prepared to put in the time if you choose to go that route.  Biggest problem I have seen with this game is the players who actually play it. Those that dont put money into the game are constantly ♥♥♥♥♥ing about the ""advantage"" other players have over them and Earth Spaceport has become a literal soapbox for these people to voice their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Despite the fact that if these people simply just put some time into the game they could have everything a paid player has access too as well. Putting money into the game is simply a time saving convinence, not a game breaking flaw. As many of these people would lead you to believe. Besides, there is a mission where you take a current generation Ship, slingshot around the sun, go back in time to TOS. And get drink recipes from Scotty... That alone should make you want to play. Graphics I have noticed are getting a bit dated and certain aspects of space combat will take you a moment to learn. But, other than that the game is enjoyable and fun.10/10 Would go back in time to get alcohol recipes from Scotty again.  "

												The game's sound and visiuals are very solid, actually, and the space combat was reminiscent of the enjoyable Starfleet Command games (no longer in circulation, as far as I know). The problems come from:1) Redundancy. A lot of missions are go to a place and seek out multiple groups of enemies; return when you've killed x number of them2) Ground combat. It's tedious. Additionally, the character movements are very jumpy on ground missionsAnyway, it was fun for a while, but didn't have anything to hold interest. Just more and more of the same grind, essentially.

												Dear Star Trek community, of my currently more than 3 hours of trying to play this piece of♥♥♥♥♥I've spent no time in game. This was at first because I couldn't make a ♥♥♥♥ing user. When I made my user, it wouldn't accept my username in the username/email box, so I always had to use my mail. When it would finally accept both mail and password, I was presented with a loading screen. I've so far spent about 3 ♥♥♥♥ing hours in this loading screen, and have yet to play the ass♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ load of ♥♥♥♥berries that is the game I wanted to help me get into the show.♥♥♥♥ it.10/10 IGN would loading time again.UPDATE:I got it running after about 7 hours and will now review the first hour of in-game gameplay. It bouldly goes where no asspoop has gone before, except maybe that Star Trek game that costs actually human money.I'm reviewing this for it's gameplay, not plot, cuz I skipped all the story things.First there's a surprisingly non-testicular character creator, this concludes my list of pros.I chose to be a starfleet person for reasons of reasons, and was booped into San Francisco anno 2400 or somewhere around ther, I know it's San Francisco because it's shouted at me trough voice-acting and the golden gate is pushed up into my face. My first quest is to go and talk to someone, so is my second one, and third, and fourth, and fifth (after it let me talk to the guy), and sixth. As my seventh quest I have to go and toast cuz I graduated from space-school or something before I get sent to a spaceship that; MAJOR SPOILERS OF SOMETHING NOBODY WOULD PREDICT IN A GAME AT ALL, the ship gets attacked. You then do yada yada for a couple of minutes (one of which was breaching a door I couldn't quite find because the doors don't work at all and you just go through all of them) before I get to control the ship (which the dialogue might explain but I skipped it. At this point I realised that I have about 71 games that are better than this in my steam library (I have 72 in total as of when I'm writing this) that are a quadrillion times better than this pile of words that would have my steam account banned due to profanity.Conclusion:Pros:Character creator.Cons:The other bit.The character creator is worth the money they're asking, it's a bit much for the rest of it tho.Negative 834762859/10 IGN would exit game again.

AND IT'S FREE! A game like this and it's FREE! Lolz, but I also like it cause it's Star Trek. If only there were a Star Wars game like this. That would be perfect.

												Personally I found this game quite enjoyable. I am a big fan of Star Trek, both then new movies and the tv series. But here are my pros and cons for this game.Pros: 1: Large expansive map with loads of planets and systems to explore.        2: Many ships, weapons, costumes and species to play and experiment with.        3: The ship-to-ship combat is enjoyable and fitting for any play style.Cons: 1: Ground combat is far from perfect. It has its moments but those a few and far apart.          2: Since the game is free-to-play, it will insist on flashing ads in your face at almost every loading screen.          3: The servers can be a bit jumpy and unresponsive at times but after a few seconds they manage to fix themselves.Finally my final verdict: This game is good. Not great but not bad. Its really has its moments if you are a fan the the series. To any Star Trek fans who are considering this game I can heartily recommend it and to any others, why not give it a shot. Its pretty good for a free game.			"

												The game is good in single player, but absolutely horrible as MMO.  Then the lastest expansion came out increasing level grind from a few days to months or years forcing you to repeat the same 3 minute content thousands of times. Every ship you want to fly will cost  you 30 dollars or spending all day every day collecting pink rocks like full time work to buy them for free. They give one faction that no one plays insane damage (romulans) and anything other factions get is nerfed to nothingness. They increased monster health 10x while maybe increasing damage 50% so you can spend half an hour shooting at same guy. They turned a casual exploration based game into a full time job. The only people defending this are those who have unlimited time or funding and want to feel superior.			"

												This game is great, but one thing is the server connection. The server connection is total trash, and they do server maintenance every other day. Fix your servers and you got yourself a good game. Plus a lot of the free to Play games are PtP, and this ISN'T. With everything you do you get something called Dilithium, and with that you can make Zen, which is the ""extra"" currency in the game, you don't need to pay anything unless you want special ships and characters and what-not. Even in the campaign you don't have to pay anything.Short Version:Pros:Not Pay to PlayGood PlotCons:Trashy Servers			"

												Star Trek online is a spectacular game. With that being said there is alot to do in game. The Quests and instances make you feel very immersed into the star trek universe. My only grip with this game as it can get complicated, there is somewhat of a learning curve and it can be overwhelming to some players. Over all this game is well done and it does a good job connecting all elements of every star trek series. Id say if you are a star trek fan you cant go wrong. If you like complicated yet dynamic space exploration games youll like this game as well. Communitys however are a different story, it is hard for me to find americans that I can group up with. Either way its a good game in an over saturated MMO market, so it kind of makes this a diamond in the rough.			"

												I kind of want to like this game, but no, it is too irritating and painful. Also despite 6 years after release I am encountering a ridiculous amounts of bugs, animation faults, voice acting errors, sound glitches that even the most simple pissant could have found and fixed.This game is half-arsed, a money hole and ridled with incredibly poor design choices that fail to keep any sort of narrative together.I have found the mission that broke the camels back though. Step one, defeat 3 groups of enemies. Great, okay. Step two, defeat 3 waves of the same enemies. Okay, getting tedious now.Step three, defeat 3 waves of 3 groups of the same enemies.

												OMG, WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!!!Do you know why? Because as soon as you play it, ninjas hired by Cryptic/Arc will break into your house, fire a bunch of ninja stars at you, and demand that you either fork over hundreds of dollars for DLCs that you don't need or grind away for gear you don't have to have!Just look at how many hours I've put into this game! Did you think I wanted to put in hundreds of hours into this game and spend $5000 in six months? Did you think I wanted to turn this game into a grind, spend hundreds of dollars a year for lockboxes and DLCs I don't need? Of course not! But when you have an evil corporation like Cryptic/Arc putting psychotropic drugs into your food administered by former SS officers who worked for Dr. Mengele, what else can you do? I have no choice but to keep pouring tons of money into a FREE MMO.This game has scammed so much money out of me that as of today, I am selling my daughters into white slavery to pay for my gameplaying. This is on top of losing my beautiful 2 family house after I gambled it away to buy 1000 more lockboxes. Now I live like a hobo underneath a bridge, shaking my tin can so passersby can donate money for my lockbox habit. This is what Arc/Cryptic does to people. It preys on their vulnerabilities, it forces them to become lockbox and DLC freaks so they are spending their life savings in a matter of months.So please, don't be like me. Avoid this game like the plague. I know it says this game is technically ""free."" I know that technically, the DLCs are all cosmetic and don't add in the way of gameplay, that players can level up all the way from 0-60 without any paywalls, that players don't have to spend a dime on lockboxes or fancy ships that go pewpewpew. But it's LIES! ALL LIES! Arc/Cryptic are evil masterminds who come up with ways to force you to spend thousands of dollars on this game against your will so that you will lose your house, your mortgage, your two prepubescent daughters, your spouse, your everything to it!!! :,-((((Don't let what happened to me happen to you. You will regret it--I promise!!!P.S. HELP ME! I HAVE NO IMPULSE CONTROL AND AM AS DUMB AS A BOX OF ROCKS! GAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!			"

												I recently started watching Star Trek Voyager agian and the by product of that experience is the need to fly around and shoot some phasers at things. The reason I say this is cause I want to point out the single greatest thing about this game which is simply you get to fly around and shoot phasers at people. This added with crew compilation options, varying abilities, and a vast universe created a game worth playing. Ship decoration is neither abundant nor limited so there is something for everyone and the ability to make your crew members match uniforms really adds to your own world and a true feeling of what sitting in the captains chair is like. This game isn't without fault but there is no game that can claim to be flawless, perfect, and sparkly. Such things are a myth and any errors or bugs in this game should not effect your opinion in whether to play it or not.			"

												one of the best MMOs around: free, based on a respectful franchise, decently coded, runs on a good engine, two-type gameplay, feature-full, greatly customizable and user-generated content.while the game had bad start, and received average remarks, the recent leap out of Atari's hands almost solved all those issues, and Star Trek Online is not the game it was two years ago.that said, if u like space simulations, and rpg-based ground combat, and u must multiplay with ur co-op buddies to have interest in a game, this is a very good choice.and if u r a Star Trek fan, then, there is no excuse why u r not already playing the game! :Dit may not b the greatest game of all times, but i don't think that's Star Trek's style anyway. for what it is, it's pretty good.

												This game causes a lot of nostalgia and excitement to see what the Star Trek universe can do. But this game is riddled with bugs, glitches, display problems, choppy fps drops, and hilarious lag issues. If cryptic can stop sucking up the players' money for a month or so and genuinely patch the game, this may improve. PvE events are non-existent, the grind is still horrible. The tutorial sticks you with skills and abilities you may not want and doesnt even let you respecialize to your own liking. You have to buy a token which you can obtain without spending actual money, but it'll take weeks of grinding for Dilithium Crystals just to afford it. My overall rating on this bug-ridden distaster is a 2 out of 5. It seems Cryptic has lost its sense of gaming and just dove for the players' wallets. Patches are meant to improve the game, new content is supposed to add new things.. but clearly its just layering on more time wasted grinding away for a ship or loadout you can't do without paying actual money.

												This game was fun for a time.  Then, I tried to get my second ship.  I got a free token for another ship and went to turn it in and both the OK and CANCEL buttons did the same thing...nothing.  My token was gone and no new ship.  So, I played for a few days and built up enough Dilithium to purchase the Cruiser ship (15000).  I went to purchase the ship, my Dilithium disappeared and in the chat window it said I received the Cruiser, but sadly no ship.Granted, I was using a free account, but if free accounts are not allowed a second ship, why does my Ship Slots show 5 available and both my token and Dilithium were depeleted?  What's worse is the bug reporting system wouldn't let me notify the developers of this issue.  Shotty programming guys.  If you would have kept me happy on the free account, I would have became a paying member, but I don't think I want to waste anymore time or ANY money on this product.			"

												Most (if not all) FTP games have stores that you can purchase things in (after all, they need to make money).STO is no exception, though it is the best FTP game I have ever played; you don't have to buy anything to succeed.			"

												This game is very very fun even if you don't have any idea what Star Trek is. I started when one of my friends was playing and was like ""oh that game looks like fun"" and i really wasn't that into Star Trek. I now love Star Trek and this game. but enough about that, you probably want to know about the game not my personal experience.Pros:+Fun gameplay+Many different races to play as+Three factions: KDF, Federation, and Romulan+Good story+F2P+Can create fleets with other people+Can ram enemies+Partial voice acting+Pretty good audio+You command your own starship+You have Duty Officers that you can put on assignment to do stuff+Crafting+There are tribblesCons:-There are tribbles-Gameplay can get a little repetative-Hard to make EC (the currency) if you don't know what you're doing-Servers are a little buggy/slow-Ground combat is a little buggy if you use shooter mode-Can be pay 2 win if you don't know what you're doing-A skill is required to ram enemies-You might find yourself becoming a Trekkie-Leonard Nimoy is dead.

												Star trek online is a MMO where you are a captain of a (klingon,starfleet,romulan) ship as you progress to make your faction more powerful and to progress your character.Ignore my hours as I played this game three years since I got it on steam,so it probaly is really around 100 or so hours.Now even though i'm a extreme star trek fan I have to be brutally honest as there are some extremely bad things in this game,trust me.So without further delay here is the reviewPros- Game is large with lots of things to do,with atleast 20 hours for each faction storyline,and with all the sidemission and fleet actions it increases far  beyond that-Space battle are amazing,when you get to those points where a group of allied and enemy ships meet it looks so good.With ships scattered everywhere in a tight group with beam lines everywhere with torpedos flying by your ships evere three seconds.And in the higher level ones you also get to see massive ammounts of fighters going by as well.-There is alot of customization options to make your perfect character,as well as there being alot of ships to choose from with alot having different variations to choose from.With the ability to mix and match the different parts of the different variants-You get to see alot of memorable places from the movies and shows,like DS9,Earth,Starfleet academy,vulcan,Qo'nos,Debris of romulus,Wolf 359, etc.-Dabo,enough said here-PVP is fun at the lower levels and you get tons of awesome loot from it!-Alot of races to choose from,and only made 10 are paid for,out of like the 50 species to be.Neutral-Game needs a better interface,even with a maxed out character I get lost in the UI and the several different drop down menus,forgetting where that one button is.-most of the clothes you need to pay for,while I love have payed content so you can have something most people in the game won't have to make your character more unique,having 80% of the clothes you need to pay for is just crazy.-All of the max level ships you have to pay for,with them being 25 dollars a peice.Cons-A.I is MENTALLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,one time I lost my crewmembers because they didn't know how to jump over a pipe.-Game completely favors people that pay money,and I don't mean like a exp boost,I mean like later in the game inless you pay money you get practiclly screwed on the harder missions and in pvp don't bother inless you pay money.-There are some large difficaulty spikes,on one point in a mission,then it goes back to being in the middle between easy and moderate-Animations are pretty bad,but I won't have this impact the score-Loading screens EVERYWHERE!,While it's better with only three loading screens as you travel in sector space,there used to be like 10-15,it's still bad in planets and such.-Game is linear especially since they removed the exploration missions and replaced them with some duty officer assignments,while they were a sorry excuse for exploration they were my favorite thing to do.Overrall the game scores a 7/10,when it first launched it was definately a 5/10,but has growed as a whole and will continue to get better for a while to come.I definately reccomend this game to EVERYONE except people that hate star trek,everyone else it's free so you might as well try it out.

												I am Star Trek fan since i was born and this game is biggest lie that was given to us. It doesnt work good and have to many crashes and game disconnects in just one day. Its pay-to-win also because if you dont buy zen or premium accaunt you need to spend to much time playing for free without any joy just grind grind grind type of game. I personaly hate WOW-like game in ST universe. Developers are joke and technical support to, they dont give a f*** for players! This game shoud be deleted from steam.			"

												I’ve never really been that into MMO’s, after having a dabble in WOW, I find them so time consuming, and not to mention addictive. However, being a huge Star Trek fan, I had to try STO. I’ve actually spent likely hundreds of hours in this, right back from when it was in beta play. I absolutely love it, the easter eggs, the guest characters are such wonderful features for those who love Star Trek. The stories are all perfectly written and have many brilliant references to previous episodes of Star Trek. The game play itself is great, the space battles and ground assaults give it a good variety of play. Ship customisation is so much fun, although to get some of the best stuff… you really have to do a lot of farming and devote a lot of time to your play. The game encourages a lot of team work and group playing, I never really precipitated in that as much prefer going off and doing my own thing. Overall I would recommend this to any Star Trek fan, hours of fun and stratification! Glorious space battles and phaser fights with an exciting sound track! What more could you ask for?!			"

												Possibly the worst MMO experience ever. Missions can take upwards of an hour - and regularly bug out - assuming you've taken so long you're AFK - and causing NPCs to start regenning health faster than humanly possible.If the Borg were to encounter STO - they wouldn't even attempt to assimilate it - probably deciding to exterminate instead. The Ferengi wouldn't even consider it worth an ounce of gold pressed latinum, and the Klingons would find it a poor simulation.The STO experience is an exercise in frustration and tedium. You'll see familiar faces, some incredible voice acting, and Korean levels of grinding. Everything worth anything costs insurmountable amounts of credits due to inflation from the Microtransactions.The entire game is built around the 1% of hard core players who somehow manages to stay far enough ahead of the curve to be gods among men - living embodiments of Q - who swat NPCs with ease - and leaving the casual player or trekkie in the dust, struggling to complete the simplest of missions.The game has not progressed in any meaningful way, or improved even remotely since the beta - bugs continue to plague  the game, that were reported in those early days. Instead they've elected to paywall or outright remove features and content to make it easier to manage.If you're thinking of picking up this game, don't - you'll have a moment of excitement to be experiencing a Star Trek game, followed by a slowly growing frustration that this isn't a trip through the holodeck, but instead a Tal'shiar torture device being experienced in the coldest corner of rura penthe while a gorn does unspeakable things.1/8472			"

												STO is 99% grinding and only 1% gameplay. if you want to loose your real life and friends and never see the sun again and spend thousands of dollar for crap, then go ahead and play sto. the game is full with never fixed bugs, boring cutscenes you cant escape, more boring pvp and pve missions, bad comic-like graphics, every 20 minutes you get a game crash, the network code is very slow and you will get a ton of lag and rubberbanding all the time, the login and loading of the game takes ages the first 5 minutes you cant do anything and i have a fast ssd, huge amount of fast ram and fast connection so its not the fault of my system, the game clipping is horrible everything is warping around, the episode mission storys make no sense at all, the support doesnt even exist they will rather harras you instead of help you, everywhere they have added timegates i still wonder why they havent added timegates even for the beamout process. the game devs cant even code at all, they are all copy and paste coders cryptic has hired some cheap coders of a third world country and they just c&p code from neverwinter another pwe game. now they have added a new and very, very, very expensive crafting system and it takes you almost 7 years to reach the endlevel in crafting and if you want to speed up crafting to reach level 20 asap you would need to buy enough dilithium for 8500 dollars!!!, but you cant craft gear with the mods you want, instead its more like a lottery crafting with random mods, its useless in this stadium. so forget it, you cant equip your toons with your own crafted gear. after that they have added a new very, very, very expensive upgrade system, this is the most expensive and overpriced system i have ever seen or heard of. you can easily burn 300 dollars away just to upgrade one shipgear loadout(6-8 weapons, 1 deflector, 1 engine, 1 shield, 1 warpcore) and it takes ages to go through all the little upgrade steps(for 1 shield i have needed over an hour to upgrade) and you have to click like a trillion times and you need tons over tons of upgrade commodities(you cant even get more some of the needed commodities anywhere in the game, they are very, very, very rare and therefore very, very, very expensive). the upgrade system is the total scam. and again this new upgrade system doesnt give you the needed mods you want, its again another lottery-like upgrade system. just to have 8 identical beams with the same mods you would need atleast 8 beams x 8 different mods - 8 = 56 trys with the upgrade system, just to get 8 identical beams with the same identical mods like crtdx4 LOL!!! and this whole process will cost you hundreds of dollars in real life money. now imagine you have to upgrade the warpcore, engine, deflector, shield of your ship and now even imagine you have 50 ships all with different gear. this will cost you thousands of dollar just to upgrade all your old stuff that you have already aquired and paid with real money. they let you pay again and again and again your stuff that you have already bought. sto is not worth the insane high costs, its maybe worth 10 bucks per month at all. you could fill a 1tb drive full with games for the money sto wants from you. i had a little trick i have used to avoid the insane high costs in form of real money. i had in the end 27 chars and 20 alts all level 50 that i have used to farm ec, dilithium, commodities, contraband and i was a heavy multibox user. because of this little trick i could aquire everything in the game, i had everything and all ships you could get. this means i have started sometimes up to 10 game clients and i was logged in with 10 different accounts at once. i did cycle though all 47 chars to get all the doffjobs done on all of my chars. i mainly used the refugee, prisoner, officer doff exchange assignments to get more very rare and rare doffs and sell them on the exchange. all i did was switch between the game windows and do doff assignments for doffs, contraband and commodities or i did path to 2409 or did mine dilithium with my 47 chars or did the cristalline entity event and idled with 10 chars at the startpoint lol. sometimes i have played more than 18 hours per weekend day! i made trillions of ec and millions of dilithium(trade 5 contraband for 2000 dil ore every 4 hours with my 20 alts chars plus 1 main char). i did not pay a dime for the new greed rising extension, i have farmed over 2,5 million dilithium and traded it for zen and bought the dr pack ingame for 12,5k zen. i was very dissapointed by the delta rising pack, the new t6 ship are ugly beyond imagination, the stats of the ships are horrible, everything is broken in delta rising nothing works. i couldnt even login more due to crashes and server timeout and game freezes every few minutes. sto has no beta testers, we the endgame customers are the alpha and beta testers. i said to myself enough is enough, screw that. i have deinstalled sto and sold my main account. i will never again play a mmo or sto. i bought now battlefield 4 with premium and all unlocks. now i play maybe every 2 or 3 days bf4 for 2 or 3 hours per day. i only play bf4 if i really have the time and nothing else to do. i have also no monthly followup costs like in sto. i bought bf4 once and have never again to pay anything and bf4 is now 99% gameplay and fun and only 1% grinding and for the first time in 3 years i have seen a real working game support, thanks for that. now after my horrible sto experience my whole life has changed to a very good life, i have now more sleep, more energy, more money, more time, more friends, more sun, more of everything, im so glad i stopped playing sto.

												I love Star Trek. I always have, and I'm pretty sure I always will. I loved this game for a long time, too.What I'm not a fan of, is the way things on this have turned recently within STO. The atmosphere of the game is wrong. When I first started playing, it was a happy, very lore-friendly place filed with lots of people trying to get their way into the TV screen we all watched our first episodes on. Recently, the lay of the land has become confusing. To say you have to grind a lot is the understatement of the milenium. EVERYTHING is a grind now, unless you want to pay for it. It has also become increasingly apparent that PWE is searching for money: In-game purchases are fine, but when you give us 3 new ships and 10 new costumes every other week, it gets ridiculous. I think one of the things I have been experiencing serves as a perfect explination. The game only launches on safe mode. In the time that this bug began to now, I count at least 19 new ships that have been added to the game (not including fleet model ships). The new way of grinding is... well, bad. Horrendous. An abomination. A lot of the new grinds require vast sums of dilithium, which is hard to farm for, and is quantity capped at 8000 units a day, which is a penny in the well of what you'll actually need. Now, dilitium is hard to farm for, but guess what PWE sells. Zen. Guess what you can by dilithium for, kiddies. Zen. All in all, this game is very good. I wouldn't have spent so much time on it otherwise, but I'm terrified that this will turn into Guitar Hero. A good game, a great idea, but driven into the ground harder than a Mack truck hitting a freight train because they produced too much new content too fast, and people got sick of it. Also: when you advertise an upgrade to your existing tier 5 ships to make them ""tier 5u"" ships, make them equal to the tier 6 ships. The imbalance is ridiculous. I have top-tier gear on my odyssey (including your $5 upgrade). It can't keep pace with anything on tier 6, and thats not okay.

												This game causes a lot of nostalgia and excitement to see what the Star Trek universe can do. But this game is riddled with bugs, glitches, display problems, choppy fps drops, and hilarious lag issues. If cryptic can stop sucking up the players' money for a month or so and genuinely patch the game, this may improve. PvE events are non-existent, the grind is still horrible. The tutorial sticks you with skills and abilities you may not want and doesnt even let you respecialize to your own liking. You have to buy a token which you can obtain without spending actual money, but it'll take weeks of grinding for Dilithium Crystals just to afford it. My overall rating on this bug-ridden distaster is a 2 out of 5. It seems Cryptic has lost its sense of gaming and just dove for the players' wallets. Patches are meant to improve the game, new content is supposed to add new things.. but clearly its just layering on more time wasted grinding away for a ship or loadout you can't do without paying actual money.

												one of the best MMOs around: free, based on a respectful franchise, decently coded, runs on a good engine, two-type gameplay, feature-full, greatly customizable and user-generated content.while the game had bad start, and received average remarks, the recent leap out of Atari's hands almost solved all those issues, and Star Trek Online is not the game it was two years ago.that said, if u like space simulations, and rpg-based ground combat, and u must multiplay with ur co-op buddies to have interest in a game, this is a very good choice.and if u r a Star Trek fan, then, there is no excuse why u r not already playing the game! :Dit may not b the greatest game of all times, but i don't think that's Star Trek's style anyway. for what it is, it's pretty good.

												If you have a deep love for sci-fi, or Star Trek in general, this might be a good fit for you. Focus of the game is on space and ground combat, with exploration mechanics thrown in. The quest lines are usually nicely done and supplemented by the availability of user made quests and zones. The amount of ships  available is impressive pulling from nearly every race and era of Star Trek, with new ships being added often.The downside is the fairly insistent pokes by the game to cough up cash. While not unexpected, the frequency and manner are a bit too frequent and in your face. Bugs... long standing interface bugs that have literally persisted unfixed for years (suppose that technically makes them ""features""). Grind... lots of it. That said, you can attain almost anything in the game if your willing to put in the time.			"

Multiple story-arcs!* Third, awesome customization, both for player and starship!* Fourth, you can indeed fly a starship!* Fifth, content is still being released!* Sixth, plenty of ships to collect!Cons --* First, the game can be hard to run for some low-end systems.* Second, after a few weeks, the game can feel quite grindy.* Third, after a few months, you may get bored with the overwhelming content.* Fourth, the game has connectivity issues.Overall --Would I recommend this game? Yes, yes I would. Especially if you are a Star Trek fan!			"

 It's got all the MMO elements in a Star Trek Universe and more than enough PvE and basically single player ""questlines"" to give anyone the option to play countless hours without worry of only having the option to be phaser-fodder for ""pay to win"" players in PvP only like so many other ""Free to Play"" games.

 If I understand it right, you actually pay for more ""Episodes"" which I think is like expansion story lines and some cheaper access to other ships which can be used for further standard MMO play. Yet I don't feel I saw any major ""beat-all"" purchasable items, ships or gear. It's got a lot to offer for a free and if you've got a Taste for SciFi and/or StarTrek then give it a shot. You'll even get a little time travel now and then to cross paths with old friends and some nice Star Ship Battle time to really get that nostalgic feel,

												This is a great game for any star trek fan. I played it for a solid 3 weeks until I reached admiral level. From then on you are required to buy ships and equipemnet with real money if you want any chance to finish missons. So this means you'll get a good 50 hours gameplay until you have to reach into your pocket for mmo virtual products. So if your a star trek fan of any of the franchise give this a play for a few hours and decide after if you wan to spend money.The ship fights are great. The fan made missions are even better. The arrangement of your bridge crew adds fighting and mission abilites which is great. Complete customisation of your self crew and ship. The only downside I found was that every mission had you kill emeny ships. Its not very federation if your killing everything. The fan missions have a bit more of a true federation feel to them than the main ones. There is alot of fighting for a peaceful exploring space federation. Also its always updateing. If you dont update for a week itll be a good 10 min update waiting when you log in.			"

A few came to mind that I have fond memories of in the past...Bridge Commander, Elite Force 1 & 2, Away Team, Fleet Command III, Final Unity etc. Star Trek Online combines the best of those games into one, with so much more. I can't get enough of it. It scratches every Star Trek itch I have, when it comes to gaming. It isn't pay to win, either...though paying does help a lot.

												As a long term Trek fan this game is brilliant, there have always been and still remain some issues with ground combat, but as a whole this games use of the IP is amazing, they keep adding more and more story content and new exciting ships, every year at christmas and on first contact day they give away prizes and gifts to the community.recently they've added a new game level where you begin in the 23rd century and play in the TOS era but this its self is still part of the story content of the main game. they frequently bring actors from the show in to reprise their roles all of which are woven into the main games story line. There is so much to do and so much to explore and see and learn and play.. this is a MUST for any Trek fan and should be for MMO fans too.			"

												When reading this review, please bear in mind that I am reviewing the Agents of Yesterday DLC, not the full game.Star Trek Online: Agents of Yesterday is a brand-new DLC for Star Trek Online. It consists of 6 missions if you choose to create a character from the Starfleet of the 23rd century, and also about 4 other missions towards the middle of the game whereby you become a Temporal Agent.The storyline takes you to various different locations and various timelines, most notably: the JJ Abrams Timeline (or the Kelvinverse) where the U.S.S Kelvin was destroyed in battle (presumably). In this timeline, you assist the U.S.S Yorktown against Na'Kuhl Raiders who are trying to destroy the timeline hence creating a weapon against the Federation. There are several ships added in his DLC, all of which, however, cost REAL MONEY. I have to say, however, that they are very unique and powerful although I am surprised at the lack of a Kelvin Timeline Constitution Class (T6). The DLC itself feels and looks very much like the TOS sounds and graphics I wanted but does not give me the option to change to the 2410 style later on when the TOS effects seemed to get slightly annoying, Other than this, it felt almost empty as the storyline ended abruptly. I feel that more could have been added to improve e experience.			"

												Meh. 2 hours into the tutorial and I already have enough of it. The game looks, feels and plays as a dated and clunky game. I love Star Trek, but this MMO again shows that the first great Star Trek game has yet to be made.    I have not given up on the game yet and will try it out for some more hours (for the love of Star Trek), but so far its meh thus.Edit (4h gameplay): The Star Trek Universe lore is actually pretty decent. I have also boosted the default max graphic settings in the game with 8x supersample and that reduced most of the jaggies I got on normal maxed settings. Still, it's not a great looking game, but it does look acceptable now.			"

												See all the pretty cinematic pictures? Look at them a loooooong time if you plan to play this game. You will need a reminder of what they tried to sell you. I actually bought this festering turd, pre=ordered it even. It is free to play for a reason, it is boring, monotonous and about as epic as a trip to the toilet. The worlds are tiny, the missions heartless and the storylihne is... Oh wait I can't recall it really having one. Avoid it at all costs... even free.			"

												Meh. 2 hours into the tutorial and I already have enough of it. The game looks, feels and plays as a dated and clunky game. I love Star Trek, but this MMO again shows that the first great Star Trek game has yet to be made.    I have not given up on the game yet and will try it out for some more hours (for the love of Star Trek), but so far its meh thus.Edit (4h gameplay): The Star Trek Universe lore is actually pretty decent. I have also boosted the default max graphic settings in the game with 8x supersample and that reduced most of the jaggies I got on normal maxed settings. Still, it's not a great looking game, but it does look acceptable now.			"

												Star Trek Online the perfect MMORPG. It is Free to Play, but not Pay to Win. You may progress through the game faster, and get some exclusive items (mainly customization items) and features with a paid subscription, but the free version is still perfectly enjoyable. The high-end ships and items are very expensive, but you do not have to pay with real-world currency just to purchase them. All you need to do is grind... a lot. I have almost one million energy credits, and that's all from playing casually, no gridning involved. You pick up items from fallen enemies, and if you pick up all of the loot critters and sell the stuff you don't need, you'll be rich in no time. The more valuable currencies are a bit harder to come by, but again, they are obtainable by simply playing the game!The game has a lot bugs, but almost all of them can be fixed with a console command, and I have only come accross one game-breaking bug. I feel like I should mention that I have put in alot of hours into this game. Like, hundreds (the 7.8 hours on record is only on Steam, I usually play with it's standalone launcher.)And don't even get me started on the fan service! It's simply wonderful! Actors from the television series reprise their roles to voice their characters' in-game counterparts.Whether you're a Trekkie, or just enjoy MMO's, definitely give this game a go. "

												I have played this game for a long time and whilr it is rather good there is a lot wrong with it. To start with cryptic is only interested in sucking people in to buy zen credits for purchases and dilithium and it is far to reliant on the later for most things. There are also no dilithium factories like in the real star trek and as a result you always run out of dilithium. The game is just an endless grind to get anywhere and when you reach level 60 it gets even worse. After awhile you run out of things to do and it ends up being a constant repetitive annoyance! So while it is one of the better star trek games don't bother playing it unless you have tons of money on your credit card to waste on it! "

												Originally got this game as a regular subscriber back before it went FTP.  Was disappointed by lack of RomulansCame back a few years later, once they got around to adding Romulans, and found that all my characters and most of my gear were now locked behind paywalls... along with my custom made Forge missions and half the stuff that I had already done.Then discovered that they didn't truly add Romulans... they just added Romulan skins and a few ships to the existing two factions and called it good.  I guess adding a proper third faction was too much effort.  Then again, from what I saw in my second forray was that the only effort still being put forth was to sell pay-to-win items and lottery tickets to those blessed of wealth and lacking of brains.In summary, a great potential for a MMO squandered away into another dull PTW cash grab.

												This game is such a mixed experience for me. On the one hand I want to hate the terrible land combat and the quests inability to engage me (though that is probably a bit more of my fault than the game's) but on the other hand the space combat is one of my favorites I've encountered in a game and I love the thrilling feeling I get when the game allows me to upgrade my ship to the next really cool looking stage. Gameplay wise the game has two parts, as I mentioned above, land and space combat. These two balance out in one being boringly bland and generic, and the other being really fun and feeling appropriate to the universe. The space combat is the better part, feeling like a sort of naval combat except in space. You have to line your ship up in the appropriate positions to fire ceratain weapons and it feels more like the sub-esque combat of the orginal Star Trek series, and is nice change of pace. The leveling is kept fairly well paced throughout the game as I remember only having to grind for levels a couple of times during my playthrough. Also another good point is that most of the real money currency is used for cosmetics (like costumes based on the original shows' designs). However, as stated before, the land combat is incredibly generic, it's very similar to the hotkey buttons that I complained about in Lord of the Rings Online, this combat system can be fun if done right, such as Aura Kingdom's mix of being able to use two class weapons and rediculously flashy animations, otherwise though it's very boring. Unfortunately, Star Trek Online falls into the boring category of hotkey combat. Ultimately the enjoyable space combat and the charm of the Star Trek universe keeps me enjoying the game however. If you're a fan of Star Trek, space combat, or naval style ship combat, you will definately enjoy this game. If not, I'd still recommend giving it a try, there are worse games to spend a few minutes on.			"

												Engagins and entertaining to play for those who are a fan of Star Trek (and possibly those who are not, although STO's charm will be lost on those who don't enjoy Star Trek).The gameplay is enjoyable but can become repetitive the more you play, but such is the norm with MMOs, and can become a grind when confronted with the higher level end-game content, because missions have to be replayed to build experience points to advance to the highest ranks.The game follows Star Trek lore faithfully and recreates the vessels of Star Trek very well with a high degree of accuracy, which can be a limiting factor as the developers will have to start creating their own designs if they wish to add more vessels when they add the existing ones thus degrading the fan appeal of the game itself.STO has been focussing more on Fleet missions and PvE events lately where large groups of players are necessary to complete a mission, which sadly takes away from the single-player enjoyability of the game that is present in the campaign missions.All in all I would recommend STO to anyone who enjoys Star Trek.

												Well I've played this game for many hours and wanted to rejoin the fight with the latest expension. Sadly you have to link older accounts to a newer site one which I also already have because of another game and this simply isn't working. Contacted support and explained that I'm stuck in a loop as the linking accounts page times out every time and the launcher sends me back into the non working page. All I want is for them to link them so I can login. Now they asked me for a screenshot of this. really? screenshot of a timeout screen or a launcher which tells me to link my account? So I can no longer log in and no longer play and this with a support that doesn't care about it's customer.TL;DR: All I want to do is play but I simply can't and with a support that doesn't understand how their own game/launcher works or even how to fix their own accounts (non steam)... Well then you get a negative review and an uninstall.Do not invest any money in this F2P game as you can get locked out of it.Going to close my old and new account and never play anything from theirs again.

												Alright. Let me start off by saying. I am not a ""DIE HARD"" Trekkie. I love Space, Spaceships. Space combat. Everything space. This game has it all for me. Ships, they are Customizable, and can be enhanced a number of ways. As in equips, and if you have the right ships. Fleet and Tier 5 Upgraded variants. The ground combat is a little blank. As if, go here, and kill this foe by swarming him. The story is rather interesting. And I by no means, have a low play count. (At least half my time was spent on the Arc launcher. And still is.) Ignore the bad reviews. I promise. This game, if you let it. Will pull you in. THE ONLY REASON THOSE PEOPLE RATE IT BAD IS BECAUSE THEY DO PVP!!!

												Steam really needs to have a 'meh' button.This MMO is not by any means bad. I mean it's an MMO so what do you honestly expect. The story is reasonably strong and does have some grounding in the Star Trek cannon but they seem to use it as a spring board which is a good thing in my opinion. I'm not too sure about the story as about half way though I got bored and started skipping through the story. I kind of picture my captain giving 'get to the bloody point' hand gestures while some Admrial gives me a new mission and the story becomes go here, do this and get these as a reward.The space combat is what people really play the game for. It is quite fun although does get annoying if you go up against another ship which is roughly the same level as you and taking down it's shields is like shooting spit balls at it. The ground combat is sort of meh. I don't know if I set my character up correctly but I seem to die very quickly and enemies can tank damage like nothing else.STO does have a few other things to extend the life of it and ones of these is a reputation system when several factions will give you nice little traits once you get enough reputation points with them which you get through completing assignments by using reputation marks which are rewards for PvE events. These do turn into grinds but most of the traits are useful and you can get some fantastic ship and ground upgrades.They also put on winter and summer events which are quite nice and do add to the life albeit not much. One system I do like is the Zen coins, you can either buy them for real money or use Dilithium (in game rewards) and trade it in the games version of the stock exchange. This takes forever to get any usable ammounts of Zen but it does save you real money and you can buy some pretty fancy ships if you have patience.I'll be honest I play this game till I finish the event or get to teir 5 of the current faction reputation and that is it, I find little incentive or want to play more and while there PvP, little pointless side missions and the Foundry where you can make your own story missions they just don't grab my attention. Hardcore MMO players might disagree but for me this game is a quick distraction and a bit of a habbit.Check out my youtbe channel for lets plays and commentary every Monday and Fridayhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2l1zwMcpJm_hJq4owO3nHg "

												I used to love this game - there was PvP, there was procedural content (albeit more limited than even older MMOs like Anarchy Online), there were lots of canon starships at endgame - it was almost a Trekkies dream (aside from the lack of non-violent mission resolutions, which will turn off hardcore Roddenberry-ites).Then free to play happened.  The game was monetized, at the time, in an acceptable way.  As time has progressed, however, there have been paywall timegates and $60 ingame purchases labelled as ""micro-transactions"" by the publisher.  There has been a complete death of PvP, and the powercreep, which although unavoidable in classic-style MMOs, has accelerated to the point that nearly every update makes the game even more faceroll easy coupled with more lag as the server tries to sync hundreds if not thousands of more effects than it was ever designed to handle.The graphics engine, although once quite shiny and almost speedy, has, with the addition of many new effects, become a lagfest, even bringing SLI Titan Xs to single digits on occasions.  The default DX11 mode is more than likely to crash first-time players, unless you set the game to safe mode and change the render device.  The sound system is frequently broken and glitchy.  The voiceovers, while becoming more and more plentiful, are both poorly directed and poorly acted, not to mention that if you are a Trekkie who doesn't happen to be a fan of Voyager, there are very few characters that you will care about.  The only saving grace was the Leonard Nimoy VOs that you would here upon entering a new sector for the first time - with the combining of the space map into a single zone, I have no idea if these are even still present.If you are thinking of coming back, having played before the Delta Rising expansion - don't bother.  In the most asinine level cap increase I have ever seen, all of your gear is obsolete as ""endgame"" and has become placeholders for upgraded and crafted gear, both of which are highly RNG based and either require a massive timesink or spending into a paywall.I still do play - but it has no attraction as a game I care about - it fills the same role for me as a game like Ziggurat - if I have 30 minutes to waste but I don't want to commit to a real game, I jump into STO and run a few STFs (raids), or would if the lag in some of the instances weren't absolutely outrageous.Don't get me wrong, there is still some fun to be had, especially if you are a Trek fan.  I just don't think it's worth the time to download, or the temptation to spend real life cash on.			"

												As a single player game, it's great. It gives a very immersive Star Trek experience. However, the end game content is lacking and VERY VERY grindy. PVP is so unbalanced in escorts favor, it's a joke and PVP is dead in the game. It became a factor of who uncloaks and 1 hits the opponent first.			"

												Spends 100s of hours and a few $$$ getting to the top ship tier and weapon tier, only to come back and find that my ships are now obsolete and I need to spend more money to get the next ship tier if I want to be competitive in the PVE content of the game (top tier ships are only accessible through the $$$, or endless grinding that makes Korean MMOs look tame <---- not my thing). Now don't even get me started on the endless amounts of bugs or the horrible ground combat system.			"

												Here's my experience with STO.1) Was offered a friend key years ago to play for a month.  Said used key and played for said month.2) Left the game only to come back about a year later.  Didn't like the changes so left again.3) The game was apparently sold to ARC so I attempted to come back.  There's no record of my old account so I registered using a new email account.4) Verified my new email with ARC and used my password only to be told over and over by the launcher that my account name/password was invalid.5) Removed the game from my drive.If you're going to force someone to make a new account, at least make sure you registration system functions properly.

												Left the launcher open overnight to patch the game so I ended up with 16 hours playtime without having ever gone into the game. Spent an hour trying to create a character. Thought my game had glitched for another hour because it didnt tell me I was actually still in a mission, and had to speak to 1 dude for 1 dialogue box to end it. Friend set up a fleet with memes as ranks and then set up another friend called ""Baedolf Anschluss"" as Fuhrer, but had to pay 2 random dudes 2 million energy points or something so we had enough people to actually set up the fleet. Went to a tailor and realised that not only could I change my own uniform, but my character and also my crew and their uniform. Spent an hour doing that and made some lizard look like deadpool and edited everyone else. Went onto Baedolf's ship and... unmentionable things happened. Then a friend and I spent 4 hours running around my ship asking people for threesomes and criticising them for not wearing the Fleet's uniform. We started giving things random Star Trek names such as ""temporal quantum synthesizer"". Abused our power to no effect. Pasted the chat into Discord and spent 3 hours with other friends laughing at it and contiuing the role playing. Still haven't played any mission other than the tutorial.100% worth every hour, even if it wasn't free.			"

												This game reminds me of the first version of Eve......In the 16 hours since clicking the 'play' button in Steam, 15 hours 50 minutes have been spent updating, 7 minutes crashing, and I shot a few things in the 3 playable minutes.I hope they fix everything for the release version of this game.  Oh wait, it was released 5 years ago.0/10			"

												Like many other here, I'm not really sure what to say about this game. I myself have been playing it on and off since F2P and keep going in the cycle of:1. Gets really into it and plays a lot2. gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about all the negative stuff and ""quits""3. 3-4 months later get curious and start playing it againRepeatIn a way, this game is kind of like crack: you keep coming back to it even though you know it's bad. I think that I've finally broken my addication after almost 4 years though...For people just starting out, I most definetly do not recommend getting this game. The sheer amount of ""stuff"" to go through to get ""caught up"" is mind boggling; the game will probably be dead by the time you get ""caught up"" if you're just starting out now. Speaking of ""catching up"", that's exactly what this game has always felt like for me, especially as someone who can't just go shell out $30 for the latest ship, or $150 for the latest bundle/pack, or a couple dozen $$$ to buy keys to sell on the exchange to make energy credits to buy stuff that only the rich players ever seem to have to keep your ship up to date with what has become nothing more than a DPS race that worse all the time. When I first started playing this game, I got the sensation that it was a lot like Burger King: have it your way. Ther ewere so many different combinations and builds and setups that you could do and the 3 classes actually had roles and purpose in group play. My main character is an Engineer, as I always enjoyed popping turrets, mines, shield generators and being able to take one hell of a beating and tank like nobody else could. Now, it's just a DPS race in PvE (don;t even get me started on PvP, or anyone for that matter...) where it's all about how much pow you can put in and obviously the tactical class is now the only relevent one. The only builds people do are the ones that get them the most DPS, there is no longer and creativity, it's all just ""Aux to bat"" and ""beam boat"" escorts and such. What does it matter that you can take more damage when Borg cubes in STF's will hit you for 800k damage with their invisible torpedos? Or when tactical people can hit a button and make their weapons do 200% more damage than yours so they destroy everything fast, do the most damage, and as a result, get all the best loot. Loot. Any and all of the good loot is trapped in the ""upper class"". You can only get it if you have other high-value items to trade/sell, but first you need high-value items to trade/ sell that you can only get if you have, that's right. To ""break in"", you're going to need $$$, and that is the curx of the problem of this game (besides the bugs): Play to win. This game is probably by far the worst paramount example of it ever. It's a choice of either pay pr grind, especially with reputations, but at least that gives everyone a somewhat fairer chance to obtain half-decent gear. Upgrading your gear seemed like a good idea at the time, but like with many things in this game, it was implemented poorly, kind of like Obamacare. That brings me to the second big disappointment of this game: great ideas, poor implementation. If every new feature/release stopped being more about cash grab than it was about new content, then maybe this game could be more enjoyable. You know, what games are supposed to be like, instead of feeling like it's your second (or third) job. And GOd forbid you can't ""keep up"" and make a good dent in the previous grind before the next one comes out.Coming back to the concept of classes, which in my opinion are sadly obsolete, there was a time when each had a role to play and you needed a balance to successfully finish a mission. Now, there is very little true quality group play, unless you're in a fleet on teamspeak or some other voice chat like I was. There is very little strategy, planning, communication, teamwork, the list goes on. There's trolls galore in matches, or more often ""noobs"" that people just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at and then leave leaving you and the noob alone unable to finish the mission so you have to leave and take a 1 hour penalty all because people are too impatient and too rude and can't be bothered to communicate and show some of the newer players the ropes. The same goes for chat. On ESD or any other major hub, youask a question, and nobody answers or people just start flaming you for their enjoyment. The forums are practically worthless too, just a feeding ground for those with nothing better to do than rant about how bad Cryptic is rather than actually be constructive. It's like the old saying of giving a man a fish vs teaching him how to fish. Right now, people are just slapping people with the metaphorical fish. And that is the third and final sad face for me about this game: the lack of group play/teamwork/cooperation.I guess the real reason I kept coming back to this game was the hope that the next thing would make the game alright. As some others have said, ""the miracle that was never going to happen"". That, or because sometimes teaming up with the people from my fleet on the voice chat and doing runs could be a lot of fun and funny too. Finding a quality fleet can really make a huge difference. I was in the Phoenix Vanguard, and although I've been kicked since I haven't played this game in over 6 months, the people in that fleet are quality people who might be enough to get you to stay around despite all the bad this game has.People really seem to enjoy flaming Cryptic, but like current events, they do so without knowing all the facts. Here are some facts:STO was originally developed by Perpetual Entertainment from 2004 to 2008 till they went bankrupt. Even when the liscense went to Cryptic, they had to start from scratch with the code. They started in 2008 and finished in 2010. That is unprecedented to say the least to create not just a game, but an MMORPG in that amount of time. (Just for comparison, one of my favorite games Space Engineers has been in Alpha for over 2 years) Granted, it was buggy as hell and they immediately patch the heck out of it initially once it launched they just had to get it out the door. Since then, Cryptic went from Atari to ""Perfect"" World (get my drift) and the originaly people who were on the team have since been replaced more than once. The new people don't know how to fix the existing bugs cuase the code is proabaly such a mess it's near inmpossible. (as a side note, how many games do you know of that support 3 different versions of DirectX) But, as they have shown, they can create very good new content, especially once you get to the New Romulus story arc that continues on the Iconians got me hooked and I hope they keep it up. It seems to me that they are slowly trying to re-write the game over with code they do understand and hopefully that will come out on top, but that's not going to happen overnight...All in all, this game has (had?) the potential to be great. Maybe if someone else had made the game/takes over the game it can become what so many of us want it to be. Who knows, I'm going to college for Computer Science - Game Development and maybe someday in the future I'll have my own studio and be able to boldly go where no man has gone before and create the REAL Star Trek Online...Kirk out.

												Update: 7 February 2016;It's a fun game to play for a while, especially for fans of the series. There are plenty of different ships, including the main ships from each series;James T. Kirk's Constitution-class Cruiser,Jean-Luc Picard's Galaxy-class Cruiser,Benjamin Sisko's Defiant-class Escort,Kathryn Janeway's Intrepid-class Long-range Science Vessel,Jonathan Archer's NX-class Escort.You can also find some movie-specific ships in the game, such as the Excelsior-class.You could also go for a Klingon or Romulan Republic character, which opens up other ships and options, as well as unique story routes for these characters.Endgame is a lot of PvE/PvP grinding, but what MMO does not have that? STO at least offers a variety of ways in which one can 'grind'. Such as research and development, special missions for duty officers or admiralty ships, and a reputation system with its own special rewards.There is also room for daytrading on the exchange, although item prices seem regulated by a few dozen players who have large stocks of special items laying around on alt-characters and alt-accounts. Not too infrequently I have come across items which are no longer obtainable in the game, bought one or two to see if the price would rise, only to see five more of the same item put up on the marketplace within minutes, as if the sales triggered them to be posted.PvE missions are all doable with items obtainable through in-game currency, but if you are looking to do PvP, it is more of a pay-to-win situation. The more competitive ships require ZEN to buy them or items for them, and while you can trade Dilithium for ZEN, at a cost of 316:1 it's simply not worth it.The community is decent, and the new armada system allows fleets to work together more, so it's definitely worth looking at playing it with some friends.

												I've been trying to play this game on my Mac for the last week.  I can create a character, but when it loads into the actual game it crashes within 2 minutes, sometimes on the loading screen, sometimes while playing, completely locking up my computer and forcing me to hard reboot.  Unbelievably buggy.  I'd like to try to play it, but it isn't worth it for the frustration.  Deleting now.			"

Haven't tried xbox controller yet, but controls are prolly better with it!  Decent mmo, about runescape level maybe, fun-wise, but with less options and no annoying ""lose your items when you die"".  Gotta go thru a third party program to play it, and gotta sign in with them as well as Steam, and the DL is 14 GIGABYTES... giga BITE me!  *grumbles*  Buuut.... totally worth it!			"

												The galaxy's premier Starfleet combat simulator with a side of ""Everyone loses to a Romulan Tactical officer in a Scimitar"" gameplay. Dont bother playing if you're a fan of Klingons, the lead dev is openly opposed to klingons as player characters and only begrudgingly makes new Klingon related content. Oh, especially if you like Klingon Birds of Prey, they've been blacklisted for new releases until at least 2016, per a Cryptic forum Supermod.EDITED IN JUNE 26th 2015: Dev team has become more willing to create quality Klingon-themed content as part of the ongoing war against the Iconians. It makes sense, as we are the greatest warriors in the Beta Quadrant.Still, there arent really a hell of a lot of alternatives. SWG, and even SWGEmu, are all but dead. SW:tOR is a crap fest with on rails space combat. EVE Online takes years to really get anywhere, and months to build any ship you'd actually want. Star Citizen is going to be the next great vaporware of our time. No real alternatives, so enjoy the new pilot ships.			"

Subscribing is not an option, the game does not reward you adequatelly for being one. The game depends on ""whales"" to make its profit and that works.+It's space combat and space battles are very cool. +The game's universe is well made.+Some story missions are well made.-The Voyager related story missions suck.-Neelix.-Ground combat sucks.-Too much fanservice.-Terrible Microtransactions.

												Do I reccomend this game?Lemme answer that with a question. Is the Pope a Catholic?I absolutely love this game. I mean, the graphics could use a tad bit of an overhaul, but other than that, it is absolutely amazing.Farming for levels to pass through the main storyline? Tch, forget that. Instead, they give you a whole freaking squad to support you in your endeavours, and each mission is specifically designed to level you up, so you need not worry too much about advancing levels. There are special ships, but they're not available straight off the bat, even with purchases, the ships and weapons are restricted by level, as are equipment and such, ensuring an almost always fair game (There are exceptions, but that's just because the other guy has a good weapon combo, not because they're OP.), and in group events, everyone gets a cut of the experience (Some less than others, either because the majority are high levels, or vice versa). You'll be so addicted to the storyline that you'll have a threatening dreanought before you know it!The storyline itself... It's just so addicting, anyone who's watched a Star Trek movie will feel like they're in one. You'll rise among the ranks relatively quickly, and getting through the main campaign is in no way a grind. There's always something new and interesting to it, and by the time you're done, you'll be begging for more. I've never experienced a more exhilirating storyline. If anyone, these guys should be getting all the money. They've made a game that's just in no way a bad game for those who dont wanna pay. So give them your money instead of wasting it on P2W games.

If you love star trek and are looking for a decent narrative and pretty solid star trek naval combat, this will probably be worth the download. Endgame grinding is rediculous, endgame as a whole is very subpar so dont get your hopes up. Good single player expirence considering its free. Recommended for any true star trek fan.			"

												So much has changed. So much gets updated on a daily shedule. I first subscribed on August 29th 2010 and this game has always given me reason to come back. I have a lot of the ships I've always wanted at an endgame level. I can collect ships, Pets, Costumes, Ground Weapons, Traits and be a badass as much as I want. I support this game through buying stuff from their C-Store and by paying a monthly subscription. I always have gotten my money's worth with whatever it is that I buy because I have over 16 characters on my account for Star Trek Online.			"

												I think this game has potential, but I find it to be just too hard. The Klingon ""Space Chase"" quest just seems to be impossible to beat and I cannot abandon the quest and therefore am stuck. There are a lot of buttons to push and the game is very twitchy and requires fast reflexes, ect. It isn't customizeable and the game quickly became not so much fun anymore. For the young bucks out there who can mash buttons with the best of them this game may hold your interest, but I am either too old to appreciate a steep learning curve or too impatient to bother with a game that seems imbalanced...

If you buy equipment that another £20, Just to have to spend a further £20 on a new ship in 5 levels.Unless you have a LOT more money then sense dont bother. If things were cheaper then maybe. But i can't abide paying £15 for a ship that i'd have to replace with 6 hours of grinding with another £20.			"

												Alright, I'll admit I downloaded this game because I love everything Star Trek. But I've hardly been able to play it because I'd play for an hour or two, then come back to it a month or so later and have to download a patch for it that (literally) took more than 24 hours to load. By then I decided to delete and redownload the game, which didn't help either. It still wanted a 87,000 megabyte patch. So here I am like the Star Trek addicted baby I am, writing this, and waiting for the fifth time for this pach to load. I now have 300 megabytes of the 87,000. Yay. Not a happy camper.			"

												Personally i love STO. I've played from the start and keep coming back. That said it may not be for everyone, if you're a trekkie then this gives fans the chance to play as a starfleet officer or as a part of the klingon empire. The stories link in to TOS, TNG, DS9, voyager and enterprise in a fair few places so thats got a lot of apeal for me. If you're not a fan of the franchise then this is still a pretty solid SCI-FI game, fly through space completing missions or on the ground on one of the many planets.For me its a 5 star.			"

												The space combat really has nothing to which it may be compared and is tremendously fun before endgame (when it starts to suffer from feature creep in a big way). Story content is very nostalgic for Trek fans, and while the game is aging and shows it in several ways, the newer content is better constructed with fewer interrupting cut-scenes and more voiced dialogue that plays *while* you play instead of in pop-up dialogue windows or in cut-scenes. Overall, this game is definitely worth checking out.The free-to-play aspects are well done too. You can throw a little money at the game for conveniences and aesthetics until you reach endgame. At that point, you can either spend $20-30 on a T6 ship or spend a large amount of time farming dilithium (a time-gated resource) to exchange with other users for the paid currency to purchase an endgame ship. If you really love the game, then you will have to spend more and more on these things. Having said that, to get to the deep end of the endgame pool with the best ship builds is going to cost some real-world money or deman an epic commitment of time to grind, so there is a point where they start making the game for ""whales""; however, this is only for ""elite"" PvE queues as you can do the ""Normal"" queues with a free t5 ship and the ""Advanced"" queues with any t6 ship. So this game can actually be completely F2P and be fun and rewarding. They enticed me to pay a little bit, but not to go full Orca. YMMV.			"

												Alright, I'll admit I downloaded this game because I love everything Star Trek. But I've hardly been able to play it because I'd play for an hour or two, then come back to it a month or so later and have to download a patch for it that (literally) took more than 24 hours to load. By then I decided to delete and redownload the game, which didn't help either. It still wanted a 87,000 megabyte patch. So here I am like the Star Trek addicted baby I am, writing this, and waiting for the fifth time for this pach to load. I now have 300 megabytes of the 87,000. Yay. Not a happy camper.			"

												Ok this game is just awesomeness. Still some minor bugs to work out but the amount of content will keep you entertained for a long time. Progression system works well and you have real incentive to keep leveling your charactor. Seemlessly flows between third person shooter type gameplay to its space-ship centerd battles. Mechanics work well. Only issue I have is that sometimes my keyboard glitches out and I get stuck running left or right and have to mash keys to fix it but dont let that keep you from exporing this very deep Star Trek themed universe. Lots of fun to be had here.			"

												Okay, it is Star Trek and anything to do with Star Trek is almost always enough for me, so I am clearly biased. I love it. I love the modifiability of your characters and ships. I love how the developers are trying to keep the minimum requirements as low as possible so poor folk can keep playing using the old computers that were often handed down to us from friends or family members. I love the way it all links together through the ongoing storyline. You can play your way, and you can play for free. It may take a bit longer to make it through the ranks and acquire new ships but you can. I have made it all the way to Vice Admiral and have not had to spend a penny....			"

												I am a HUGE Star Trek fan. I've seen every episode of every Star Trek series at least once (including The Animated Series).

As an MMORPG this game does a really nice job of instilling those standards onto you, while keeping up with MMORPG standards. Is it completely Star Trek?

												Probably the only truly free MMO that you can play all the way through without buying anything.  If you're a Star Trek fan, this is as close to the perfect game as you're going to get.  Obviously the MMO conventions still apply, and you can buy some things if you want (better ships, more storage, etc), but none are required to hit max level and play the story to its current conclusion.

												As a long time Trekkie having seen evey episode and movie made to date I feel comfortable saying this is the truest game to what Star Trek is that ive seen let alone had the privelage to play. I have reccomended this game to all of my friends and even the ones who liked neither MMO's nor Star Trek still enjoyed it. The story is the best most intricately woven storyline of any game even more detailed than some actual Star Trek story arcs. The gamepay particularly space combat is well designed and the ground missions feel exactly like a good MMO should. The game is by no means pay to win (even though i have donated over $200) any content that cannot be directly obtained by free players is either available for free during twice yearly giveaways or can be earned through grinding (minor grinding by mmo standards).I felt that with 1000 hours of STO on steam and another 500 on the second launcher, ARC that it was time to pass on my experience to others.In short: if you like Star Trek even a little bit then try the game and if you like MMO's even a little try the game. Hey, maybe it will convince you to get into the other more. Star Trek is fabulous sci-fi and MMO is the best gerere of gameP.S. For anyone who does want to watch Star Trek i reccomend the following watch order: Star Trek: The Next Generation -> Star Trek: Deep Space Nine -> Star Trek: Voyager -> Star Trek: Enterprise -> Star Trek: The Original Series -> Star Trek movies in order 1-10 followed by the new alternate reality Star Trek movies starring Chris Pine.

I'm sickened I didnt get in on earlier versions, I wouldnt mind terrible graphics if the story was interesting but alas I never got the chance.so if your working off a bad computer like I was dont get your hopes up.

												Star Trek online is essentially a single player game with a chat box that will kick you if you are afk for too long. Its NPC opponents are designed to be adjusted to your player level, so that they can be overpowered regardless of the output of your weapons and sheilds, and full enjoyment of the game is unattainable unless you spend money. You will find on the bright side that STO is an exellent opportunity to nerd out and live your life through your avatar counter part given that alot of the purchasable items exist solely for the pupose of customizing and showng off your account, but that's just it! The best part of the game is everything that isn't a mission. Evey mission gives you a level, every 10 levels, you rank up, becoming significantly stronger at the exact same rate as the enemy. the only discernable pupose of this linear increase in point values is to force the periodic upgrading of equipment and to discourage PvP gameplay by enforcing an insurmountable lack of balance.

												I have been with this game since the beginning, day 1 of launch and have been with it through the ups and the downs.  There was a glimmer of hope for this game for a while there but then catastrophy happened and now this game is nothing more than a buffet for the wallet warriors.  About every two weeks they release some new lockbox or some new series of ships and demand prices upwards of 35$ to 100$ + if you want the ""bundle"".  Days of when ships were around five to ten dollars are long gone.  The game is also plagued with extreme server instability, rubber banding and random disconnects.  Your chat is filled with vile in the form of chinese farmers demanding you pay them irl money for in game currency and theres no stopping them.Anyone who has loved Star Trek and has grown up playing games like Star Trek Starfleet Command or Klingon Acadamy, or even Bridge Commander....Do yourself and your wallet a favor and stay far away from this game.  Its nothing more than a korean grindfest MMO painted over with something that resembles but isnt Star Trek.			"

												Probably the only truly free MMO that you can play all the way through without buying anything.  If you're a Star Trek fan, this is as close to the perfect game as you're going to get.  Obviously the MMO conventions still apply, and you can buy some things if you want (better ships, more storage, etc), but none are required to hit max level and play the story to its current conclusion.

												I am a HUGE Star Trek fan. I've seen every episode of every Star Trek series at least once (including The Animated Series). Star Trek will likely remain my favorite series from here until the end of time. Everything about the franchise invites exploration, friendship, adventure, action, and ethical responsibility. As an MMORPG this game does a really nice job of instilling those standards onto you, while keeping up with MMORPG standards. Is it completely Star Trek? No, of course not, but it's the best game to instill my dreams of being a Starship captain exploring space on my very own starship. It wouldn't be fun if it was totally Star Trek, and I'm not contesting that. In fact, the MMORPG aspects of that make the game more fun than if I was actually sitting in the Captain's chair making life-or-death decisions.""But PsionicPhazon, it sounds like you love the game. Why did you give it a thumbs down?"" you might be asking. I will tell you why:I am not allowed to play Star Trek Online because of my region. I live in Taiwan, and since it's affiliated with China they want nothing to do with it for no other reason than PWE doesn't want us to play it. It sucks, too, because I was really getting into it before they banned me a while ago for existing in another country, even though in the past I have played it here. It is for this sole reason that I do not recommend it. Anyone living in Asia is not allowed to play Star Trek Online, and in certain other regions of the world. I can't even log into PWE's ARC website to make a complaint or even activate a code that was given to me by the company (their way of saying Haha ♥♥♥♥ you). For a game set in a world where the heriones of the franchise value togetherness, diplomacy, and peace; they are doing everything they can to do the exact opposite of that. Call me butthurt, but the very thought that this game can't be available all over the world is the antithesis of what Star Trek is about. I will give it a full thumbs up when the region locks are lifted.			"

												I never got to play it, and for this reason hated it. I was really exited to play, tried installing it on my (extremly weak computer) and it just kept crashing after the 2 hours it took to upload the over 20gb of data. so I tried to load it on my nephew much better gaming laptop, but gave up half way throught the 9gb patch upload because of the reviews I read, also the gateway for character creation wouldnt work. I'm sickened I didnt get in on earlier versions, I wouldnt mind terrible graphics if the story was interesting but alas I never got the chance.so if your working off a bad computer like I was dont get your hopes up.

												Star Trek online is essentially a single player game with a chat box that will kick you if you are afk for too long. Its NPC opponents are designed to be adjusted to your player level, so that they can be overpowered regardless of the output of your weapons and sheilds, and full enjoyment of the game is unattainable unless you spend money. You will find on the bright side that STO is an exellent opportunity to nerd out and live your life through your avatar counter part given that alot of the purchasable items exist solely for the pupose of customizing and showng off your account, but that's just it! The best part of the game is everything that isn't a mission. Evey mission gives you a level, every 10 levels, you rank up, becoming significantly stronger at the exact same rate as the enemy. the only discernable pupose of this linear increase in point values is to force the periodic upgrading of equipment and to discourage PvP gameplay by enforcing an insurmountable lack of balance.

												It's star trek alright, maybe not as good as the next generation, but it sure is star trek, or atleast a very amazing take on it.The story is okay, it's nothing like the television series, but the combat and the choices and dialogue and exploration and combat and combat and anything you'd want from a star trek fan.I'd also recommend this to any sci-fi fan aswell, since it's not fully star trek, it's like if it were a new series or something.

												I first got this game on preorder back in the day and was so excited to finaly play startrek that i am so in love with , but after launch going live i started getting graphicle glitches and lag BAD lag and i thought sigh..here we go. Anyway after 2 months along came the CRASH. OMG i thought and i had to keep force reseting the pc as i couldnt get back to desktop. After 6 months i gave up and put the game in the alcive section amongst a few other titles that are useless to run...So NOW after nearly 6 years and also taken over by perfect world with loads of improvemants so they claim to not only the client but gameplay as well like graphics ect ect you know where im going so i will stop there. i decided ok lets give it another go. Loaded up viea steam now loged in onto my acount and started a fresh charector as i knew through all the changes i would be at a loss so a fresh char would be great to have a fresh begining. And OMG OMG O M G. After a few min of just being in the tutorial my screen was filled with graphicle shap glitches like triangle and all sorts of shade fanomina artifacts it was that bad i couldnt see wtf was going on, so i gave it a little love and made sure directx was all upto date ect ect ect and finaly yes managed to resolve that problem so i thought ok np being an old game and me haveing a new powerfull pc this was expected so a little tweeking solved it. off i when again still in tutorial and after 3 min BOOM!  complete crash, the who thing just froze and i couldnt even get to desktop so a force RESET on pc to reboot. this didnt change after 3 hour trying to play the dam game. this means uninstalling and reinstall 2 times to make sure everything was upto date ect. I finaly gave up. The moral of this story about my experiance with STO is NOTHING and i mean NOTHING has changed since 2010 as far as stability of the game. So with that said i can only say DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME even playing it. Think of it this way, If after 6 years they cant even sort out the main problems like crashes ect you ant gona get anything resolved even by contacting support for a solution DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME. I do not recomend this game to anyone. it lags bad, players have random graphicle glitches it crashes all the time and i mean ALL THE TIME.Anyway i thought i would just write a review about this game as i started it from beta and can asure you that the only thing that has changed is the content added and graphics but come on lol what does it matter if you cant enjoy the dam game or even play it. have fun all i wish you all the best			"

												Before I begin, I would like to say I really wish there was a third ""meh"" option.  This game isn't, overrall awful, but it isn't great, or even good.  I would say, it's...decent.  Not great.  Not awful.  Just..decent.  And this is MY OPINION, and this is MY review.  So..please no hate.  I have played at least 200 hours off of Steam on PWE's main browser of Arc, and an extra (as of this) 900+ hours.  With that out of the way, are you sufficiently informed?  Yes?  Let's get down to it, then.NOTE:  THIS IS JUST AFTER THE AGENTS OF YESTERDAY EXPANSION!  NOTE 2: SPOILERS TO TUTORIAL, AND SOME MINOR MISSIONS!1:The StoryOkay, okay, hear me out.  To many people, even some of my friends, the story is the selling point of the game.  If the game were its own thing, and not a Star Trek MMO, then I would accept it.  But, since it is, I will treat it as such.1a.  My first main problem is that the story never has a ""pacifist route,"" or a diplomatic alternative.  And, yes, I know some people like action, but, people like me like making a compromise with my virtual enemy.  Get to the root of what their issue is, and make decisions.  If that doesn't work because of your decisions, then it can escalate to violence.  That’s only my issue with it, and most of my (few) eligible friends to know about it agree.1b. The second problem I have with this is the ladder that you climb.  In STO, with every 10 levels (or in Admiralty’s case, every 5 levels) you get a new rank, until 45, a new ship, maybe a skill or a bridge officer, but not much else.  The only difference in a promotion to Captain and Lt. Commander, is that the Captain ships are more recognizable, as they have been used in the shows.  So, why is this a big deal?  In case you didn’t deduct it from my list of ships, you have a ship at Lt. Commander.  Not only that, you command the ship at Lieutenant, even as a bloody cadet, in the tutorial!  If the Captain’s Chair was something you gained at, I don’t know, Captain, I’d be more accepting of the new ship.  But, it isn’t.  The reason is pretty sloppy, too.  You led one other cadet and yourself to fight some Borg, with the help of a trained Starfleet officer.  You held onto the ship for a few minutes before reinforcements came.  Because of those things, you’re given a ship, but..not the rank?  So, yes, you will probably find people that outrank you but are in lower positions than you, especially early on.  And, because you’re captain, as a Lieutenant, the ENTIRE ship is run by ensigns, so they don’t outrank you.1c.  This game focuses on the wrong thing.  When someone tells you Star Trek, does “war” come up so heavily?  And, while this was brilliantly touched on in Star Trek Into Darkness, Starfleet is, by nature, an exploration organization.  As of the writing of this review, there isn’t exploration in this game.  There was, in the form of going into clusters or nebulae and finding new planets.  This also tied into the Diplomatic Corps., where you might do some missions for them here.  But, no.  Cryptic decided to remove that little feature that even hinted at something other than action.  In summary of what I said, no exploration in this game, and there are way too many fronts against the Federation for the Federation not to fall, let alone the Klingon Empire, that faction should have a civil war story arc.  But, for the action lover, surely there’s opportunity here?  No.  Not really.  The missions feel more like you’re James Bond in a slightly elevated Cold War.  Why do I say this?  There aren’t any real battles you’re fighting in.  Well, to be fair, there are a few battles.  There’s an invasion of a city to topple a falling government, there’s a space battle with ~40 different ships to take down a Klingon house, there’s another space battle with about the same amount of ships above Mars.  But, overall, there isn’t much going on in the supposed war.  In the Federation storyline (I keep mentioning this one, because it’s clear this was intended to be the one you choose) the first story arc is about the Klingon War, but..the most they do is set up a spy network, or try to stop an Undine.  To me, this is a failing point to a Star Trek game.  Maybe this would work in a franchise of its own, but as a Star Trek game, it absolutely fails.  The only thing remotely Star Trek is the Next Gen episode titlescreen UI at the beginning of every mission.1d.  I'm going to be brief here, because this section is too long already.  But, the enemies are dull, and forgettable.  Of course, not ALL are forgettable, but most of them are.  The factions seem the same.  There doesn't really seem to be any motive besides ""power hungry,"" or ""I hate the Federation.""2: GameplayThere..isn't really much to say here.  It's basically..an MMO.  Nothing special about it.  Again, if it were its own franchise, or its own sci-fi thing, it probably would pass for the story, and maybe the gameplay, but it doesn't fit Star Trek's exploration themes.  Yeah, deep space is dangerous, but there is no real exploration done in the danger of the game, until MUCH, MUCH later in the game, and it has already lost all seriousness, or ties to reality.  Even THEN, not really exploring.  There is an expansion solely based on the Delta Quadrent, and it's the same formula from the rest of the game just in a slightly different environment.  Continuing on what I said in 1d, the enemies seem the same, just slightly stronger as you 'progress' through the game.  There isn't really a strategy against them.  You can literally do the same thing you did against the first enemy and the last enemy.  3: The MissionsI did reference these in the story section, but I thought I should touch on it here.  There are some really great missions in this game, I really have to admit.  But, most of the ones I really, truly enjoy are in the same arc, and it's really too far before the end, and too far after the start for it to be worth stomaching the Klingon Cold War.  The environments for some of these missions are incredible, as well, even if the missions are awful.  There are some really creepy ones, and, in some cases, it really benefits the mission, and in others, it just makes you dread doing the mission.  For the former, there's Mind Games in the Romulan storyline, where you're captured and brainwashed.  For the latter, there's What Lies Beneath, in all three playable storylines.  Overall, there are some diamonds in the rough, but these diamonds really shine.  I really love some of these missions, and I just wish they could've done more with them.  I don't love them because they're the ""least bad,"" but they're the best of the bunch.4: The Expansions.Anybody who has played this game from the early PWE days knows what I'm talking about.  There are a few expansions in the game, most recently the Agents of Yesterday expansion, that really don't help the game in any way.  In some cases, it really hinders on the base game story.  In one expansion, it took one mission from the early game, sprinkled a few more Undine, and made a whole storyline out of a conspiracy that ""The Undine did it the whole time!!""  Whenever there's a really superior species, it seems like in the early 25th century instead of just..using their technology to..y'know..invade the weaklings, they feel better just orchestrating some others to fight.There are some updates that do benefit the game, though.  But, the review must end.Overall, the game is okay as a standalone game, but it isn't good as a Star Trek game.  To put my conscience at ease, I shouldn't recommend this game to anyone.  I only play this still to be with friends.			"

												By far one of my top 10 favrioute games probably about 5.Its a great game in its self if you can get past some of the little bugs... like getting stuck on a cactus (but thats a different story) there is a great deal of customization and plenty of helpful players and if you are an MMO player you will be happy to know there are little to no gold spammers.Yes people are right it does keep ""hinting"" you should micro transact this or that and that money never seems to go towards server managment, you can subscribe but it is generaly greater than most other MMO's.Overall a great game.P.S. If you do decide to micro-transact (i recomend you do at some points) only buy:End Game ships (level 45-50) usually about $20-$25If you want to pick up a level 1-9 or a 10-19 ships they cost $5-$10And for roleplay options and shnaziness perhaps buy a costume/uniform or 2(Just dont go crazy, i spent $90 in a month :/, i feel ashamed for it)			"

												One of my favorite games. It keeps a great balance of being both loyal to the original shows, while keeping the content original and fun. It runs well on almost any hardware, battles are fun, ships look great, and new content is added fairly often in each season. My only real problem with it is the fact that there are like 10 different currencies you have to keep up with. Other than that, I definitely recommend STO.			"

												A space MMO for fans and strangers to Star Trek alike, become the pilot of your own ship and explore a massive galaxy.I played this game for a little over a year when it first became F2P outside of Steam and then shelved it, but recently I have decided to make a new character and play through Steam to see what's new in the trek.Lots of character customization, tons of ships and equipment.. can become a bit grindy, but always events and daily tasks to keep you busy. Player made missions that can be very fun and free DLC 'Delta Rising' that adds lots of new content and missions.			"

												It's not bad. Seems like a lot of work has been done to improve the quality of the missions lately, and it's made for a much nicer experience. Good visuals, though there are a few scaling issues with the sets and environments. Great character customization. Excellent music and sound effects.Unfortunately it's completely broken on OS X and won't launch, throwing an exception instead of functioning. I'm honestly starting to wonder something very strange. There's a Macintosh version of this, and Steam properly installed the OS X version of the launcher, but ah...... The only version showing in Steam is the Windows version. Did something patently absurd occur, and Steam installed the Mac version of the launcher but then the launcher downloaded the Windows version of the game? I was really hoping not to have to reboot to Windows to play STO, but that doesn't seem to be an option if it's not going to install a functioning game.			"

												I was never a big Star Trek fan. To be honest I still have trouble completely understanding. I saw the two latest movies...never got into any of the old shows or movies but I'm slowly becoming a fan. This game downloads fast and is really in depth. Loading time is almost always fast, graphics are great and the community has NEVER been mean. Both characters I made (one I made long ago and quit because I just didn't understand the game much with the lack of a good tutorial) got into a guild really fast; and all the guild members did their best to help. Now that the tutorial is better done I'm enjoying it so much more. Pros: StoryGraphicsCommunityLoadingSpace/ground combatNot P2W (as far as I know so far with all my experience)Name can be remade once for free, ship customization can be mostly done with in game currency as well as character customizationYou can choose to hide your 'show weapons/utility belt' for free (yeah it's a pro because most game devs are shallow and you need to pay for it)Cons:It's one giant server making it unstable at times: crashes/lagsA very annoying random mix of voice acting and just text reading (just stick to one already!)

												I will preface this review by saying that it's a nice way to unwind after a rough day because of the uniquiness of going from space to ground combat and back. So take my own experience with a bit of salt (although not an entire shaker-full).I am really on the fence about recommending this game. I played it through the Arc client for days and days and days. You start up as a cadet and then grind your way through space on repetitive missions until you reach the maximum level. The nice part is that you get a free ship for every major rank you achieve, the unfortunate part is that the stock ships are pretty much worthless. To remedy this, you can purchase a new ship for Zen which is purchased with your hard-earned money, you can spend days and days grinding up dilithium to buy a fancy ship, or you can hope that your fleet (guild) has some in storage that you can pilfer (sometimes these actually sell for a decent amount on the exchange).Then you realize that even with your new ship, you can't even come close to competing with the other players because you need epic equipment, which is mostly an RNG game wherein you end up spending tons of dilitium, energy credits, and time to find out that you created the exact same, worthless ultra-rare [Crtd] [Acc]x2 antiproton array that you just created 500 times previously.Long story short, this game is all about the grind. If you love grinding, grinding, and more grinding: this is the game for you. If you are like me though, you'll play this game until you realize that to compete you'll have to mortgage your house, sell your car, and maybe a kidney- and that might not be enough.			"

												One thing I haven't seen in the reviews is the foundry. Bascally it's a in-game mission editor, all players can use. There are some missions with better story than some of main ones. (check out Putrity or Photonomy series)anyway...PROS: A whole lot of starships to chose from The foundry (player made missions) Amazinngly big space Space combat Very high customizability of ship and character builds Ability to farm premium moneyCONS: High prices of some end-game ships & items lack of a proper exploration system (there was one but got removed) After about 100h gets repetable AACOB (An Absolute C*&%$#& Of Bugs; there is an ingame bug-tracker+game is constantly getting fixes, still there are a lot of bugs) Poor customer support some story missions are really old "

												aspiring members of starfleet should probably play this because it's the only good star trek experience so far this decade. progression to max level is kinda fun as a single-player or (recommended) 2 person coop game. space combat is super ez but that's a part of its appeal, because it doesn't really ever get old seeing dozens of beams and torpedoes blasting back and forth on your screen while you use the chat to roleplay every second of it to your group -- ""SHIELDS 80% AND HOLDING. IMPULSE DOWN TO HALF. LIEUTENANT, ROUTE ALL POWER TO FORWARD PHASER ARRAYS AND PREPARE TO TARGET THEIR ENGINES.""heck yea star trek rulz!!!			"

The only money is for microtransactions for outfits, ships, guns etc, but I've never bought any of that.  The core game is great!  Fly through space, spec your ship, spec your crew, get into battles, and enjoy a quite good story within the seasons.  Not on par with other Star Trek games like Elite Force for instance, but worth a look at the very least.			"

I downloaded it and I still play it to this day. It's been out for 4 years. The game is better for Space Stuff and ground could use ALOT of work. But I still like it. In my opinion it is WAY better than World of Warcraft. World of Warcraft free addition you can only level up to 20. In this free game yo lvl up to 50. And thats the max lvl. Again, thegame could use some work but I like it.			"

												After 250 hours or so the game just turned into a grind-fest. The story was fun to play through in the beginning, but it gradually devolved to the same types of missions, involving the same types of quests. The regular events were okay, but only if you upgragded your ship to the hilt (which of course requires signficant invest of either real money, or real-time gridning). The strength of this game is the space combat, and I will admit I'm sometimes tempted to fire up the game just to take part in some space battles. There's multiple classes to choose from, and a wide variety of ships to utilize (some free, some paid), and you can also upgrade your ship with a variety of devices (new weapons, shields, engines etc.).But the ground combat - ugh. It looks bad, plays bad, and is buggy too. It really weighs the game down in places, and I found myself dreading beaming down during missions. I hardly played the event ground missions because they were resoundingly terrible, and the ground fetch quests? I cringe just thinking about them.I can't really recommend this game in good faith. Will you have fun with it? Maybe, but it will also frustrate you to no end.  "

Really Cryptic Studios/ Perfect World Entertainment what did you guys do to this game, and before anyone says anything my system hasn't changed it is still the same pc, and of course with updates. I'd like to play this game again, specially since I have actual cash invested in it, so for right now I wouldn't recommend this game.			"

												I was never a big Star Trek fan. To be honest I still have trouble completely understanding. I saw the two latest movies...never got into any of the old shows or movies but I'm slowly becoming a fan. This game downloads fast and is really in depth. Loading time is almost always fast, graphics are great and the community has NEVER been mean. Both characters I made (one I made long ago and quit because I just didn't understand the game much with the lack of a good tutorial) got into a guild really fast; and all the guild members did their best to help. Now that the tutorial is better done I'm enjoying it so much more. Pros: StoryGraphicsCommunityLoadingSpace/ground combatNot P2W (as far as I know so far with all my experience)Name can be remade once for free, ship customization can be mostly done with in game currency as well as character customizationYou can choose to hide your 'show weapons/utility belt' for free (yeah it's a pro because most game devs are shallow and you need to pay for it)Cons:It's one giant server making it unstable at times: crashes/lagsA very annoying random mix of voice acting and just text reading (just stick to one already!)

												I have played this game on and off on this and another account. Play this game is not a good experience. The graphics somehow make me dizzy and extremely nausiated after play for 2 hours, never seen anything like it. A very buggy game, very frustrating when character stuck at some hole on the ground and cannot get out (also worsen the nausia). The space combat system REALLY SUCKS. It is not what imagined for a sci-fi spaceship fight, more like world of tanks in space. Quest are boring, go to space coordinant, shoot enemy, beam down party, explore maze, phasor shoot enemy on the way, beam back to ship, fight more enemy, leave system and get reward. Does not have any spirit of startrek and heard a lot complain on its OP gold player so, do not even download, it download a lot of patch along the way.			"

												Huh.So, I've never been a real Star Trek fan. I came from Star Wars. But This game and the series surrounding it seemed fun, so I gave it a go. Truthfully, I don't recommend this game to anybody who wants adventure, going where no man has gone before, et cetera. This game just doesn't have that. If you get this game, it should only be if you want to mess around on a few of the small planet maps, or if you want to just get some free roam in, though again, the maps are tiny. Just don't spend money. "

												As of last year during one huge update, all AI coding was released from pathing constraints and many other restrictions put on them. Just facing down one keldon (if you ever happen to find one) on elite difficulty is a tough battle for any engineer in a normal cruiser. AI (npc) ships are or were capable of doing anything a player ship can do, aside from cloaking, pathing used to be enemy ships moving in a straight line only firing back at players in the line of fire arcs, now enemies react follow, even boost and use abilities they never used before. Enemies are not fitted with better equipment, but hopefully one day they will be.Ground npcs are still mostly the same, there were always pathing issues in ground instances where corridors are involved, so making them able to do whatever they want would cause even more chaos. Basically npcs on the ground instances can do things a player can't do, like fit through impossibly tight gaps between a door and blocking shield eventually.The visuals on the game can be adjusted to suit almost every gaming computer on the planet!! those with lower end can turn down shadows and particle settings and turn all other things up to get the most beauty out of the game, those with high end systems can simply turn up everything and see the heavens during a full warzone, good luck with your random crash depending on how it goes ^^i recommend this to anyone looking for npc's that are not completely locked down by code, they have more free will than defiance and firefall npcs put together.please do list any other games apart from champions online that have unlocked AI if anyone replies to this. :)oh and i mention champions online only because npcs in the game have full amazing control of their actions when they are broken.the future is superior			"

Really Cryptic Studios/ Perfect World Entertainment what did you guys do to this game, and before anyone says anything my system hasn't changed it is still the same pc, and of course with updates.

												If you like Star Trek and want to play a F2P game, this is a decent start to enjoy the story line/campaign. The universe is as real as it gets, you get most of all the iconic ships that the ST franchise ever designed and the alien worlds feel different from one another.So when it comes to just enjoying face-to-face what Star Trek feels like besides the scenes from the movies and series, this is a must play.However it completely goes over the top when it comes to end game like in any MMORPG...way too much fantasy stuff and made up stuff that is overly expensive to be enjoyable.Enjoy it as a F2P where you can explore the Star Trek universe, but be prepared to get lost when you start putting money into this game.

												This game when my friend bugged me enough to play it turns out it was great. Space combat was cool and fun as was the ground based combat the foundry means players can create their own stories but everyone will pick you up because you missed one letter out of one word (e.g. Dager = dagger). The episodes are great but I find them to be a bit dull at times so I went to a star cluster and explored unknown systems.Now there is no exploring the game has gone past its golden days and alot like the COD francise you will either love it or hate it. If you like star trek or sci-fi then yeah your going to like it but its best days are gone in my opinion.			"

												I mean, ignore the fact I recommended it, as I'm kinda neutral on the game. For one thing, the developers can make some decent content. On the other side of that, you have to pay for most of that content. Oh, you got a lockbox? PAY TO OPEN IT! Oh, you want a really nice ship? PAY! You want to start a fleet with friends? PAY! You want anything other than the five or six base options for customization and ship choices? PAAAAAAY! However, the story, while disjointed and strange, can be fairly enjoyable at times.			"

												Star Trek Online. This game is extremely basic, theres not much here other than the Star Trek feel, which soon goes after a few hours of playtime. I have been trying to get into this game over and over with no avail, its too boring. The ship desings and mechanics are sound, They're fun to play for a few hours every now and then, but by god dont get me started on the ground combat. I have never in my life played a game so clunky and weird, the animations are basic at best, some just seem so out of place it adds to the clunky movement and constant animation cancelling. Annnnd thats the game folks, nothing else to mention really, Raids and such are a joke, and no one plays them, you would be in a queue for hours on end looking for 3 people. Im not sure there is even a story here, Much like the TV shows, it's individual missions with the odd big missions with a story, then its completely forgotten till you find another. Voice acting in some parts and none existant in others, you would be best off just turning off the sound and listening to music while doing this grind of a game, actually, dont even pay attention to the missions either, because you soon get lost in what you're doing, even while paying attention.Now, what I did like about the games was the nice little tutorial stories each faction has, it realy feels like you're a member of the Klingon Empire, the Romulan Empire and even the Federation, who of which were the most enjoyable with the whole Borg element. But like I said, all the problems the game has, this feeling soon wears off. It is just a bad game, and the playerbase supports this, the game is pretty dead.			"

												TL;DR: DONT PLAY THIS UNLESS YOU LOVE STAR TREK AND HAVE A FRIEND TO PLAY IT WITH YOU, 4/10Now, I've played this game a lot. In the begining, it was fun, with the 2 main segments, Ground and Starship, allowing for the game to change what you do, so as to not get bored. But after this initial euphoria, I sadly have to admit, the game is mind-numbingly boring. Every mission has the same basic structure; Warp in, alternate between space and ground combat, then warp out again. It becomes a grind during the mid-game, and dispite attempts to make you solve puzzles or resolve issues, it becomes a mashing ""F"" contest, as you don't have to do anything other than that 99% of the time. On the rare occasion a genuine puzzle comes along, its solution is either highlighted in a text box, or told to you when you begin. And then the cash-grabbery. I would overlook moderate cash-grabbing in a F2P game; servers are not free, but the preposterous extent of the cash-grabbing in this game is unforgivable. You are capped at 10.000.000 Credits, unless you buy an upgrade. This would be fine, were it not for the fact that the majority of good late-game equipment costs much more than this. The vast majority of ships are locked behind their own paywalls, as are the more iconic outfits, such as the TOS uniforms, just to ring every possible penny out of the playerbase. However, worst of all is that the best, endgame ships are in lockboxes, which you have to buy keys for. But with these ships having an ~0.4% droprate from these crates, to get them you must either waste far too much money, or be very lucky. This guts the endgame, as if you dont pay into the system, you become obselete. Even at endgame the missions are boring and repetitive. Don't play this alone, get a friend who owes you a favour to go through it with you. Its comunity made missions can be fun, but the creator for theses missions is difficult at best. As a Star Trek fan, I have to honestly give it 4/10, as much as it pains me and my 11 days of playtime to do so.			"

												EDIT: I've been playing now for a month or so and have a much better idea of the game. I will leave in most of my original 'first impressions' review too. NOTE: I have changed my opinion on some areas. Updated bits at the bottom. Essentially, be prepaired to pay real money at the higher levels, and don't buy anyhting less than a T6 ship because it's a waste of money - and in the future expect to pay again, and again as they release increasingly high-level content and your current ship won't be able to do it.---original first impressions-----TL;DR: It's FREE, so give it a go if you're even slightly into Trek. IT's surprisingly good, and the paid for store items are good value for what you get. one of the better PVE MMO's I've ever played.(52 hours played at this point)  I was immediately surprised by how much detail the game makers have gone into in terms of creating a very 'Star Trek' feel to the game, and successfully translating a TV/Film franchise to not only a computer game, but a (relatively) free-roaming MMO.All the Trek bits aside, the game itself plays nicely, the interface on the ground I found a tiny bit clunky, but I adapted fairly quicky and there's certainly a lot of scope for customisation and individual play styles. The ground game reminds me a lot of a party-rpg style game because you have your away team of NPC crew members, all of whom have skills and equipment that you can customise and level up, so it's mostly about creating a 'team' that works well rather than just making one character that can do everything.The space combat is where the game shines in many ways. It's a healthy mix of tactical positioning and phaser-blasting, and the control system is nicely done. Combat is well paced and feels solid, though there are other things to do in space other than shoot stuff.The mission system is robust and fairly varied, with good stories and they feel very much like episodes in a TV series for the most part. There's a lot of repeatable missions and side missions as you'd expect from a MMO. There's a welcome mix of mini-games and small puzzle-solving elements to many of the missions which add some variety.The game is still being actively developed with expansions and content, there seems to be events very frequently that get you bonuses or involve special storylines, the community is active and the players seem on the whole a good bunch of people.My major complaint is that it's too easy (even on the hardest setting). I'm not a power gamer and I wouldn't consider myself to be any sort of expert or anything, but it's basically impossible to fail any mission. There's no way that I've found of losing anything, there's no possiblity of any of your main bridge crew dying, your ship can never be destroyed. If you get 'killed' or blown up on a mission you just repawn (the mission doesn't even reset to the start).The up-sde of this is that it actually adds to the feeling of Trek universe (where there's always a way out even when crew seemingly dies, etc.).So that's it really.-----end original------Latest feeling:Generally, what I said still stands. However there are some important considerations to make. The PVE space game gets less tactical as you get higher up and as usual the DPS-heavy options are infinitely better than any other play-style. Which is sad since at lower levels there's quite a lot of tactics involved and it's viable playing other roles. At lv50+ it's just ""activate all the special abilities and keep firing"", I spend more time watching the cooldown timers on my hotbar than I do the actual 'ships-in-space' bit. Ironically the ground-game has levelled perfectly and remained consitent throughout.The game ***IS*** Pay-to-win. Up to lv50 you can do fine on the 'free' version, although I did make some (very optional and fun) purchases from the C-store because I wanted to support a game I enjoyed. I purchased a couple of ships and a few other things, spending around £40 or so - for me, the purchase price of a good game. My plan was to make a small (£5-£10)purchase every month or so as I played or les frequent larger ones (the subscription options don't offer much IMO, but there's plenty you can buy).When I hit lv51 I found my ship (which cost me £25+ which I was using since I didn't like the equivalent-in-power free ones) suddenly struggling. It seems to me that to play in a comfortable way after lv50 you really need to pay for a Tier 6 ship - therefore it's pay-to-win since you can't realistically do all the content avaialble without paying.I'm OK with this model, except for one fact. I've already purchased three ships at this point, unfortunately they are all now essentially useless since the content auto-levells with you. One (a Tier 5) did have the option to upgrade ""to bring it up to standard at lv50+"". Which I did using a paid-for upgrade kit, making it not a T6, but a T5U. We were told that this was as close to a T6 as this ship class could get.7 days later...They have just released the same ship class with a slight stat boost and a new skin as a T6 ship. Unfortunately to use it I have pay full price for it - despite it being 95% identical to a ship I've already puprchased (it's even advertised as being the T6 version of the ship). Because of the nature of the game my existing ship (the T5U) version will be useless and honeslty I'll just delete it from my ship hangar. I would feel much better if they offered an upgrade from T5, or T5U to T6 rather than making me pay full price again. I'm not alone (according to the forums) in feeling slightly cheated/misinformed by this. It seems like this is the plan for new ships, so essentially, just be aware that when you play this game, you'll be expected to pay (between about £7 at lower levels and £35 for highest levels) for ships, and that realistically you need to buy at least one or more at the top levels to play, in addition to any vanity purchases or optional choices you make. Again, not necessarily a critisism of the game or the pay model, but a definite criticism of the communications between the company developing the game and the players regarding real-money-investments. Knowing what I do now, I would not waste my money buying any 'lower' class ship, since they are useless, and I would have just waited until now and spent that money on a T6 instead.			"

												As of last year during one huge update, all AI coding was released from pathing constraints and many other restrictions put on them. Just facing down one keldon (if you ever happen to find one) on elite difficulty is a tough battle for any engineer in a normal cruiser. AI (npc) ships are or were capable of doing anything a player ship can do, aside from cloaking, pathing used to be enemy ships moving in a straight line only firing back at players in the line of fire arcs, now enemies react follow, even boost and use abilities they never used before. Enemies are not fitted with better equipment, but hopefully one day they will be.Ground npcs are still mostly the same, there were always pathing issues in ground instances where corridors are involved, so making them able to do whatever they want would cause even more chaos. Basically npcs on the ground instances can do things a player can't do, like fit through impossibly tight gaps between a door and blocking shield eventually.The visuals on the game can be adjusted to suit almost every gaming computer on the planet!! those with lower end can turn down shadows and particle settings and turn all other things up to get the most beauty out of the game, those with high end systems can simply turn up everything and see the heavens during a full warzone, good luck with your random crash depending on how it goes ^^i recommend this to anyone looking for npc's that are not completely locked down by code, they have more free will than defiance and firefall npcs put together.please do list any other games apart from champions online that have unlocked AI if anyone replies to this. :)oh and i mention champions online only because npcs in the game have full amazing control of their actions when they are broken.the future is superior			"

												EDIT: I've been playing now for a month or so and have a much better idea of the game. I will leave in most of my original 'first impressions' review too. NOTE: I have changed my opinion on some areas. Updated bits at the bottom. Essentially, be prepaired to pay real money at the higher levels, and don't buy anyhting less than a T6 ship because it's a waste of money - and in the future expect to pay again, and again as they release increasingly high-level content and your current ship won't be able to do it.---original first impressions-----TL;DR: It's FREE, so give it a go if you're even slightly into Trek. IT's surprisingly good, and the paid for store items are good value for what you get. one of the better PVE MMO's I've ever played.(52 hours played at this point)  I was immediately surprised by how much detail the game makers have gone into in terms of creating a very 'Star Trek' feel to the game, and successfully translating a TV/Film franchise to not only a computer game, but a (relatively) free-roaming MMO.All the Trek bits aside, the game itself plays nicely, the interface on the ground I found a tiny bit clunky, but I adapted fairly quicky and there's certainly a lot of scope for customisation and individual play styles. The ground game reminds me a lot of a party-rpg style game because you have your away team of NPC crew members, all of whom have skills and equipment that you can customise and level up, so it's mostly about creating a 'team' that works well rather than just making one character that can do everything.The space combat is where the game shines in many ways. It's a healthy mix of tactical positioning and phaser-blasting, and the control system is nicely done. Combat is well paced and feels solid, though there are other things to do in space other than shoot stuff.The mission system is robust and fairly varied, with good stories and they feel very much like episodes in a TV series for the most part. There's a lot of repeatable missions and side missions as you'd expect from a MMO. There's a welcome mix of mini-games and small puzzle-solving elements to many of the missions which add some variety.The game is still being actively developed with expansions and content, there seems to be events very frequently that get you bonuses or involve special storylines, the community is active and the players seem on the whole a good bunch of people.My major complaint is that it's too easy (even on the hardest setting). I'm not a power gamer and I wouldn't consider myself to be any sort of expert or anything, but it's basically impossible to fail any mission. There's no way that I've found of losing anything, there's no possiblity of any of your main bridge crew dying, your ship can never be destroyed. If you get 'killed' or blown up on a mission you just repawn (the mission doesn't even reset to the start).The up-sde of this is that it actually adds to the feeling of Trek universe (where there's always a way out even when crew seemingly dies, etc.).So that's it really.-----end original------Latest feeling:Generally, what I said still stands. However there are some important considerations to make. The PVE space game gets less tactical as you get higher up and as usual the DPS-heavy options are infinitely better than any other play-style. Which is sad since at lower levels there's quite a lot of tactics involved and it's viable playing other roles. At lv50+ it's just ""activate all the special abilities and keep firing"", I spend more time watching the cooldown timers on my hotbar than I do the actual 'ships-in-space' bit. Ironically the ground-game has levelled perfectly and remained consitent throughout.The game ***IS*** Pay-to-win. Up to lv50 you can do fine on the 'free' version, although I did make some (very optional and fun) purchases from the C-store because I wanted to support a game I enjoyed. I purchased a couple of ships and a few other things, spending around £40 or so - for me, the purchase price of a good game. My plan was to make a small (£5-£10)purchase every month or so as I played or les frequent larger ones (the subscription options don't offer much IMO, but there's plenty you can buy).When I hit lv51 I found my ship (which cost me £25+ which I was using since I didn't like the equivalent-in-power free ones) suddenly struggling. It seems to me that to play in a comfortable way after lv50 you really need to pay for a Tier 6 ship - therefore it's pay-to-win since you can't realistically do all the content avaialble without paying.I'm OK with this model, except for one fact. I've already purchased three ships at this point, unfortunately they are all now essentially useless since the content auto-levells with you. One (a Tier 5) did have the option to upgrade ""to bring it up to standard at lv50+"". Which I did using a paid-for upgrade kit, making it not a T6, but a T5U. We were told that this was as close to a T6 as this ship class could get.7 days later...They have just released the same ship class with a slight stat boost and a new skin as a T6 ship. Unfortunately to use it I have pay full price for it - despite it being 95% identical to a ship I've already puprchased (it's even advertised as being the T6 version of the ship). Because of the nature of the game my existing ship (the T5U) version will be useless and honeslty I'll just delete it from my ship hangar. I would feel much better if they offered an upgrade from T5, or T5U to T6 rather than making me pay full price again. I'm not alone (according to the forums) in feeling slightly cheated/misinformed by this. It seems like this is the plan for new ships, so essentially, just be aware that when you play this game, you'll be expected to pay (between about £7 at lower levels and £35 for highest levels) for ships, and that realistically you need to buy at least one or more at the top levels to play, in addition to any vanity purchases or optional choices you make. Again, not necessarily a critisism of the game or the pay model, but a definite criticism of the communications between the company developing the game and the players regarding real-money-investments. Knowing what I do now, I would not waste my money buying any 'lower' class ship, since they are useless, and I would have just waited until now and spent that money on a T6 instead.			"

												One of my favorite games. It keeps a great balance of being both loyal to the original shows, while keeping the content original and fun. It runs well on almost any hardware, battles are fun, ships look great, and new content is added fairly often in each season. My only real problem with it is the fact that there are like 10 different currencies you have to keep up with. Other than that, I definitely recommend STO.			"

												I am a lifelong Star Trek fan and have searched for a SciFI MMO exactly like Star Trek Online. I would play the hell out of this game and even spend considerable cash on (as would my brother) it if only I could actually play it. I've amassed most of my few hours in the game in 5 to 10 minute increments. All it does is crash over and over. There seems to be no solution for it. I have a top-of-the-line, late-2013 MacBook Pro. My brother has a PC capable of running any game. We are both experiencing the same constant crashing/freezing and general unplayability. I will continue to try and play the game in the hopes that I can make it my #1 game for a long while, but that devotion only comes if I can actuallly play the game. Ball is in your court, Cryptic. That Legacy Pack looks mighty tempting but not for a game I can't ever play.			"

												Star Trek Online isn't a great game but its okay if you want something free to play to pass the time or whatever, story lines at start are pritty easy to follow get a bit confusing later one i found. Sadly like most free to play games and that is the pay with real money sadly in cryptics case the over priced stuff would be understatement somethings costing you 100 GBP for a tiny item you might only use now and again.So all in all I found the game was in a sort of cheat mode really easy without any real risk but was still fun to play for a couple of weeks but was destroyed by the online store (something i hate in mmos). There are couple of bugs and can be quite confusing for non-star trek fans one puzzle in a quest was something that nobody bad a maths would be able to manage without a calculator.			"

												Terrible.  My play time says something like 8 hours, but I only was able to make the game work for like 2 hours.  Such a shame, I had high hopes.  So the first mission is broken for me.. the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crew is standing around the armory waiting for me to equip the phasor rifle that is in my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d hand you morons!, and the game starting out completely on rails basically stopped me from being able to play that character.  On another character (whoes phasor rifle successfully triggered the retard crew to move along) I was able to fly around in circles mashing 1 and 3 until the several hundred borg cubes (who incidently are armed with spit balls that just tickle when they hit you) are obliterated by any random actions.The story is so cliche.. and not in a Star Trek kind of way.. in a bad video game plot progression kind of way.  It seemed extremely juvinile.  As a hard core Trekkie that didn't want to be disappointed by yet another embarassingly bad Trek game, I am really embarassed about this one...  I'd wear Vulcan ears to a party, but THIS game is friggin embarassing.			"

												This game is terrible and boring...You want more.I have played a good amount of this game even if my hours don't tell you that, but after the first 20 hours you will have done everything the game has to offer. Which isn't to say i didn't enjoy it, infact I lost myself in the story and look of the game. Even if it was running a mix of settings.The MMO is split into two types of game play. Space battles and Ground battles.The ground battles are rubbish and are, the reason I stopped playing. This is because they killed my frame rate, there were so boring and (the main reason) I couldn't shoot my weapon but my party could shoot there's uuuh.The only solutions I found were re start the account. NOIf you're wondering these are my computers species which are well within the requirements.CPU : Q8200GPU : GTX 650 1GBOS : Windows 10Monitor : 1080p (The resolution didn’t kill my frame rate)Space battles fear much better. Not only because I could fire my weapons and add my own sound effects (pew, pew, pew) to the game's brilliant sound design and soundtrack. But the ships also control really well, unlike brigh commander. Which felt like you were on and ice skating rink (I know that space is meant to be like that).I know that I haven't said anything that would make a terrible game not even an MMO. But eventually the little annoyance give way to boredom and the deleting of the launcher and the 13GBs of game. I would like to get into the story but I get bored before I get to the next mission. Anyway.One to beam up... Go away 2009 Kerk and your 725m USS Enterprise, that is nearly the same size as the USS Enterprise E.			"

												Star Trek Online. This game is extremely basic, theres not much here other than the Star Trek feel, which soon goes after a few hours of playtime. I have been trying to get into this game over and over with no avail, its too boring. The ship desings and mechanics are sound, They're fun to play for a few hours every now and then, but by god dont get me started on the ground combat. I have never in my life played a game so clunky and weird, the animations are basic at best, some just seem so out of place it adds to the clunky movement and constant animation cancelling. Annnnd thats the game folks, nothing else to mention really, Raids and such are a joke, and no one plays them, you would be in a queue for hours on end looking for 3 people. Im not sure there is even a story here, Much like the TV shows, it's individual missions with the odd big missions with a story, then its completely forgotten till you find another. Voice acting in some parts and none existant in others, you would be best off just turning off the sound and listening to music while doing this grind of a game, actually, dont even pay attention to the missions either, because you soon get lost in what you're doing, even while paying attention.Now, what I did like about the games was the nice little tutorial stories each faction has, it realy feels like you're a member of the Klingon Empire, the Romulan Empire and even the Federation, who of which were the most enjoyable with the whole Borg element. But like I said, all the problems the game has, this feeling soon wears off. It is just a bad game, and the playerbase supports this, the game is pretty dead.			"

												TL;DR: DONT PLAY THIS UNLESS YOU LOVE STAR TREK AND HAVE A FRIEND TO PLAY IT WITH YOU, 4/10Now, I've played this game a lot. In the begining, it was fun, with the 2 main segments, Ground and Starship, allowing for the game to change what you do, so as to not get bored. But after this initial euphoria, I sadly have to admit, the game is mind-numbingly boring. Every mission has the same basic structure; Warp in, alternate between space and ground combat, then warp out again. It becomes a grind during the mid-game, and dispite attempts to make you solve puzzles or resolve issues, it becomes a mashing ""F"" contest, as you don't have to do anything other than that 99% of the time. On the rare occasion a genuine puzzle comes along, its solution is either highlighted in a text box, or told to you when you begin. And then the cash-grabbery. I would overlook moderate cash-grabbing in a F2P game; servers are not free, but the preposterous extent of the cash-grabbing in this game is unforgivable. You are capped at 10.000.000 Credits, unless you buy an upgrade. This would be fine, were it not for the fact that the majority of good late-game equipment costs much more than this. The vast majority of ships are locked behind their own paywalls, as are the more iconic outfits, such as the TOS uniforms, just to ring every possible penny out of the playerbase. However, worst of all is that the best, endgame ships are in lockboxes, which you have to buy keys for. But with these ships having an ~0.4% droprate from these crates, to get them you must either waste far too much money, or be very lucky. This guts the endgame, as if you dont pay into the system, you become obselete. Even at endgame the missions are boring and repetitive. Don't play this alone, get a friend who owes you a favour to go through it with you. Its comunity made missions can be fun, but the creator for theses missions is difficult at best. As a Star Trek fan, I have to honestly give it 4/10, as much as it pains me and my 11 days of playtime to do so.			"

												I mean, ignore the fact I recommended it, as I'm kinda neutral on the game. For one thing, the developers can make some decent content. On the other side of that, you have to pay for most of that content. Oh, you got a lockbox? PAY TO OPEN IT! Oh, you want a really nice ship? PAY! You want to start a fleet with friends? PAY! You want anything other than the five or six base options for customization and ship choices? PAAAAAAY! However, the story, while disjointed and strange, can be fairly enjoyable at times.			"

												I was never a big Star Trek fan. To be honest I still have trouble completely understanding. I saw the two latest movies...never got into any of the old shows or movies but I'm slowly becoming a fan. This game downloads fast and is really in depth. Loading time is almost always fast, graphics are great and the community has NEVER been mean. Both characters I made (one I made long ago and quit because I just didn't understand the game much with the lack of a good tutorial) got into a guild really fast; and all the guild members did their best to help. Now that the tutorial is better done I'm enjoying it so much more. Pros: StoryGraphicsCommunityLoadingSpace/ground combatNot P2W (as far as I know so far with all my experience)Name can be remade once for free, ship customization can be mostly done with in game currency as well as character customizationYou can choose to hide your 'show weapons/utility belt' for free (yeah it's a pro because most game devs are shallow and you need to pay for it)Cons:It's one giant server making it unstable at times: crashes/lagsA very annoying random mix of voice acting and just text reading (just stick to one already!)

												After 250 hours or so the game just turned into a grind-fest. The story was fun to play through in the beginning, but it gradually devolved to the same types of missions, involving the same types of quests. The regular events were okay, but only if you upgragded your ship to the hilt (which of course requires signficant invest of either real money, or real-time gridning). The strength of this game is the space combat, and I will admit I'm sometimes tempted to fire up the game just to take part in some space battles. There's multiple classes to choose from, and a wide variety of ships to utilize (some free, some paid), and you can also upgrade your ship with a variety of devices (new weapons, shields, engines etc.).But the ground combat - ugh. It looks bad, plays bad, and is buggy too. It really weighs the game down in places, and I found myself dreading beaming down during missions. I hardly played the event ground missions because they were resoundingly terrible, and the ground fetch quests? I cringe just thinking about them.I can't really recommend this game in good faith. Will you have fun with it? Maybe, but it will also frustrate you to no end.  "

												This game when my friend bugged me enough to play it turns out it was great. Space combat was cool and fun as was the ground based combat the foundry means players can create their own stories but everyone will pick you up because you missed one letter out of one word (e.g. Dager = dagger). The episodes are great but I find them to be a bit dull at times so I went to a star cluster and explored unknown systems.Now there is no exploring the game has gone past its golden days and alot like the COD francise you will either love it or hate it. If you like star trek or sci-fi then yeah your going to like it but its best days are gone in my opinion.			"

												Having spent well over 200 hours on Star Trek Online, I can safely say it gives a far better experience than any other games based on the franchise I have played ever has. The game offers two types of combat, ground and space. STO also offers 3 different factions to choose from, the Federation, the Klingon Defence Force, and the Roman Republic (which is a thing in Star Trek Online)/Empire each having their individual storylines and content. Character customisation is excellent, and probably one of the best I’ve seen. However, STO is a combat based MMORPG, losing a sense of exploration; an important aspect of Star Trek. Plus, the more you play, the more the game becomes repetitive. Cryptic (the developers) have done an adequate job with the endgame content.Overall, the game is more than satisfactory.			"

												Spent alot of hours on this game and money!!! brilliant game even for non star trek fans, Unfortunatly the game wears off after a few months of grinding an then gets hard again lose interest and start to play another game, my fleet must hate me but its not the guyz always helpful and there for questioning D the problem is grinding and getting bored of having to replay alot of the same missions because of the prizes needed or quantity gained through certain missions. and when a special mission with one time prizes show your battling between that and your normal rountine. the games massive no doubt but its very deep and a massive learning curve this is not going to help the game expand by popularity....if anything puts people off. 5/5 patches always good, maintanance is always quick. cant knock it apart from that, *****			"

												Star Trek: Screw the Prime Directive!STO is more for cookie-cutter MMO fans than Star Trek fans. If you don't care about the spirit of the franchise and simply want to blow things up and make yourself as explicitly powerful as possible for DPS, this is your game.If you are coming here out of the desire to have an interactive experience with the world you've grown fond of in the movies and television series, you will feel quickly let-down.This Star Trek universe isn't about exploration or diplomacy, or really any kind of social philosophy. It is about war, power, financial gain, and the biggest ego. Become an Admiral after a very short amount of time and play with dozens of others who are easily and conveniently and admiral as well, owning a collection of ships as if they are trivial collector trading cards, and deal with multiple ""reputation systems"" and currencies that pander to the ego and primitive reward systems.This simulation was put together by Klingons (frequent war, combat, honor systems), Farengi (multiple currencies and trading), Borg (insistive power in numbers and hardware), and an assortment of other races, none of which included the Federation.

												I've been playing this game since the game came out, first with Cryptic then Perfect World.  This game is NOT P2W, you get amazing ships just by playing the game, players are helpful and generous.  This game is also Canon!  This is the world that is pre-Abrams.  In other words, Romulus is gone and Spock was sent to the past where JJ Abrams rules with world with pretty starship bridges and lens flares!  CBS is on board wit hthe game and that helps a lot!Make sure you find a fleet (guild) and they'll take good care of you.  You can play as either Star Fleet, Klingon Defense Force or the Romulan Republic.  The Romulans are a pseudo faction, after a while you have to choose to either ally with Star Fleet or the KDF.In the past, when I started playing, the Klingons were at war with Star Fleet. You could not play with them, you couldn't even talk to them.  Now everyone is allied to a degree and it's a lot more fun!There are multiple storylines, all voiced and the ships that come out around the same time all have the same general theme.+ Great Graphics despite it's age+ Customization options that are amazing+ Customizable ships+ Ship to Ship Combat+ Away team ground combat+ No need to spend real money to be competive and have fun+ You can get the Zen (paid for currency) by trading Dilithium+ You can get Dilithium if you have Zen you don't need+ All mission content is voiced+ You can have multiple ships and dry dock even more+ Solo play is very doable, I'm not a group player so I can't say much in that areaI could go all day with positives, I've been playing this game for years for a reason.- Can't have large amounts of EC (Energy Credits, in-game currency) without buying it in the store or having a subscription- *** Personal Opinion *** Ground combat is annoying and more common than ship-to-ship combat- A few latency issues from time to time- You'll want to spend money due to the cool factor of the ships etc.  They all have a gimmick that is pretty cool, but there's a lot of great powers etc available, but the fact that you need Zen (and sometimes a LOT of it) is annoying.- You can process 8,000 dilithium a day, at this exact moment you can get 1 Zen for 311 dilithium... Some store items are 20000 Zen... you can see where this gets annoying.  Fortunately you don't need shop items to have fun.They have seasonal events which can land you some very powerful ships for nothing more than your time and can be a lot of fun.  I've heard some people complain about Q's winter wonderland, (There's a combat against giant gummy sea monsters) however it's Q... he can do anything, so why not Gummy monsters?Anyhow, check it out, it's fun and I hope to see you in game!

												Before I give my final verdict, I am going to give the Pros and Cons.Pros:-Visual effects. Star Trek online is gorgeous to those who play it.-Space Combat. The space combat is very fun.Now to the Cons.-Ground missions. Very repetitive and last longer than needed.-Ground Combat. Not very interesting, and PvP there is a bunch of rolling.-No exploration. You can't really explore because of the missions.I would give this game a rating of 7/10, being an OK game. If you are looking for a game that has the Pros of Star Trek, and the cons are fixed, I would recommend playing Star Wars The Old Republic.			"

												(this will have PC and XBOX one reveiws: both are mixed)PC: the gameplay mechanics run pretty smooth, however theres a LOT of button pushing/mouse clicking involved so it can get pretty complex to those who are not used to a keyboard and mouse functions of a MMO. camera functions are pretty smooth compared to the xbox one (wich ill get too after the reveiw for PC) were you can let it zoom in or out by scrolling up and down with the mouse wheel. as far as the campaigns go for all 3 factions (romulan, klingon,federation) all 3 run alright without any problems. there is some lag every now and then thru out the game but you sometimes dont notice it.Xbox one: just the same with PC; the gameplay mechanics run pretty smooth, but there is less buttons to push and its all sorted into wheels that you can hold down buttons to select (wich can be pretty usefull to some or all). camera is very glitchy and does not have the full set up with it. during or after combat the camera will glitch to were its zoomed far out and away from your character, when that happens you have to hold down a button, then select ""adjust camera mode"" to reset it back to were you want it. its VERY BROKEN on the klingon characters, it zooms in OVER your character were its not positioned over the shoulder, federation characters dont have any problems with the camera other then it glitching during or after combat(this goes for all factions with the camera glitching)  (not shure with romulan yet, havnt gotten around to see if its as broken as it is on the klingon characters). STO on the xbox one does not have too many dedicated servers like the PC's version, and when ALL the servers are filled up..you can really feel the lag, when that lag hits, the game becomes your worst enemy, from making you go further down a path only to YANK you back into a random location or to the starting point over and over again,not doing damage to anything to dieing quickly or dieing in one hit, or spamming A in frustration to get to the next selection only to make you select MULTIPLE things to were you make wrong choices or makes you fail a mission or do VERY poorly in a event. example of this is the starbase 234 mission were you fight the ships and do enough damage to the starbase to pass, if you are lagging your not doing any damage AT ALL and if you try to get away from them so you can either abandon the mission and do it latter when the lag lifts up or to swap weapons and gear out to help you in your fight....your yanked back to them and they catch up pretty quick due to there not being affected by the lag, YOU are the only one affected by the lag. and sooner or latter you get oneshot or two out of nowere and the timer will say ""0:00"" or go down in 10 to 30 seconds EACH lagspikewith those bugs/ glitches you whould think the developers whould listen to the XBOX comunity on the game's performance and feedback, but no..the game has been out for two months and they have not lifted a finger to fix those issuesoveral: i highly recomend you stick to the  PC's STO or give it a shot. i cannot stress it enough to stay away from the one's STO unless your ok with the game fighting you over and over when the servers are full			"

												STO is great. It may have it's flaws, but it makes up for that being Free to Play. They do have event ships, so you don't actually have to spend money on getting a T6. they have a exchange ""player controlled"". The Exchange enables you to get game shop currency, that way you dont have to spend money, just time for the grind. They have a player shop, you can buy and sell items such as outfits, Lock Box ships, gear and keys for said Lock Boxs. There is a lot of grinding in this game, but it's great, it's sure worth the try. The story is a bit rough at first and in patches later on down the road, but it is overall enjoyable.Played it a lot without using Steam.			"

The game is in 3d and gives the player missions in-game while allowing a certain ammount of free roaming. Ships can be earned or bought using the zen store. Another feature is that on the official Sto website (Sto is the abreviation for Star Trek Online), you can earn zen for free by taking surveys and such. This is an amazing game I would recomend to all.			"

												The space part is fun as is the ground part, but ground weapons are unbalanced and look dumb. Federation should be using hand phasers, not space gattling laser guns.Cool thing is melee is just as effective as weapons in ground combat, maybe even more effective. You can even kick♥♥♥♥♥unarmed with big roundkicks. It looks ridiculous, but that was still a good dev decision. You can even use a straight up sword. Problem with ground combat is the way the game is layed out in small areas that are mostly randomly generated crap. This game has like 1/4 of the ground combat it needs.The storylines are also pretty crap. Instead of developing one villian they pretty much used every villian the series has ever had, but developed none of them. Too many races as well, espeically the ridiculous looking custom races where you see things like 2 foot green midgets and homer simpson and joker from batman lookalikes.4-5 races for federation and 2-3 for klingons and 2-3 for romulans would of been more than enoughRacials suck as well, although they made it better. Crafting sucks, not worth anything, and only way to get good gear is be part of a good fleet or spend 20 buck+ to buy one from the store.Overall game has potential, but its really dead nowadays and is gonna need a miracle.

												Hard to describe. I love space combat, personally. Others love the ground combat. Both have available pvp, and great endgame content, as well as special events. Follows Star Trek story line nicely, tho you don't need to know anything about Star Trek to play. The story line will explain it nicely.			"

												For the price (free!), it is not a bad game. You can create a character for each of the three main political states - Federation, Klingon & Romulan. There are a variety of races to choose from and you get to customize your character (and supporting NPC crew members) for free (first time only). I saw a lot of buxom & statuesque female Vulcans even one bald but for a top knot (very blonde hair) and a tattoo around one eye back going back towards the ear.Some of the game mechanics feel clunky & some cut screnes (shuttlecraft wobbling all over the place as it comes in for a landing on Vulcan) leave something to be desired. And if you want to really get serious in the game and get the good stuff, you will have to buy (as in $) special credits (or earn them which takes a lot of grinding). Missions included space & ground and you can even get involved in fleet actions (versus Klingons, Gorns, Romulans, Borg, etc). For the first MMO I have really played, Crunch had a good time (not playing much these days) and recommends it if you are looking for a casual or serious MMO. He rates it 7.5 out of 10.			"

												I didn't think this game was really going to be worth installing,as i hate paying monthly for a game I already bought,Since it went free to play,I've spent some time on it,a LOT of time actually :)Its quite immersive,fairly easy to pick up,but its the ships that make it worth the while,as each time you get to a new rank,you get a new ship.the missions are fairly varied,both ground and space,and now with the advent of player made foundry missions,theres a lot more to do.If you want a ftp game,I'd recommend this highly,though there are still a few glitches,but the devs are fairly quick to sort them out usually.I'll see you on Earthdock :)Make it so :)			"

												Star Trek Online is a great free to play game with a high ammount of things to do without spending money at all. The game is in 3d and gives the player missions in-game while allowing a certain ammount of free roaming. Ships can be earned or bought using the zen store. Another feature is that on the official Sto website (Sto is the abreviation for Star Trek Online), you can earn zen for free by taking surveys and such. This is an amazing game I would recomend to all.			"

												I've played STO since it came out around December 2009. I have to say that I have liked Trek since I was a kid, watching the, at the time, reruns, in the early 1970's and on to the various TOS movies. TNG took some getting used to, but Picard turned out to be a great captain. The only movie I really care for is Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan and then the new JJ Abrams retcons that take us back to Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. In my opinion, it's the Kirk era that is the real meat and potatoes of Trek. All the rest is just too far out into the future...making it all seem like magic instead of technology. Anyways, this is the only current Trek game and so I've been with it up to now in 2015 and probably will until it goes offline. If you really like Star Trek, this game will not disappoint you. It's Free to Play...which means all the cool stuff will cost you real life money.			"

Its enjoyable, you really get the star trek feel and tooling around the galaxy in your own starship is pretty cool. Although having said that, every time they release new content or a major update the servers can't cope with the amount of traffic and I find I have to wait about a week before I can play the new stuff, which really irks me to be honest and what drove me to write this.Overall though the good outweighs the bad and I would recommend star trek online to anyone with the patience to wait a while after new stuff is released.

												First off this game will never win any graphics awards as it has a simplistic system because they have a ""in game workshop"" where you can make your own missions and scenarios in an in built creator.The game itself is very enjoyable as it seriously takes time to have fan service to all movies and series' that make up the cannon universe.The story takes place 32 years after the end of Voyager ad 20 years after the events in the JJ Abrams Star Trek reboot where Spock and Nero get pulled into an alternate timeline after the Romulus system gets destroyed.They link everything together in a compelling storyline that fills in plot holes from the franchise along the way.They have returning actors reprising theircharacters in voice overs for certain ""seasons"" or sections of the game.The Away team (ground) combat is a little basic compared to other  MMO's but the space combat...oooh the space combat...is some of the most fun I have had in a Sci-Fi game in ages.Seriously on week of playing the game and I bought the Lifetime subscription.There is a in game shop and ""crate"" system in the game that keeps this free to play game running, but you can quite easily play this game with the free ships you get during seasonal events.It is not a fee to play game as the bought stuff is generally cosmetic or has things just makes things easier. It doesn't break the game.			"

												If you are a Star Trek fan, or a fan of science fiction games, look no further. Developing a Universe that fully takes for its worth the trove that is Star Trek lore, they encapsulate the universe shown in the shows and movies, yets makes it bigger, and adds you into the mix.10/10!			"

												I started playint STO shortly after it became F2P. At first it was a great game with a lot of things to discover, but that changed after a couple of weeks/months of play. Every mission is like: travel to this planet or system, defeat the enemies in the orbit of the planet/station or friendly ship, beam down to the planet/station/ship and defeat ~50 enemies in ground combat. Then beam back on board and defeat the reinforcement. Warp to sector space and report to starfleet.Although the story (traveling back in time, meet Kirk, Scotty and various other well known characters) was quiet good, the linear gameplay of just traveling, fighting enemies in space and then on ground was horrible. If I wasn't such a Star Trek Fan, I would have quit playing after 1-2 weeks. The overall gameplay is (from my point of view) horrible and I hate the ground combat. In all series/movies, there are just a few combats with a hand full of enemies. In the game, nearly every mission has a ground combat with about 50 enemies, which is horrible and does not fit into the Star Trek universe.  In space PVE you just need a DPS-ship, so tanking enemies with a cruiser is useless, because enemies will focus on the ship with the highest DPS. Flying a science-ship is also most useless, because they do 2 types of damage (weapon damage and exotic damage). So you can't skill effectefly a high-DPS science-ship.Space PVP does NOT work either. In most cases an enemy ship decloaks behind you, fires all BUFFs and hit you with ~70k DPS, so you are not able to do something against this. So PVP is mainly broken since YEARS.So all about fighting is to get the most DPS out of your ship. Group play is about doing high DPS in a short amount of time. So there is no tactic like - tanking the boss with a cruiser, slowing/knocking him back and apply dots with a science ship. All is about maximising DPS.There is grinding all around. The 5th year anniversary ""present"" was a mission, where you have to grind for about 3-4 weeks to get a highest tier cruiser. I tried the grinding mission for 4 days. At the second day the mission was broken, so I couldn't end it successfully. At the 3rd day this bug wasn't fixed. On the 4th day I quit and cursed PWE and Cryptic and all the other so called ""Developers"".Now content is all about getting a Tier 6 ship with REAL MONEY! So NO F2P anymore. You have to grind months of getting a new ship and then just more months for getting adequate equipment.Just a little bit about the story. There is a redone of all episodes from time to time. They just want that you want to replay Star Trek again with new characters, so they can sell you ships/items. The content of the story is sometimes good, but sometimes the conversations and explecitly the jokes are horrible. After you have done all missions, there is almost nothing to do. Star Trek Online is NOT about exploring the universe, other cultures or getting in first contact with other species. It's a poorly space/ground shooter, but the only MMO in Star Trek Theme (until now).			"

												I've played this game twice ""only"" but the two times I did, I spent my entire day on it from morning to late night (actually morning, I admit it... I played 18 hours in a row and since I have a 30hr total, this also means my first time lasted 12 hours, which were also in a row). I was actually afraid to play it again and that this would happen. I was right, it just did. This game and its world and map are simply HUGE (In the beggining it is impressive and you will have to walk away to wait to reach another place while the ship travels, but I have read that once lvl 30 is reached, one can go fastly between all the systems & sectors and cross absolutely everything almost without any waiting time). The graphics performance is pretty nice & smooth and I play with all settings on maximum (antialising too). Maybe they could develop updates to make it even more ""HD"" with more textures?. The scenes in the space or inside detailed rooms are stunning and so inspiring. It is such an open world, with typical but also many unexpected missions (which makes it seem more realistic, as if it was indeed a different and existing world). When I was put to install statelites and scan a planet for it to be the new home of certain peoples, I was just fascinated and couldn't be happier about it. Specially, after I went into the planet to do scanning and some little alien creatures ran to me, stared at me and kind of sniffed me. After I analized them they'd run away with their fluffy weird little bodies, aw. It kind of made me think of SPORE (And SPORE was always pretty special to me because it always made me think of a book I got for my 9yo birthday, it was a book that changed my life, opened my mind & exploited my imagination (title: ""Ami : Child of the Stars"")), but without the cartoon-like designs and the 6yo entire game style. The space battles remind me a bit of the galactic conquest space battles from Star Wars : Battlefront II, but here controls are a bit more complex and ship movement & velocity are just a little bit more awkawrd (Half the game I used R for turbo speed (ON/OFF) and now it works only for turning it ON, so I have to click Q like nuts just to dicrease the velocity fastly to zero again), but is simply a different battle style. I would say it is some kind of mix between that and the modern M.M.O. games. It is not such a ""social"" game as other famous M.M.O. games I've played where is easy to ""make friends"" on the first or second day already, here most of people is completely into their own, which is perfectly fine to me (I actually got a fleet invitation but I declined because I was too focused on my own mission and its story line). I would say the ZEN currency and money-greed of all these new games are really tiring though. To get ZEN currency, you have to buy it, directly from your steam wallet. I would rather pay to have this game, than have all that c.r.a.p. incrusted in all windows related to your character and fleet. I'd pay once, in order to have freaking peace forever. Or easier, make it possible to transform the currencies again, as I read it was before in some review. Damn money grabbers.I'm going to bed at 5am, and I cant wait to play again!!! People out there, don't waste any more time and try this game out. Cause even if you don't like it, you will at least enjoy flying through the space ;)  I can also say this game has made me reflect about some deep couple of things too, I am sure it will provoke the same in any other reflexive person or just anyone that wonders about life, our universe, time-travel and space-time theories.Too sad I checked for the Steam screenshot shortcut in the middle of my game, otherwise I'd have over 100 screenshots instead of ""just"" 68 if I started taking them from the beggining of my game :p			"

												A good game.  Very fun.  And no, it's not really a ""grind fest"" unless you have to have absolutely the best gear in the game right this second.  If you're content with gear that's ""good enough"" or are willing to wait and work for your stuff then there's really no problem.  Almost everything can be earned just by playing the game.  There are a very few things you can only get by subscribing (or buying a lifetime sub) but those things aren't that good anyway.  The rest of the cash shop stuff can be earned just by playing.For anyone that likes PvP, this game isn't for you.  PvP has never been very good and was never meant to be.  The developer doesn't care about it and only really added it so PvPers would stop whining about wanting it.  That didn't work out very well.			"

												First off this game will never win any graphics awards as it has a simplistic system because they have a ""in game workshop"" where you can make your own missions and scenarios in an in built creator.The game itself is very enjoyable as it seriously takes time to have fan service to all movies and series' that make up the cannon universe.The story takes place 32 years after the end of Voyager ad 20 years after the events in the JJ Abrams Star Trek reboot where Spock and Nero get pulled into an alternate timeline after the Romulus system gets destroyed.They link everything together in a compelling storyline that fills in plot holes from the franchise along the way.They have returning actors reprising theircharacters in voice overs for certain ""seasons"" or sections of the game.The Away team (ground) combat is a little basic compared to other  MMO's but the space combat...oooh the space combat...is some of the most fun I have had in a Sci-Fi game in ages.Seriously on week of playing the game and I bought the Lifetime subscription.There is a in game shop and ""crate"" system in the game that keeps this free to play game running, but you can quite easily play this game with the free ships you get during seasonal events.It is not a fee to play game as the bought stuff is generally cosmetic or has things just makes things easier. It doesn't break the game.			"

Graphics are Okay and with the new lighting effect the game is buggy and laggy yet I'm sure Cryptic will fix this.

												Star Trek Online is a game you will either absolutely love or hate with a burning passion, no stops in between. Reasons to love it: lots of contents, a strong player base, a friendly community, is a free to play game, and the fact is part of the Star Trek franchise.Reasons to hate it: PvP is almost dead, the items and ships which will require you to open your wallet and throw some money into it, the never ending grinding an the fact is part of the Star Trek franchise.This last point is a great plus to those player familiar with the ST lore, with lots of references to all the TV series and movies, but outsiders might feel lost at times.Regarding the payable content, you can still get the stuff if you're willing to spend time grinding, but it will take a long time. For example, to get a T6 ship you'll need to refine the daily Dilithium quota for 3-4 month depending on the Zen price on the exchange.Overall, the game has a lot to offer, and it's a great and fun option considering you don't need to pay a subscription.

												As an MMORPG this is a fairly solid title until you hit max level.  Unfortunately the end game space content is a little lackluster.  Some of it isn't bad but it gets repetitive.  The storyline content (Episodes) up to max level (and a little bit after depending how fast you hit max level) are amazingly good.  The game is top notch there it actually does feel very much like Star Trek in the episodes.  The public area encounters leave a lot to be desired though as they feel chaotic and not very much like 'Star Trek' as people race around bumping into each other trying to kill ### badguys of X or Y type or what have you.  Overall, however, this game is absolutely worth playing if only to run through the episodes and get that Star Trek feel.  After that, your mileage will vary.  Grab the game... play through the episodes... if you enjoy it stick around for the end game content.  I did for a while.  It'll keep you busy for at least a couple months... it held my attention for nearly a year.			"

												In the simplest terms the game is really only worth it to you if your a farely devoved a star trek fan. Other then that its a farely generic run and gun rpg. Not horbible but not great either.			"

												First of it's a star trek MMO, and while most people will go nah, i'm not touching it, there are a lot of people that will enjoy itso lets start with the pro's and consPro's Continually updates with more Events and content.Learning curve isn't that steep.It's Free to play.Con'sIt's very senstive to certain anti virus / antispyware combos, and will crash at the drop of a hat.early game is free to play, late game at Vice Admiral / whatever your race equiv is (lvl 50) is not competetive for F2P'ers and you will at some point have to spend some money to buy an end game ship.PVP is merciless and you will get trolled.but despite those points, it's a very soild game and you don't really need to be a Trekker to enjoy it (Although it helps), I have so far clocked in around 2 Ish years and i'm still playing it, unlike WoW which kept sucking my bank account dry with it's PPM schemeIs it the best MMO out there, nopeis it fun, I'd say yes, but i'm sure there are other out there that will disagree with meIf you fancy saving / or destroying the galaxy in a fully customisable starship then this is probably the game for youGraphics 7Audio 8 (has some really recognaisable tunes for the trek series)Gameplay 7 (space combat is better than ground, otherwise this would be higher)Longeviety 9 (takes age to lvl to 50 if your a casual gamer)Overall 8.5			"

												I started playint STO shortly after it became F2P. At first it was a great game with a lot of things to discover, but that changed after a couple of weeks/months of play. Every mission is like: travel to this planet or system, defeat the enemies in the orbit of the planet/station or friendly ship, beam down to the planet/station/ship and defeat ~50 enemies in ground combat. Then beam back on board and defeat the reinforcement. Warp to sector space and report to starfleet.Although the story (traveling back in time, meet Kirk, Scotty and various other well known characters) was quiet good, the linear gameplay of just traveling, fighting enemies in space and then on ground was horrible. If I wasn't such a Star Trek Fan, I would have quit playing after 1-2 weeks. The overall gameplay is (from my point of view) horrible and I hate the ground combat. In all series/movies, there are just a few combats with a hand full of enemies. In the game, nearly every mission has a ground combat with about 50 enemies, which is horrible and does not fit into the Star Trek universe.  In space PVE you just need a DPS-ship, so tanking enemies with a cruiser is useless, because enemies will focus on the ship with the highest DPS. Flying a science-ship is also most useless, because they do 2 types of damage (weapon damage and exotic damage). So you can't skill effectefly a high-DPS science-ship.Space PVP does NOT work either. In most cases an enemy ship decloaks behind you, fires all BUFFs and hit you with ~70k DPS, so you are not able to do something against this. So PVP is mainly broken since YEARS.So all about fighting is to get the most DPS out of your ship. Group play is about doing high DPS in a short amount of time. So there is no tactic like - tanking the boss with a cruiser, slowing/knocking him back and apply dots with a science ship. All is about maximising DPS.There is grinding all around. The 5th year anniversary ""present"" was a mission, where you have to grind for about 3-4 weeks to get a highest tier cruiser. I tried the grinding mission for 4 days. At the second day the mission was broken, so I couldn't end it successfully. At the 3rd day this bug wasn't fixed. On the 4th day I quit and cursed PWE and Cryptic and all the other so called ""Developers"".Now content is all about getting a Tier 6 ship with REAL MONEY! So NO F2P anymore. You have to grind months of getting a new ship and then just more months for getting adequate equipment.Just a little bit about the story. There is a redone of all episodes from time to time. They just want that you want to replay Star Trek again with new characters, so they can sell you ships/items. The content of the story is sometimes good, but sometimes the conversations and explecitly the jokes are horrible. After you have done all missions, there is almost nothing to do. Star Trek Online is NOT about exploring the universe, other cultures or getting in first contact with other species. It's a poorly space/ground shooter, but the only MMO in Star Trek Theme (until now).			"

												think i have more time in this game than any other but i cant give it a positive review bc it has the same problems that it had at the start tons of bugs and lag is insane bout 30% of the time makes it unplayable. seems like the devs are more concernd with realeasing the next ship for ppl to play real money for than fixing the problems with the game.

												I found that if you do not like watching, or inveloping yourself in the star trek fanbase you woud not find this game interesting or the slight bit fun. Although I had this game recomended to me i found it a complete waste of time because even with someone to coach me i struggled with the introduction to all fleets. The game has a surprisingly good amount of gameplay and good quality it is just difficult and lacks any consequences or punishments for a death so new people don't learn different tactics they just charge in and hope they do it right. This game is just a bad game overall if u aren't involved with star trek before hand.			"

												every new update that comes out only benefits those with large wallets. the developers shine the spotlight on new gear and ships but what they forgot to mention is that it is all for premium players.if you dont mind being a noob through the entire game, een at the highest level, play it.if you mind being abused and forced into payment, dont play it. ive been playing this game for two YEARS and im on the max level. the only problem is not beng able to participate in special events without being butt♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by a borg probe because i dont have a cryptic membership. DONT PLAY IT.			"

												long time star trek fan.  always hoped this game would take a turn for the better...  last time i installed this i hit a brick wall glitch that didnt allow me to leave a planet... forums told me i had to restart my character.  in my opinion this should never happen...  going to give up on this game.  Also why does it say that there are steam achievements on the steam page?  It's been on their store page for ages but no steam achievements ever happend.			"

												Trekkies will love this one. I Personally found the game engaging, but repetitive at times. the interface is somewhat clunky, but that comes natural with an MMORPG. the Foundry offers unlimited playability and is a welcome addition to the game.the recently introduced free DLC, Delta Rising had me wondering where the story will go next. Cryptic/PWE did blunder a few times, but overall has my approval.			"

												I'm sorry the simple fact that its already been 5 yrs in the this game and people can't assign a crew member to take control of a extra ship allowing us to create our own fleets kinda makes me depressed to not really want to get into it, but if you can deal without that then i can recommend this game its fun but for me i want to grow my fleet with my NPCs.

												This is an amazing game. it changes the perspective on how we play MMO's and RPG style games. hours of endless fun for you and your friends. The multiplaying though could use some work im not a huge fan of the level matching becuse your ship is still severly under powred and weapon systems barly put a dent in other people. I do have one concern when ever i try to change my graphic settings i have to uninstall the game and reinstall it. is this normal or is my computer bad? other then that this is the most played game in my libary. GOOD JOB GUYS!!			"

												STO is great. It may have it's flaws, but it makes up for that being Free to Play. They do have event ships, so you don't actually have to spend money on getting a T6. they have a exchange ""player controlled"". The Exchange enables you to get game shop currency, that way you dont have to spend money, just time for the grind. They have a player shop, you can buy and sell items such as outfits, Lock Box ships, gear and keys for said Lock Boxs. There is a lot of grinding in this game, but it's great, it's sure worth the try. The story is a bit rough at first and in patches later on down the road, but it is overall enjoyable.Played it a lot without using Steam.			"

												As i am a fan of the star trek franchise i really do enjoy this game, it has a massive ammount of detail to lore and a huge list of ships to command including ships from the federation, romulans and kilngons. this game has a uniqe crafting and upgrading system and offers a large ammount of armaments for you to use. there is only one down side to this game. it takes a lot of time and effort to rank up and make your ships formidable. to have the best experience with this title i would recommend doing the game alongside a friend or join another players fleet so you can ask any questions on how to progress certain things. all in all i would give this game a solid 8/10. as this is a free game there are a lot of things you can actually purchase with real money. such as unique vessels like the intrepid class (voyager) or the defiant class (deep space nine) along side many others. no this is not a pay to win, but buying a few items here and there never hurt.

												Well... i thought this game is going to be dead about half a year ago.... but it's still there and fun from time to time.A big contra: their design choices are VERY bad - unproportional interiors which make you feel like a dwarf is just one example - a game breaker for me, but if you can ignore this you can still have fun in the game.So if you haven't played this lately or at all I can still reccomend that you try it now, after all its free (there is a cash shop but its not needed you can achieve everything without buying... though it makes things less time consuming ^^).(but beware, support is still not very good if this matters to you......)

												A few bugs here and there and a bit of a pay 2 play game as once you have done all the campaign missions which are a little boring you either have to stick with a low end crappy ship or buy ZEN to get a new ship. Graphics are Okay and with the new lighting effect the game is buggy and laggy yet I'm sure Cryptic will fix this. Anyway after a while the game kind of gets boring a lot even when you've repeated the same missions and fleet actions and PVE battles over and over again for the same rewards. This game deserves a 8/10			"
