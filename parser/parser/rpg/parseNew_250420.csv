 Overall review and problem.  This game was good for 1 year. Things went horribly downhill. I am a very experienced player, i've built some of the most epic buildings in the game, i am a very known player, my name is Chris_Ramos.  I joined the day 19/10/2014.Owner of 10 towns, proud maker of Russian themed cities, glitch blocker and an absolute fighter for opinions. What do i mean with that? I don't want anyone to get repressed for sharing it's own opinion, like it happend to me.Some months ago couple of friends got banned for their own reasons. The developer (Sim9) not having enough fun he banned some of his old players to see if that made him feel better.♥♥♥♥♥♥move, he split the community in half. Game Forums They weren't dead before this enraged developer banned everyone asking ""Why did my friends get banned??"".Any kind of protest was completly removed with the thread itself.Now just 11 year old kids trying to become moderators of this game wander in the forums flipping the ♥♥♥♥ over when someone posts a noob question or a simple swear. REPORT REPORT REPORT!! Hermit & Kyro  Here is where things go to♥♥♥♥♥♥ They both were game moderators, one posted a funny meme about the infamous ""Mini-mods"", moderators wanna-be.Sim9, the enraged developer, got so angry that someone posted a meme he PERMANENTLY BANNED THIS MODERATOR.At this point you are asking ""Who the ♥♥♥♥ is Kyro then?"" A retired mod of course! Mememaster, dank overlord of belair. After he noticed this lil' kiddo banned his friend for posting memes, he got ♥♥♥♥ing angry you bet.He went in-game and had a little discussion.After that he got an obvious ban. After this, it shocked me that the dev didn't even care about it. For 2 years those moderators been supporting this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community based game. Around only 4 players i trust. That includes my best friends. Why do i hate this ""Sim9""?  After i was complaining that he should be on a better mood when checking forums he♥♥♥♥♥♥fury all over the chat.I told him to learn to take jokes, welcome to the internet.He Hard-muted me, he permanently banned me on IRC, and he disabled my posting in the forums. (I am currently banned on those 3 medias). Who were you even? Translator of the game, also beta tester of March Of Industry, 9bitMMO (his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3D game) and i was going to be a moderator. Rejected this, never become a mod, you get tied to follow this♥♥♥♥♥♥s rules.(I also was friend with all the legends, etc.) What is bad about the game? Besides the 10 year old kids griefing all the wilderness, ♥♥♥♥ing up the chat and begging to be citizens, the game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible, looks like the engine this was made with is called ""Royalty Free Engine"". You can't build over 120 Z-Axis because the game bugs. The tutorial makes you clueless about anything, the humour is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ The character model is amazingly detailed (approx. 8 pixels), also that the ""Sandbox"" is a whole new feature in this unique game, you must pay for every single block, and the game itself doesn't tell you how to grind gold, you have to ask someone to tell you to go to ""/tele Megazoo"", which was made by a rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who loves being the developer's pet. What about the ""Frequently Updated!"" feature? Look, hun. It's 13/2/2016 and since december of 2014 we don't get an update with something actually useful.The only updates are about ""GAME IS GETTING H4XD UPDATE UR PESSWORD!!!!11ELEVEN"", how come it not been hacked before? This game is broke, you get stuck in the floor if you have lag, and the dev aknowledged that you can no-clip through walls if you are buggy enough. Is it worth a try? No. Unless you want high volume cancerigenous fail of dubstep music that loop over and over, newbies that can't use chat or explain themselves properly everywhere and experienced players leaving you aside, ignoring you or just trying to scam you, don't try this crap unless you want to give it a nice rub in the negative reviews section. You have over 2000 hours on record. I used to like the game. Very much, my love knew no bounds for this. Too sad the dev was a♥♥♥♥♥♥when everything was going uphill. Thinking he can just shut me up to prevent noobs knowing the truth behind this, do you really think you can stop me, Robby? Ban me, i dare you. But first i take my translation back, and the $50 i gave you. Oh! because in this game you have to pay to have cool♥♥♥♥♥♥ F2P? P2W? Mostly Pay to Enjoy. You can't buy cool♥♥♥♥♥♥unless you buy plat items for unfair prices.To have a real town you must pay 10 Dollars. Is it worth it? NO. because it's a 9 region place, you have to expand it at least 5 times to have a decent place. Which expands go from 10p to 60p, around $200 to get a decent town.WHICH NOBODY WILL JOIN, BECAUSE THE GAME IS DEAD! YAY!  Game is dead?  Kill confirmed, amirite. 10-20 players online in this ""MMO"", lol, what a joke right? Why MMO? Dev thought this was going to be a cool idea. Don't ask me, ask him, if you don't get banned while asking, too.    3D game? you named that before, you don't fool me, ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Yes! 3D feature, isn't that ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic? you need to pay $30 to get it! It's basically the same game, same server.But glitchy as♥♥♥♥♥♥(more than the original, even.) EDIT: Region. Yes, there are 16x16 regions in this game, which you need at least 5p (5 Dollars) to expand 500 blocks of the region, this means you have a very limited space to build amazing♥♥♥♥♥♥ You either have to be rich to get to make something cool and you must delete all blocks that you are not able to see to save some space. This of course could ♥♥♥♥ up your experience, making 3D art is a bad idea.And if you bought those expensive piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥blocks you still have to buy more if you want to make your building large. Because regions are small as♥♥♥♥♥♥ 15p to max out the region limit which is at least 10 Dollars or more. With that money just buy any kind of game that is not this crap.Edit 2 was removed since it was unecessary, just showed off some pics of how many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ buildings are considered ""Building sensations"" to the game. Few cement houses with broken roof, resumed. EDIT 3: The end I got permanently banned the day 20/4/2016, the reason was a poorly made tactic directed to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like me. He deleted my latest post and wanted an agressive message from me to have an excuse to ban me without breaking his own rules. But he did break his rules by deleting a post that was harmless, friendly. All i said was that he should be disappointed at himself for doing such unproffesional thing and i called his moderator team Gestapo, that was the mostly offensive thing i have said to him besides all these insults in the review. How can you stop a 40 year old virgin from getting his revenge in his own rules? you can't, overall if he doesn't know how to react to internet.P.S: Stop adding me, i have plenty of friends. Thanks.			"

												I simply wanted to say this is neither 8-bit nor MMO, and a pathetic excuse of a game, but it seems like a lot of people invested significant amount of time to build and play this game, so I must add some thoughts.I guess its selling point is 100% player built world, which explains why everything looks messy, half-baked and crummy. Remember seeing similar phenomenon in MC freebuild servers. Very few builder-type core players may create something that's actually worth looking at, but majority of builders aren't so talented or got better things to do that the landscape ends up being filled with featureless assortment of random ugly structures. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that builders often end up losing interest rather quickly and abandon their pet project to go somewhere else and start anew, leaving behind ugly husks of their former obsessions which only serves as roadblocks to newcomers trying to explore the world. And I mean UGLY. Can't even tore them down and they're littered with spikes which results in instant death for your newly created character. Really hope there were options for these abandoned structures to self-destruct and morph into forest or something.I've no idea how some reviewers say ""tutorials were fun as hell"", but I dunno, different taste I guess. Starter dungeon is a joke. Rectangular cage with mobs that spawn all over the place and they won't even fight back properly. Having said that, fighting is a joke. Lag is crazy and you only have one weapon to ""fight"" moving around in 2D plain; go figure. NPC interaction is a joke. No storyline, no dialogue, no interaction worth caring. Had you ever played any other modern MMOs you'll know beyond doubt this ""game"" calling itself MMO is a joke. Quests are irrelevant, NPC jokes are equally terrible and quite frankly feels like the writers are insulting you for wasting your time playing this game. This game would've been good in the last century, but the year is 2015 and it is clearly out of time.Music is pretty good though. "

								""Platinum"" is required to build your own town, and must be bought with real money.  And it takes a lot of it.  This may be a good game to try if there are some major changes made, however i would not waste my time or money on it until then.The best thing, however is the developers sense of humor. However MOST of the game is player built and MOST people do not share the same humor or intelligence. There are a LOT of misspelled words in the player built areas. Sometimes i could not even guess the meaning!  The leveling up is very repetitive, at some point you will discover you cannot do some things in the game without real money (to buy Platinum).  The player driven quests were the most unique feature, however, many of them are broken or too long or boring to be interesting. The most time i spent in game was trying to complete two player driven quests only to have no way to finish them. Homes people build are mostly empty, and you can only explore so many towns with nothing to really do in them. And you are unable to interact with most items. So no world exploring there , either.

Hmm...The concept is good, but there are some things I don't like. First and foremost, there are way too many microtransactions (AKA in-app purchases). To build something, you need to buy every single block with coins. To gather enough of them, you have two options; either keep playing and get them (which takes forever) or buy them with real money. So, by that aspect, you may feel kinda scammed, like I did.Regarding the gameplay, it is really difficult to build. You'll have a hard time trying to place a block over another. Try it for your own, you'll see. Sometimes, the block hiding system doesn't work, thus making it impossible to play inside a room.But wait, there are positives; as I mentioned beforehand, I liked the concept, even though it's not new. There is also a fully functional anti-grief system, which I admire, as there is no such thing in Minecraft or Terraria (yet).			"

												If your looking for a good, play-to-win game, this is not it.Firstly, to build anything, you have to buy the blocks with money you earn veeery slowly. or buy them with MICROTRANSACTIONS. its buggy as hell, the community is horrid, the FIRST mission is a grind.

								The concept of 8BitMMO is great. A 100% player built world with combat and an infinite world? Sounds great, right?The way it's executed, however, isn't as great.Before I say anything else, I do /NOT/ believe that you need good graphics to make a good game. That being said, this games graphics are one of the major issues with this game. The majority of the tutorial is telling you what you're even looking at, for example how to distinguish an overpass from the floor below. I think this game would be MUCH better if it had depth. the way it is constructed makes it difficult to tell where you are in comparison to anything. When you go under something, it dissapears, but that leads to even more confusion when trying to navigate through someones building. Furthurmore, when attenpting to build, you must puild from north to south unless using slabs. Attempting to do otherwise causes you to place the block on top of the previously placed one. Trying to build roofs or multi-story buildings is a pain, and the game doesn't tell you how to place blocks in the air without building up untill after you've placed 30 blocks. This wouldn't be an issue, except for the fact that you need gold to buy blocks. In order to get gold, you need to kill enemies, which is a good concept, but as with the rest of the game, is poorly done. The combat in this game consists of either jabbing a super-close ranged sword at the enemy, or using a pixel pistol to shoot the foes down. Aiming properly is difficult, and even if you use the swords, combat is extremely bland and difficult. There are so many things wrong with this game, the few things it does right are not enough to counter them. Like I said before, the concept is great, but I do not recommend this game.			"

								This is by far one of the worst games I have ever wasted my time on. I'm pretty sure I played the SimCity beta for longer. I mentioned a few problems I had on the forums, and this is when I decided to make this review. They ♥♥♥♥ing banned me, for TRYING TO HELP THEM IMPROVE THEIR GAME. No, you ungrateful♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥go ♥♥♥♥ yourself. Just because mommy and daddy gave you the money to kickstart this game doesn't mean you can walk around like you are some big dev company and anything that anybody says against you is wrong. I could rant in detail about all the things I found stupid with this game, but I'll give a summary. In the time I played I already received a repeat quest. I discovered that building things is PAINFULLY difficult. Also, this is NOT LIKE MINECRAFT in terms of building a world. You have to buy the blocks, with either in game money or real life money. Actually you can buy anything with real life money because this game doesn't even hide the fact that they simply want all your money and could care less about the game. The combat system..... or if you can call it that, is ""press space at stuff"", and is one of the worst combat systems I have ever had to deal with. Overall 0/10This is the worst MMO game I have ever played and I will tell all my friends and everyone I know to avoid this game like the plague.Edit: Of course this game -has- potential. But it's hella neglected and the devs obviously don't care. They got their money and went on vacation. This could be a good game, but as it is now it's an absolute waste of time.			"

												It was hard for me to find pros for this game, but I'll try to make a comprehensive list:PROS:Good casual MMORPG with user-built quests to ensure new quests are added to the systemYou will be called names that you never thought you would be called after elementary school ended, like ""poopy head"", dork, and ""fart sniffer""This game will make you reminisce the days when you were between 9 and 14 years old.CONS:Community is between 9 and 14 years old; no, that's not me trolling them, they are literally between 9 and 14 years old. Do not expect a good community here, because it just isn't good.Game is way too easy, even without the purchase of plat because of individuals who have made ""farming zoos"", which spawn creeps and grant incredibly easy gold/exp. If you don't use them, you will be way behind.You will be called names that you never thought you would be called after elementary school ended, like ""poopy head"", dork, and ""fart sniffer"".Mods are also between 9 and 14 years old.The graphics look like they were created by someone between 9 and 14 years old.

								 I dind´t play too much, but from what I played, 8BitMMO is a trying hard to be nerdy, I mean, hipster dungeon, and I am like ""ha, wait, do we still make hipsters jokes?""Gameplay: Clunky, a basic grinding MMO, go kill this, do that, so boring and repetitive, the combat sucks, press SpcBar to attack, but the range of the sword is bad, and it´s pure random, 50% of the times that you strike at point blank range, you miss. Building is a mess, the perspective doens´t help, and the UI is all over the place, and yes, you can build cool stuff.Storyline:  You wake up in the Dev home, for real like, haha, a unfriendly first meeting, but I think the game is just a big parody, and it doens´t have a plot.Bussiness Model: WTF? Seriously? I mean, everything is so pricey, and you gain so little Gold, but no fear, you the wonderful overpowered microtransations, I mean, in Brazil, where I live, R$(Real, Brazil´s money) or BRL, it costs the double of the dollar, so that pricey ultra duper whatever gold pack costs here 400 R$!(200 U$D!)Aesthetic: It sucks. it ins´t 8 bit btw, it´s boring and bland.Overall: Good Concept, Bad Execution. And I understand for example the aesthetic being crap(Cuz is retro and intentional),but it doens´t excuse an poor and obnoxious title like this.			"

												Several months ago, I wrote a review for this game and said that I have not abandoned my willingness to change this game for future players. Now I have. In the past, I talked about the various changes this game could use because I cared enough to believe this game can be improved. I truly thought there was hope for improvement. This game left me with nothing more than disappointment for my own inadequacy to change it, and the frustration that it has been left unchanged. With no omission of detail, I will describe all the injustices of this game I have endured and eventually, what led to my eventual retirement.I am a well known player, and I have received numerous achievements including the community's recognition for my candidacy as a moderator. As of this review, it has been about a year since the developer displayed any intentions of enlisting new moderators. Over the course of two weeks, I built this game's only non linear open-world quest. To compensate for the lack of NPC's in the game, I created makeshift ones with pumpkins and hid signs on every NPC, amounting to over 3000 words of dialogue. This construction received no recognition and the only part of the quest that received any major attention was a large boat that represented the last part of the quest.I built a tutorial for this game to remake the current one. The current tutorial cannot be considered, in any shape or form, a tutorial. It teaches basic controls, but it omitted the most important and preliminary components of any mandatory tutorial. There were no instructions on how to build, how to obtain gold, or even how to use the shop.  Most players are turned away in utter confusion for the game's mechanics. Despite spending well over 40 dollars of premium currency on construction of a new tutorial, the developer declined before I even showed him what I made. I reconstructed the spawning area for players. The current one is vestigial other than a mild utility of teleport links to two mandatory dungeons; the rest lead to dead cities and abandoned PVP arenas. This too, was declined without a second thought. I reported two major exploits regarding 9bitmmo (the experimental 3D game viewer).One allows unlimited gold farming and the other allows no-clipping through walls at will. The first was fixed within the day I reported it, and the second has yet to be fixed. The developer has no intention of fixing the second exploit stating simply, ""people can already no-clip through more nefarious means"". To this day, no-clipping through walls in 9bitmmo leaves all areas open to theft and quest exploitation. I created this game's first and only Megabuild, a castle that spanned the size of a 6X expanded town. The premium currency spent in its construction approaches well over 500 dollars. The most publicity it received was a visit by the developer and publicity on Facebook, twitter, and the sidebar for about two weeks. No monetary compensation was rewarded for its construction, and a teleport pad was never added to the spawn area for players to visit this place.I contributed 400 dollars in donations towards the Novemberbit fundraiser event, amounting to 1000 dollars under my name. The only prize for donating this exorbiant amount is a custom item created and implemented under the name of the donator. Ever since the creations of items for the zealous donators of the game, no other items have been added.What made me quit this game eventually is the ignorance of the developer to sympathize with the players of this game that truly want to make it better for others. If there is criticism to be heard, it falls on deaf ears. It has been over a year since a new building block as added to the game and almost mockingly, the developer still hovers over the forums and regulates posts that criticize the declining state of the game. Chris_Ramos is correct in his review when stating the incident where two game moderators were banned. It is also true he wrote the Spanish translation for the entire game and for compensation, the developer gave him ONE DOLLAR. Even the head moderator of the game was not granted a response when he sent an email asking for an explanation behind the lack of updates. The reason he does not improve the game is not because of a lack of time or budget, it is due to his obstinate and outright refusal to do so. What the developer has committed, and is continuing to commit, is no longer within the moral realm of right or wrong. There are players who have donated thousands of dollars to this game and are taken completely for granted, their doubts met with only trivial responses as they ponder the future of the game. It is no longer a morally questionable demeanor, it an ethical crime. Because nothing categorically imperative in his actions can be considered correct; his actions indicate only a betrayal of the players' loyalty and zeal in favor of a personal agenda. In the past I would ask players to play the game before forming a judgment, and to approach it with an open mind. But with the way the game currently is now, it has no future. Not for as long as the players' loyalties are met with an utter betrayal of expectations.			"

BLOCK.

												I played this, I tried to make my own pokemon center only to find that the possible items are like.. 10 all in all. If you're going to make an 8bit game then for heaven's sake make 100 at least items or make a creator and let the users in a workshop do your dirty work. The weapons are also 8 or something (including a sword, a blue sword, a red sword... (not kidding)). Again if you're going to make an 8bit game put spells and stuff or at least an axe and a spear or a bow. Placing gray boxes with a roof cannot keep you playing even if you do it with friends. This game has the same effort put into it as a school project or a hobby you're not that much into...			"

												After playing for a few day, I feel like I can give an honest review.Hours 1-3: Learning the game and how to build. Ran the beginning dungeons to get XP to build more. So far, enjoying the game.Hours 4-14: Running dungeons are pretty stupid. All of them are player made and all look the same. Learned the best way to make a town is to grind gold in a very Destiny ""Loot Cave"" method. Basically just click a wall thousands and thousands of time to loot gold. Game itself has become boring, but kept playing to unlock more items and finish my town.Hours 15-16: Finished my town {which is the only enjoyment I really got out of this game}. Decided to explore neighboring towns to only find a wasteland of unfinished and random buildings. Its like an entire world of builders just vanished from a plague... of bordom. At this point, I feel like I wasted hours playing this game... Should have played MineCraft...For a game that has been out for a year. This game is VERY lacking. Its supposed to be an MMO, but with a level cap of 5, that doesnt allow much progress besides building a town with very little crafting matierals. If this game had more pieces to build with and better dungeons, this game would be a lot better. DEVS need to go into the world and start deleted abandoned creations, because at this point, its just random crap everywhere and doesnt feel like a player created world...This game has potential and there seems to be a few people who love this game... I, just like so many others, find this game to be very boring and a poor sandbox builder...Would i recommend? Maybe... Some people really love it, but as a whole, this game sucks. If they added more content and the players actually made dungeons worth playing, I would give a higher score. 4/10			"

Posted: January 9, 2014
												TITLE: Worst MMO I have played Ugh, I know a bunch of people are going to dislike this, but I got bored. That's why i only played 2.5 hours. Ok, now the reasons.  8BitMMO is a fully player built world, that's a bad idea because there will be a bunch of players leaving blocks everywhere that serve no purpose. The game also has a town system, but whats the point if I can't move my house? I worked hard on it, I don't want to abandon it. Plus I spent in-game coins on it, YES I had to spend my gold on those blocks. And it would be annoying to clean it all up. Also, the building system is bad. I have to go into my inventory, select the item, click the box to drop it, and that's it. Why can't I just select the block I currently have, and place it, like in games like Minecraft. Also, the game is shallow, there are only 3 npcs that give you quests. I would like more npc quests to be added, like in other mmos, so I don't have to run around doing horrible player quests, (more on that later). Also, i'm at level 3, I keep completing quests, and i'm not level 4 yet.  I'm still in the first 5 levels, what the heck i should be leveling up faster. Also there's this place that looks fun that I need to be level 4 though. You know why i'm not level 4? Because of the bad player quests. The players make horribly lazy quests, a lot of the time, they don't put me where the quest is, they give me directions that don't seem to work, and I get lost. Also once, I got a quest where I had to collect keys, and the only keys I found belonged to someone else. Thanks whoever made that quest. I even got a quest to visit a gold/xp farm. Does the developer even monitor this game? What doesn't help is that I progress slowly, and I keep getting the quests I don't want over and over again.  I never get anything new. I would actually like basic quests, that don't force me, TO FIND WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED! Sorry, had to release my anger. Anyways, these are basically the only quests I have seen other than tutorial quests, i'm not kidding. The shop is also bad, they have a very small selection. Also, this is the only place to get blocks. Why can't I find them in places, and gather them them for free? And do they expect to me to pay real money to build a town? It should just be an expensive in-game money price. I know they need money, but if they want my money, they need to get more items in the shop people would actually pay for. Even dungeon items cost real money. Isn't that the main selling point of the game!? Its like if you had to buy the building aspect in Minecraft! Some nitpicks about the game, is the block system. If I try to put a block, between 2x2 wall, the block I placed does not go on the ground, it goes in-between the two top blocks. It makes building a hassle and wastes the player's time. Also, there are only 3 enemies I have seen in the regular world. I know the game is a work in progress, but there should have been more enemies. Some major things are that the game is grindy. It takes FOREVER to level up. I haven't gotten to see what that dimension I found is like. Also I don't see a friends list anywhere. Is an MMO supposed to be social? Then where is the friends list!? Overall, the game is right now in a bad state. With problems everywhere, a bad shop, bad player quests, and some other things, this is the WORST MMO EVER! The developer/developers need to get help, or this game will not prevail. This is a game that right now, has a terrible alpha. The only positive is that it's free. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay money for this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I give it a 2/10 HORRIBLE. This is Qwerty, signing out.Also if this was made by one developer, he needs a bigger team.			"

								This whole game's one of the clunkiest I've played in a while, and not even the funny kind. Just straight up frustrating.The construction is unwieldy as all heck. First, you have to buy all materials from the shop (I'll get to the cost later). Then it becomes a fight with the camera angle to even build a decent house with a roof. Let me tell you, a ""slightly"" top down view is NOT a good angle for anything construction related. There are even cases where the walls completely block certain tiles, not only making it feel like you're building blindfolded, but also forcing you to deconstruct everything just to build whatever it was the walls were blocking.The combat... Oh the combat. Unless you're ranged, it's almost impossible to battle without getting hit. Normally this would be fine, damage is inevitable, but considering how few hitpoints you get, the damage adds up. Ultimately, you'll be finding yourself dying and going back to the beginning of the world. Even as ranged, there's also the case of extreme respawn times, so be prepared to get shell-shocked.Speaking of worlds, quests are pretty much your only option to even hope of getting decent money and EXP. It takes an EXTREME amount of gold to get enough to build anything past a small house. So unless you like running at cheap enemies, you'll have to do quests. Again, this would normally be fine, but after the initial quests, every quest you get is randomized, and I mean RANDOMIZED. It takes no account what level you are or anything. With some quests taking place in worlds locked behind level requirements, this is a major problem. This is countered with the ability to talk to the quest giver for a different quest, but the number of awful quests to cycle through is astounding. From continuous pixel-perfect gauntlets given to beginners, to ultra vague scavenger hunts, it's like there was no effort put into filtering the good, the bad, and the ugly.Finally, the cost. Like I said before, every block in the game costs coins, heck, even entering certain doors cost coins. I'm talking about an extravigant number of coins. With the small, convoluted shop menu, it's almost impossible to find what exactly you want. Pair that with the cost of everything, good luck trying to build something actually worth looking at. They're practically making you pay to get anything good, and even good's a strong word.This game has no soul. It feels like something thrown together and then presented as an enchanting ground breaking indie game. It doesn't even try to hide the amount of cynicism it throws at you. Even what few NPCs are shown are extremely cynical. Jokes are fine, but having sarcastic remarks the only things NPCs say to you in an already soulless husk of a game just spits in your face. I'm sorry.			"

												I put quite a few hours into this game, as well as bought the founder's pack to help support the dev. The game has a small amount of people that play, and it really feels like my own world rather than an MMO. The world is also very littered with the blocks from people who played the game for maybe thirty minutes, and never came back. I will probably check in every now and then. If your computer is a potato, download 8bitMMO, if not, download Trove instead.			"

												This game is why i could remove games from my library. Believe me, i tried to do it.Let me describe the game to you.>Start game and get past first part without vomiting at how horrible this game looks. Minecraft had a unique style that was blocky but tolerable, this is unique and awful though.>Kill some feline lawyers for two cents each, while holding your stomach because of how your sword looks like a stick,>Go through a portal to the overworld and get some quest. Let me describe these quests. First, the building quests.>Place a block>Place 10 blocks>Place 20 blocks>Place 50 blocks>Place 100 blocks>Place 1000 blocks.>Good job, you win a cookie.The merciless slaughter of suit-bearing cats quests:>Kill a cat,>Kill 20 cats.>Kill 100000000000000000000000 cats.>Then, you get a horrible, horrible, horrible barren plane of existance to build on while being short on funds. It doesnt even have grass. Couldnt spend the extra money on it i guess, since you already have no money.>Have fun building anything, there arent any items to build with.And you know what the worst flaw is?I couldnt play it on steam. I had to launch it in firefox, which was a whole separate kind of chore. Worse than the cat slaughter, and the block placing, and etc.This is a god awful game, dont take the few minutes to download it, they are seconds that could be better spent.			"

								Where to start..When I first entered the game, there was a lot to learn, and even in the tutorial area, it was difficult to understand it all, especially with so many people in one area. I know this is only because there's only two servers.After that, I walked into a random room and instantly began seeing potty mouths and spammers. Most MMOs have these, but it's very annoying.Everything else went fine, the first 2 dungeons were interesting, but then I ran into a problem. I had been getting the same two player quests that were both broken/glitched, and could not be finished, thus I spent 30 minutes trying to get to level 3, farming gold for blocks. It would of been nicer to be able to choose which quest you get.Basicly, if you want to make your place public, you must pay money for it, which is fine, but it's simply something I wouldnt pay money for yet. Maybe give the option to pay a lot of gold for a small town, where only a few people can enter at a time, otherwise the place you build is basicly your private home, which is something I dont usually care to do. Strip this feature away and it becomes a pointless, spam-filled, glitched building system, MMO.The servers are laggy, and full of undesirables. In a couple of months these things might be changed, but as far as I can tell, it's definitely not worthy of being played just yet. They should of kept it under development until a stable game was put out.			"

								This game is very simple but it does not fit the MMO genre. Instead, it is more of a make-shift Creative MMO, similar to Lego Universe (with a weak MMO aspect).There is lots of room for improvement in nearly every aspect.1. The GUI is terrible it needs a overhaul, or at least a opacity option (so that it doesnt get in your face)2. The economy is too unbalanced; building blocks are too expensive3. The ""wilderness"" is just empty. It needs features like hills or terrain.4. I don't like the idea of man-made dungeons. They should be randomly generated in the wilderness.5. The quests rewards are too little and the experience system is too large. (It takes 2-3 quests to level up)Enduring the poor quality in this beta will really help you for the future, if you like MMOs (as it's easy to get everything; took me 5min of grinding to buy the gear I needed, and will really help when it improves.EDIT: Someone needs to fix the signage preview and dialolgue window!

												This game was amazing (not).I got extremely addicted and paid real money (£7).Then a few days later I return and get my account banned for life.After this I make a new account to ask why I got banned and then my IP is suddenly banned for life for having an alt.Thing is, they never had clear rules of what I can and can't do, this is a horrible P2W game.

												TLDRyou have to spam spacebar for literally (and i mean literally i am not just using it for emphasis) 9 hours to get say a publicpad from a shop that you don't even know will have it. Even if your satisfied never using premium blocks it will still take forever to build something cool after spamming the spacebar for longer.Quests need more tools and quest incentives should be premium currency. The inflation can't be fixed at this point (I assume)The long versionOn the off chance that anyone actually reads this or finds this helpful, this is what the game is.First i want to start off by saying i don't know why i play this game anymore. If your thinking ""hmmm sandbox mmo might be interesting"" it's hardly either of those things, or if your thinking ""if the players make the world its probably filled with spammed blocks"" and thats absolutely true, but aside from that and the drama between some (lets say) long time players here is whats wrong.The ""quest"" systemI figured i'd start with the most obvious and most ignored part of the game. See the quest system is where most of the games problems begin. basically theres only 6 levels and your limited by the type of quest you can create because of the tools you have at your disposal. Most quests are Mazes,find the keys in the maze, get through the maze with invisible spikes,parkour with blocks you can't tell the height of(unless your in 9bit 3d mode which costs 30$),all of the above, or my personal favorite no quest at all.Once you get to level 6 theres no incentive because you gain a measly 50 gold and no exp.Farming or zoothe previous issue extends into this.see zoo's or gold farms are places where you can stab downward through a wall by spamming spacebar to gain gold from spawners. Naturally this broke the economy and inflated prices because now gold is too easy to get and now theres no incentive to do quests other than leveling to 6. To be clearer, the shop item never changed price, but there are items that can only be bought with premium currency. so platinum shops were created where people would sell platinum items for gold. Those were the prices that inflated. but the fact that you have to pay for regular blocks in the first place means if you want to build something cool you better have A)a town or a lot of space in the wilderness to do it B) be extremely patient or pay up the wazoo. Possible solutionsquestsWhile it's a long way from fixing or making the game worth playing in any way, my suggestion would be to make it so that rewardblocks give off platinum sure you can't get a reward block twice, but it's premium currency anyway so it would help players be able to get items they want by completing quests and while i realize that this is not a complete solution it's the best i can come up with. That being said players need more tools to create decent quests like npc's that can be interacted with maybe they give you items (That aren't keys) that can be put into a quest item inventory even that would be a start.farming and inflationI would say there is one, but unfortunately there isn't.it all started from a bug that allowed you to stab downward through a wall thats never been fixed.That's all that needed to be done to fix it, yet it's come to the point where certain people would be very reluctant to change their prices if this problem was fixed. they don't need your gold they are selling it to you out of ""courtesy.""you know a certain someone even got touchy when i asked him why /tele awesome place was worth 1,000,000 gold i get that your paying for a title (because it's apparently the default suggestion for a telepad name) but even then i doubt even the minority of the players who can afford it would buy it.My final thoughtsThis game could have had so much potential but there are things wrong beyond what i have listed (because the other steam reviews cover them) and this game was really only held together by the  now long dead community. There are over 884,000 registered players and only about 20 will be playing at any given time at maximum. I don't want to dislike this game, but it's a shame that i do.Congrats intrepid explorer!if you got through the grammatical errors, my long rant, and the fact that my final thought wasn't final then you deserve a word of advice. If you decide to play this game and you see me in chat acting like a child although im almost technically and adult and spamming spacebar for the gold cycle instead of doing my biology homework or hanging out with my non-existant friends...Say hello.

												8BitMMO is an action MMO with 8bit graphics... Yes, I know.So, you have a character and a sword, you clear dungeons created by other players and buy stuff to make buildings or dungeons, that doesn't sound so bad, right? Keep reading... You buy with gold that you get through either killing mobs, clearing dungeons or buying with real money. The problem here is variation, the game is boring, there are only about 5 kind of enemies, three types of weapons, the dungeons and cities are all done with the same about 8 kind of blocks you buy in the store... Making this the more repetitive, boring and grinding MMO I've ever played, not to mention its level design...★★☆☆☆ | Disliked it "

												This game kind of gets boring after a while. It at first was really fun, I enjoyed getting better gear, messing around with my pocket universe, and exploring the map. It slowly gets... kind of dull after a while though. CombatThe enemies in this game are all the exact same, except they look different and have different stats. They will try to run at you, and hit you after 5 seconds. Needless to say, they are very easy to kill. PVP is pretty engaging at first, but gets old really quickly. You have 4 types of weapons that each work differently, and considering there is only one developer, this isn't that bad. The issue is the weapons themselves. There are three swords, exactly the same except in damage. There is a gun, that shoots little friendliness pellets at people, and it controls alright. The laser is pretty weird, you charge it for a few seconds, and it shoots a straight line. People actually have made good use of this in pvp, but it seems extermely easy to dodge. Lastly is the hammer, doing a massive area damage, but taking a while to charge. Each of these weapons can be specialized to do well in pvp, and people have become really good at pvp in this game. Regardless, it does get dull quickly, however it is worth trying out. CommunityThe community is actually pretty helpful, when I played this game, I actually learned a lot from other people. The only issue is that for an MMO, there is pretty much nobody. 5-10 people are usually online at a time, which is pretty small considering a huge part of the game is Towns. It would be a much, much better game if it were more active. Because of recent events I have heard of (and not participated in, and as such will not talk about), and the game not really being updated, I doubt this will happen easily. The community that is there is fine, though.BuildingIronically, this is probably the worst aspect of the game. Well, second worst. The mechanics are not that bad, it just takes getting used to. The issue is often, unless you are an expert and know what your doing, it won't turn look very good. This wouldn't be that bad if more materials were available, but microtransactions make it worse.MicrotransactionsI get it, I honestly get it. There has to be a way for servers to keep running, so microtransactions are used. Honestly though, when I get a game, I want all the features available (minus DLC, that's different). It's a bit like PVE, and PVE2. Plants vs Zombies costs some money, but it gives all the features immediately. Plants vs Zombies 2, on the other hand, is free. However, there are many micotransactions. I would rather just pay the $5. Not only do items cost money, though this is forgivable considering items aren't necessarilly needed, and they are obtainable through mystery boxes, but towns and pocket universes need money. Towns need money to make, and money to expand. Pocket Universes need money to expand. Even dungeons, a large gimmick of this game, need money to make. The good news is it's easy to get some items via players, and there are shops that sell them. The bad news is they are really expensive.StyleThe style of this game is actually not that bad. It doesn't look really good, but it's alright. The music is really on your taste, however. I personally don't mind it, but I can easily see people turn off the game after 5 minutes from it. It's essentially 8-bit dubstep. Ironically, it is one of the only aspects of the game that doesn't get old after a while.Final Verdict8-bit mmo, dispite it's flaws, is a fun game. It is a nice little game to pop in every now and then, mess around with, and leave. It isn't by any means horrible, but it isn't a masterpiece either. It's pretty fun for the first 10-20 hours, but then gets dull, depending on your taste. That being said, you should try it out, and if it isn't your style, forget about it. Because of the numerous flaws, and it being boring after a short while, I'm going to have to give it a 5/10. See if you like it, but if it doesn't look like your cup of tea, skip it.			"

 Why I nominated this game      I nominated this game for standing the test of time. No matter how deserted the game becomes, the people I have met in the game always make me come back for the rare chance that we have some minigames to play. That is why I nominated 8BitMMO despite my review. (Written 11-23-2016 AT 12:18 PM) Disclaimer    Though my hours may seem low compared to other people who have reviewed this game, they aren't. I have played well over 1,000 hours of this game total combined with Steam and the Standalone version. With that said, lets get started! Oi! Also. I am working on making this review better. Mainly because this review right now seems one sided. Till it is updated. Please don't take the review as ""completed""  Tl;dr or something    This will sum up the review if you would rather not read a giant thing of words. The only reason I don't recommend this game is because of recent events in-game. The main Dev went insane and banned two mods. Then everyone freaked out and a lot of stuff went down hill from there. Building    Argh, the building in this game is...weird, different, clunky, any word like those can describe the building in 8BitMMO. The angle that you play at contributes a HUGE part in how you build. At the angle you play at you have to build the back of your building first,them the sides, then the front. If not done in this order, your building will not turn out right. To combat this, you would have to buy the ""DLC"" called 9BitMMO. It is just a 3D viewer for the game that costs  35 dollars!  this is outrageous just for a 3D viewer for the game! Other than those flaws, if you are able to become an expert builder and learn all the tricks, you are then able to build some  insane  stuff! PVP    The PVP in this game is rather bland and boring with only 3 swords,  that are just recolored versions of each other that only do a little more damage  a pistol, a laser rifle, a hammer, and thats it. Being really good at PVP in the game is rather boring, being consider 2nd best my self; you can take it from me. Other than the weapons you can also heal your self in battle with chicken, steak, and a few other items.  Community    Ok, this is where I become split at where I should recommend this game or not. The community in the game is actually pretty ok! There are some friendly faces out there that can really brighten up your day! But then you have the rare trolls that come in and either start insulting people or just being cringe-worthy.  Rules and Moderators    The rules in this game are...ok? You aren't allowed to really swear besides being able to say ""Damnit"" and you are not able to spam either but that rule is normal. The moderators are also ok as well, from my experiences they are always fair and never take one side of the situation just because someone is their friend. They also never mute/hard-mute people when they don't deserve it  99% of the time.  Huge Pros and Cons  CONS  Dev who almost never listens to the community and starts going on a muting spree if you ask one simple question. Almost no active community at this point To build anything good you need to buy it with Platinum (Currency bought with real money) PROS  Gold is rather easy to get if you are an active player at farms. A lot of the players and mods are willing to help you if you have trouble. Plat items are able to be bought with in game gold, though a lot I might add. Ending Note(s)    In conclusion, 8BitMMO is an ""meh"" game with it's flaws, but until the Dev can get his **** together, this will stay negative.			"

								This game is painful. I started out enjoying it, but then I realized that I wasn't. The community is, mostly, the Roblox people but even worse. Trying to figure out where something is, where you're putting something, where you're going, and why you can't move hurts your eyes. Whenever you walk under something, it immediately goes invisible. When you walk through an actual person's structure, it flashes like strobe lights. Even more so, when you try to build in this abomination of a game, the fixed camera angle and no FOV fish-eye causes you to put things in the wrong place. The dynamics of building are repetitive and time consuming, not to mention that you run out of materials and you have to grind for hours to get more, or perform a microtransaction. Not to mention, anything put somewhere by a different person cannot be changed. Everybody's low-tier items clutter the ground of the wilderness, and as you walk over them the camera jerks up and back down once you've walked off. It hurts your head after a while, and they're EVERYWHERE. The community, again, is terrible. There is one other way to get money for materials. Player-made quests. What this means, is, you go in their headache castle, walk past traps with no possible way to recognize, see coming, or prevent, and get 1 unit from a currency dispenser at the end. The screenshots are the least cluttered thing in the entire game. Anything else looks like a preschooler's noodle art that they covered in glitter, then tried to flush down a toilet. The dragon that you saw when you clicked on the link to the game? If you tried creating that, you'd spend over $100 and 5 hours. If you do play this game, I did warn you. It sounds good, but it was executed worse than Napoleon's invasion of Russia.			"

Do quests, build and...Stop right there.Quests are gong into dungeons, slaying Hipsters by pressing space, until you level up.Building is pleading for someone to take you into his/her town so you can build a house.Animations are jerking figures I KNOW THIS IS A PIXEL GAME BUT THAT DOES NOT GIVE YOU AN EXCUSE TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A GAME WITH WORSE ANIMATIONS THAN PAC-MANHats are just, no,no			"

												I downloaded this game(against my better judgement) and found what i believe to be a game with a great concept that fell flat on its face because of its stupid devs. Even though I saw all the nasty, and concerning warnings NOT to get this game, I did so. Just a few minutes of gameplay showed that its community is DEAD, with no players (from my experience) the dev thinks he's funny, but really is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Even the controls and building/fighting system is confusing and broken, as my attempt to build a simple wall was confusing enough to make me want to quit. This game is only recomended for those who want to just cry because of how bad and quiet and terrible the ""community"" is.			"

												I have put in a lot of hours into this, almost 2,000 hours to be precise (played on 8bitmmo.net). I am a rather popular player and I have seen alot of things come and go in this. I joined around about june in 2014. | What it's all about |8bitmmo is game is an 8bit styled mmo, the game is in third person mode and follows your character around, which is pretty much a square with legs, arms, and a square head. To accompany the retro look it heavily features chiptune while you're playing the game (for all you nostalgia nerds out there!). In 8bitmmo, it is a very social game as the game revolves around a chat. With this chat, players wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. As the title says, you can literally build anything you want, from dragons to space ships, to pixel art and pirate ships, you can really do it all in 8bitmmo. You can even build quests for players, these quests are always built in towns in which give you your own personal area to build in.| Pros |- There is a postive and a thriving community who are all very welcoming.- The game has recently been released as an alpha and may be updated frequently.- You can build anything you want, as long as it's not innapropriate.- It's relatively easy to obatin gold, there is a farming cycle which lasts for 45 minutes and within that time, players can gain 2000 gold.- There is a market for premium items in which some players are willing to commit to keep the economy alive in the game.- You can have alot of fun in this mmo.| Cons |- The developer is not active.- Only a handful of players really stick around for a while, many players come and go.- The vast majority of new players are mainly 3 year olds who spam the chat all day long, it's extremely irritating.- This game calls itself an ""mmo"" yet there are only around 10 - 20 players online everyday, if you're lucky, this might be extended to 30 players.| Over all view |Personally, this is my favourite game and I do enjoy it. However, the game needs to be frequently updated and as a consiquence, many players aren't satisfied about the games slow development. Although the developer calls the game an alpha, in my eyes it's still a beta. It is still very basic and needs much more time and effort into the game. However, the community are very enthusiastic about new players and they are genuinly awesome people.| Rating |Overall, I'd rate 8bitmmo 8.5/10			"

												To start this game was developed by one person. Anyone who has ever coded anything will notice that the developer has most likely thrown his entire life and soul into this (which he has). This game has come so far, and has so much more potential. The community is friendly, and very helpful. Mods are on nearly 24/7, you can message the developer directly on IRC for quick replies. If you want an RPG then don't go here. This is a social, sandbox game. Everything you can do you can do without buying anything with real money. The MOST you have to do in the form of extra payment is buy premium items from other players with gold. Every single thing in this game is player built, and most of them are absolutely amazing. This game deserves so much more attention then it has right now.			"

								So, after tinkering around with this game for a short while, I've got an idea of this game. The graphics are pretty shoddy and look kinda off when you move, but they work (for the most part, anyway, determining what layer a block is on is tricky and overhangs just vanish when you're under them). The music is honestly quite enjoyable, but nothing fantastic. Gameplay is simple, but effective: both combat and building have little to them but still satisfied me nonetheless. The menus do their job, but aren't special and don't really look pretty. The NPCs have nice designs (and the ones that speak are often humorous) but enemy AI is incredibly simple and similar.I can't really comment on the MMO aspect, as I prefer playing solo. But for an MMO, I enjoyed my time alone, which is generally a good sign. I've heard complaints of being only playable if you shovel money into it, but I honestly didn't feel that way at all. Overall, the game is lacking. However, there are three factors that stop me from not reccomending this:1) The game is in early access. The biggest problems I have with this game (namely, the artwork and the simplicity) can be very easily fixed with future updates.2) There's just a certain...CHARM the game has. With it's designs and it's dialogue and it's style...there's just something about this game that I love, even if it isn't that great on closer examination.3) The game is free. There is really nothing stopping you from at least trying it out and making a decision.TL;DR: The game is simple and somewhat lazy, but charming and free.			"

								This game is pretty good if you pay money. It is also sort of good if you have friends to play with. Since I have neither, the game is quite a drag for me. I would recommend this game if you could earn plat. for free.			"

												This game is poorly made. You build 3D buildings in a 2D world. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? I honestly spend over half of my time figuring that out. I'll list some Pro's and Con's. Pros -Creative World Design-Interesting Characters (but terrible names.) Cons -Character Names (lawyer cat? dafuq?)-Impossible to build-Nobody is ever on, hardly a ""mmo""-The DLC's cost so damn much.-The combat is terrible. You can only knife. OVERALL 1/10.The only fun part is getting the achievments. Some are hard to get. Some are as simple as placing a god damn block. 8BitMMO, change your name to ""8BitPeiceOfShit"" because that will get you more people TO STAY AWAY THE TORTURE THEMSELVES WITH THIS.			"

												It's a good rpg but has the worst building mechanic ever. It's impossible to even make the simplest house. 5/10			"

												A pathetic excuse of a pathetic piece of garbage. You start off in some retard's pixel ""house"" and are told to GTFO. Then sent into a world where you all you do is press spacebar on NPCs and mutant rabbits. Not even 8bit and not MMO. You also need to buy blocks and other decorative pixels to decorate your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bloxy ""house"". Community almost like Graal Online but way worse. And back to building a pixel house. Once again, you spend ♥♥♥♥ing $$$ for blocks and place them. Almost like 2d minecraft. Wow, GOTY. This shouldn't be on steam.I wonder what idiots voted this up on Greenlight. 10/10 would uninstall again.			"

								I love the game. However, after a few minutes you will run out of things to do besides farm for gold, build, or write in the chat. If you are looking for progression, this isn't the game for you. If you want to hang out with friends, look at great builds, and speak with new people, then come join us!			"

												-Saw game-Played it because I like pixel-themed dungeon games-Dissapointed because it's a poorly made copy of ROTMG-Poor choice of weapons.-Place block. Place block. Place block. It's boring.-ugh.-Going back to the crappy Roblox RPG games.			"

												Do I reccomend this? Eh.... no.It's dead, really.By dead, I mean REALLY Dead, noone really plays it now.Yeah, some people are nice in this game, atleast I was nicely greeted.Yeah, the building is... Moderate.From the other reviews I saw, people don't like this game quite much. I enjoyed it though for some time... (11 hours)If you want to have a decent town, you have to grind quests, try to make cash, or just grind enemies for hours to get atleast 10000 gold, and still, if you want to have a big one, you need ACTUAL REAL CASH.Log of my 3 days:Just when I joined, I got greeted, and some people showed me round'.Then I got a pocket townstone.Then I made a town.Then a guy got in my town.Then I got a new steam friend.Then I got 2 more people in my town.Now I don't have space for my friend to build.Now I need a town extension.To be continued.

												How can an 8-bit game (that isn't actaully 8-bit) get frame rate lag? I tried to enjoy this but it's hardly playable. The community is irritating and the gameplay itself is significantly below the standerds for an MMORPG. I give credit to the developer for having a cool idea and trying, but this certainly isn't a good end product, if it can even be classified as an end-product.			"

8BiTMMO ReviewI have played 8BitMMO for a while now and I honestly can't recommend it as a free-2-play title. I'm fully aware of the difficulty of producing a game but this game is neither fun or interesting. There are many games out there like this, there is a massive range of issues plaguing the game and the game uses many different features in conjuncture that are just confusing and difficult. The UI is a joke, as well. CONCEPT:Possibly good on paper - an easy to access MMO that nearly anyone can play. 6/10GRAPHICS:Ugly. I understand that the ability to allow everyone to play the game needs modest graphics but this is just ugly and poorly animated. 2/10SOUND:I can't remember, to be honest. No voice acting and I can't even remember if there were sound effects. That fact alone is probably bad - if I can't remember them. 2/10PLAYABILITY:I guess it's playable for the most part but the developer tries his/her hardest to make it not playable with an uninspired UI, a boring economy and crafting system and a story that is quite simply... not existant. 2/10ENTERTAINMENT:The game amused me for roughly... 5 minutes. After that - there was no entertainment to be found... at all.1/10REPLAYABILITY:LowOVERALL SCORE: 2.5/10[/i] "

												It is quite a well made game but I found it quite boring at times. One because the quests are mainly boring like 'go and kill 10000000000000000 lawyer cats' (or somthing along those lines anyway). Also when you  are in your pocket universe you think 'yes! im going to build a city!' Then the next day you get bored so you just give up. i would give this game 4/10 +1 because it is free  +3 because alot of effort went into it e.g. building the entire world.			"

								This game is pretty funny. It's world is also very large, and entirely explorable. The game mechanics are simple, a bit too much for my personal tastes, but still responsive. Some of the features it mentions such as playing as a zombie requires platinum coins, these can only be obtained by buying them with real cash, however. WHY DO YOU PEOPLE DO THIS SWEET HELLFIRE ITS A FREE-TO-PLAY NOT WORLD OF WARCRAFT WHINE WHINE WHINE.In all seriousness, its fun for a while, and its free, so go ahead and download it. (Whine.)			"

								Disclaimer :  I have played some of the game, and got the basic gist of it, this review may not be accurate for later on in game, but if it's not, then I will be sure to make another one if it's not. Disclaimer over. Now, time to review. This game seemed like it got a lot of hate, I wondered why. I decieded to play it. The controls are...interesting. It takes a while to get used to. The story seems like the typical RPG game, random hero, do quests, kill enemies, grind for gold to get the decent cr@p. (Dont know if somepeople consider cr@p a swear, i don't, but i'm doing that for the people who think it is) The graphics are decent, aside from the character sprite who can't seem to turn his entire body at times. I had this one part when I turned north, my character sprite only turned to the right, and swung his sword through his back (or something like that, dont really know how to describe it). Other than that, the graphics seem fine. The beginning is crazy, and could make some people giggle or laugh. I have not advanced far in the game, but the quests I have done are basically all the same except for a couple factors changed. (ex : kill 21 lawyer cats.   next quest : kill 21 hipsters.     ex : place -object-      next quest : do the same thing with another object) I know they're all to learn how to do the basic stuff, but it's just all the same thing. I can see why most people do not like this game at all. I somewhat like it. It's in it's early stages, there are bound to be flaws. Hopefully, when the full game comes out, I hope the character sprites look better, i hope the quests get better, and I hope it excels with a decent enough fanbase. It has the potential to do a lot, but it hasn't done much yet.			"

								The wilderness is choked and polluted with unfinished buildings and random blocks lying around. One cannot find a proper and public place to build. The world is not infinite, and that being said, theres random bits and pieces of debris lying around from some long-vanished player. Combat is bland, even given the early access there is only a minimal variety of enemies and weapons. It also gives access to powerful weapons very early in the game, and enemy spawns are quite very visible, making even the newbliest noob an easy way to farm for gold and exp. Building is also a pain, as it is confusing and blocks tend to overlap and behave in an odd way. The biggest problem I had was the ""roofing"" system. Ceilings that are placed overhead vanish and reappear suddenly, leading to a flashing and annoying ceiling over your characters head. TL;DR: 1. Crappy Combat2. Crappy Building System3. Polluted Wastelands that rival those of Fallout4. If you've played Portal, you will get PTSD relapse from potatoes5. Pay to Build6.

												8bitMMO is a Very fun game. At certain times it can be very boring, depending on what players are online. It is a friendly game, except when people scam, spam, or curse. Be forewarned this happens quite frequently. When people buy plat or plat items, they either sell them or use them. Plat item selling is very common, so it is uncommon for people to buy plat. There are also items called mystery boxes, so you can buy plat items only with gold. There is so much you can do on this game! it depends entirely on what you want to do. If you like making pixel art, there are many blocks that provide colors to do so. One player (Sage) made realistic looking people using only blocks he/she could buy in-game. If you like being a popular and admired player, you can give or sell plat items. In total 8bitMMO is one of the best games i have ever encountered.			"

Very little variety in building materials, with the ""reward block"", teleporters, 3 traps, and the safe being the only interactable ones.  Only 4 enemies all melee, and only a couple items in 3 categories to change your looks.  That's even including the real world money required stuff.			"

								I think 8BitMMO is a great game for it to just be in early development. I would totally recommend it to anyone who is a fan of building/sandbox games and/or fighting games.I also would like to say that for a free game it is amazing. So I would recommend getting it now, especially if in the future you will have to play.			"

								8BitMMO, created by Robby Zinchak aka RobbyZ is a old school styled Free Roam Rpg. 8BitMMO is a game that takes inspiration from many games such as Minecraft, Legend of Zelda, and even Mario. In 8BitMMO you start off waking up in a man's house who is completely aware that he is in a video game by breaking the 4th wall. He sends you off to complete quests in order to just get you out of his house, he references that he has done this multiple times and that strangers waking up in his house has become a common problem for him. This snarky dialogue made me enjoy my first 10 minutes of the game, as it reminded me of dialogue coming from games like Saints Row. I love it when games make fun of the fact that it is a game. Unfortunately after the tutorial this dialogue seemed to cease and enjoyment of my gameplay experience began to decrease more and more. The combat in 8BitMMO is simple enough to play with one hand, with occasionaly reaching for your mouse. Only having the WASD keys for movement and the space bar for attacking made hunting quests and fighting off enemies a bore after the tutorial. There is also another element that makes 8BitMMO a little more entertaining; the ability to build. You are able to build a houses and environments like a top down Minecraft or Terraria. The building can become tedious with blocks stacking not the way you want them to and having a lack of tools to do anything truly spectacular. Although I didnt enjoy this feature, I did see many interesting and cool user created homes and even areas that put the building and combat to good use. The music is probably what I enjoyed most from 8BitMMO, it had beats that went along with the art direction and it had the convenient feature to skip the current song as if i was using Pandora radio. The game does have a leveling system like most other MMO's that encourage you to rank up in order to get certain items or get to certain areas. I have to completely honest and say that I didnt have a great time with 8BitMMO. It is free on Steam and does offer microtransactions, BUT doesnt flash them around begging for money. The game might be fun with a few friends looking to make your own quests and adventures but playing alone is just plain boring.Overall:8BitMMO has a lot of great ideas that just dont work out yet. After sometime and update the game can be great. The music fits in with the world perfectly and the combat is a little bland. In my opinion I would like to see RobbyZ create either more content for this game or make more games with the same amount of snark and wit that the tutorial of this game had. I loved the original dialogue and was set to play a game that knew how to make fun of its self but instead, I got a bland and lifeless world that could and should be improved dramatically. And could be alot of fun if your bored with nothing new to play or if you find a group to play with.(Roleplaying could be fun in this game)Verdict:7.0Worth a try.(hey its free!)			"

								Massivley multiplayer and massively FUN! Unlike Minecraft and Terreriayou dont have to spend money to make a server and the game it self is 100% FREE But if i had to suggest any problems with this game it would be the unavialibility on Mac and ADD MOAR HATS. This is not just an Average game, its a game for ALOT of things one other thing i might ask is the building if they could make that better because it happnes alot i build the wrong direction and i cant see behind the blocks and have to tear everything Down But Other than the Magic Side Effects This game is Great!

												For the most part, not a great game in terms of gameplay as Combat is cumbersome though it makes up for it in its simplicity. Opening and closing menu's could be refined as they are annoying to navigate when buying and selecting while building. The title is misleading as this game is not ""8-Bit"" nor is it a MMO.To put it simply, this game consists of grinding slowly, building, completing quests, leveling up, unlocking new blocks, grinding for those blocks, building again, chatting with people who are trying to get lucky over a game on the internet and then going back to grinding for that sweet new Pimp Suit you just unlocked.tl;dr It's REALLY repetitive and boring			"

												When I play a videogame (regardless of genre), I expect it to grab me by the arms and drag me into it's world. I want to be fully engrossed in it's universe, story, and gameplay.Personally, 8BitMMO did none of this for me.Now, I realize I didn't play this game for very long. I plan to play more of it in the coming days, to really give it a fair shot. I also realize that the focus of this game leans more towards user created content then a narrative-heavy experience. I GET that. But what 8BitMMo is supposed to do, it doesn't seem to do particularly well. It just hasn't made a great impression so far.PROS:--Somewhat clever sense of humor--Relatively empty servers--Easy to pick up and play--Does not require an email address to playCons:--World-building, an already slow and unintersting affair (and unfortunately the whole point of the game), is made more difficult via microtransactions.--Gameplay is fundamentally oversimplified, and not very interesting as a result.--Quests lack challenge and variety--Performance issues-notably server lag.It's just hard to reccomend an MMO like this when there are so many better experiences available.

												Honestly, this game was a disappointment. At first, this game looked amazing, fun, and well put together. But that's just in the trailor. The truth is,  when you actually begin to play the game, you notice a lot that went wrong. First, it's incredibly hard to figure out how to play. The tutorial doesn't tell you much at all about what you're supposed to do, or how to get started. Second, the block layouts are all very 'chunky' and hard to work with. You can barely tell where blocks actually are, what level they're at, or where a wall is.This game has a camera view very similar to old 8 bit games, but the view genuinely sucks. You can't even see the sides of blocks so even with the different layers, this game doesn't even have a 3d feel to it. Other than that, the character art is awful, battles don't make much sense, and I couldn't even figure out just by playing the game if there's an inventory system.In general, I would rate 8bitMMO 3/10. I just couldn't see a good side to the game.			"

								Free2play game (with in-game store of course), what more can you really say? It appeals more to kids or pixel indie game enthusiast types. It's fast paced, which is nice, but it's so freaking convoluted that it can give you a headache or be a bit overwhelming. I would give this a neutral vote because it is a free game, but in lieu of having an absence of that choice, I am downing the vote because of the huge headache it has given me. It also makes it a difficult game to play with friends and the building function, albeit cool, is nothing new nor entertaining. The best thing about the game is how huge the player-made world is. That brough some awe, but not enough to keep me in. But it's a free game, what do you have to lose to try?			"

								played maybe 5 minutes of it...(17 minutes to be exact)to be honest, it doesn't deserve a review, positive or negative, however I will do a short one for consumers who may be looking at this game......if you are looking at this game though....I'm sorry you stumbled upon this page.First things first:   yes yes, I know, I've only played 5 minutes of the game....but I want to be honest, this is my opinion..and to take 1 or 2 hours to do a full on review for this game would be the end for me in this life and in the next.* The Music:Terrible, noisy, distorts at times and because of that I muted ALL SOUNDS.* The sound effects:Meh. basically, something you can get off freesounds|org and alot of the sounds used in this game are terrible and...the SFX sound as though they've been ripped right out of another game (or again freesound)* The Graphics:what to say about the graphics....disgusting.   I could easily recreate this game in RPGMaker, attach a server to it, and call it 8bitMMO part 2.1 sequel to 8bitMMO 1.0a.There isn't anything at all that stands out in the graphics, to me anyway, I guess others may think different.* The servers:what...the...hell?This game could easily run on a 1.4ghz CPU with no trouble (not that I have a CPU like that) however with the addition of ""Servers"" attached to a cheaply made game, it runs like poop on a stick (that slowly dribbles down the stick as it ""Melts"")    Lag, so much lag (I don't usually get lag on other games, for example Guild Wars 2, Wildstar, Archeage etc.), horrid optimization.......and a bandwith eater?what? a bandwith eater? how? -> Poor optimization, no funds going towards their hardware to ""Upgrade"" their servers to be more beefier.              I know this because once i started ""Playing"" on a server, google chrome loaded slow as hell, pages weren't loading at their normal speeds etc. as soon as I turned off the game, everything was fine (what do you know....)* will someone like the facebook page???? please...?constant ""popups"" asking you to ""Like"" their facebook page, buy ""gold"", Twitter....basically, social crap spam.*  Golddidn't spend to much time in this area..obviously...but looks like microtransactions to me.* OverallDon't waste your time on this, nor your money, stay clear of this, and please.....BURN YOUR PC IF YOU ARE EVEN ON THIS STORE PAGE...........

								I came in, expecting a cheap but fun retro-style MMO where you build stuff. Instead I got a cheap and unfun game with poor hit detection, lots of lag and a rather aggressive player base. The gameplay, while simplistic, doesn't always function the way you want it to, concepts of the game aren't explained well in it's tutorials, and there is no way that I could find of telling when I was getting hit, so I ended up dying when it appeared I was doing really well. The graphics are more akin to a late-era Atari 2600 game as opposed to an 8-bit console, which sort of ruins the entire 8-bit feel. I guess some of the music is catchy, though some of it is also not so good, so it's rather hit-and-miss.I did not spend that much time with the game, but the time I did spend was enough to convince me that this game is not for me, and most likely not a game that was well made. I'd say avoid this one, it's just not worth it.			"

								A retro-themed construction mmo. Build alone or with friends. After taking a little time to learn the z-axis mechanics, the system is quite easy to understand and flexible. Don't go in expecting it to be combat-driven, or too complex in the PvP department. Building is the primary focus here, and in this regard it excels. The community will usually answer any questions you may have promptly if you get stuck, just make sure you're polite, and the kindness will be reciprocated. A single developer runs this entire game, so updates are slow, however imput from the players is always taken into consideration. If minecraft-esque construction with a retro twist sounds appealing to you, give 8BitMMO a try.			"

												Thirteen hours in the last few days, and I still can't quite figure out why I like this game. The graphics are, indeed 8-bit, though the colors are more like 16 bit. 32 bit if you play with the flesh tone color change option (/color <0-9>), as some of the variances are too subtle for 16 bit. You can mod your textures very easily. Which, I did do... Since I was sick of blue glass that you couldn't see through and neon green grass that makes your eyes water. All it takes to mod is a zip file creator and a paint program with transparency.... Go check the community, there's a FAQ for that.Some of the stuff you really want is limited to platinum, which is only available through real-world money. Though, there are people that buy plat items and sell them for gold. (Regular quest cash.) These can go in the houses you build or - honestly - just about anywhere in the world. You can even found towns and build them up with friends.Maybe that's what I like about this game.... When I used to play all those 8 and 16 bit RPGs, I used to think to myself that I could make better houses. This is my chance. (And, yes, I am a fanatic for a certain game that starts with an 's' and ends with 'ims.') Also, the game isn't that difficult. I find that making money is a breeze once you buy a gun and just sit just barely in range of a spawner. Levelling to 4 was long, but - if you do the draco and brain quests - not terribly bad. The draco quests can be repeated by clearing your quest log, by the way. I haven't hit 5 yet, but I'm on the way and looking forward to opening up some more blocks to build with. I'm also really looking forward to gathering enough gold to buy a spawner off of someone that has plat, so I can make a shooting range.			"

								       THIS GAME IS GREAT    Most reviews are taking about how terrible the graphics are, but its an 8bit game, so the graphics arnt supposed to be stunning. This game has little bit of everthing for  everytype of player. If your the type on gamer who plays to slay, then your enjoy the completely player built dugeons. If you like to set a mark on the virtual world, then constuct an house, buy a town stone, gather citizens, and be the mayor.          What makes this game great is the freedom. In other games, if you spend REAL money on the game, you can squish every other player, and no one really gets along, but in this game regular players and players with money mix, and work together. For example, people who spend money get speical money called plat, where they can buy exclusive building supplies, but people who dont have money to spare on an 8 bit free video game can still get that exclusive gear. this game is completely player built, most people think that means levels and stuff, but people devolped game modes within the game, and an money conversiony thingy ( 1 plat= 1000 g the devolpers didnt diside that, the players did)       One of may favorite parts of the game is the socialness. Once you get playing you become popular withen the game, and people respect you. people give oppinions on eachothers ideas, they share, donate money, and some towns have a government system started, which is pretty cool.      So if your looking for a game that you create games within that game this is the one for you. I recomed this game to all			"

								First time pixels go MMO for me. This game is really amazing, it brings you new view about building and shopping, fighting and talking. Even NPC's language is awesome. What impressed me most - THIS IS NOT PAY TO WIN. Fight Cats , Peoplle and Zombies to build your own dream Castle , Village or City Hall.I reccomend this game to everyone who is creative and loves Indie games with friends.P.S. RobbyZ : Hey, that's you Hero? Omg, i have an epic quest for you! You must come to the kitchen to meet me. Try this out! ;)			"

								The idea is nice and at first I thought it was fairly intriguing but after less than an hour I found it to be horribly boring. It's very hard to build anything since i can't tell apart walls and floors and the grinding to buy blocks is horrendous. There's barely anything to do, and the combat is clunky (maybe I'm just bad at that so I won't hold it against the game) and aside from the first few levels where it's kinda' funny, after that it's just... ehh...If you like it, more power to you, for me...

								It's alright. It's kind of extremely barebones and doing anything interesting costs platinum, but you can still build freely and stuff. Graphics are very minimalist and the game tries way too hard to be funny, but I'm not really docking poitns against the game for either of those things. Not much to keep you playing for a long period of time, but for 1-3 hours it's a good game to check out. It's free and only like 200MB so I would reccomend seeing if you like it I suppose. Personally I grinded a lot of ingame currency to build this giant♥♥♥♥♥fortress but then I realized there was no point to building it at all because there's no real goal or feeling of accomplishment in this game except that you built something obscenely large and took up so much space that the other 99% of players don't get the opportunity to build something in this small gameworld			"

								It's free for a reason. I understand that this game is still in development, and is mostly just a fun little pixel game, but it's plain awful.The sprites and characters are lazy (I'll bet I can make a better character than this...), the user content is a mess and the interface is clunky and annoying. The quests are reptitive and it lost its charm in the first 2 minutes. The coding is OK yet some barriers don't work properly and a lot of the portals/quests don't work well.I just feel like the creators either don't care or they have a lot of work to do.Like I said, it's free so who cares.

								This game is an interesting one. I don't know of many games like it. It reminds me of Realm of the Mad God. It is half ""hack n' slash"" and half ""sandbox"". Its pretty good, but it does get boring if you don't like grinding (like myself), although there isn't much of it, which is good. The building is a bit wonky, so I tend to avoid it and just explore. I know its still in Early Access, so maybe they'll fix it. Haven't seen to much ""pay-to-win"", although there isn't much to win. I've put about an hour in so far, and killed some Hipsters, Business Cats, and The Escapist.  There are some quests, and those are pretty cool. The sort-of cool thing is that when you finished the quests that came with the game, you get to do some player quests. Some are ""get through the dungeon"", some are ""find the reward in my city"", and some are ""here's your reward, you're good at doing nothing"". I prefer the latter two (I suck at fighting in games). Overall, its an O.K. game for what it is right now. I suggest you try it, and if you don't like it wait a bit and then come back. Its a pretty small file size too, so that helps. If the current game were the finished product, I would give it 7.5/10.			"

								I actually turned this game on expecting to love it immensely. The idea is very appealing on paper, but just something about the execution the turned me off completely. I'm not one to nitpick over graphics but this isn't really an 8-bit game. In fact there's an inconsistency when it comes to graphics altogether. Menus are one thing, the world is another, some of the sprites something else, and the inventory is it's own thing. It seems like each of the components were made individually and then thrown together with glue and duct tape. This game seems to lack an overall harmony.On the bright side it's in early access beta so a lot can change in the coming months. For the time being though... meh. I'll wait a bit before turning it on again.I will however give this game a point of kudos for having a quirky personality. The NPCs are pretty witty and hilarious at times.			"

								8BitMMO is a great, unique game. I like to think of it as Minecraft-meets-Legend of Zelda-meets-8 Bit graphics. You can build a town, dungeon, PvP arena, or anything you like! The world is entirely player built (even creator Sim9 has to follow the rules of establishing a town). Players can also create their own quests. In a way, the game is like a Wiki, it depends almost entirely upon its users. And the game is still in Beta, so it can only go up from here! I'd recommend this game to all players, casual o hardcore alike. There's something for everybody. And hats. Who doesn't love hats?			"

Early Access Review
								This game is an interesting one. I don't know of many games like it. It reminds me of Realm of the Mad God. It is half ""hack n' slash"" and half ""sandbox"". Its pretty good, but it does get boring if you don't like grinding (like myself), although there isn't much of it, which is good. The building is a bit wonky, so I tend to avoid it and just explore. I know its still in Early Access, so maybe they'll fix it. Haven't seen to much ""pay-to-win"", although there isn't much to win. I've put about an hour in so far, and killed some Hipsters, Business Cats, and The Escapist.  There are some quests, and those are pretty cool. The sort-of cool thing is that when you finished the quests that came with the game, you get to do some player quests. Some are ""get through the dungeon"", some are ""find the reward in my city"", and some are ""here's your reward, you're good at doing nothing"". I prefer the latter two (I suck at fighting in games). Overall, its an O.K. game for what it is right now. I suggest you try it, and if you don't like it wait a bit and then come back. Its a pretty small file size too, so that helps. If the current game were the finished product, I would give it 7.5/10.			"

								I played this game for a little bit to see if it was worth playing, but I was disappointed. I started out on the main world and went through the tutorial (Which took a bit of time) and then went out to find a place to build. Ill say this, the world is so populated that it is very VERY hard to find a place to build that wasnt covered in debris from previous players. When i switched to the beta world to see if it was less populated, but I found that my gear did not carry over and i had to start the tutoial all over agin. I just stopped there and decided this game wasnt worth it. Even when i was doing missions in the main world, It wasnt really that fun.  I would just save yourself the trouble and if you want a real mmo, download neverwinter. It is also free and is superior in every way (Unless you have a toaster for a computer)			"

								This game could be a very good indie title, however when i play it, it feels as if i'm playing some pre-alpha debug version.It's definitley not done yet, it's buggy, laggy and full. I do see potential in this game though. If it's given some time it could become something big. All in all, i would wait until the game is more finished before actually playing it. But you can check it out! It's free!                 Oh and also, i love the comedy in this game. Hillarious, keep it up.-Farian			"

								It is a  fun causual game. but if you are looking for a hard core MMO to play with friends then this is not the game. I found it fun for the first few hours, but i cannot see this being a game where I bulid a Giant castle. The game right know has a small community so I would personall suggest waiting Exactly a month after the release day. So my first Complaint is that it gets hard to see from time to time when going through the sides. Another small gripe for me is the fact all the Characters look the same, I think that it needs a Character custumization complete with races, hair color, faces, and eye color, it would be something to make the game seem less monotonus. There is almost no Custimization in this game, Aside from Building, also for building you will need to be social in this game other wise you will be having a hard time finding a place to build outside in the world. There is almost no combat in this game though, and the combat that is in it is very monotuns.But there are posotives, The user created content is good because it allows creativity annd the building of the masses. Some good thing is are the personal plots of land that you can get which then allow you to have some land that can not be trifled with. I enjoy the silly art style and the fact it never takes itself to serously.So Ultimatley i found this to be an enjoyable pixaleated mix of Minecraft and Terria, The community is fair. So I give this game a good 4 out of ten 10, which is pretty good for an indi Developed game like this, i suggest a buy when it drops below five dollars, it will give you atleast an hour of enjoyment.

								8BitMMO is a great game for 2-D, and is quite addictive like the old days when the graphics were like this game. I consider 8BitMMO to be an alternative and a simliar version of Garry's Mod, just in 2-D. I highly recommend this game whenever you're bored.			"

								This is an amazing game that has humor and awesome potential, play it now and support it!Graphics 0/10 for realism _ 10/10 for a retro pixelated feelMechanics 7/10 - looks like these are improving, they'll be ironed outCombat 5/10 - needs a little more work, maybe a strafe moveAudio 8/10 -  MOAR SOUND EFFECTS! But besides that, the music is awesomeThe only downside for this game is having to pay money for platinum for cool items. HOWEVER, that is purely for support for the game and will probably be removed when this isn't Early Access anymore.Also, YOU CAN BE A FREAKIN' POTATO!!!111!!!			"

								The idea is nice and at first I thought it was fairly intriguing but after less than an hour I found it to be horribly boring. It's very hard to build anything since i can't tell apart walls and floors and the grinding to buy blocks is horrendous. There's barely anything to do, and the combat is clunky (maybe I'm just bad at that so I won't hold it against the game) and aside from the first few levels where it's kinda' funny, after that it's just... ehh...If you like it, more power to you, for me... No.			"

												8bitmmo is a fun game for those willing to pay attention, It has a great community and the game gives you a variety of ways to bind you all together so you don't feel so isolated. Other reviews make it seem as if there isn't much to do and it's a rather boring game, I think otherwise. You can build a mansion, Start a town, PvP players with the options of weapons you're gifted by the games weapons menu, and you can join one of our clans!, Clans aren't recognized by the game but are still influential to pvp and building. Clans are a great way to play with friends, and this is just the start of what you can do during 8bitmmo. The building system is pretty complicated at first glance but it becomes fun one you've got the hang of it, I play this game to relax with the amazing friends I've made within this brilliant game.

								If you can enjoy some old school graphics, like sandbox games like Minecraft and MMORPG games then there's a good chance you'll find something to enjoy in 8BitMMO.  Unfortunately the game is not without it's issues but keep in mind this is an Early Access Game and in time some of those glaring issues will be ironed out.Lets start with the good however.  First off this game will run on nearly any computer that's still up and running out there.  It's simple grapics style is a solid plus and you can feel confident inviting your friends to join with you no matter what kind of computer they have.  Secondly the game is free-to-play so you really have no excuse as to why you aren't at least trying this game out.  As an added bonus they currently are using what I consider one of the best free to play models out there.  There is nothing in this game, other than some cosmetic hats, that you can't get without spending money.  Other than the time things take to do your experience in this game will be no different whether you spend money or not.So what is the gameplay like??  Well it's in part a roleplaying game.  Combat is currently limited to a small variety of mostly hand held swords that get better as you level and it is very basic but somehow enjoyable.  There are quests you can follow to recieve a nice reward in the end and different monsters to beat up.  Story wise, it's ""not-so-serious"" gameplay with a lot of witty humor and references to other movies, games, and so forth.  The other part of the game is very sandbox style.  Most of the world can be built up by the players which really gives you a chance to make your mark on the world, including designing dungeons and such for others to adventure in.  You buy the building blocks, monster spawners, and other building materials using in game money, which can be earned by killing monsters and completing quests, or bought with real money.  Other than a handful of hats that is the only thing that real money can buy for you.  Yes your gear is also bought with in game money however it is currently very limited and cheap enough to afford with just monster killing and questing money.  Even building materials are fairly cheap, though it will take some time saving up coins to build anything massive if your not willing to spend real money.So what about the ugly side of the game.  Well first off the servers don't seem to currently be able to handle the load right now.  Granted there were what looked like hundreds of people playing, but I did experience quite a bit of lag that was worse in the more populated areas.  Secondly it is not at all or in any way pretty when it comes to graphics.  In some instances it can be hard to understand where you're supposed to go.  Some of this is players not being used to the building tools and thereby not building their structures in the most presentable way but some of it is simply the limitations of the graphics engine.  As far as audio goes, the sounds are extremely limited.  Start up some tunes of your own before you start the game.Overall this is certainly a game you can and should at least try out.  While there's still a lot of things that can be ironed out there's a huge potential for this game to be massivly fun.  If you can put up with a few hiccups and bumps in the road I belive you'll find this a very enjoyable game.  It's certainly one that I will be playing from time to time and keeping an eye on.			"

								An Ok game. there are better games out there. but this game is free  if your looking for cheap fun the game is waiting for you.pros: the ability to create what you want.make your own public or private city.its free.servers are rarely full or never full.Theres hats.updated monthly.cons:not alot of weapons.hard to find friends.gets sluggish when you get to level four as it feels like there nothing left to work for.repetive gameplay.the blocks have  limeted varity.at times you feel like theres not much to do even early on.chat bar gets spammed with people linking to websites claiming to have free plats and gold.Take note: despite being able to buy coins or plats, this game in no way or form pay to win as you are limeted to how mch you can buy. plus theres not alot to buy anyway other than hats and awesome outfitsfinal verdict:i suggest you go ahead and try it for your self as this review was based on my 1 hour experience to witch i got to level 5 and got tierd of the spam in the chat. but for what it is its great and should be tried by all who like building game with rpg elements.

This game.I would give it a 6.1/10.Its basically like Realm of Gods with fourth-wall breaking in it and some minecraft aspect.Looking forward to some new contents this game has to offer.The cons in this game are just some bad puns and joke.Meh,good game.Recommend for everyone.

								So for this being the only thing on steam that my computer can run-- I'd say I have the patience of a shaolin monk. Here's why. The game, although pixelated and simple is quite rich of things. I spent quite a time bored on this game, do to the fact that I didn't have a town or money for that matter.I played it for a few days straight, desperate to hold on to what little patience I had with this computer. Suddenly brought into citizenship, I found a town. The mayor was probably 12 y/o and said ""__ okay?"" like I was a child that was  pressing the action button to show the next block of text. While in this town I was a ""bartender"" sitting in an inn while he gained more citizens. After getting bored and going on to another town, I asked this guy --mind you he had the platinum townstone-- if he had a job for me. As my job I made 1k gold a day to donate to town projects. I ended up donating 2k a day out of kindness. I constantly gotten praise for being so nice.A few days later I started to help other people for no reward-- donating 1k to them. I'm bored with the game for now--but I do recommend it to any and everyone. If you spend enough time paying attention, you'll learn to gold farm (There's a gold income system, a 45 minute interval) to get anywhere, and also need weapons to get such gold to get such weapons to get such gold to build amazing things.Confusing?Try walking up to a hipster with your puny noob sword. You will die.This isn't minecraft. Or roblox. Or any childish rpg game.This is 8bitMMO.			"

								1st and formost. This game is mainly about building. Too often players come in expecting more. Do not come in expecting freaking world of warcraft. 2nd. The game is run and developed by ONE person who really does work hard to make it better. Yes updates can be small and slow but they do come. 3rd. The game is free to play... Yes there are some things that have to be bought with real money however all items except cloths can be traded for ingame gold. Genrally a LOT of gold but you can still get oretty much everything without having to spend real money. As long as you understand that and can accept that then you just might really like the game.That having been said the games developer has been working on adding more than just building but the game content isn't a lot currently. If you do play just try to build and have fun. Yes the building system can take a bit to get used to and some things can be confusing but most players will try to help you out if not a moderator. OR alternativly watch a few youtube videos.Bottom line. Give it a try and see for yourself weather you like it or not. If you do great and if not it's understandable that not everyone will like it but please don't stay and bash the game if you don't.			"

								If you can enjoy some old school graphics, like sandbox games like Minecraft and MMORPG games then there's a good chance you'll find something to enjoy in 8BitMMO.  Unfortunately the game is not without it's issues but keep in mind this is an Early Access Game and in time some of those glaring issues will be ironed out.Lets start with the good however.  First off this game will run on nearly any computer that's still up and running out there.  It's simple grapics style is a solid plus and you can feel confident inviting your friends to join with you no matter what kind of computer they have.  Secondly the game is free-to-play so you really have no excuse as to why you aren't at least trying this game out.  As an added bonus they currently are using what I consider one of the best free to play models out there.  There is nothing in this game, other than some cosmetic hats, that you can't get without spending money.  Other than the time things take to do your experience in this game will be no different whether you spend money or not.So what is the gameplay like??  Well it's in part a roleplaying game.  Combat is currently limited to a small variety of mostly hand held swords that get better as you level and it is very basic but somehow enjoyable.  There are quests you can follow to recieve a nice reward in the end and different monsters to beat up.  Story wise, it's ""not-so-serious"" gameplay with a lot of witty humor and references to other movies, games, and so forth.  The other part of the game is very sandbox style.  Most of the world can be built up by the players which really gives you a chance to make your mark on the world, including designing dungeons and such for others to adventure in.  You buy the building blocks, monster spawners, and other building materials using in game money, which can be earned by killing monsters and completing quests, or bought with real money.  Other than a handful of hats that is the only thing that real money can buy for you.  Yes your gear is also bought with in game money however it is currently very limited and cheap enough to afford with just monster killing and questing money.  Even building materials are fairly cheap, though it will take some time saving up coins to build anything massive if your not willing to spend real money.So what about the ugly side of the game.  Well first off the servers don't seem to currently be able to handle the load right now.  Granted there were what looked like hundreds of people playing, but I did experience quite a bit of lag that was worse in the more populated areas.  Secondly it is not at all or in any way pretty when it comes to graphics.  In some instances it can be hard to understand where you're supposed to go.  Some of this is players not being used to the building tools and thereby not building their structures in the most presentable way but some of it is simply the limitations of the graphics engine.  As far as audio goes, the sounds are extremely limited.  Start up some tunes of your own before you start the game.Overall this is certainly a game you can and should at least try out.  While there's still a lot of things that can be ironed out there's a huge potential for this game to be massivly fun.  If you can put up with a few hiccups and bumps in the road I belive you'll find this a very enjoyable game.  It's certainly one that I will be playing from time to time and keeping an eye on.			"

								With sound effects & graphics of the classic NES, customization of your character, and the ability to make anything, even your own house, you'll be having hours of fun! It's worth a try if you want that good ol' feel of the 1980's again.That and the fact the whole map is player built makes the game even more fun! Though a word of caution: you MAY see some references in the game, I'll note two of them: 1) the White Sword has the description from Zelda (NES: 1987) and 2) the TARDIS (Doctor Who: 1963-2005) makes an appearence in the game!

								8bitmmo... you apear in the house of some npc named robbyz where after killing some lobbyist slugs.. you are projected into a red room... Hmm.. there are npcs here.... QUESTS! BUILDING! FARMING GOLD AND BEING RICH!!! Then you continue to play this game, because it is beautiful. Seriously. Possibly the best part about this game though, is the fact that there is lots of communication with the developer, and this game is ALWAYS being updated. I doubt you will find a better indie game that has only ONE developer.And to anyone who said the graphics are bad, because they are 8bit. You are really, really, REALLY dumb. This game is supposed to have that retro 8bit look. And you can play the game easily without making any microtransactions. You can get any item (except clothes) from other players without spending much time to get the gold.Chances are, most reviews are from this game in it's older stages. This game has progressed significantly more than most indie games ever do... and it only has one developer...9.8/10			"

								There once was a lad who played this game. He wandered around and built a house. Then he discovered that he could become a potato. So, he lept at the opportunity. The lad enjoyed being a potato and hopped around happily. Until one day the lad met a man with an eyepatch and fancy suit. He said to the man ""Hi there I have mixed feelings about you. You are wearing an eyepatch. That makes me distrust you, but you are also wearing a fancy suit. Despite that the fact that I cannot figure out why it is so fancy, it makes me trust you.""""Well my lad no reason to fear me for I am a mayor. Follow me to my city and I will grant you citizenship and a free plot of land.""The lad happily followed the man to his city until they arrived there.""Here is my city lad. Go in and make yourself at home.""""But sir it is a cave.""""Oh my silly boy. It is an underground city. See?"" He said as he walked into the cave. The boy saw this as proof enough and went on in.""No boy you must pay a small fee to pass this door.""""I thought you said it was free of charge.""""Oh yes but this a toll for all people. No exceptions.""The man waited as the boy deposited the fee. Then the man walked through the door and the boy followed. Except the boy felt the floor move and as he looked he felt himself falling. He did not understand what was going on.""Thank you for the gold my dear potato, but I must bid you farewell.""The boy fell for about three more seconds until hitting a spike pit and subsequently dying.(Moral of the story never trust a man with an eyepatch no matter how fancy a suit he wears.)

								8bitmmo is a top down sandbox game with fixed world vision. It has a moderately sized group of core players that keep things steady. There are quests, buildings, artwork, and more. The PVP has been kicked up a notch with the addition of Transponder battles. With many possibilities I suggest you give the game a try.The premium currency items can generally be traded for from other players, so don't be discouraged. Even if you don't want to pay for plat you can still enjoy the game.			"

								For no cost it is a fine game indeed and you can build anything you want and glorify it with enough time spent. However the enemies do tend to get a bit repetitive but still challenging in a way, I enjoy it very much but its really up to you about how you feel about it when it comes to what your looking for in gameplay. If you want a casual building game with some fighting but not quite minecraft than this may be for you! If your looking for a action packed battle game with flaming demonic wolves than i suggest you keep searching. This may be a short review but it is what i think of the game.			"

												I've had an account in 8BitMMO for nearly three years.And the first thing I have to say about this game is that I personally love it.The community is amazing. It is full of great people willing to help out where necesarry.If you cannot find a town to join, and nobody is responding to you, chances are that most of the players are off and sleeping. Just try again later in the day.Primary is usually a thriving and bustling server with a very good ammount of players for you to meet and socialize with.The moderators do their job to keep an eye on chat, and are also extremely friendly.At first glance, PVP seems bland... But if you try out the weapons and strive to get better, I guarantee you will love it a whole lot more. There are endless possibilities for this game. The only limit is indeed your imagination. Whether you are a creative mind, or just a casual gamer, there is a place in 8BitMMO for you.I highly reccommend downloading the game and trying it out.Hope to see you in the near future!~SapphireCoyote10/10			"

I got this game a while back from RobbyZ when it was in closed beta, I was the first of my friends to recieve the game and I actully got to talk to RobbyZ on Twitter when the beta was first released. Its definitelya good game to play if your into older games and MMO'S.One thing I suggest working on in this game is optimization, I can run DayZ at 30 FPS but this games gives me INSANE mouse lag and frame drops in 1920x1080. 7.5/10			"

												This game sucks, it's very laggy, you gain XP very VERY SLOW, the dungeons are stupid as ♥♥♥♥, everything costs so much, the wild is very awful, full of unfinished junk constructions or random dropped items, i finded 2 free slots, but magic magic, it were occupied by a player item, even there was no thing, this is not a MMO, there is pure micro transictions are overprices and expensive as ♥♥♥♥, quests are stupid or hard and you will start to be boread easily, if you want a land you need to ask to mayor, but surprise every ♥♥♥♥ing land is occupied, you can't hit unless you are first, enemys are fast as hell, considering that only 2 or 3 catalgos are useful: Traps, objects and items>weapons, hats, accesorys and shirts don't do mroe than ♥♥♥♥ing waste your money, considering that your HP is ridiculous low (3 HP, 1 HP/hit the first monster), considering that depending of where are you looking it shoots (this is annoying as ♥♥♥♥, you can't go backwards and shoot left nor right) and very bad jokes, trying to make any fun, instead it seems made by a 8 year old, making unfunny jokes and a pretty bad history, this have a good concept, but they didn't make it very well,4/10 Would kill the creator againNow:History: 1.5/10, Seriously this story game is nothing, just a small and even it doesn't lasts 30 secondsGraphics: 3/10, Ok don't critize me, by that i mean the graphics bug, sometimes the world goes nuts, btw graphics are still bad and poorly animated animationsGameplay: 2/10, It's awful, 1 block range, short as hell, unless you buy range, considering that every 10 ammo costs like 10 coins, gun = 50, btw it only have a 4-direction battle and bad aimingDialogue: 6/10, They tried tho, atleast they added some, but it still doesn't quit off the fact that some dialogues are placed wrong and with some minor orthographic grammarWorld: 2.5/10, Worlds in general suck, either good ones are made by mods or rich as ♥♥♥♥s players, or the common ones make bad things, why? the economyCommunity: 3/10, Same as other games, mostly minecraft free-build servers, pure ripped off chuncks, randomly placed etc. you can't build anything till' meeting with a ""occupied space"", still the community is dumb as ♥♥♥♥Originality: 0/10, This applies the next: Teleports as minecraft, places like habbo (you know, those of rich dumb♥♥♥♥s and puts alot of sticky notes) getting a very well animated character (no seriously, how much it took? 1 minute? a square, 2 large sticks and other 2 in the torso, a cube, 2 dots and a line, done a character) and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story (wow, that story was very deep, it got me in da feels)Economy?: 0.5/10, Pure P2W, you want a sword? PAY SOME MONEY (if you don't want to be starving to death killing dumb as ♥♥♥♥ characters), Want a telepad? PAY MORE MONEY! Want a useless transformation? PAY MONEY! Want to get useless shirts? PAY MONEY, this game is about pure P2W, everything you want need to farm alot of enemys in dungeons and stuff,now... Overrall?2.3125/10 (calculator numbers)Good concept, bad way to do it, This game happened the same as superman 64, it was going to be extreme, but the manageres didn't wanted to do a sandbox game (like GTA games or Saints rows) and did that loopy♥♥♥♥♥			"

												8BitMMO, huh? Alright, I guess I can try this.  Plays for an hour  Hm. Addictive.8BitMMO is a clever little game. It's an MMO-sandbox, 8Bit-style. There actually isn't much of a story that I can find, because it doesn't really seem to take that seriously, what with your character being a hobo that broke into the creator's house,  rambling about himself being the hero and having to save the world and all. The creator's response? He's getting bored of these random homeless people entering his house.The more addictive part of this, though, is, as usual:  The building. Don't seem to get it? Happens. Basically,  you have to spend gold at the shop to purchase blocks, weapons, and items for your home . How do you get gold?  Well, you can get it by completing Mr. Zombie's quests, finding reward-blocks in community-made villages, and killing enemies. That's all I have to say about this game. I can't come up with any more intelligable words for it.			"

Right now this is basicaly 2.5D Minecraft without any ability to mine or otherwise gather resources. (Everything has to be bought wth coins gained from killing monsters or purchasing with real money.) Honestly I think I'd rather just play Minecraft.

								8BitMMO in my opinion seems to be a game where building a community is key. You don't get handed your materials and get sent out to mine and craft them though like several other games out there. Instead you have two systems working and playing off of each other. On one hand you have the RPG section. Here the system handles your characters progression, shop system, quests, economey and the most importing thing, FIGHTING THE BAD GUYS! On the other hand you have have the Building system that directly feeds off of the RPG system. You fight monsters which nets you gold and expierence which can net you more expierence and gold from a quest but most importantly it lets you get your materials to build. The shop is tiered in such a way that your level dictates what you can buy in the various sections of the shop and you use the gold you gain to purchase the items. You can then take the materials you purchase to your own Pocket Dimension. Here you can build what you want then invite people to visit or open it up to the public. The game has heart behind it. I can clearly see inspirations, aspirations and a future for this game, if it can quickly evolve and try to weather the storm.			"

								My god and I thought horrible camera angles and views were a thing of the 90's. OH hey your character is behind a wall in a house. Well lets remove that ceiling cause you're inside so your char doesn't need to see that roof. However, that wall yeah lets leave that in your way.Also, What on earth do the devs do in this? Seems like every quest is playermade except for the first 3 maybe? That's great and all but every player quest is either ""Oh her move to there get free gold and give donations plox!"", ""Hey every wall you can't see through may or may not have a trap and by the way watch out for random lasers."", or the worst of them all ""Oh hey here is some free gold, donation box is here and there's a free no risk exp/gold farms all over.""I mean 3 npcs you start talking to make it seem like oh hey this might be a great game, humor is alright and all. Oh wait that's pretty much all the stuff the devs have done as far as content. Everything else is done by players and their quests are tossed into a RNG pool from 1 npc. So the majority are cash/exp farms and every one out of 50 may actually be a real player quest with story, intrigue and maybe actual normal difficulty that doesn't exploit walls.			"

												Probably one of the worst games i've ever wasted my time testing out!I've done all the opening quests, and now there's nothing else left to do!The game doesn't give enough (or any) instructions on what to do or where to go, or what the next mission to do is!The building is buggy and pretty crap. The game is basically pay to win. And the graphics are pure♥♥♥♥♥♥ Yes, i know it's supposed to be an 8bit, but that's no excuse to not add shaders and any sort of detail to a modern game!			"

												It is definitely easy to play and easy to understand and easy to build and easy in-general. This game can be a lot of fun and it can be pretty creative for a 2D game... But, it hasn't got much content at the moment despite the length of it's release and I hope they improve upon it more in the near future, as the community is pretty small but friendly. Also, some of the achievements are so hard to actually unlock, they are practically bugged and sometimes enemies can attack you through walls. I am going to say yes to recommending this game, simply because of what it is and it's free. But if it ever changes to a more Pay-to-Play, it might go to ruin. In my opinion: it's pretty much Habbo Hotel on Pixelated Crack. Completionist's Note: Now that I have finally done what there is to date, I can finally conclude that my opinion of the games been improved slightly, I had a lot of fun building and the community is really friendly! 75/100.

								Overall: 9.5/10----------------Gameplay: 6/10Story: -/10Combat: 5/10Concept: 9.5/10-----------------Summary:I do like the fact that you can create your own adventure and play with friends and stuff like that, but the actual gameplay (in it's current stage) is a bit (heh, puns) lacking in certain places. Yes, I know it's an early-access title and that it's still in-development, but I would like to see a bit (heh, another pun) style and diversity in the combat and and customization of your character. Now, in regards to platinum, I don't like the fact that there is no conversion rate between the gold and platinum, and I do not agree that everything should cost platinum after level 3, but, because it's an early-access title this is probably just a temporary donation system and may be worked on as the game is updated more. As for the enemies and combat, I would like to see a bit more variation, maybe a randomly occuring dragon attack or space invasion you have to defend your town against, meanwhile, the combat shows a bit (I swear, I'm on fire today with these puns) of potential, I would like to see a magic/mana system worked into the combat. Other than that, I would say that because this game is free at the moment, you should download it and play it. It shows a lot of potential, and I would really like to see this turn into something great!			"

												This game has a lot of potential however Steam Analytics says that there are only 5 people visiting a month on average. Though the whole game is based around your creations, it's kinda disheartening to know that your creations will go to waste as nobody will see them here. Either way, it's worth having a look around.Also, if you're into 8 Bit music, you'll love the music library.			"

I will give the game another chance soon, and will then update my review accordingly.First of all, the ingame perspective is absolutely awful.  The world is already mostly destroyed save a small village that a sole user created.  The graphics are horrible and animations terrible.  Don't play this game, because it is a waste of your time.

												Hmm...The concept is good, but there are some things I don't like. First and foremost, there are way too many microtransactions (AKA in-app purchases). To build something, you need to buy every single block with coins. To gather enough of them, you have two options; either keep playing and get them (which takes forever) or buy them with real money. So, by that aspect, you may feel kinda scammed, like I did.Regarding the gameplay, it is really difficult to build. You'll have a hard time trying to place a block over another. Try it for your own, you'll see. Sometimes, the block hiding system doesn't work, thus making it impossible to play inside a room.But wait, there are positives; as I mentioned beforehand, I liked the concept, even though it's not new. There is also a fully functional anti-grief system, which I admire, as there is no such thing in Minecraft or Terraria (yet). "

There's elements of player-built world- except the the whole mess is terrible confusing in 2D.There are complicated society elements like towns and such- except they cost too much for something that is almost useless and challenging in this limited 2D world.There's customization-but everyone still looks almost the same.There's quests to get gold- yet as they're player-created most of them are unplayable.If you wanna play a free-to-play mmo, look elsewhere, because no one should lower down to this.

Also if you are like me with a sort tepmer that can easly rage then don't even think about this game its like a rage game mixed with mincraft and terraria and 6 year old violence this game is very harsh about health you only start off with 6 hp apart that you lag ever time you die,spawn or some else spawns (that happens alot).This game is very strange as well you can become a patato,zombie,and more.

The ""make your own dungeon"" part is really well worked out, and you can find and create one full of trolls and halarious traps that do anything but good. The amount of weapons is broad, considering the amount of time they had with this game. Tell your siblings or friends about this game and ahve you and them steal from each other.

												It's a good concept, just poorly executed. Though I do love the player created world, I also hate it. Neary everything is claimed, gold income is decent, but the gold/platinum system just kills it for me. If you made it easier to get platinum or everything costed gold, I'd say thats perfect, but back to the world. After taking the random teleport (which by the way only seems to have about a 100x100 tp range) you have to walk for about ten minutes to get to the wilderness where you can build. The world is laggy af in dungeons and the hp scaling on level up is so tiny and leveling up takes so long that you'd be lucky to pass level 3 without any deaths to your name. Vanity items are way too expensive as seen in most games. The buildings in the world are atrocious but that doesn't affect my opinion as those are player made. Honestly, I think it'd be MUCH better if you hade official in game cities with paths between them where you could go off and build from, and make a random warp that puts you not right in someone elses building area. All in all, I'd give this game a 3/10			"

								This game is fun. The 100% player built world is no lie. Most of the achivements are hilarious. This is the one game i have in my steam library with over 13 hours.  The only problem i have is the microtransactions. Plat swamps the shop. But at least you can turn into a potato. Most of the building blocks don't cost much, and getting money is easy. You can create enemy spawners and get money from that, along with other things.The trading option is great, along with creating towns with townstones.The 8-bit style is well made. The chosen music for the game fits with the style perfectly. The griefing control in the game is well-made, so people aren't running around taking blocks from your build randomly. I recommend this game greatly. Your'e welcome.			"

								Little to do, player quests are terrible, the community isn't helpful, the game isn't really any bit like it wants to be,it's too grindy and the sense of humor is just weird and by no means charming. The game has you kill ""hipsters"" for some reason. Or ""lobbycats"" i guess lobbyist cats? And by far the worst part of this game is the perspective. It is so confusing and impossible to navigate. I have had multiple instances where a wall was the exact same texture and placement of the floor, for no reason. It trys to be funny but just falls on it's face and you can't tell where you have to go. The only redeeming quality of this game is the soundtrack, which is phenominal. Otherwise, it's too easy to uninstall.			"

You can farm all the gold you can handle from places like the zoo (/tele zoo) but, for PLAT you much fork out cash.There is even a bot to help you swing the sword, available from nFected Software.. hehehttps://sites.google.com/site/nfectidsoftware/Downhome/8bitbotHave fun.

								8BitMMO is quite an amazing game. First of all it is like any MMO really, but has a more comical feel. Secondly, if you have a low performance computer, it still runs well. The music is great, simple and easy to use controls. Creative quests and concepts, and for me only playing about a half an hour of it. I love it so much! I highly reccomend it to anybody who has a sense of humor or somebody who likes MMO.			"

Even though it is only in it's beginning stages there is a great future for this game.Pros---------Fighting is simple-Concept is fun-Missions-Unlockables (HATS)-Leveling Up-Owning your own town/area of landCons--------Hard to understand building at first-Player Quests are nearly impossible-Laggy Servers (Will get better over time)			"

And the wilderness. Well. U cant break other players blocks but u can place by them. Meaning people can grief u easyily. And the wilderness brings u to player structers. Not true wild so u can build properly. I do recommand it but this is super annoying. If this doesnt get fixed soon im quiting! And i was ganna buy items :P			"

								Spawned in, completed the genericish tutorial, went to my plot of land, tried to burrow into the shell of a community this game has by talking in global chat. There was my first mistake. 90% of feedback was either ""&@#! you!"" or some people trying to trick people into various things. Then I decided since a global community wasn't what this game had I decided I might actually play. Can I just say here that this game looks fine, if not having a nice feel. Also, hats, thats a +1. But please, please dont make me pay for blocks which I need thousands for to build something that is kinda cool. My wallet said no. Overview: Don't download this game unless you have a network of friends, because global chat hates itself, and also prepare your wallet. ""free-to-play"" is becoming a less and less relative term. I would like this game if not for the pay-to-have-fun model. Maybe somewhere people would figure out how to make a proper model.			"

								Fun for a bit but really has a long way to go. After just a small amount of time playing the game I already find myself just unsure what to do with it, the quests keep looping and all I can do is farm for gold and build something. But the mechanics are there for something really fun and I find myself interested in it constantly. I'd build my own dungeon but I have to shell out far too much real money to get something even going. I recommend it simply because it is free to play and very interesting (it really is a fun idea) but be warned there are microtrasactions to get to the meat of the game and right now there is very little content to play around with.

Also I got bored in about 5 minutes of playing, and I only downloaded it because I wanted to see the game myself instead of reading the reviews about it, but now I understand why people thought this was terrible!I would rate this game as: A even more crappier version of roblox only more expensive! 0.5/10                                                   I would say 0/10 but I'm not that harsh			"

												This game is a perfect example of a great idea badly displayed. Everything about this game is just so badly done, it's not even funny. Let me start with the perspective. The game's perspective a a mix of 3D and 2D, just so poorly done. It is incredibly hard to build anything you want in this game. The perspective is just unbelieveable, because in a sandbox game, wouldn't you want to build stuff, and you can't even do that is this game. The combat is so boring in the game. I always choose the building quests instead of the combat quests, because their both terrible, just building is better. The game consists of a very toxic and rude community, like Roblox. The game is a huge♥♥♥♥♥failure when it comes to microtransactions because of the unbelieveable deals you can get. The graphics are poor and ugly, like a game that belongs in a flash games website. If you want a sandbox game, i beg you, pick anything, and I mean ANYTHING over this sad excuse of a game.			"

1 Part I LikedThe idea of an massively multiplayer online game where you can construct the world sounds pretty cool.1 Part I DislikedThe economics of the game is prohibitive. To build anything you need gold, which is obtained either through poaching monsters from other players, running player created mazes or micro-transactions. These all get boring pretty quickly, and the plain decoration pieces makes it difficult to be proud of what you've built in the first place.			"

And the wilderness. Well. U cant break other players blocks but u can place by them. Meaning people can grief u easyily. And the wilderness brings u to player structers. Not true wild so u can build properly. I do recommand it but this is super annoying. If this doesnt get fixed soon im quiting! And i was ganna buy items :P			"

								Its a funny little game but as the creators say, its NOT done yet. Its sometimes laggy, depending on where you live (only 2 servers in the USA). I have now played it for 30 minutes, and it got boring pretty quick. It has a nice and funny community, but you need to get in the game for a while to actually get into in to a town, get some friends to build things with and that kind of stuff. So, ill try again when its a little bit more ""game-like"" because, personally, I would not YET get this game out.			"

								I honestly cannot recommend this game to anyone. It might seem nice for the originality of making a pixellated MMO, but it's not.Is just one of the many games that have recently taken the name of ""Artist's♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. Really poor game from both graphics and mechanical.Graphics: 1/10 (for the pixels) Gameplay: 2.5/10 Controls: 7.5/10 (quite intuitive) Contents: 3/10 Overall Rating: 3.5/10			"

								Its a funny little game but as the creators say, its NOT done yet. Its sometimes laggy, depending on where you live (only 2 servers in the USA). I have now played it for 30 minutes, and it got boring pretty quick. It has a nice and funny community, but you need to get in the game for a while to actually get into in to a town, get some friends to build things with and that kind of stuff. So, ill try again when its a little bit more ""game-like"" because, personally, I would not YET get this game out.			"

								The first few hours of playing I was excited, because I thought that everything I did in the first 5 mins would be just the tip of the iceberg. Sadly, that is it. All of it. The building is buggy and the fighting is too stiff. Nothing you do feels satisfying. There is that excitement of joining a town, contributing to its growth, but it builds up to nothing. I like the general idea of it - the players make everything and create their own world with cities and quests, but It just lacks depth. It has the potential to be really fun, though. Just needs more creativity.			"

								By Now, I have played 8 hours of this game, on a very low-end laptop, there are a lot of things wrong with it, many have established this, but I feel it can become much better in the future, though at it's current state it is very horrible, platinum is needed for a lot of items that you need/want and most of the items cost 10+ platinum (btw 7 platinum = $5!) Literately your only other resort is to hope and pray someone will give you a platinum item for being such a good friend or farming Mobs for a week straight, drink all the coffee in your house, sit up all day and all night so you won't be banned, and sell that 150K+ gold for idk 15+ platinum? (I don't envy the trade system nor do I want to see it) This game has the, let me rephrase that, THIS GAME 'HAD' THE POTENTIAL TO DO GOOD! This was made in 13 YEARS! I mean CMON, I don't even touch SPIKES, I DIE!, I can't scoot OVER FAR ENOUGH ONTO A BLOCK TO GET PAST THE SPIKES, THIS GAME IS A DEATHTRAP OF RAGE! Literately, I Don't even Rage at games, and this one throws me off my record for ""Person that Rages the Least Award"" I mean cmon bro, Step up your game, add more platinum to the money packages and lastly, put in more optimizations as well as, SELECTIVE QUESTING, I don't like being repettitively asked to do the same quest over and over when I CANT do it because there are SPIKES, LASERS, AND GAME REVIEWERS EVERYWHERE. Sorry, Getting a little out of hand, I do not recommend this game, but if you want to play it, idc, I may continue playing it just because I don't care.			"

												this was (i think) my first steam game! its is a pretty good game. kinda akward building and no real story but, its funny, has a good tutorial and is just fun. while there are barley anyone on servers, it just makes it easier as there aren't local servers (like in aus. they are only hosted in texas D:).now we need local servers to lower lag. over all, i would reccomend to those who want a very odd rpg.

This is a great game, yes it is a bit grindy but still, about half the games on the internet/console/mobile are like that. I do reccomend this game to people who are looking for this kind of game.Keep working strong Dev.			"

												When I first saw the trailer for this I thought that I would spend hours on this! Once everything was done downloading I then got on. It started out with a tutorial that made you kill a certain number of things. After I finished the tutorial I then was wanting to build a house. Guess what happened next! More tutorials on where to build and how to build one. After every single tutorial was done i went to go build a house. I swear, I was looking for atleast 30 minutes to find a empty spot and there were none to be seen. I decided i'm done with this game! I uninstalled it and deleted it. Thanks for wasting my time 8BitMMO!			"

								Absolutely amazing! I would, and have, recommended this game to others. The community is nice, kind and friendly, and the odd ""bad"" (inconsiderate?) player is easily dealt with by the multiple game moderators. It's free! Seriously, it's amazing that something this awesome is Free to Play. Some people (I won't lie - me included) don't like the graphics but the Texture Packs made by the community for the community add a really unique feel to the game. Even if a construction looks ""bad"", most players are considerate and try find as much good points about the build as possible. The developer, Robby Zinchak (Sim9), is really involved with the game and its community, not like some other games (minecraft?). It's a construction sandbox! Personally, I absolutely love construction sandboxes, and one were you can suggest something and it's likely it'll be added? Even better! You can suggest things through either the forums or in the suggestion box and Robby will read it and, possibly, add it in. The moderators are all friendly and I don't have an issue with even 1 of them. You can chat relaxed with the community and it's so laid back it's unbelievable.I would DEFINITELY recommend this game to as many people as I possibly can.			"

								I think the game is fun, but has little to work with when it comes to building in the start of the game yet its still fun and I feel there should be more content than just simple areas that are small and end quickly building is sorta good but confusing at times and if there was more of a weapon selection that would be great overall its decent its still a early access game so there will be bugs and glitches and more things needing to be added but you should check it out			"

								Maybe it gets better later, but what I played it just seems like a boring grind fest trying to hard to be funny and really simple gameplay. It feels like one of those games that's only really retro and simplistic cause the creators of the game couldn't think of anything creative. Also the only 2 server thing (and both located in Dallas Texas, go figure) was baffling, as someone who lives in South east U.S it didn't effect me to much but I can see it be an issue for other people.

								This is a decent community oriented game.Basically paying members can get various perks, including home stones to set permissions on a small homestead in the general play area (rather than their private area) town stones that let them set permissions on an area and form a village or city as well as quest stones that let them set up quests for other players.This provides a nice active community where both paying and non-paying members.  It's pretty nice.It's clearly not for everyone.  The graphics are rudimentary but functional, and the gameplay is quite simplistic.  Still, there is a certain community cohesion and simplicity that will appeal to other players.This is clearly a nitch game, but if it's your nitch you will certainly enjoy it.  Your best bet is to try it for free, and see if you like it.   Worst case you lose the few hours you spent learning the game mechanics, and even then observant players who don't like the game will gain insite into the nitch title which may help them understand certain general game and community mechanics that were done right in this game, as well as where the title is lacking which makes it only appeal to a nitch group.Oh yeah, and there's some achievements for you achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s out there. :D			"

												It's a rather nice little game for those who can keep their attention span on it butafter reviewing most of what others have said I am determined to tell the public DO NOT GET NOR BUY ANYTHING RELATED TO THIS GAME! why? here are my reasons and the reasons from othersThe game is rather buggy most developers are long gone and their towns and workings left in the dusteverything is blocked off by levels or somthing elseall the slightly better crap just costs too much and is most likely crap tooyou literally have to spam spacebar from what I have seen to attack though it can be changed if I am correctthere is hardly anyone on there these daysusing the fancy effects button is just a lag makerweird tutorialunprofessional developers quote from the tutorial guy ""They're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s"" and emoticons detectednot enough customizable features a pay money system for normal currency obtained and used to buy things after killing monsters which is a pay to win sort of feature that most do not likedeveloper secrets open to the public (a good gm hides their issues and hangouts cleverly and effectively)spawn issues (I placed a bunch of dirt over normal ground before I knew I was stuck in it}enemies looking different yet similar abilities with different damage ratiosThese are just the things that I and many other people are complaining about and is beginning to make me thing the developers were just there for a ride on the cash cow and to bail at the moment they made enough pay.However if I myself am wrong of this then Developers I call out to you to prove me wrong on the fact you were not just b eing greedy.After all I have seen from the reviews and the game I can without a doubt say that it is dead and should be removed from steam due to the fact it is mainly abandoned and in a state of decayA little lesson for the devs I have taken 4 business classes 3 in english and 1 in spanish and I can say that your game was not meeting professional standards in my eyeshence why I tell everyone on steam and of the worldDO NOT EVER BUY THIS GAME OR ANYTHING RELATED TO IT IT IS ABANDONED BY DEVS AND SO FORTH ABANDONED BY MYSELF			"

												This is definitely a special game to me, in that it's been built from the ground up by 1 developer who clearly has a lot of his heart and passion poured into this game.Now as a gamer in 8 bit mmo I would simply describe it as a Social and/or Creative game, in that the better your creative and social skills, the more you'll get back from playing this game.Many players trend towards laziness and wont pay attention to the tutorials and faq, or swear and get banned quickly, or try to get into marketing which this game WASNT built for but their overriding greedy tendencies don't care!But ultimately they wont really enjoy this game for what it's really all about, be social! Make friends! Build a community. Or just build beautiful things, build upon ideas or concepts, explore your imagination!Bottom line isIf you have no social grace, nor any imagination. Don't touch this game!I'll continue to support this game as I see a lot of potential for it in the near future!			"

								8BitMMO is a game with lots of potential, even though it's in Early Access, it is still pretty fun! I've read lots of reviews going on and on about how bad the building system is, how bad the microtransactions are, and how sucky the community is. I played with these expectations going in, but it wasn't that bad. The building system is actually quite detailed, and getting gold coins isn't that bad, and seriously. A couple bucks torward the developer for the platinum coins (Which you can buy various special things with) is seriously not that bad. As for the community... Eh, it's not all that great but it's definitely not as bad as it's made out to be. There's pretty much no indecent content except for some mild language, but being it an MMO, no-one can account for the online language. This game is really fun, and really underestimated by the community! Instead of reading reviews, try it for yourself! It's free (at least for now), so go make your own opinion!			"

												Alright, this isn't for a review, this is for the devs:Good job. It looks like you guys have been trying very hard on making this game as good as it can be. I haven't played much, but only because you guys are obviously not finished with it, but right now it looks like it has a lot of potential. There are a few bugs in there, like a shadow bug after taking away bricks (don't know if it's just me), but it looks like it's gonna be good. I really like where you guys are going. With that being said, I do have a few rants about it.-The open world  is all brown. I don't know if it's unaccesable (again, haven't played much), but it just looks kinda ugly on the world map site. I do not mean to offend.-restricting access to blocks from low levels is a weird mechanic. If the restricted blocks do something special, then sure, but if it's just decoration it's weird.there's more, but I am very tired this morning so I will stop here.			"

								Before this game was on steam, I tried it out for a bit. And I get tell you what this game is. A horrible MMO in which you do nothing but spam your spacebar to kill enemies and read the annoying jokes in large text. This game is pure pay2win and in what no manner has the right to call itself an oldschool 8bit roleplaying game. People will steal your kills in large grinding areas, which makes it almost impossible to level up to get blocks to build your own town without paying money. This game would be like if team fortress two had you pay a small fee out of your steam wallet to capture a control point, the main objective of the entire game. Pass this one on if you're not willing to put tens of hours of grinding into this ridiculous game.			"

								I logged in, had issues making my account so once I was able to get that done. I logged in and met RobbyZ or the NPC of.. He had me run around in the most.. Odd manner spamming my little 8bit sword with 26 other users to kill a slug to continue.And at this post I must stop my self, look this game isn't really that bad. I just can't find my self spending time on that kind of game when they are jsut soo many good RPG's out there to enjoy. For example if you must have one- for the same style of game go play rune scape- at least there are things to do in that game. Also the custom part of this game doesn't show till way late in the game and with how the community is blowing up on it. By the time any of us get there the whole place will be build with awful builds xP			"

								This game is in beta...and it still charges the testers for in-game purchases. I'm so dissapointed. 8-bit games possess some of my favorite titles: Mega Man 5, Legend of Zelda, Double Dragon, and Contra to name a few.  The writing is funny and creative. The combat is extremely basic. (Face enemy and hold spacebar.) The building aspect is what I loved the most. But to be in a town you only have two options. Beg somebody to let you into the town that they paid for, or buy one. I wouldn't really mind the whole asking for access into a town...except nobody seemed to be accepting anyone. I ran around doing quests and I saw the same people standing in place for half an hour just begging every mayor nearby to join. I never saw them move from those spots so I don't know if their pleading ever paid off.. In the end, the game is just not good. There are much better free MMO's to dump your time into than this.Also I cannot stress enough...it CHARGES BETA TESTERS FOR IN-GAME PURCHASES!!!			"

								Have you read other reviews? Most people have only played for 0.1 to 1 hour, and that's because that's how long they could play it before they wanted to rip thier balls off and choke on them. First, the story. There is none. In the beginning, you're met with a speech bubble containing something along the lines of ""You're the hero, save us, blah blah boring story stuff"" Now I like humor in games, but this was lust plain lazy. Second, it's not 8-bit, it just has graphics that look like buffallo diarrhea. Third, it's ""Free"" to play, at least from what I've read, and the quotation marks mean it tells you it's free, but really you need money to do anything. REAL money, not fake money you earn from playing. Now, you do earn virtual money from playing, but you need to do so much grinding, you might as well just use real money. Or better yet, STOP PLAYING! At least, if you did play. Or read other reviews. They are better.			"

Awful in appearance, difficult in understanding what it was I was supposed to/able to do, and forget building anything! Such a pain. I'm sorry, but unless you enjoy a game that looks as if it were designed in MS Paint, where they have the audacity to offer the ability to use -real money- for in game items, I do not recommend this game.

Lets start with community, This is your community, a little 10 year kid running around saying ""HOW DO DIS?"" ""HOW DO THAT?!"" ""YOU HAXER♥♥♥♥♥♥♥REPORTED!!"". You think thats bad? Well thats only part of it. Next thing, the tutorial barely tells you how to build (very disapointed i was excited for the building part and it gave a horrible tutorial on how to build) doesnt really teach you the basics (the creator was more like i ""HEY LETS NOT TELL THESE PEOPLE HOW TO PLAY THE GAME AND PUT ♥♥♥♥♥♥ HUMOR IN IT""). Last but not least the pay2win, I'll be honest it isnt the biggest pay to win game alive but it sure is one. If you want a game that makes you pay like 1000 coins for 1 block, then go ahead knock yourself out its stupid as hell to do something like that. Getting coins is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥too, you only get like 1 coin to killing 1 enemy which is a waste of time and total bull♥♥♥♥♥♥Overall I highly hope you waste your money on some other game 1/10 rot in hell developer.

												(English)8bitmmo is a fun game for those willing to pay attention, this is a great community and the game gives You numerous ways to bind you all together, to not feel so alone. To do other reviews, it seemed as if there was nothing to do and it's a pretty boring game, I think otherwise. You can build a mansion, the beginning of the city, PvP players with the right weapons you gifted the game menu weapons, and you can join one of our clans!, Clans is not a game, but still powerful in pvp and building. Clans are a great way to play with friends, and this is only the beginning of what you can do 8bitmmo. The building system is quite complex at first glance, but becomes fun. one you got the hang of it, I play this game to relax with friends I made in this brilliant game. 10/10(Русский)8bitmmo-это веселая игра для тех, кто готов обратить внимание, это большое сообщество, и игра дает Вам множество способов, чтобы привязать вас всех вместе, чтобы не чувствовать себя так одиноко. Сделать другие отзывы, казалось, как будто там нечего делать и это довольно скучная игра, я думаю иначе. Вы можете построить особняк, начало города, PvP игроков с нужным оружием ты одаренный меню игры оружия, и вы можете присоединиться к одному из наших кланов!, Кланы не игра, но все еще влиятельных в пвп и дом. Кланы являются отличным способом, чтобы играть с друзьями, и это только начало того, что вы можете сделать 8bitmmo. Системы здания-это довольно сложная на первый взгляд, но становится весело. одним вы получили повесить его, я играю в эту игру, чтобы расслабиться с друзьями я сделал в этой блестящей игре. 10/10			"

All u can use is a sword?! and ur sword is SUPER derpy.... it looks so weird when u swing it, hits awkwardlyBuilding=What the heck? it requires platnium to build these things :(Story line=TERRIBLE! JUST TERRIBLE! kill 12 lawyer cats? kill 20 lawyer cats? kill 30 lawyer cats? Really?Beginning= was fun, until i noticed 500 PLAYERS on! stealing all of the kills, lagging out my computer, and i could barely talk to the npcs!Graphics=Pretty bad, looks derpy :(      but hey, its early access as i said beforeAll in all, i think its pretty bad right now.... dont get it!

								There are so many things wrong with this game.  I feel as if the game was made by some middle-school child whom thinks cats are funny, and signs everywhere saying ""F*** YOU"" is hillarious and appropriate.  The main dungeons are simply just a couple small areas full of players farming spawnpoints, and to make matters worse it seems to have a pay to win type of free gameplay.  Otherwise you won't be able to make anything better looking than the minecrafts dirt house.  Also there are obvious memory leaks.My recommendation is simply to just ignore this things existence; I was hoping for a game which I could build underground dungeons and castles; and everything is just so ugly and awkward to do.

												Sometimes I vomit uncontrollably, spewing half digested supplements upon all that which stand in my immediate vicinity. Trying desperately to hold in my chunks, my eyes would bulge and the veins would pop, making my vision blurry and red, and as my vision begins to wane I try to let go and let myself vomit, but of course it's too late to stop my eyes from bleeding, and I would get a sharp pain in the side of my head. I often would black out and come to in a puddle of my own blood, mucus, stomache acid, clutching my belly, and tears streaking down my cheeks. These occurrences are quite a kin to playing 8BitMMO.

												This game is such a joke. It's as if it was made by a 12 year old, for a 12 year old with maybe some help from his dad or something. If you don't believe me, the test server is called ""potato"", a joke that I stopped hearing in 6th grade. The community is a disaster. If you could die from reading stupid messages, I'm sure there would have been atleast a medium sized mass extinction caused by the stupidity of people in this game. Most of them sound like they are between 6-8 yrs old. If you want to build a town in this game, hopefully you got a fat wallet cause this game is just the generic MMO pay2win trash. Platinum is required for a lot of things, and there's no known free way of getting it that I know of.The moderators will mute you for doing something as simple as constructively critisizing the game or saying something that they don't agree with.The game is horribly textured, most of it is something I could easily do myself in MS Paint. The character you play as is just a stick figure with a fat body, stick arms and legs, eyes that appear to be closed all the time, and a solid white colored body.All in all, discovering this game was a traumatic life experience of mine and I don't know if I'll ever be able to recover from how much this game caused my IQ to drop. I'm typing this right now in a mental hospital due to the traumatic memories and such I recieved from it. This game makes me feel like I'm reliving preschool			"

												I don't know what to say about this game. I downloaded it cause it's free to play and i was bored. For starters there is A LOT of chat text in this game. I feel like the whole start was a novel. Which is not my thing.It is a cute little game if you have nothing else to play at 3 am.. So I recommend it in that situation.			"

								When I first played this as a flash game some one and a half years ago,I experienced the same gameplay,same designs,and same everything from before.This game has made no effort to even improve its poor gameplay and controls,and it's pushing for the honour of being on Steam.I am truly shocked to see a piece of garbage like this on Steam,and am worried for the future.First this,then what?Wartune?

												I'd rather post a sideways thumb, but, as there ain't one, I'll give this a thumbs up, due to its creativity.I know my play time in 8bitMMO is pretty low, but thats just it. This game is so simple.  Its pixelated, so feels more like a computer game from 1993-2000. Literally. I felt like I'd fallen into a timewarp or something, when I first tried this.It should be noted that, messages from the community disappear after a few seconds, to minutes(depending on how many are chatting) so it is hard to tell how the community is, or how active it is, to me.Ai is the evil, really terrible....Lawyer Cats. Yea. That appears to be the basic enemy, and may be the only one on the game. Unless the quest sends you to kill a certain thing, such as slugs. And fighting is simple enough. Press the Spacebar. One Lawyer Cat down. Even if you got 4-5 Cats running after you. Oh and as of level 2, my total HP(Hit Points) is the very super high number of 6.You can also build in ""towns"" across the game. The owner is known as the Mayor, and with his permission, you can build in it, and become a citizen of that town. Then you place blocks down, similarly to MineCraft. Except the game has ""flat walls"" which is where the game world is flat, and you run along in, what looks like a maze of colored pixels. Just like back in the ancient days of gaming.Overall, this is probably the best MMO for children, or complete newcomers to the genre. Simple, and teaches you the basics of MMO gaming. It also lacks alot of that challenging, wanting to come back for more. Veteran MMO players will probably find this game super boring, while young kids, new MMO comers, or fans of pixelated Indie games may feel like they found a treasure trove with this game. Again, only reason I put a thumbs up was cause, 1. No neutral thumb and 2. Its creativity and uniquness of making it look so pixelated seems 1-of-a-kind.			"

It isnt fun, there isnt a wide variety of shops and weapons, you can earn gold that you can't do much with, the combat sucks, and the leveling is slow and usless. This is what a version 0.1 of a game should be. I take that back, it's what version 0.000001 should be. Don't get this game, because its too expensive. Free is too high of a price. Someone would have to pay ME to play this stupid game. Screw this ""MMO"" which should be a DSPWOT which stands for Deserted, Stupid,Pointless, Waste Of Time.

								Dis game is awesome,Yeah sure it can get a little boring with quests and once u finish the game it's like your character is just free for now, I recommend this for people who play ROTmg (Realm of the Mad God) and just wanted to be able to build on ROTmg.Lol, I hope this game gets bigger,It is really off to a nice start :)For now, my rating is 8/10.Another thing I liked is it only took about 5-9 minutes to download :D			"

								Good game, if you have 2GB RAM then you should be all good. I dont have that much of RAM unfortunately which causes me to lag at some point which bothers me. Why am i recommending it to people? Because, regardless of the requirements its actually a fun game. And even if i lag, i sometimes play just so i can lvl up or something when i'm bored lol. The gameplay looks VERY classic, nice pixels, of course coming from a game that said ""8bitmmo"" haha, thats how the game works isnt it? Lol! Anyways, its good to have friends to play this, its also a FREE game so go and fight with your friends or invite them in your house in which you make. Theres also PvP, so you can fight players. Anways its a free game so its not like anything matters lol, just give it a try. Its FREE!			"

								You know, i was originaly just going to leave this critism in the forums, as i did not want to leave a offical negitive review when the game has room to grow, but apparently critism is ground for being banned from the forums. so i guess ill leave this here1. game is not really 8 bit, just poor art, its a indy title so that is exusable, but it is insulting to 8-bit consols to imply that is what it looks like. the music is also not 8-bit, but chip music as there are real drums and stuff playing. 2. combat is poor, you just face the enemy and spam the attack key, 3. hard to see, the rendering has issues. hard to tell what is wall or floor.i did wish this game well, but not i am not so sure.

								The game gives me a very 8 bit vibe  a=but still looks good enough to be HD I personally love MMO's because its an adventure game and I absolutely love this game. The game is however glitched at somepoints so beware that the game isn't in the  best condition but the dungeon's and online play make up for that. Being able to communicate just incase your playing with a friend is really help so I reccomend playing this with friends its realt fun also the game is extreamly hard so don't evn think for the slightest seconnd your safe otherwise you might just get beatup in dungeon two. I absolutely love this game and anyone who loves multiplayer coop,8-bit games,MMO's,adventurer's,Dungeon Crawlers,and fun really ought to get this game plus its free so that makes the deal even sweeter			"

								So far, I've sunk 2 hours into this game and I love it. The business model, while somewhat constricting, does not require you to spend money, and you can have just as much fun without it. The player quests are a great idea, and if you get one which is broken, you can ask for a new one. The graphics are somewhat confusing, but if you made it through the tutorial you SHOULD get the hang of it fairly easily. The game's sense of humour is great, and so is the rest of it. It's kinda like if Minecraft were a dungeon crawler, with a few extra features on the side.			"

								This game is weak. I haven't played it for long, but the time that I spent on 8BitMMO was soul-crushing. I can't see how this was allowed onto Steam. But if playing immensely terrible games is your thing, then play this. You will regret it.- 1/10			"

								A funny game with great and helpful tutorial for begginers  things that need improving are the inventory items will stack over each other if you have a lot of items or the should be a option to sell items and MORE QUEST!!!! there a too few quest in the game and with newer quest they should say what the difficulty is because for example: mr.zombie brains quest the one with the 3 floor maze not exatcly good for begginers but over for this game i give it a 7/10 download it before you have to buy it			"

								I've played some Muds before that had amazing skills, spells, abilities, weapons, armor, accessories, classes, and power trees. You know, the works and a unique funky hat! I was expecting something alond those lines. This gives you a sword that does +1 damage. If you level up you get an additional 3 health and can buy the sword +2 damage. This game isn't just early access, it's just bad. Know mater how much polish they put on it, it will still be terrible.			"

								I personally find this to be more of a ""meh"" kind of game. Even though I hate to say it, this game is basically a 2D version of Minecraft. I really don't like to compare things to Minecraft because it is a stupid thing to say in my opinion, but whenever I play this game, I just keep thinking that I could have a better time playing Minecraft or Garry's Mod. If you happen to be looking for a game similer to Minecraft, there are many different free games made that are comparable to Minecraft. Even after all of the flack I gave this game, I am willing to say that this game was interesting to try.			"

								If you like building, Pokemon (The 8bit view field), PvP, puzzles, strategy, or showing off your fancy new hats or cloths, you will love this game. Learning how to build is a task worth learning. Listen to what Draco the Dragon has to say!! He will help a lot. If you ever want to recieve the godly Red Sword, you will have to level up like crazy! Leveling up gets harder and harder, but keep up with the missions, and you will be there in no time. Some of the Player Quests are pretty hard, but read the signs, and reguard the traps and you'll be done in no time! I'd definately recommend this game, it suits all of my gaming wants/needs.			"

								8BitMMo is fun. Nevertheless to say, much like other ""F2P"" games, it's more of Pay2GetTheRestOfTheGameTemporarily.Why do i say it's that? It's that because the other half of the game, if you want to pay 5$ CONSTANTLY to have all the extra pieces from the store, you need platinum. Platinum is the in-game form of ""Screw you all who only have gold, i'm going to lock the rest of the game down till you pay"". It's stopping the gameplay. THIS is the problem with F2P. If you say it's F2P, DON'T LOCK THE GAME DOWN UNTIL WE PAY. Fine, Slow gameplay down a bit. Make the pieces harder to get, but don't stop the gameplay.The idiots who do the microtranscations just feed the creator of this gam---- WAIT LEMME REPHRASE THAT! The creator of this Travisty, not game.Onto the actual gameplay. The AI feels cheaply made and easy to farm, Infact, I could make the same in minutes.Actual gameplay? Once again cheaply made. I RARELY fight things in the wilderness. That's caused by things RARELY spawning. Player quests are terrible; I can barely complete one due to hidden reward blocks, etc. It's not the monsters that make them hard. Once again, they're crappily made. Next up, The building tools. Oh god. Multilayered 2D building. That's it, I'm done. No more. I'm uninstalling this crap.So yeah. I give this game 3/10. If it weren't 100% player built, It'd be a .000000000000000001/10.Given, the game is still being made and there's room for MAJOR improvement, But come on, really? Flipping ""Flappy Bird"" is better than this game. Hold on lemme add another thousand zeros in that decimal. If the developer of this travisty sees my post, Please do fix the things i listed. Actually, lemme correct my rating.I'm gonna be nice here. .1/10EDIT: ""Become a zombie""? I HAVE TO PAY REAL MONEY TO DO THAT? WHY DID I WASTE 256 MB OF DISK SPACE?

								Quite fun, and a time-killer as well. Does need a bit of work:1) When exiting menus such as the inventory when the 'Drop Active' build tool is on, a block is automatically placed on the ground when clicking even if you don't click on the ground.2) The building blocks in the air quest-you can basically place any block anywhere and still pull it off. Also I don't quite understand the z-axis lock...it's not really explained very clearly.I haven't played the game for too long, as you can tell, and I'm aware that it needs improvement, but overall it's a fun little thing. :)EDIT: Also, the shop interface could use some work. It tells me I'm buying things in quantities of ten, and when I open my inventory there is only one of each block that I bought.And when placing blocks, I placed eleven, and then destroyed them all, and only got 7 back...Also the quest where you have to place 100 blocks- you really don't have to build anything at all. You can simply place blocks, remove them, place them again, etc.			"

								Walking in buildings is really confusing because you can't tell wheter if there's a door in the wall or not also what you think is a wall suddenly turns transparent once you walk into it revealing to be a roof or something like that.The tutorial is really annoying, confusing and you need to buy every single block you use to build with gold which you get from missions that also suck. Some background music would be good.			"

								this game is highly addictive in a good way, of course. it lets u express your imagination in an easier way than the other multiplayer sandbox,RPG, and adventure games (such as minecraft or garrys mod). it is pretty much impossible to put stress on u like losing things or having others destroy your wonderful creations.the only thing in this game u wouldnt like is when ur NOT playin it. luv the excessories, blocks, characters, pixels, EVERYTHING. also im a fan of 8-bit games. this game is wonderful and in my opinion, RobbyZ is pretty funny. And so are creatures u fight. Lawercats, lobbysnails, hipsters, HYSTERICAL. I recomend this game cause millions should be playin it. in summary this game ROCKS! (but maybe u could befriend cpu's or something and they help u and die with u and never get lost. and u could only have up to 2 or somthin like dat)                                                                                   Good work,      :)			"

								Well... Let's get started. For it's current state, this game is absolutley terrible. The animation is shotty at best and sometimes your character will randomly speed up for no reason. While moving objects, people and body parts tend to disappear and reappear, making it very hard to not get a seizure. The building... Oh boy... I like the idea that you actually have to kill things for building supplies. By killing monsters, you get gold, which can be used to purchase blocks. But, due to would-be reasonable protection systems for your creations, you can build almost NOWHERE. Heres how it is: You cannot break other player's blocks, or build/break around their blocks. Reasonable, right? No. At the beginning town, Origin, some d-bag must've come through and broken all the grass and replaced it with their own. When trying to place a block (which are awkward because they are 2x1) it says: ""You cannot place near other peoples blocks!"". This game is currently very, very bad, and I understand its WIP, but whoever made this should've at least had a working movement system that looked decent before releasing this to the public. So let's recap: Horrible animation, d-bag players, odd block dimensions, glitchy npcs, and disappearing things, not to mention a horrible movement system. I think the only thing I can say thats good about this game is its sillyness through chat with npcs, monster names, etc,. But it does not make up for all the absolutley broken mechanics of this game. It isn't even a REMOTELY original idea. Building and fighting in a blocky world! NEVER HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE!			"
