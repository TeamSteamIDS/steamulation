								After playing this game for 19 hours learning all about the game since this is the first spaz game i bought i came into a troublesome bug that the dev team replied quickly and did thier best to help fix this problem but sadly couldnt due to it getting corrupted and the bug not able to be replicated. So the devs sent me a fixed version of just past the mission where it bugged out and gave some recources for lost progress after they did that i had to write this review and just say thank you to the devs for thier support and keep building an amazing game have a nice day :D			"

								I can't describe how much I love this game. There is an amazing amount of polish and balance, from the visuals and the strategic depth, all the way to the raw and dirty visceral depths that combat can descend to.Let me tell you about the combat; It is good. My most memerable battle so far was a 2v2 where I aided a weaker captain vs a bandit, only for a high level bandit to join in.Bandit capital ships are weaker but they have an insane number and reserve of strike craft, which increases by level (not fighters, those are different). My ally engaged the motherships while I thinned the swarm but he was being overwhelmed, so I rammed the strongest enemy and kept thrusting to push him away (ramming is a big mechanic, more on it later). Freed to 1v1, my ally succeeded in destroying the first pirate, but at high cost; his shields down, his nose and two wing modules torn off and floating free, a core destroyed and his health but a sliver. Sensing blood, the swarm of strike craft pounced. There was nothing I could do to save him. He exploded magnificently, destroying many of his attackers who were too slow to flee.The remaining pirate and I circled while exchanging broadsides, each deadly piroette bringing us closer to a field of asteroids. His strongest weapons were on his nose and he fought to bring them to bear. I, meanwhile, was slightly more manoeuverable and clung on the the relative safety of his rear, while picking of the remaining swarm. Our shields failed at the same time.Shields, armour and hull are not just 3 interchangeable stats in SPAZ2. Shields are the most familiar, a flat, regenerating, protective field. Armour is different. Every single non core piece of the motherships have their own armour, some of which is shared to the core. If a part loses all its armour, it is torn off, and sometimes destroyed. Hull, or health is only relevent to the cores of the ship and when that is gone; boom. So unlike other games, it isn't destroy shields>armour>hull with various piercing weapons, it is shields>tear them to pieces or shoot straight for the core.We tore each other to pieces. I took his right wings out but clipped an asteroid at speed, destroying my left. Caught against it, he was able to bring his nose to bear, shreading off my remaining wings and one of my engines. Now he was more manoeuverable.In despairation, I boosted, smaller asteroids tearing into my hull until I placed a large one between us. Frustrated momentarily, he stopped and reloaded. Seizing this last opportunity, I came out of hiding behind him, my last weapons pounding his engine, trying to even the score. But it wasn't enough. He began to turn and rained fire on my last engine. Before I could be left helpless, I once more boosted, this time straight at his exposed engine, knocking it into the void while my nose crumpled and exploded.Both helpless now, no engines, but still he had weapons and he slowly, ever so slowly, turned to bring that hateful nose to bear. With nothing left, I had a moment of inspiration and grabbed the astreroid chunks with my tractor beam. In space, surrounded by the refuse of awesome technology, I beat him to death with a rock.A narrow victory, I collected the refuse of our 4 ships to just bearly rebuild 1, and then jumped to the void.All actions described above REALLY ARE IN THE GAME. If two things collide, they do armour type damage (very weak vs shields, weak vs hull) to eachother based on their mass and speed. If you can get an enemies shields down while yours are still up, boost at him/her, smash their bits off! Beware of ramming with your shields down, as you can wreck yourself. Finally, you can rebuild your mothership WHILE IN COMBAT. A wing came off? Try and grab it before it goes to far, and reattach it! Enemies powerful weapon came off? Remove your own and replace it!Did I mention I love this game?Also, there are so many viable ways of building your mothership, and none are perfect for all situations. I keep parts in storage to swap forms when dealing with different kinds of threats (General flying, starbases, pirates, mining) but my general form is the ION shield ram: Huge shields/thrust and some ION weapons or lasers to take down shields so I can ram them. It is weak to strike craft and starbases however, and is hard to mine with.			"

Early Access Review
								I felt the need to expand the review, since there was a lot of complaining going on all over the place, from people that have barely played through a tutorial but presenting themselves as able to properly judge the game. There is also a lot of complaining that it's not SPAZ 1.5. If you've played SPAZ 1, this part is for you, otherwise you can skip it entirely:1. All resource collecting is done on strategic map now, without pointless grind and a waste of time. There is also no limit on resources you can carry, which is great news. Having to watch how ships mine for ten minutes straight was a chore of SPAZ 1 and I never liked it even 1 bit.All that resource micromanagement never added to the game, since after you've lost a battle or it was hard and led to loss of resources, game STOPPED and you would spend next half an hour collecting resources.2. Skill trees are gone and replaced with three random skills per level.Some will say, that skill trees in SPAZ1 were great, when they were actually not.You had to upgrade a skill to be able to use better tech, and once you knew a cookie cutter build you could easily blast through the game, or got gimped for a looong time if you didn't. Because of this you could never upgrade everything or try everything in one play (and that is an extremely long time). Game could actually punish you for trying wrong and it did.Skills in SPAZ 2 are extremely helpful and relevant to the player actually making you stronger, and unpredictable pattern doesn't allow a winning level up in each gameplay. With new content, there can be more skills added leading to more variety, without the need to lock them to a path.3. Blueprints are gone. Finally, for the best.That was another grinding aspect in SPAZ 1.There were barely two viable strategies: blow up the station (if you can, huh) to get all blueprints inside, or spend goons to impove relationship and then REZ to buy it (and then get back grinding goons/REZ back).With ship blueprints, you had to destroy a ship a number of times to get all parts of blueprint to unlock that ship. Incredible chore, cause you either had to be lucky, or repeat a mission to get those blueprints.In SPAZ 2 an ingame economy and leveling up gets you better and bigger parts. You protect transporters in order to get better tech, and upgrade bases. And of course you loot enemies for it as well, even on the battlefield, which is great.4. Combat is deeper however you disagree with it. Instead of basically an energy regeneration for everything in the game, you now have separate sources to manage.Energy battery can protect your shields from getting down with a boost under heavy fire until enemy need to reload.Boost engines allow you to ram through the enemy or get further away.Energy battery allows you to keep firing and once depleted you have to reload, which also makes it impossible to boost up shields or regenerate them if they are gone.Asteroids protects you from heavy bombs and enemy fire, while can also be used with a tractor beam to damage the enemy. There are powerups on the field, REZ ""balls"" that might spawn some zombies and barrels to blow up.Battle wagon mode allows to pass weapon controls to AI, which is incredibly useful against small strike crafts, but it uses battery ineffectively which leads to more reloads and decreases survival chances.5. Mothership is not smaller ships from previous game, those are still here and they're recognizable.How can one describe SPAZ 2?Have you played Mount and Blade? Good, cause the idea behind strategical map, factions, captains and other stuff is basically the same.Economy is real, bases produce stuff, ships transfer stuff, captains trade and fight, zombies infect, bandits mess up. Diplomacy allows for alliances, friendship, bounties and so on. You can even share parts and resources if you need to.You can start a proper faction and take over eventually, but it's NOT easy even one bit since there are lots of threats that needs your attention.In combat you manage a number of ship resources to increase performance, and survive as long as possible until you catch an enemy on reload phase when they are most vulnerable, strip off their shields and ram them to death. :) You won't see it in low level fights, but then it gets important.Ship building is difficult, since parts are hard to find and there's always more you want to install than you can with different strategy involved. In 7 hours I have barely seen any tech at all with 16 level. You can't slap random crap on a ship and win, nope, only in the tutorial.There is nothing in the game that MAKES you waste time on routine stuff anymore and it's awesome!You can attach to you ship a torn apart enemy part on the battlefield any time, or reattach something you've lost yourself. You can even throw it in the enemy with a tractor beam.The game is incredible already, since it has solid well planned foundation and it can only get even better in time with the help of developers and mods. I mentioned it before, that there is only one feature needed - LARGER battles with more ships involved. That is one thing I want to see, something like 10-15 motherships in one intense battle.For the 18$ it's one of the best purchases I've made, besides the.. M&B.*Some small fixes..			"

								Okay so what can be said about SPAZ 2... Tl;DR: SPAZ 2 is worth every penny. Holy crap it's fun and awesome for anyone looking for a neat new take on a great series. The game is great in every area as far as I'm concerned, and I was a huge SPAZ fan from the start. Sadly this account doesn't reflect the years of college that I was playing the game during my down time but trust me when I say I've got plenty of hours invested.Here's a quick warning:  THE GAMEPLAY IS NOTHING LIKE SPAZ 1   Take it or leave it, it's not SPAZ in any format except some concepts and characters you'll remember. You aren't flying around constantly trying to scavenge REZ so you can have a surplus for purchases, you don't fly one vessel or another and have a hearty upgrade system that allows for full blown customization/focus, and you can't BS spam support-craft every time one of them blows up. Okay so there, that's my big warning. If you want SPAZ 1 in your SPAZ 2 you're a touch out of luck. The game is still perfect and worth your money, it's just don't come in here expecting SPAZ 1 because you won't find it. I consider this game the successful sequel that used SPAZ as a stepping stone.So you start off pretty straight forward, welcome to sometime in the future after SPAZ 1's story. You are now floating on a tactical battlemap with a crap ton of other motherships floating around doing whatevery they want. Unlike SPAZ you aren't the only player getting stuff done, the AI is also going from point to point, harvesting resources you probably want, picking fights left and right, and just causing some general issues in the grand scheme. Mothership. You don't have this giant beast of a ship from the first one, you start off in a crappy clunker that can be upgraded/fixed on the fly. I'm not even joking, the whole gimmick for motherships is everything snaps off and can be attached to random ports on your ship. Got a wing piece that shoots saw-blades? Welp just going to clip off my other wing that's in the way and snap that bad boy on!Economy is something this game has. Want to buy something? Hope you have the scrap (the new rez in terms of currency), want to get from point A to point B on the map? Girl I hope you had luck stockpiling a small bit of REZ because REZ is a huge pain in the butt to harvest enough but oh jeez it's so worth it! Goons are back as well, but they really don't impact too much. I often found myself floating with a surplus of Goons and that's not good for your REZ usage but after a while you either stop caring or get half of them killed doing ship repairs.So, as one can tell by my hours right out the gate, I was a tester for SPAZ 2. The devs have been incredibly understanding and willing to work around the advice I had given on gameplay and it opened the door for a lot of great additions or changes to gameplay. Try to keep this in mind, if you have an idea or want to push for some fixes be civil and post about it in the community forum here on Steam. They check and they pay attention. I'm not paid to say any of this, they are just some really great guys who want everyone to be happy for the most part.That's my review right there folks. You love SPAZ like me so you're eyeballin' SPAZ 2 after a long wait or you're new to the game at which point I'm recommending you play the first SPAZ and try to pick up a copy of SPAZ 2 after you beat it. There is some story that's good to know but you won't get the right footing story wise if you start solely with SPAZ 2.Some advice for players:1: Build your ship length wise. Believe it or not building more DAKKA (firepower) is important over all things. DPS is key!2: Sell everything you don't particularly need. Trust me, you'll get way more crap than you'll need parts wise and it'll slow you down!3: If you're playing as a pirate make sure you understand your ship's limits in combat.4: THIS GAME IS A BROADSIDE BATTLER. One side of your ship should be missiles or support, the other side cannons!5: Does the enemy have a sexy weapon you want? Carve it off their ship! Your weapons can damage individual components on ships now and they blow off if they take too much damage!6: Yes, you can literally scrap pieces off enemy ships, even when in combat! 7: Don't be a♥♥♥♥♥♥if you can't handle fighting. If you mess with someone too much they may bounty you, then you're getting stalked by like 20 AI stronger than you. Be careful!8: Save Scumming is okay! Sometimes you'll get into fights where you're boned from the start, luckily the game seems to save before every conflict.That's about all I can offer. The game, as I said, is amazing and I recommend picking up a copy or two if you've got a buddy! MinMax is still a two man team after all these years and they put a whole mess of love and effort into this title. I know the wait has been rough for a lot of us and I totally cried after the delay was announced, but it's here and it is an amazing title. "

								I want to preface this review by saying that not only am I a big fan of the original SPAZ, I also respect and admire MINMAX for experimenting with their original model and stepping outside the box for their sequel.That being said, I think they stepped out of one box and into another.SPAZ 2 retains the charmingly witty-yet-stupid writing and dialogue of the original game that reminds of a Saturday-morning cartoon. The aesthetics have also remained the same; blurry textures composed of screamingly high contrast colors that bore into your retinas. On top of that, the from-scratch gameplay is also retained from the original game, where you start with practically nothing and build your empire on top of that. Aside from the actual space combat, these things define SPAZ pretty well, and if that's all you're looking for, you won't be disappointed.This is all SPAZ 2 has in common with the original, however. In the transition to 3d, much has changed. You now get to fly and build the mothership, you are now the biggest fish in the sea. Right Hooks and Tugs are tiny compared to the hulking, glorious piece of junk that is your ship. You start off with a scaffold looking like it was built entirely out of old bicycles by an inpatient from a mental hospital. Over the course of the entire game, from start to finish, you will upgrade from bicycles to smashed car-shaped objects.This modular mothership, along with the ability to establish and govern starbases, seems to be giving us what we didn't have, and wanted in the original SPAZ. An interstellar empire. Flying the Clockwork. AI that don't run face-first into the enemy's largest ship and die instantly, wasting thousands of Rez. Actually, that's still a thing, but they only waste small amounts of scrap instead because they're only piloting small fighter ships.This lends a much more strategic feel to the game. And I'd call that an advantage. However, much was lost in the transition:First of all, everything feels like it's about the same size. Gone are the days of warping into a battlefield and attempting to take down a ship 20 times your size with bombing runs. The smallest mothership is maybe 1/4 the size of the largest. Heck, even space stations just look like circular, spinning motherships that can't move.Next, ship design doesn't matter as much. In the original, when you were restricted to chassis with a set number of module slots and module types, you knew exactly how your own ships worked, and their strengths and weaknesses. When you looked at an enemy ship, you could distinctly see what modules were attached to it (unless it was cloaked), and you knew how those weapons would affect your fleet. What weapons a ship had often determined whether you'd try to take it down for its blueprints, or flee with your tail between your legs.Now, you pretty much slap whatever module will fit on your mothership and has the most stars. Because of the randomness of parts, both in terms of their perks (the bonuses they confer to your ship, like shield strength, speed, health, etc.), and in terms of the weaponry on them (cannons, beams, the works), both when you're scavenging, and when you're shopping at space stations, it's very unlikely that you're going to find exactly the part you're looking for.I get what they were going for here; you're a scavenger among scavengers. It's not about what you want, it's about what works. But, that being said, it isn't very compelling. The chances of me finding a part that: a) looks the way I want it to look, b) has a weapon that I want on it, and c) has the bonuses that I want (which I don't even keep track of anyways), is almost null. The chances of me finding *multiple parts* that I actually want are nonexistant.This results in your mothership EITHER looking like a piece of trash, that has EITHER nice weapons OR nice stats, OR a mothership that looks nice and is completely worthless in terms of battlefield effectiveness. Yes, that was a nested either-or statement. And, usually, what ends up happening is you get a muddy mix of all of these things.The end result is that you don't feel like the ship you're flying is *your* mothership, even though you built it piece-by-piece. It feels like you just cobbled together what the game gave you and now you're flying it around.And, all of these things would be fine if they took advantage of the things they gained; We're in 3d now. There's a lot to explore, right?Not... Really. You still fly your ship in 2d, while asteroids hover tantalizingly over and under you. You still effectively fight in 2d; you can't go over or under an enemy ship. The battles are more bland than the original game. Explosive barrels don't matter as much, and neither do asteroids. They feel much more staged, 2-4 ships warp in, 1-3 ships warp out. The outcome is largely determined by your stats, and who warps in with you. Positioning can matter, but ships are so random and cobbled together that it's hard to tell when you're facing directly into an enemy's broadside, or if the other side is even worse. You can't ""get used to"" an enemy faction. You can't take advantage of a ship's slow turning speed and its blind spots. You really can't dodge missiles anymore. There is no longer a cloaking system (except for in the star map, where it doesn't really matter), and ""big"" weapons like Mass Bombs don't feel as significant.That's what it is. A lot of elements have lost their character. Rez is no longer the rainbow-colored candy it was, now it's just a generic purple blob that you pick up. Finding a new color of Rez stone felt like moving to a different level. Things are worth more now. Ships are bigger. Now it's just numbers on a screen.Goons have gotten even less important. You no longer scavenge for rescue pods, or steal from hotels; just numbers on a screen. You need to maintain a minimum number of goons, and you shouldn't have too manygoons. Finding the last blueprint to a weapon you really want is no longer a thing. Sometimes you stumble across a part that has a unique weapon on it, and you get to use that one part, and you will never find that same weapon ever again. And if you do, it's going to be on a worthless part.The game feels smaller. You can cross the whole starmap in a matter of minutes, faster towards the start of the game and slower towards the end (the opposite of the original game), and you probably won't be attacked.It's not a bad game. I just don't see why I would play it over the original SPAZ, which has much more crisp, interesting RPG gameplay and gunplay. Or Istrolid, which offers the modularity and customizability of SPAZ 2 with much faster, more satisfying top-down gameplay. Or why I would play it over Dreadnought, or Fractured Space, which are full-blown third person space shooters with interesting tactical gameplay and the advantage of other players.SPAZ 2 seems to be a mashup of various genres, and sadly, it doesn't work, at least not for me.

								After 45 hours I won the game, such a blast to play. Different than SPAZ1 but funny like SPAZ1, a good mix of arcade space battles along with a great story. I finished the story and I have not even played the Sandbox yet. I could say alot about the game but I do not want to give alot away, just that it is deeper than one would think. Story has some fun twists and turns. It was fantastic to build my ship up, earning experience points to make it strong. I am so glad I played it, great hours spent for me.			"

Early Access Review
Quick noteThe mixed rating is because the devs could not add multiplayer into the game due to major issues.The devs made a fairly long detailled post about this, but it was removed. So here's the short version for wy it was cancelled :After updating the game engine (Unity),the devs realised that unity completely changed how multiplayer works, thus all work done on multiplayer before that was lost. They wanted to upgrade to the newer engine to improve performance and the long term compatibility with the new systems coming in the next few years. (Performance was indeed much better after the upgrade.)They then tried to start over the multiplayer work but had several issues doing so. After trying to work around the problems for over a month, they made no progress at all with multiplayer.Eventually, the devs took feedback form the players about that issue. Most agreed to scrap multiplayer in favor of adding more content to the single player experience istend.At that point multiplayer was scrapped.That's about it. Some details are missing here but this is what hapened in a nut shell.Anyway, on to the actual review.IntroThis is one of a kind game that should NOT be left under the radar.Space Pirates and Zombies 2 (Or spaz 2),Is a game with many different gameplay elements in one game.If you played the original spaz, this game is quite different form that game.In this game, you control a fully customizable mothership with Elsa has her captain trying to earn a place of power in the galaxy.Homever you are not the only one...There are other 199 captains roaming around.They follow the same rules that the player does, with few exceptions.The game is also very well polished, more so that you expect.Go to the ---TLDR--- if you just want to see pro/cons of the game.The meatThe major gameplay element is the starmap screen, where you can plan your destination and interact with several things like other captains, resources zones, starbases and other events. All traveling/resource gathering is also done on the star map, greatly reducing the grind you usually find in X4 games.Starbases is where you can use scrap (in game currency) to buy much needed resources like Rez (Think of rez like Gas) or buy parts for your mothership.You can also battle in the arena with preset ships for rewards and improve relations with other captains. (More onthat later)Ship customizationYou can fully customize your own mothership using the loot you find or buy them at shops.You want have lot of projectiles weapons? You can.You want be a carrier type mothership with lots of drones? You can.You want go nuts with a lot of missiles? You can.You prefer using beam weapons? You can.The way your ship handle in combat depends entirely on how you build it. Want to go fast?                     Use more engines.Want a better turn rate?          Use more wings.Want to have more shields?    Use more noses.Finding the parts you want may be hard, but there is a VERY helpful catalog system where you can order parts form and getting them delivered to you directly.The Captains and FactionsYour actions can cause a captain to like or hate your guts.If a captain likes you, he/she is more likely to help you in battles and gives you better prizes when shopping at his/her station. This also work in reverse, of course. If a rich captain really hates you, you can expect a bounty on your head. While captains that are friends with you will not try to collect the bounty, the others will.You can also put a bounty on someone else if you want.There is 5 main factions in the game that you can join after building relations with other captains of that faction.At that point you can have your own starbase in the faction you joined if you spend time gathering resources and build a station for your faction.Stations is like a bank where you can drop resources and parts for later use, also a good source of passive income.Each factions specialize in something, giving a specific bonus for parts they sell. (like Speed/armor/shields and power.) Some weapons type can only be found in a specific faction.You unlock the ability to form your own faction and build your own empire of imbeciles and simpletons with you has the leader later on.Space Pirates and Zombies?Now you may wonder, what the heck the *zombies* in thetitle mean?At some point in the game, the zombies will make a appearance. How they show up depend if you play the campaign or the sandbox mode.They do what you expect them to do, no much else to say...Oh and try not to get infected, wash your hands often.CombatsFights will usually happen vs. bandits, captains, starbases...and Zombies of course.The combat is done in a 3D Arcade shooter style with the option of a top view or behind your mothership with the ability to switch at anytime.Up to 4 captains/zombies/bandits can participate in a battle, ending in 1 vs. 1, 2 vs. 2 and 1 vs. 3.Combats are fairly fast,with lots of effects form fired weaponand usually quite hectic.You and other captains can also have smaller ships (Called Strikecrafts) to aid in battle.And yes, those are also customizable.You can unlock more type of strikecrafts by collecting blueprints in battle. Collecting more for a already unlocked ship will eventually make it more powerful.If a mothership gets damaged eneuf, the ship may lose parts of itself.Attacking a specific part of a ship for a while will eventually break it, this is userfull for 2 reasons : weakening the enemy ship and extra loot after a battle. Some weapons are better that other to break parts.TLDR (Pros and Cons)Again, most downvotes for the game is because multiplayer got scraped.Even so it still got it's perks, the game do not deserve to be brushed aside just for that reason alone.Ok, starting with cons because i prefer a good end.Cons :1.Lack of diplomacy options for factions. The core is here and it works, but is missing things like trading/no-agression and a few others. 2.The story leaves something to be desired.3.Modding is not possible. Offset by using the various sliders in sandbox mode that changes how the game plays.4.Too easy/quick to become the *Biggest fish* in the galaxy.5.I wish you could build more that starbases in the galaxy map. (Like building on resources zones to speed up the gathering rate for example.)6.Can be confusing to play for the first time. (Don't Skip the tutorials the first time you play.)Pros :1. Good customizations option for your mothership and your fleet.2.Devs being very informative,you always knows what's hapening and are constant to fix minor/major bugs really quickly.3.Great replay value, thanks to many sliders(Or mutators) in sandbox mode. Over 50 new options was added in 0.9.1, for a total of 73 different tweak possible so even more changes is possible now.)4.The grind is minimal, making the game fun form the very start to the end.5. A Fairly deep Captain relation system.6. Be free to play YOUR way, even in story mode.7. There's no games comparable to this. Closest being the mount and blade games. But it's still a completely different game.8.The galaxy feels alive, thanks to the many other captains roaming around. (200 including you)9.Early access done right. No really, it's one of the best early access progress i seen, check the *Major Update Stockpile.* in the forums to have an idea on how much it progressed.If you like space battles with tons of customizations options with great replay value, you will love this game.

Early Access Review
								If you're hoping for combat similar to SPAZ 1, I'm sorry but you're going to be disappointed. While there are some faults with this game, I can easily overlook them for how cheap it is, and how much time I believe I'll be getting out of it. (As a rule of thumb, you should always cut 1/4 the hours of someones gametime out, they can gain time being tabbed out or just accidently leaving the game up.)Pros:• Star Map is fantastic, it reminds me of Mount and Blade Warband. There are people everywhere with their own motivations,• Combat is really neat, but is different from SPAZ 1. Its more broadside pirate-like combat now. Also, being able to ram your way out of a bad situation feels amazing. Your ship parts are VERY important.• Built in option for hardcore players to reset via lore-friendly means. Many people like punishment, and this allows that.• Game looks very nice, especially when a multi-party battler takes place.• Ship building has been fixed, before it was a very tiring system to work with, but this has since been changed.• Strike Craft can now be customised, and are based off of the ""main ships"" that were your controllable ships in the first game. A nice nod to those who have played SPAZ 1.• Bandits can now ""evolve"" by stealing parts off of those who they'ved defeated, making some insignificant, and others very formidable.• They've made it harder to take out starbases, which makes a lot of sense. Before you could basically just roll up and blow it out of the sky, or place an incredibly small bounty on it and watch it get blown up by the dozens of captains swarming at it. Now there are penalties for placing bounties, and captains want much more for the risk to be worth it.Cons:• The default controls feel really bad to a lot of people. However that can be fixed: Options > Gameplay > Relative Controls.• You can easily outrun high-load missiles, but some NPC's like to just sit inside them and die (Gravity, Zombies, ect.)• Weapon and Armour Systems can be hard to understand.

Early Access Review
								Spaz 2 is definitely a departure from the first game in many grand ways and I feel this is a good thing. That's not to say that the core of what made the first game a blast to play isn't there, you'll still be spending many hours blasting away ships of all kinds with a very large pool of weapon choices and traversing a vast map. One of the major changes is the world map. Now you are no longer stuck in gated off zones but instead are part of a huge living map where every action you take can have consequences with close neighbours or even across the entire map. Every single ship captain has their own agendas and memories of what you and each other have done throughout the game, some will like you, some will be your nemesis depending on what you can do for them or they for you. Best way I could sum it up even though its still different  would be that the world map feels like mount & blade in space, with lasers. Make and break alliances, work for existing faction or set up a territory and faction all your own.Another major change was the move to 3d. On the surface it feels like a huge shift from what Spaz 1 felt like and of course looked like but after a few minutes of familiarizing yourself with the game and the new 3rd person view during combat, the spirit of spaz's hectic fire fights shines through (the devs did leave in a top down camera views for the old school fans). I love the new look with its vibrant colours and ship part styles that, depending on how they are fit together, can give a look of new off the lot or cobbled together to survive. Another huge benefit to the move to 3d is the ship building portion. Each part of the ship has its own stats and effects and its up to the player to build both what they would think works well and to what parts you currently have access to. Want a ship with guns for days? Build it. Want a ship that can turn on a dime? Build it. Not feeling the build you got going right now and want to tune it? No problem, just hop into your ship build menu from the overworld map and rip off parts and socket new ones on.If your looking for hours of fun blasting your way through a galaxy that can hate you and love you, looking for that perfect combination of parts to tune your ship into the type of death machine you want to pilot around, I thoroughly recommend this game.

								Excellent game, initially quite challenging.. so would recommend to only pay attention to reviewers who have put in 20 + hours....The game offers EXTREME customisation.. I've been a game player since the 80's and typically prefer gameplay first and foremost...SPAZ2 is a leading example of how to develop a game, and also importantly the developers listen to comments from players...

 This review has been written after finishing the game, twice...The gameplayThe core gameplay is rock solid and fun. You will be directing your (mother) ship across the galaxy in an effort to eliminate a zombie thread. Conflicts are unavoidable, and you will have to duke it out with other pilots, zombies, and starbases, with a wide selection of weaponry. Lasers, missiles, Drones and more can be used to decimate the opposition in impactul fights, which will put your choice of weapons, your situational awareness, and your piloting skills to the test.While you're not busy blowing things up, you can ""direct"" allies, and other captains to do the work for you by way of bounties. Want a base ""removed"", but you're not feeling confident about your ships strength? Let the money do the work for you. Had a bully picking on you? See how he fares against several fortune seekers and have the last laugh.Your shipIs going to be comprised of cores, weapons, engines, and noses. Cores come in different types with different boosts to your ships overall stats, some will make your ship more maneuverable, others will be more beneficial for your shields. You can mix and match cores according to your liking, and create a slow moving juggernaut ship, a fast hit-and-run bomber, a missile boat, or pretty much everything else. Getting higher quality cores and components, as well as making the most of them, satisfies the tinkering mood.The visualsBlasting foes is not only fun, it also looks flashy, while not overburdening your eyes with absurd particle-effect-spam. A nice mix of ""Did you see that explosion?!"" and ""I see what you did there."" The art-style works is what I'm saying.The campaign so farIt's a ""moving up in the food chain"" experience, which does not disappoint. There are some twists and turns to it, as well as some good sense of humour during dialogues. You are encouraged to constantly consider how your actions affect other pilots and even factions as you proceed. One can only speculate what is going to be added to the campaign in terms of side missions in the future, but don't be fooled, there is always something to do already.So there you go, a nice well-rounded package worth picking up. If you want some more Space-Zombie action, consider picking up the original S.P.A.Z. for the definitive experience.			"

Early Access Review
								As of now the game feels much too unfinished. But it's early access so thats to be expected.There's quite a bit of potential but people coming to this game having played the original SPAZ will be very disappointed. It's its own game by its own right but if you enjoyed features from SPAZ such as the things listed below, don't come into SPAZ 2 looking for them.-Missions: Gone, outside of the main campaign missions the old system based missions and quests aren't there anymore. No more random jobs listed on the system map. So how do you make money you ask? There are random nodes strewn about the galaxy map that you have to “ransack” for resources. This hurts your relations with the various owners of these nodes, but that’s about as similar as this game will get to its predecessor. Instead of the fun options you had previously, which often involved blowing things up owned by people because other people offered to pay you, now the game feels like it can be played entirely from the galaxy map. You’ll find yourself more annoyed than anything to enter combat.-Combat: The fast passed combat from the previous game has been replaced with slower, smaller scale (Fights are often 1v1 but sometimes up to 3v3) engagements that feel like they take ages to end. The typical fight is just the two ships firing volleys into each other until someone’s shields go down and then that person dies. Strike craft feel nearly useless half the time, unless their equipped with mini-gun weapons, which allow them to kill every missile in the entire instance until they are killed.-The Blueprint System: This one hurt the most. No longer are you able to reverse engineer other ships and then make them from your stored resources. Now you either buy parts outright (and then have to lug around, which you're penalized for) or snag them from the wrecks of ships you've destroyed or happened upon. While the system is functional it is very frustrating to be unable to use the games new ship creation mechanic to its full potential, as you have to have the parts readily or else you cannot modifying your vessel. This feels like a very odd decision by the devs. They had a very, very good system in the previous game. And this isn’t nostalgia talking. The blueprint system not only added a very fun incentive for combat but it rewarded you in way where you knew exactly what you were getting. The blueprint method allowed you very open ended and free customization of not only your fleet but even the modules equipped on the ships that make up your fleet.  Now, if I want to acquire parts for a vessel I have to buy them, haul them around, clutter up my inventory and then likely sell them when something better comes along, or I just tire of the chore.-Customization: In the previous game, you could have various weapon loadouts and various fleet compositions that you could modify and adjust to adapt to situations. Even on the fly. This is no longer the case. Now, if you find your missile based combat preference is being countered by a single strike craft shooting down your missiles at an alarming rate (missile rate of fire is so slow jesus), you're only choice is to run. You cannot refit your ships mid battle anymore. Another issue that hampers your creativity is the way parts go together. Noses can only face forward, wings sideways, and engines downwards. This limits ship design heavily. And each of these parts has a weapon attached to them. Which you cannot change. This compounded with the above issues of being unable to make your own parts means half the time you’ll be unsatisfied with your current loadout. With no way to change it as quickly as you would like. You can’t really make a ship specialized without very high effort low reward methods. Needing to stockpile potentially good ship parts for later on feels off. Like this shouldn’t be happening both lore wise and gameplay wise either.In conclusion, this game has potential. But as of now there are just too many small annoyances with the game that will chip away at your will to put up with them until you find yourself loading saves and quitting more than actually enjoying the game. Hopefully the devs delay the release and make some changes. Because I can’t and won’t recommend this game until some things are improved or overhauled into fun mechanics, which were readily present in the original.Here's to hope.			"

Early Access Review
*EDIT: Since this game is still in Early Access some of its elements will change, and parts of this review will no longer be relevant. Only two days after this games release, much of what really frustrated me about this game has already been hotfixed. That which no longer applies to the current state of SPAZ 2 will remain, but be obfuscated. Strong Points: +The galactic map (where >=50% of game time is spent) is graphically simplistic, stylized, and clean. 	It’s basically Mount and Blade: Warband, but in space and graphically pleasing.+Hilarious dialogue and characters+Both combat perspectives (top down and 3rd person) work well with this game+In depth weapon configurationEither automate all of your weaponry, or categorize your weapons into subsets to truly minmax your offensive capabilities.+Ship customization/modularityWithout a doubt the strongest component of this game. Build a slender corvette with many side cannons, a flat-headed cruiser with an unnecessary amount of engines, or whatever awkward mess you feel like. Weak Points: -Leveling upgrades are dull. 	+20% HP, +15% armour, +25% recharge rate, etc. -Arranging parts in the ship builder is a task for the 7th circle of hell. Ship complexity correlates with how much hair you have left to pull out while trying to make components click where you want them to.-Engagements are very unpredictable. From my experience, when you attack a target you rarely proceed to 1v1 that opponent. You rather 1v3 against his allies, 2v2 with your ally versus him and his ally, or 3v1 him down with your allies. It loosely depends on proximity to allies, but often times allies have flown to my aid from off-screen or ignored my situation when they were right beside the battle. Selecting a wingman helps, but wingmen get distracted easily and still won’t 100% reliably follow you into battle.Stylistic Choices I Dislike: -Ships always look like block-components banded together with small struts. While this makes sense in the beginning, when you are literally gluing garbage together, it feels wrong to have an advanced mothership look so cheap and flimsy. -Enemy HP, Shield, and Armour bars offer very little information.They are the same between very weak and very strong forces. The bars could have ticks that demark certain values (as in League of Legends or DoTA). It would also make sense to colour code them so they aren’t all the same red mass to keep track of. Mitigated Issues: -Resource management was nightmare-inducing. Early game: you need a lot of scrap, and it is slow to acquire. Mid game: your star base takes care of any scrap needs, but because of your larger ship, excess goons will rapidly deplete your rez stores. You only ever want around your maximum capacity of goons, but you must constantly spend time working to avoid excess.Late game: when zombies pollute the entire galaxy, all it takes for your crew to be completely decimated is your shields to drop while fighting an infected enemy. You lose many goons to the slightest infection, and the only consistent method to restock them is pitifully slow.The easy solution: make goons and rez consistently purchasable at every station.   -Ship infections were too unforgiving. Goons die not only in the cleaning process, but also because of the infection’s very presence. If you don’t always carry at or above your max crew capacity, the crew won’t be strong enough to clean a serious infection away. You also won’t be able to save up a large enough force over time, since any amount you find will immediately be killed. In other words, it’s game over in the most excruciating way. EDIT1: Although you can remove infected parts from your ship to stop the infection from spreading, this tactic only works if your initial infection was minor enough to isolate. In my experience, many ship parts can become infected in one unfavourable incident. The problems are that you can only clean parts while they are attached to your ship, and cleaning parts demands a tremendous cost of crew. If an infection gets out of hand, it’s such a hassle to deal with that I would rather reload a save file than go through the tedium of putting a brand new, far weaker vessel together, scrounging around for enough goons to use as a blood sacrifice for my old infected rare parts, and eventually reconstructing my powerful ship from the ground up. The mechanic would be far less frustrating if:1) Fewer goons evaporate in the cleaning process.2) You are allowed to pay scrap at star bases to have parts cleaned at no crew expense.3) The infection takes longer to spread from part to part, and can only infect so much of your ship in a single battle. Conclusion: In case it wasn’t already obvious, this game is definitely not a sequel to SPAZ 1 in terms of gameplay. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as SPAZ 2 has a lot of interesting and unique gameplay of its own to offer. Initially I would recommend SPAZ 2 only to those who are head over heels about space battles and ship customization, but the devs have already mitigated what were the most frustrating aspects of the game. The game still has some problems and annoyances, but now it is by all means an enjoyable game with a hard-working and responsive dev team to boot. My thumb has been flipped.			"

Early Access Review
								SPAZ 2 is a good game, made by two guys with a lot of heart, and probably some undiagnosed disorders. Fly around the galaxy, turning your star jalopy into a functioning battleship and surviving in a collapsed economy suffering from the loss of magical zombie poop on which it relies. The controls are responisve and fluid, the art direction is wonderful, and for the most part everything is well optimized. I had to turn down the resolution a bit, but my laptop is teetering on the edge of mid-grade and doing this let me keep all the graphical options turned up.The actual gameplay is a bit hard to sum up without quoting the store page- Minmax summed it up pretty well and so far I don't believe they've lied about any aspect. zip around the galaxy at ludicrous speeds via the star map, ransacking people farms and harvesting Rez while trying to stay a step ahead of whoever you've angered lately. That is, until you get bigger guns of course. Once a battle occurs, the game shifts to direct control and hands you your mothership and whatever escort craft are currently licking your boots. It's similar to the ship combat in Assassin's Creed 4, but in space, and with far greater variety of options. It's a bit overwhelming at first, and you'll likely be tempted to turn on Battle Wagon mode and focus on maneuvers and damage control, but once you get the hang of it you'll be switching weapon groups on the fly while using your tractor beam to beat the enemy to death with their own wreckage.Remember how I said the devs are probably crazy? Yeah, SPAZ 2 is full of black comedy and whimsical stupidity. There's lore and fluff nuggets that grant oft-hilarious tidbits of info along with supplies and EXP; my personal favorite being the one comparing the warp drive mechanism to a donkey being led with a carrot. Dropping out of warp is, of course, de-donkeying. It may sound stupid, and it is, but it had me laughing the first time I heard it.Don't be discouraged by the Early Access label; so far I've had no bugs at all and the only thing there telling me this is early access is a little bit of missing polish and all the voice-acting being computer generated. SPAZ 2 deserves your love and hard drive space, and unlike most EA releases appears to be in very late beta.			"

Early Access Review
Seeing the overwhelming postive reviews of users with just over 1 hour of gameplay, I'd like to speak up with the same (85 minutes) amount of time in the game.The game is in EA but I couldn't find any major changes planned regarding the core gameplay. Which is also the reason why my recommendation is a no.With the game being released into Early Access I was overjoyed; had been waiting for this since the game was announced. SPAZ 1 was, at least from my point of view, one of the best games in its genre, it had everything I could ask for. RPG-elements, a nice story, good controls and so on. It reminded me of a super-upgraded Swarm (the video game from 1998, man how I loved it) with a better story and gameplay, buying SPAZ 2 was a no-brainer for me.Fire up the warp-drives, dust off the Space-Zombie eating cannons and put on that cologne for Elza--let's rock this joint!Oh boy...how that joy was shortlived.Tl;drPros:+ The story is well done, the dialogue is what makes SPAZ+ Galaxy-map is simple and intuitive+ Activity (pirates, factions etc.) in the galaxy is fun+ Learning curve seems lowCons:- Ship customization is lacking- Battles and controls need improvement- 3D hasn't been able to take SPAZ 2 over its predecessorWell that's that, read on if you'd like to hear more of my opinion.---In generalI was truly missing the game features which made SPAZ such a great game. For example, the whole concept of having a mothership somewhere which warped smaller ships to specific warp-beacons is gone...just gone. Instead you know directly control the mothership while the smaller ships have been demoted to buzzing-space flies which are flying around the mothership as a distraction for enemies.The way you navigate has been overhauled and changed to a semi-realtime system where you fly around on a galaxy-map. Engaging in events such as raids will switch back to the view where you control the mothership (or one of the smaller ships). Overall navigation is refreshing and fun, but beware that it might not appeal to you if you're expecting something like SPAZ 1.Combat and ship controls are really lacking, a 'decent' score at best. Ship controls are sloppy and need improvement, but aren't game-breaking. Combat on the other hand actually is, at least for me. Where in SPAZ 1 I had some sort of awareness of my weapon loadout, in SPAZ 2 I had no idea what I was pumping out of my ship. Sure I could see the weapon's stats, but the descriptions of the weapons aren't all that helpful. Battles now feature an option called 'Battle wagon mode' to let the AI fire turrets. The AI respects weapon groups, which is a neat feature. Personally I'd loved to see the battle system unchanged from SPAZ 1, but it isn't necessarily a bad battle system. Battles do feel a little...boring when compared to SPAZ 1 or other games in this genre.Dissapointed in the new way of customizing your ship. For me misses the mark by focussing on 'how' (physically attaching ship parts like 'lego') you do it rather then giving you a good feel of 'what' you're going to fly around with. Might be appealing to some, for me definitely a game-breaker.Overall SPAZ 2 feels like it has a broad focus of game elements, but none really appealing. A lot of reviewers say that this is an absolutely MUST-HAVE if you like and love SPAZ 1, but I beg to differ. To be really honest...I like SPAZ 1 way better and this feels like a serious step backwards. Feels like kicking the devs when they're on the ground (please, no hard feelings), but hiding the truth is worse.---First up, customizing your shipYour ship essentially consists of 'parts' attached to 'cores'. While this is nothing new, you have to physically attach the cores and parts together like building blocks using some sort of tractor beam. The concept is fun and original, but I couldn't find the added value next to just using a list to select where the parts (or coreS) should go. Some people may like it; I for one think it's fun the first few times, but quickly becomes a annoying chore. Moreover, the controls aren't intuitive and I was struggling to attach the nose of my ship. Might just be my inability to use the tractor beam, but the judge is still out on that one.Tried to love it, but failed sadly. Score: 'bad, could be better'From customizing to controllingControlling your ship is...meh. You'll get where you want to go, but ship handling could definitely be improved. Where 'forward' was the direction of your reticule in SPAZ 1, the same could be said in SPAZ 2. Most of the time I had no 'feeling' as of which direction to press regarding the position of the reticule. Flying is kind-of horizontal, which should be easy to adjust to. But somehow I couldn't grasp the controls that well.Don't really know how the controls could be improved, but I'm sure they can.Sloppy to decent controls. Might be inexperience, but then again...I'm an experienced gamer. Score: 'so-so'Entering the SPAZ-galaxyNavigating around in the galaxy now is a semi-realtime experience. No one moves, except when you do. You no longer travel from system to system but navigate in an ever connected galaxy as an entity. You're sharing this galaxy with a lot of other entities which come in the form of starbases, gathering-points, other ships and so on. Interacting with these enteties is well done and easy to get into.Threat assessment could be a bit better though. As a level 14 threat I had trouble with a level 9 threat, something I wouldn't expect. In SPAZ 1 I would've absolutely gone loco on such a level difference, but no way sir not in SPAZ 2.All together I think it's a good and refreshing way of navigating around, but I prefer the system to system navigation. Also threat levels could be misleading. Score: 'okay'Battles, now in 3D! But...While 3D is graphically superior to 2D most of the time, I find that 2D games aren't always inferior in the ways of gameplay. The same can be applied to battles in SPAZ 2 and battles in SPAZ 1. Even though the switch to 3D has been made, the battles are lacking.You can have multiple smaller ships under your command just like SPAZ 1, but next to the mothership, none of the ships can be customized. The smaller ships, now called 'Strikecraft', are just there to take the heat off the mothership, which they do pretty well. They also dish out some much needed punishment of their own.While going through battles I found myself playing with just the mothership, really had no reason to plas as one of the smaller ships. You might find a valid reason such as hunting a hostile which is faster then the mothership. But since you can also make Strikecraft attack a chosen target, the same reason becomes invalid however.Damaging other ships is easy to see when switching on the damage numbers in the options, but I was missing some sort of HUD when locking into other ships. Didn't notice the 'HP-bar' of other ships until my 6th battle or so.Gravely dissapointed in the battles. While some may like it, this was definitely the game-destroyer for me. Score: 'you've been warned, consider watching YouTube'Sadly, already exiting the SPAZ-galaxy as of nowThe game isn't particulary bad, but feels lacking when compared to its predecessor. The whole SPAZ feeling is absent, everything I loved from SPAZ 1 is literally nowhere to be found. This might have been what the devs want, but this also means that you should think twice if you're expecting a reboot of SPAZ 1.			"

Early Access Review
								MinMax took a bit of a risk with this game.  Instead of making a direct mechanical sequal to the fun and popular original SPAZ, they chose to reinvent the game pretty dramatically.  What resulted was someting new and different and not directly comparable to any other games, so it's a little hard to describe.  SPAZ2 has a clever ship construction mechanic that allows for equally clever ship destruction, as well as a sort of mount-and-blade-style overworld with factions and independent NPC actors and economy.  It works pretty well, even in its somewhat rough Early Access form, and I find the combat quite enjoyable.  They offer a bunch of ways to play the game - I personally quite like the arenas, where you battle with a premade ship, but I can see a lot of attraction in the building mechanics and the 'empire-building'. It is an early access game, so many of the usual qualifiers apply: there are bugs and questionable design decisions that are still being worked out.  Game-altering (although rarely game-breaking) patches drop pretty much weekly, with a fairly steady stream of more minor hotfixes.  On that note, I want to give a huge shout-out to Blorf and the rest of the MinMax team for being the most responsive and friendly Devs I have ever seen on a Steam forum.  They make a point to respond to nearly every thread, they often impelement well-reasoned player suggestions within a day or two of reading them, they take criticisms with a great deal of grace, and are basically everything you could want in an Early Access developer.

								If you liked SPAZ 1, but disliked the grind, go play SPAZ 2.If you prefer tactical play in the form of Sid Meier's Starships, with a good portion of hands-on fighting in between, go play SPAZ 2.If you like slaving away min-max'ing your ship until it becomes the most powerful build it can be (for now), go play SPAZ 2.That said, coming from SPAZ 1 originally, I really like the new look. The music is great. The gameplay is solid. The 2 man dev team is busy pumping out patch (hotfixes) after patch (features).The only (slightly) dark shadow is the beginning of the game.. the learning curve seems a bit steep as the game is now. But the devs have this topic on their roadmap already.If you like an Early Access game with actually active developing, go buy SPAZ 2 and enjoy the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. Oh, and there are zombies ;-)			"

Early Access Review
								While SPAZ 2 is quite a bit different from SPAZ it is absolutely an improvement. GraphicsIt would honestly be difficult not to make an improvement over SPAZ in this area. The game still has a unique visual style but with more 3d and more camera options. Backgrounds are very similar while weapons and ships are more detailed. Simply put I like the way the game looks. If your expecting something amazing or top of the line you need to see a doctor. A $20 indie game isn't the place to look. ControlsI have been using the default which is camera relative. I have had no issue using this control scheme but it can be counter-intuitive. There is an option for the more standard ship relative controls. Since you primarily control your mother ship and it can get to be very big it can be a bit sluggish. However, simply using the engine boost correctly takes care of most issues.GameplayI like the living universe idea but I do wish it was a bit more living. The game is designed so that while you are not moving on the galaxy map nothing else is moving. It is nice since I can get up whenever without it being a problem but I have also had to basically fly around in circles for no reason while waiting for conditions to be right. For example, you can select a fellow captain in your faction to be your wingman and he/she will fly to you and follow you so that you have help in more difficult battles. Since they don't move while you are not moving I have had to just fly around so that they will move to me. Battles are rather quick in this game but not as quick as in SPAZ. Originally you could boost your ship up so much relative to the enemies that it wasn't really a battle at all. The biggest problem in SPAZ was combat becoming meaningless since the enemy did not stand a chance. In SPAZ 2 it is a much more even playing field since you don't have the option of taking a specific weapon type and boosting it beyond the levels of sanity. In my experience so far it seems like ramming the enemy is the best way to win and it is very amusing to ram off parts of the enemy ship. There is also a fun feature in that you can use your tractor beam to throw stuff at the bad guys. There are always explosive barrels or astroids around that you can use. Speaking of the wingman ability. I found it frustrating that having one didn't mean that he would actually make it into the battle. When you start a battle enemies will come to help each other and your allies will come to help you. This is great except that there is a four captain limit. So if you try to pick on one guy and two of his friends are faster than your friends you get to have fun fighting 3v1. Menus/UIFor the most part I have no complaints. However, on the galaxy map it can be hard to click on the right thing when there are a bunch of ships piled on top of each other. While playing the campaign there are constant interruptions that always seem to happen right when I am trying to click something. Ship buildingI think it's and interesting feature but you are very limited in what you can do and be effective. Turrets can't shoot through your own ship so building a box and putting wings/engines/whatever inside is a terrible idea as they won't be able to shoot most of the time. It seems to me that the best options are either a nearly straight vertical line or a horizontal line. Though really having a ship that is all engines and noses may not be the best bet. The ship building thing can be difficult to work with. I had constant problems with parts attaching in the wrong places and sometimes not wanting to attach unless I turned off the tractor beam and grabbed it again. I also managed to get parts stuck under the ship many times so I would have to leave the ship builder and reopen it. I was just throwing things around to be fair. Overall there are some QOL changes that will probably be made while the game is in early access but overall it is a rather good game.			"

Early Access Review
								I have purposefully delayed writing a review for this game as I think any game in early access deserves a chance for the dev's to work on any issues. I've had SPAZ 2 in my library for quite some time. Upon launch I felt that the game was functionally good, thoroughly enjoyed my first playthrough of the Campaign. Everything worked, but something was missing. After a long hiautus I have returned to the game, wow, what a difference. The game has improved dramatically, gameplay wise its much more challenging,  the bandits are a force to be reckoned with, the zombies are highly dangerous, especially immediately after taking over their territory, frequent ship to ship battles, I have an exceeding high threat level 156 atm and still got my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me by the zombies . If you want a game that you can:Design your own Capital Ship to take into Battle against various factions, Bandits and Zombies.Amazing Ship to Ship combat with great visuals and having to apply/create/perform tactics during combat in order to survive.Strategic decison making on the map level in order to gain resources to constantly improve your lot.Trying to survive against over 200 individual AI captains all vying for dominance, creating allies and enemies based on your behaviour  with an overarching sense that soon things will all go to hell . Great narration and a quirky sense of humour throughout the game.Amazing Dev's that respond to the community and have implemented a number community ideas into the game.There were negatives to this game when it first came out, and that was expected, however, the dev's have worked extremely hard to address the issues of the community, and in my view have surpasssed expectations, and seeing as there are only a two main dev's it remarkable how frequent their updates have been.You do need to spend more that a couple of hours to appreciate the complexity of the game, it will not hold your hand like a few of the AAA title out there, you now which ones I'm talking about. I have seen negative reviws abound by others who have less than 2 hours game time. There is no way anyone can make a well informed judgement after only two hours worth of gameplay, Give the game 20 hours and you'll see it is a highly enjoyable game.There are also many ways to fulfil an objectives, such as gaining levels, gaining resources and many ship design configurations that you can experiment with. Over time this game has become one of my favorite ever games to-date, even surpassing SPAZ 1 and I highly recommend it.Good job dev's.			"

Early Access Review
								A captain that was friendly with me had been chased down by a bandit chief, I joined the fight and another bandit swooped in. I managed to ram the bandit to death but I couldn't stop the Chief from taking out the friendly captain, leaving me to fight against horrible odds. My main benefit is Engines, I swept around the Chief just out of range of his main weapons to take out all his strike craft, losing half my health in the process without even touching the Chief. I knew I was dead.Then I saw some teal space debris in the distance and I remembered when you destroy them, they create a shield damaging cloud. It was my only remaining hope. I positioned them between us, boosted my shields to max while the Chief, a behamoth of lasers and cannons, drew in. I blasted the space debris and the teal clouds surrounded him.In seconds his shields dropped, mine were barely there at all but if you ram with shields up you negate the damage while your enemy suffers the consequences. I boosted my engines and rammed that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ into an asteroid and kept ramming while we blew chunks off each-other. I ran out of energy, seconds away from being space debris myself, unable to fire, the Chief still overpowering me. The only thing I could do was tractor beam while recharging. I beamed the chunks of asteroid around us, smashed them into his Mothership Core over and over, expecting to die any second.One of the asteroid chunks released a gas explosion on his core, destroying his ship, which in turn started to release explosions itself. I boosted my engines and barely outran the death boom of the Chief, winning the fight with nothing to spare, shaking in my chair.The sheer options available to any fight alone make this game worth more than they sell it for, add in the massive world around you with hundreds of other captains able to do every single thing you do and the possibilities are endless, the fun is (in my opinion) endless. I know I will be addicted for the long run, and the game isn't even finished yet. Bravo.  "

Early Access Review
								Majority of current steam reviews in a nutshell:Positive: People who enjoyed the game on its own and/or hope for its bright future.Negative: People who expected SPAZ 2 to be SPAZ 1 with 3D graphics.----First off,I feel bad for the (two) hard working developers that are seeing such effort being blasted by dubious reviews, but this is capitalism flooded by a bunch of naive people. It is clear that the game is not perfect (YET) but is IS NOT supposed to be  SPAZ 1. Also, besides being on early access, just as SPAZ 1, SPAZ 2 will be heavily driven by the community.So I make a public appeal: If you happened to not check out the developer's demo video of the game that came up before the EA launch and was caught off guard when you realized the game was very different from SPAZ 1, then please, ask for a refund and/or remove your thumbs down.This is very important to them because, although they are only two, as I said, the game was always community-driven and the first one had even great mods in which the developers had given a lot of support to the modders. That's why I see a good future for this game.The rating should be a balance between the development team, the effort and the game. In the end, all that we paid for was a game that could give us enough hours of fun to pay its price. If you paid for for a Modern SPAZ 1 then it is completely your fault. So, please, don't hurt the development team just because you wanted another game. SPAZ 1 is still out there and very moddable.----I really liked the game and I'm still willing to put way more hours into it. What makes me going forward is the ship customization and the will to improve yourself (gunpower, shape, variety, factions etc) which every grind-like game provides. It may not provide this grinding method in the best possible way yet but there is a long road ahead for the developers and the supportive community.Regarding the future multiplayer, I still hope that it will turn out to have a differently balanced COOP as well instead of just PVP duels.Regarding the camera and controls: If you want the camera and controls from SPAZ 1 you can actually almost have it by disabling ""relative controls"" in the gameplay options and using the top-down camera (""C"" key by default). The difference is that you can't strafe with your ship (maybe not yet). The other SPAZ-1-FREE reviews explained a lot about the detailed features, pros and cons which I mostly agree with all of them so I won't repeat myself as I don't have much time right now, I really just wanted to point out that appeal.

Early Access Review
								I understand that this is an Early Access title.  However, the dev has stated that this game is essentially finished except for bug fixes, which is why it is in Early Access.  To combat the mass flood of individuals who reviewed this game positively in the short period that they've played it, I will give an accurate assessment of the negatives that I experienced in the short amount of time that I've played it.First, Bad ship controls:  The ship controls in SPAZ were very good.  You could easily assess where your ship was going to go based on the buttons you pushed.  Of course, heavier ships would take longer to speed up and slow down and turn due to the inertia caused by their mass.  However, they still moved based on the player's key strokes.  In SPAZ2... nowhere near as responsive.  In fact, I found the Movement in 3rd person mode more responsive than top-down mode (same mode as in SPAZ).  However, even in 3rd person mode, the ship was nowhere near as responsive as even the largest ships in SPAZ.  This ruined the game for me.EDIT:  Based on the devs, this issue is due to relative controls being on by default.  From what I read, the ""non relative"" control scheme is more fluid like SPAZ's control scheme.  I cannot confirm nor deny if it is more fluid like SPAZ's control scheme as I did not get a chance to try out that control scheme as I didn't know it even existed before I got my refund.  If only they had put this option choice at the start of the game (like the voice option), or put it in the tutorial, or just turned ""relative"" controls off by default then my first issue might not have been an issue.  However, they did not, and that's why it is still an issue.  If it is true, and they can fix issues 2 & 3 before exiting Early Access, then I might buy SPAZ2 again.Second, Threat assessment is borked compared to the player:  Basically, if I'm facing a target that has Threat 4 and I am Threat 6, then I should be able to beat that target fairly easily.  Nope, not even close.  In SPAZ that usually wasn't a major issue as you could estimate chance of success based on threat level of an area vs the player's level.  But, I found that not to be the case with SPAZ2.  However, my two encounters may have been because of the terrible ship responsiveness I listed in my first issue.Third, Bad controls when building the mothership:  Just as the title says, the controls when building the mothership are just, plain terrible.  Unresponsive, doesn't stick half the time, and you can't even tell which slot it stuck to half the time on larger ships with multiple cores.  That system seriously needs to be tweaked.Fourth, This is not in the same genre as SPAZ:  I understand that this was a design decision by the devs, and many people like the change.  I do not however and other potential buyers may not as well.               SPAZ was an arcade space shooter.  It had tech trees that you placed research points into that you gained per level.  It allowed differentiation and builds per playthrough.  There was numbers and icons in combat that showed how close your or your oponent's ship was to blowing up.             SPAZ2 is an X-2 Lite space simulator with shooty combat thrown in.  The main focus of this game is not on the combat but on living in a simulation of sectors of space.  It has a generic tech tree of +%'s in dmg, shields, armor, hull, etc...  There is no real differentiation between weapon types in this game at all.  And, the only indication of a ship's health is shield and health bars.Again, if the first three issues were actually fixed at the time of this game's launch (again, ""early access"" is essentially so they can fix bugs) then I could've overlooked issue four.  However, people need to know the truth.			"

Early Access Review
								I don't understand why some people are so obsessed with SPAZ 1. Yes, it was a nice little game with a lot of good things, but it had serious issues - customization was good to the point you unlock a biggest ship and pack all it's slots with weapons, technologies was more like ""choose how are you going to play for the rest of the game and if you change your mind you will suffer"", and endless ""jump to system, kil people, bribe/kill guards, rinse and repeat"" was becoming too repetitve even on smallest maps (when i tried to play big map once, i was bored to death instantly). And now comes SPAZ 2, which shares much with the first game, but is basicaly a piece of old SPAZ 1 gameplay, mixed with some sort of 4X strategy and  RPG. Obviously, SPAZ2 has a lot more things to offer, and new things are constantly added. And yet some people are discontent that SPAZ2 is NOT SPAZ1 with a better graphics. I completely don't get it.So, about the game itself. The game is... refreshing. It manages to ideally fit all its elements to create very satisfying experience. For example, the main thing - it's space battles. They are not 2D (which is not only too simplistic, but there is a ton of 2D space combat games, which are boring me to death at this point). Yet they are not completely 3D (your ship can move only on 2D plane, but your fighters can go up and down), so combat doesn't consist of endless rollings around, trying to catch your target in crosshair, like in other games (this, for example, infuriates me in X3 Terran Conflict and bores to death in pure space simulators to the pint where i just can't play them). If you can fire manually but if you don't want, you cen set on Battle Wagon mode and concentrate on maneuvering. You can field fighters and target them. And you can filed strike craft which can then field more fighters. Or you can forget about fighter and go ram enemy - which is pure eye candy when you manage to rip off half of it's weapons in a single blow (just watch the shield - either your or his should be down, or you just bounce off). And so is with everything. Starmap may look simplistic, but there are constantly random events appearing, someone is fightng and world really lives (like in X3, except those who live there are really people with their own personality, who remember everything about you). Part selection may look too random, but really there is a possibility to get the parts you need most of ther time, and if you find really good part with e really good weapon, it's a thing that realy makes you feel good. Zombies now really a threat, which will overwhelm you if you try to stay out of trouble too much time. And all this still gets updates, fixes and additional content, like planned in the nearest future multiplayer.So, for me this a best game i played for the long, long time and i will definitely recomend it to everyone else.

								SPAZ 2 is an excellent game that I highly recommend.  The action oriented gameplay will keep the casual gamer entertained while the strategy, resource management, ship design, variety of weapons/components, factions, and options allows players to go as deep as they wish.For a game in early access with a two person development team, SPAZ 2 comes off as highly polished and immensely playable (Triple A gaming companies should take notes).  In the 50+ hours I have played so far, I have experienced no bugs, crashes, framerate chugging, visual artifacts, or any other evidence of cut corners or rushing.  The user interface is clean and intuitive.  The controls feel tight and responsive.  Ship combat is extremely satisfying (immersive battles with multiple enemies and allies, battle damage, beautiful explosions / debris, vibrant graphics, unique and memorable art and scenery, unique weapons allowing a variety of approaches to combat).  The sandbox mode allows you to customize your experience from the vanilla story mode as well.The development team is very responsive to the community and attentive to any reasonable criticisms.  At this point, updates are mostly adding final touches to the game as well as community requested additional content and features - not desperate hot fixes to address game breaking bugs.I found the tutorials and story mode satisfying as well.  However, I believe the promised addition of voice acting will significantly enhance the story.Criticisms:- Some weapon symbols in the inventory menus are difficult to distinguish from one another.- The number of ships allowed per battle encounter seems low.- For those looking to maximize their ship's threat, the ship design is limited.- After the zombie threat is dealt with, no other equal or greater challenges / events appear (I usually start a new playthrough shortly after).- Max level starbases are incredibly strong when attacked directly by the player, but are laughably easy to destroy when attacked by the A.I.I really had to strain to come up with these criticisms.  They are the smallest nitpicks and trifles surrounding a solid and gloroius core.  Considering the price, current content, and developer dedication, you can't go wrong.  Just buy it already.			"

								A bit disappointed in the direction the game took from the first one.  I've put a few hours into Spaz 2 since release and it just doesn't hold my attention like the original did (100+ hours) so I've had to quit playing for now.  I think this is primarily due to spending the majority of your game time on the star map (boring) rather than zooming around in your ship the majority of the time like in Spaz 1.  Many of the elements that made Spaz 1 exciting and fun to play (to me) are absent in the sequel.Flying around in your ship and blowing stuff up (even the grindy aspects like harvesting asteroids) was still fun to do.  You were in your ship flying around 90% of the time and had relatively minimal interaction with the other GUIs like the star map.  This allows the player to bond with their ship(s) and made it much more enjoyable to see your tiny ship and fleet grow over the course of the game.  Spaz 2 is the opposite, where you spend maybe 20-30% of your time flying around shooting stuf in a clunky environment, and the other 70% interacting with an interface.      I've always felt that game sequels should be 1/3 old, 1/3 improved, and 1/3 new.  Spaz 2 skews that formula and presents an entirely different game vastly different from its predecessor.  The simulation on the star map is now the main feature, and zooming around in your ship(s) feels like a tacked on accessory.  To that end, I feel the game may appeal to those who like simulation games over those who prefered the more action oriented original.  Despite the impressively hard work that's been put into the game, I can't recommend the title since I don't find it a fun game anymore due to the above reasons.  Here's to hoping there's a major overhaul by the time the game exits early access.     "

								DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS GAME!!!(Edit: Just realised something. This is essentially BORDERLANDS. IN. SPACE!)I just played for 7 hours straight, and that says a lot for me. Let me tell you why.As much as I love video games, I hate them more than anything. Why?Because they are so f*cking boring nowadays. It's the same thing over, and over, and over.I've played a lot of the popular space games here on Steam, even FTL. I hate them all.Sure, they're pretty and they have a lof of features and charm, but I hate them.I don't know what it is that makes me hate most games, but I do.This game. This game is an exception.Yeah, you are limited to, in my opinion, a pretty small play area. The map isn't big at all.But, this is perfect, because the entire map is a running simulation of all the AI doing their own thing.They place bounties on you if you♥♥♥♥♥♥them/their faction off, kill them, etc.Getting to join a faction just makes it even more fun. You eventually start feeling a sense of pridein your faction, protecting it every chance you get. Any why wouldn't you, you get an insane amountof experience for helping people out when they are getting attacked(not just those in your faction).There is a ton of different weapons for the size of the game. So what I mean is, there is a dozen weapon types that can have a dozen different firing modes and they are all gradiated from 1 star to 4-5 star.The drone system is just... ugh, the drone system. Perfection.I can't go over everything. I just spent a straight 7 hours in the game, so it is still all fresh on my brain.I don't want to make this any more of a TL;DR than it already is, so just trust me. BUY. THIS. GAME.			"

								It's not SPAZ 1, not quite. So if you came in wanting more SPAZ 1 with better graphics, you'll have to look elsewhere. Also Multiplayer is right out, the developers never made any absolute promises in that regard, despite the whiners and man-children screeching about ""betrayal"" in other knee-jerk reaction reviews.The game is rendered in 3D but all action takes place on a 2D plane, similar to terrestrial naval combat. The overall game feels like a mix between a high-octane, much better designed version of the combat from Sid Meiers Pirates with the strategical element is reminicient of Mount and Blade: Warband. The game feels nearly complete and is surprisingly bug-free as of the current iteration despite its early access tag. I would definitely recommend this title to anyone who likes a mix of arcadey naval combat and strategy lite.			"

Hell, even shopping for parts is fun as you can go around and do whatever you want to do, and they arrive safely by courier from whatever port they were purchased from.The fighing is definitely more intense for me, as well as all those other npc captains out there doing the same thing as me, sometimes with me, sometimes against me.All in all, I look forward to seeing how the game develops, but in my mind I've already got my money's worth.Whatever develops next is just gravy :P			"

								SPAZ 2 is definatly worth the price. I am a huge SPAZ 1 fan and coming into this i was pretty excited. It is its own game and I wouldnt compare it TOO much too SPAZ 1 although it shares a lot of the atmosphere that I loved about SPAZ 1. This game seems to be more focused on ships and mothership battles. The games graphics are pretty good and I like the animations ect. The game is very ambitious and I think they do well overall. New comers and old fans ought to both be satisfied. I played and beat the storyline on whatever the defualt difficulty is and experimented with ship building for a total of about 35-40 hours gameplay. The game does not really feel like its lacking anything major to be able to come out of early release, although there are a few minor complaints, and most of those are already admitted to being addressed by the Devs! These guys are great! Through my playtime the game crashed once and I am not really sure if you can blame the game or my rig or Windows, I wasnt devestated by it, the game autosaves often. I did however notice something that may be worth pointing out. I play on a 34"" Acer curved screen @ 3440x1440. In massive battles with tons of strike crafts and carrier attachments and 3+ huge motherships my FPS would dip down to 35 - 40 sometimes. 95% of the time I stayed at my max setpoint of 75FPS though. With all the tons of pieces and attachments and different types of weapons it can take about 10 hours to get the hang of building a well balanced mothership if you dont look at any guides or read any walkthroughs(I didnt), these may help some people out more than others.Basic specs for comparison.Xeon 1270V3 CPU Radeon R9 ASUS STRIX Fury (OC)32 GB Ram950 PSUAcer 34"" 3440x1440			"

Early Access Review
								03/28/2017 : new update : the devs have kept working on it. New large map, choice of up to 21 cores now, alot more options & even an insane dificulty choice. The devs still need / want feedback to fix anymore bugs & to further tweak everything in game up till now. So, this is one of the few early access games that are trying to do it right.------------------------------- old review below --ok. its been a long while since i played.but i did play for a lil over 100 hrs.even tried to write a guide to help players.i fell in LOVE with ramming, even made a ""special"" Ramming Shipit is NOT like Spaz 1.Its fun, a little to easy, or insanely impossible ; we get the choice.Theres ALOT of vids, etc, check them out. You will see for yourself if you would like playing.They worked hard to fix problems, and listen to players suggestions.i do intend to play again. got distracted by a couple of other ea games that i like.especially to test out the changes they've made to ramming. I wonder how she will hold up in a very hard engaement.i do miss the EPIC scope of Spaz 1 though, alot. Spaz 2's map feels so miniscule *small* in comparison. :(still. I recomend this game.I'm looking forward to its full release.			"

								The basics: Should you get this game? If you saw the screenshots/videos, read the description of the game and the features, and started reading this review, the answer is YES!Is this basically SPAZ 1 with better graphics? No, but close. Many of the mechanics we liked so much from the first have changed, mostly due to the fact that in SPAZ 2 you are now flying the giant mothership, which was the ""base"" you returned to with the ship you were flying in SPAZ 1... you can launch your own smaller ships during combat. So it's different enough in the gameplay mechanics to not be SPAZ 1.5, while maintaining the stellar writing and humor from the first game. My recommendation to players who wonder if they need to get SPAZ 1 or 2 if they have not played either? Start with SPAZ 1, enjoy it for what it is, then come back to SPAZ 2 so that it's easier to follow the story, and enjoy it as its own game that makes references to the first game.I got this game in Early Access shortly after it being available on Steam. The game has changed a lot since then, with every list of patch notes improving on the few negatives that may have existed, and the game seems to be slowly but steadily evolving from there. I still put-in an easy 23 hours into my first play-through of the early product just going through the story mode campaign. I found the game to be very addictive and fun even at that point... I just wished it was longer/more challenging by the end, but then again, I suppose that's what the Sandbox mode is for. I decided to put it down before trying the Sandbox mode simply because I wanted to see more features added to get a fresher experience at that time. I WILL be returning to this game for many more hours in the future.Pros:- Great graphics on high-end machines- Story is funny and full of twists, just like in SPAZ 1- Ship-building is simple and intuitive enough to not cause anxiety attacks like many modern building/design games with their high learning-curves- Real sense of progression as you gain levels, your ships becomes larger, and you get more powerful/larger weapons- Sandbox mode allows you to tweak many game parameters to make the game more to your liking- Game still under development and constantly improving to this day- Easy to pick-up and stop at any time for people with real lives...Cons:- ... putting down the game when you get started requires willpower of STEEL :'(- The map/galaxy you are in is a bit on the small-side, so even in a custom Sandbox game the length of your game is going to be limited to 10-20 hours, depending on your play-styleOther thoughts:- Due to the nature of the game focusing on combat, there is not really an ""exploration"" aspect to this game that is a core to many other games in this genre... oh, well. The developers took the route of more explody-FUN over having a tacked-on boring mechanic for the sake of having it. The ""fog of war"" that covers sectors you have not been to is their interpretation of the mechanic.- The player ship flies on a 2D plain, much like a boat on a calm lake, while the game and certain aspects (like Fighters) fly in full 3D (up to a maximum distance away from the central plain). Some people love it, some people hate it. It was done this way to allow for simpler controls and a lower learning-curve, while making naval-style broadside combat viable. It worked for another one of my favorite space games of all time, and in my opinion it works here.Ideas for improvement:- Optional larger map and a higher level cap for those that simply HAVE to have that 7-Star part ship to squeeze every ounce of goodness from this game. :D- Being able to build larger ships if the engine could be made to handle it... this has been addressed many times and even experimented with, and there is a definite limitation here, so I would not hold my breath here.If I had to rate this on a scale, I would say 9.5/10... 23 hours went-by awfully fast in this game. I could see this being a 10/10 if it could just be BIGGER and more epic in scale (as an option), but it's a really great time at its current state. Another classic from the developers of SPAZ 1.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is a great game at this price point.  If it were $40 I wouldn't recommend it, but it's definitely worth $20.  It's not a AAA title.  It's not a 2d version of the X series.  It's not SPAZ 1.  It's its own thing, and that's not bad, but it does take some getting used to if you come in expecting something familiar.  Beyond a weird sense of humor and a similar setting, the games have little in common.Pros:- Easy to pick up and play.  This is almost a con, because parts of the game almost play themselves (the tutorial makes an odd joke about this regarding the combat).  Still, I like not having to worry about complex stats or ship builds.  I can build a specialized rig if I want to, or I can just slap on the best parts I happen to have around.  I'm also terrible at aiming shooters and could never use the cannons in SPAZ 1, so I'm glad those are more automated.- The AI captains are well implemented.  The system could be deeper, but it's as deep as it needs to be for what it is.  The player still feels like a special case that has different rules, but it's not too bad.- The graphics look like a case of glow-sticks broke open and spilled all over space.  In this case, it works.  It's very easy to tell which ships are hostile and which are friendly.  Too often in space shooters it becomes difficult to tell what's going on when things get clumped up.  Not so here.- The AI does a pretty good job of navigating around in combat.  Ships with long-range weapons will keep their distance.  Ships with short-range weapons will do hit-and-run attacks.  AI captains that are outnumbered will try to escape.Cons: This list is longer, but it's mostly more specific, fiddly stuff that I expect (or at least hope) will get fixed before release.- It's kinda crashy right now.  It's EA, so that's to be expected.  Hopefully that gets better on release.- I wish I had more ability to interact with the AI captains beyond shooting them.  For instance, I can't harvest from AI resource nodes without losing reputation, but they will fly up and harvest from mine and my only choice is to attack them, also causing reputation loss.  It would be nice if the reputation loss were at least context-sensitive so that if they wrong me first they don't get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at me for doing something about it.- Some of the elements on the map and on the status screens are unexplained.  I have no idea what any of that stuff on the station information screen means.  I can get lots of data about AI captains, but it's not presented in a way that is useful at all - just long lists of events that read more like debug logs than a UI elements.- There isn't a wide variety of parts, or at least it doesn't seem to matter what the differences are.  Sometimes the differences are just confusing.  What's the difference between a laser on the top of the wing and a laser of the side of the wing?  They are called different things and have different icons, but is the only difference the location?- The beginning of the game is rough.  I got real tired of trying to grind out enough scrap to buy parts on bandits while the entire rest of the universe seemed to have no problem instantly jumping to 30+ threat while I was stuck at 15.

								Was a huge fan of SPAZ 1, they took a different direction with 2 though - there is less focus on contructing your own fleet and top-down arcade spaceship battles, and more focus on trying to fly a big awkward battleship around while you autotarget anything in a ten foot radius. It's probably fun if you're looking for a third-person-view spaceship battle game, but if you were hoping for the chance to construct your own custom fleets and specialize your tech in any direction other than ""level up for +15% weapon damage, OR +20% shields!"", then you should give this one a pass.

Early Access Review
								The one thing that everyone will tell you is that SPAZ 2 is not SPAZ.  It's not meant to be; the very first sentence in the 'Why Early Access?' is that it's not a direct sequel, and that it's a brand new gameplay mechanic for them.  In SPAZ 2, gone are the modest armadas of mid-to-large vessels, bristling with every type of weaponry imaginable.  You command the mothership itself, with only a smattering of easily destroyed strike craft with a limit placed on how many can be made 'reserve' to spawn in a destroyed strike craft's place.  As you advance in levels, YOUR ship becomes longer (or wider) through the use of cores, each of which can host attachments on the edges exposed.  Engines in the back, noses on the front, and wings to either side.  Each component TYPE adds to the stats of the vessel: More engines in the back means you can accelerate forward at a greater pace, more wings to the side make turning easier, more noses give you a boost to shields.  Not just the TYPE, but the SIZE: As in SPAZ, each component takes up a set amount of surfaces on the core.  You can very easily make a hamburger-shaped vessel that hauls♥♥♥♥♥ has great shields, but turns like a boat.   Each individual component ALSO has a weapon: This wing may have a cannon on it, this larger wing has two cannons and can turn faster, this largest wing has six cannons and can turn on a dime.  There are no real 'rules' on how the weapons are attached to the equipment, either, save for size; I've had large engines, wings and nose cones each house attack bombers and laser fighters.  Each faction has its own M.O. on how it wants to make other ships dead, and prevent their own ships from the same fate, and each piece of equipment has its own intrinsic boosts to certain stats based on a combination of that M.O. and the individual item's rarity.  So now you've got size, rarity, weapon type, and stats to focus on, and it starts to make SPAZ 2 feel more like an MMORPG than SPAZ could ever feel.This added complexity comes with it a sacrifice on the subject of 'perks'.  In SPAZ 1, you could easily say from the start 'I'm gonna go lasers.  I'm gonna laser in the morning, and I'm gonna laser when I come home at night.'  And with that, as you advanced in levels, you could advance the damage of the lasers in your armada.  Now, in SPAZ 2, it's oversimplified- 'damage' bonus, 'scavenging' bonus, 'capacitor' bonus, 'trade' bonus, among the bonuses, one bonus for each level.  On top of that, the scavenging bonuses don't seem to reflect in any meaningful way in the game, the 'trade' bonus becomes as useless as you'd expect once you begin to rake in the dough, leaving the core 'damage', 'shield', 'capacitor' bonuses to be the only real, viable options.  And as you level up, these perks appear randomly in sets of three, so you may be FORCED into picking an inferior option.All-in-all, as of this posting, I've put in 24 hours, and it's worth the 20 bucks I spent on it.

								Well. I was skipping half of my life lately because of this game, i didn`t say i regret it but the game truly feels different from SPAZ 1. So you will get everything just from this pros and cons:+New galactic system and moving via it is more interesting and developers put more details in it;+You can build your ship from a scratch and design everything yourself;+Plot. I dont finish the game yet, but it will blow away spaz 1 fans for sure! just love it+Atmosphere. The great SPAZ atmosphere is still here and it is even better. Although allmost all the dialogs are syntecized with computer voice(just because of the Early Access).+Game is pretty polished for the EA. For all my playthrough game crashed one time because of driver failures(And it`s got fixed on the next day after) . And it is with full campaign which is wow for EA.+Galaxy is reacting on your every move and you reacting to it too. You saw how some freebooter steals your scrap or rez field - blow the little shait to pieces!+Price. As allways devs dont have any delussions about the price and its very fare! -Combat system. I enjoyed spaz 1 dynamic combat system much more that spaz 2. All this thing with design and new weapons and how they work and damage is only now starting to reveal its secrets to me(only when i got to the late game,although it is allready very painfull and costly to change all the ship =( )-Look of the ""support ships"" and your ship in generally. So all th ships that you knew is just support ships for your mothership, and i totally disagree with what they do to them...in spaz 1 when you getting your first TUG it looks tremendious. And what about when you see Hook or battleship class ship for the first time! Here? Well it looks like a tetris box titles. Dissapointed.-And from the previous one you get this - the look of your mothership and its controlls. Mothership dont look ""cool"" or ""beatifull"" in any way. i guess thats what you can get from post-apocalyptic world where everything is made from scrap, but still... and i understand that this is no common class ship - its MOTHERSHIP, but the controlls of it is something confusing...-Battles are no more that big, there is only 4 ""players"" that can be in battle which is 4 motherships + all the support ships. Yes sometimes its more then enough, but sometimes that feels castrated.+\- Grinding. Oh yes its still here, though it is a little easier to grind but harder to get good details when you go to the higher tier.+\- They removed and added a lot of things. Removed assault shuttles which is sad, but added a lot of things like badass flying shurikens,which is mauling and ripping enemy ship apart!So thats it. Maybe i add something that comes to mind later, but for now its like this...There is still a lot to do, like add some game start options and else and yes the game feels different from the first one, but i still want to support the devs because i just like their work. They do a lot of innovations to spaz and not everyone going to like it of course. I hope and know it will get better as time goes!Buy the game, try for yourself. its still pretty good for common indi that you can get for 10$. Totally worth the time.			"

You start out in a garbage can and work your way up to ruling the entire galaxy. The worst part about this game is that I never want to quit. It ruins my sleep schedule and I forget to eat, bathe, and go outside.			"

Early Access Review
								I have nearly 7.5 hours into SPAZ 2 now, and the initial excitement of being back into the SPAZ universe has worn off...no, it has sadly died off almost entirely.  Luckily, I can still install and play SPAZ and enjoy something truly unique, challenging, and fun.  So, here comes my breakdown:GraphicsI have no problem with the graphics.  They aren't stellar, but I look for gameplay much more than graphics.  The ships are pretty bland, particle effects and models are reused (or at least very similarly duplicated) throughout the game, and the map is pretty basic.ControlsOnce you get it out of the default ""Relative Control"" setting, the controls are fine.  Why they chose to set the default to something so awful is beyond me, but it is in Early Access.  Hopefully they'll get that fixed.  MechanicsThere are 2 categories here:  Sector Simulaiton and Flight/Combat Simulation.  Sector simulation is fine, and actually the most interesting component of the game.  Having allies, enemies, neutrals, bandits and zombies contribute to the dynamic of the Sector Map is great.  Trade and resource gathering seems alive on the surface, but there really isn't anything to it other than the graphical representation of ships going back and forth.  There are no real commodities other than Goons and Rez, and those are essentials to flying your ship and act more like a staple.  The Flight/Combat Simulation portion of the game is awful.  The worst parts of Star Control are poorly meshed with Independence War.  There are a hodge podge of preset weapon groups (which are changeable through the options menu), but the game flatout tells you that the Battle Wagon (automated targetting and shooting by the AI) mode is the preferred and most efficient method.  With no good range indicators for each weapon, it is best to leave the computer to handling the weapons system.  Combat turns into endlessly flying around into position and watching things explode, broken up time-to-time with the need to ""boost"" your shields to mitigate damage.  Other than the shield boosting, the interactivity of the Combat Simulation is barely more intriguing than a Cow Clicker.Content and ReplayabilityThe Sector Map is relatively small compared to the prior entry from MinMax Games.  Aside from laying out your ship differently, the options for weapons and components are severely limited and many of them feel utterly unnecessary.  That is perhaps just a balancing issue and can be resolved before the game is fully released.StabilityI've had no issues whatsoever with stability.Continuity from PredecessorNearly non-existent.  Beyond the lore and theme, the game is a completely different game.  They are cashing in on the name, which is fine.  If only the game was fun beyond nostalgia.ConclusionReinstall SPAZ and enjoy a great and unique space sim experience, and then lament over what could have been.The devs have posted a few positive comments about making some changes and adding content.  Based on how wonderful they were with SPAZ, I believe them.  I think that my review of this game will change a good bit once it leaves EA, and I am hoping that will be in the positive direction.			"

								The combat is so fun and fluid i personally love ramming enemy motherships trying to warp away to knock them away from the warp gate. Also the writing is top notch if you enjoyed the first SPAZ then the writing will not dissapoint. The little empire management/factions system is great and works well its very similar to Mount and Blade if you have played that. SPAZ 2 is a nice little gem which im sure will be refined over the next couple of months.			"

								Thumbs down, for now...I really liked Spaz 1 and was excited for Spaz 2, but the game is just too different from the Original. Too much focus on the strategic map. I want to have epic space battles, not hop from one ressource node to the next on a boring starmap.What i really dislike is the new ship design. In spaz 1 you had premade ship hulls and added weapons and gadgets to them. The ships looked cool and interesting. In spaz 2 you randomly duct tape garbage and scrap together and call it a space ship. Since all the parts have their own health and armor the enemy can just shoot them off your ship and after the battle you have to reassemble your ship again (waste of time and not fun to do). I would rather have premade ship hulls again with one global healthbar. Preferably nice looking ships not pieces of scrap metal.The shipbuilding interface and tradescreen are too complicated and it's hard to see what the parts actually do since there are like 10 different stats on them.Not everything is bad of course. The graphics are nice and i also like the new ""broadside"" mode.I don't think the problems i have with the game will be gone with the release version, but we will see how the early access will change the game.TL:DR -Too different from Spaz 1. Not a bad game but i wanted Spaz 1.5			"

								SPAZ 2 is a phenomenal game.  It's not SPAZ 1, if you want SPAZ 1, go play SPAZ 1.  If you look at SPAZ 2 with open eyes, it's a different game, with different mechanics.  If you want to move house, get a big van, if you want to drive fast on a race track, get a sports car.  If you just want SPAZ 1.5, just get SPAZ 1 with some mods.SPAZ 2 is still in early release, but the dev's are working solidly to fix bugs, they've released 4 hot fixes in the last 24 hours I think.  I'm half expecting their families to go on strike, they'll not have seen them in months!The game: You're in charge of a space ship, and some nasty zombies (the Z part of SPAZ), want to spoil your day.  You build up your space ship, getting parts off enemies you've killed, or buying from space stations.  As you level up, you get 'perks', +weapon damage, +shield, +capacitor capacity, etc.  The levels are inifinite, you can grind as much as you want, you can go in for the quick kill, there is no right, and there is no wrong, there is just your way.Anyway, buy the game, it's brilliant, it'll bring about world peace, it'll put food in the mouth's of the dev's families, it'll probably bring about the election of the government of your choice, if you'd just believe enough. ;)Buy the game!

								While this is not a bad game it is a disappointment when compared to its predecessor. The game feels less vibrant and more shallow, the realtime map is ok but adds little to the feel of the game, the modular ship design is good and the graphics are obviously better.The first game felt more varied, the faction/zombie elements more interesting, I liked the varied ship designs and the perk system better (you wont specialise energy weapons/projectiles/drones/etc in this game) and the game drew you in more.I the original my ships felt like a small fleet I could upgrade and setup my own way, the new system feels like you have just the one ship with a few optional types of drone buzzing around you.Maybe when this leaves early access it will have progressed a lot and I can change my review but for now I would not recommend this over the original game (and the original is cheap these days).Its all a shame really as I looked forward to this game for so long, maybe my expectations were too high?

								I played Spaz 1 a lot and completed every acheivement the DAY before Spaz 2 came out...I was shocked at the differences between the games... but after playing it for an hour, i came to the conclusion that I would not change them back for anything!This game has an astonishing ammount of depth! You don't just 'jump in space go-cart and shoot everyone' because their faction willl dislike you. They may come back for revenge. you may end up with a bounty on your head. you might get yourself blown up and have to start again rebuilding your ship!Seriously! Who else has that? You die, you have to rebuild from where you are!This game astonished me... I really didn't think I'd like it after watching the EA lets plays and was actually nervous that I'd have wasted money... but I wanted to try it to see if I could learn to love it and oh dear fragging gawd do !!I have my ship rigged with cannons on the one side and missiles on the other so I can cut shield off, then skin their components off with a single sweep!I joined a faction and managed to single-handedly over-take a quarter of the galaxy with them!I may have p!ssed a few people off... judging by the size of the bounty they put on me... but when one of the hopeful hunters appeared, a total stranger turned up to help! I was so happy that I had to send them a little money just to make sure they stayed on my side in the future!Station taxation, fuel consumption, crew-size, weapon power-cost, damage ratios, damage types, weapon placements and firing arcs, ship design, part scructure, diplomacy, warfare, ingergalactic infection, bounty hunting, resource management...All these things were so daunting to me... but I'm doing them all second-nature because this game makes it simple to understand!It's a wall of terrifying information... but once you do it one at a time, you're actually doing it as if you were meant to do it!The campaign has been described as a great big tutorial. Ease you into the features one by one... I have to say, I'm looking foward to completing it just so that I can do a sandbox and see where that goes!This game is wonderful... truly wonderful and as such, it plays like a dream from all angles!Even my biggest complaints are petty and inconciquential as the rest of the game has so much to do!This game is in early access as it stands (I will update this review as things unfold) and I have not seen this level of Developer presence on the steam forums before!Remember, Minimax is a tiny company! But this game is the kind of thing I expect to see from the heavy-hitters! Only, this level of quirky ingenuity is so rare in the larger titles, it has that 'indie charm' that has won us all over so often...Also, I have no shame in admitting that I may have a crush on one of the characters in the game... WHAT? Her artwork is gorgeous and her sense of humour is wonderful!Curse you minimax for making the woman of my dreams XDI have often said that 'programmers make bad games' (there's a long explanation I'll spare you'You get people who think like programmers and people who think like gamers. Those who expect you to be able to understand XML and PHP because they do are pretty annoying when they make a game because you have to know what they do just to play it...Gamers make good games (again, more explanation you're getting out of... I should post it somewhere)Gamers know what they want. That strange mix of realism and 'but reality sucks so lets make it better' mentality that can make a game truly spectacular!Minimax are gamers! Every time I fear I'm too nerdy for the game, along comes a reference that makes me squee like a fan-girl! "

								First review.I play a lot of space games (KSP, Elite Dangerous, Space Engineers, Rebel Galaxy, Space Cargo, Astroneer, SOADE, Spore, Rebel Galaxy, Reassembly, FTL, Stellaris etc.) and I write from the perspective of a sci-fi fan who enjoys pretty much anything that happens in space.SPAZ was largely inspired by Asteroids+Elite style games such as Escape Velocity Nova. I played it and enjoyed it a lot.SPAZ2 keeps the lore from SPAZ and adds two new game mechanics: 2.5D combat like Rebel Galaxy. The depth dimension is important for asteroid mining and to the appearance of fighter drones. Squares-based ship crafting in a single plane. and ship component looting and trading. It's finer than typical elite-style games, but it's coarser than Space Engineers, KSP or Reassembly. Actually it's similar to Space Cargo and TerraTech.A ship starts with a mother node (like TerraTech's cabin). Then core nodes that connect to the mother node and provide passive bonuses. Then weapon nodes that add their own passive bonuses and a some kind of ordnance. All nodes are added in one plane (like Space Cargo or Reassembly), so they act like squares.You can be clever with your layoutAll pilotable ships move in the same plane, and weapon orientation and ship layout is important to tactics. In my ship, I use front and left for direct-fire weapons, and back and right for missiles.The battlefield can get confusing. But when that happens, it usually means a quick end one way or another. Overall the gameplay with a gamepad is pleasant and satisfying. The explosions are great, too!The art and the game engine is pretty. The writing and characterisation is in the same vein as SPAZ. It's funny, sarcarstic and self-derisive.The game is stable enough, and there's enough game content for the money. I would encourage prospective buyers to wait until voice acting is added (""very soon"").If you like space games, or just blasting things into oblivion with spectacular weapons, that one is for you.

								Seeing as how they said from the get-go that this was not a clone of the first game.I bloody love it! The procedural combat and stuff makes the game dynamic and you can easily lose long-term with the wrong strategies. It's even kinda got a roguelike feel to it, in a casual way.TL;DR: 8/10 - The game is great but I feel like the starmap is lacking something. I can't even really pinpoint what it's missing. Just feels like something's missing.			"

								This isn't SPAZ1.  If that's all you care about then this probably isn't what you want.SPAZ2 is an evolution of the game play in the first one and makes several critical changes.  In this one you are the mothership, a highly configurable mothership, with a variety of ARPG-esq loot.  The combinations are pretty staggering and I've only really played with one type of setup in my first game.  This modular system is great if you enjoy building and configuring your own ship, while upgrading with new/better loot found throughout.The combat initially seems smaller, but once you've got a full complement of strikecraft while fighting several other captains simultaneously the battles get quite hectic.  You can play a few bouts staying away from the enemy with sniper cannons and drone fighters, but later on I was a laser and cannon junkie.  I especially liked taking their shields down and then ramming their engines to rip them off the ship.  The AI is decent here and I lost quite a few confrontations when they decided to gang-up on me when my shields dropped.The story mode has the same flow as the first one.  You start out a nobody captain fighting bandits to get enough resources and experience to advance.  Later on you're part of a faction, fighting their enemies, and making a few of your own that will likely last the duration of the game (assuming they aren't zombified later).  The final part has you running your own faction, while recruiting captains you've made friends with over the course of your game.  That's when you get to take on the zombies or they take on you depending on how it goes.My only real complaints are that the tutorial seems to go on forever.  You can't really do or see much of the game while constrained to just the first 10 levels so if you don't persevere the game might seem rather boring.  I also leveled up passed 40 in my story game, which meant I was capped on the number of sub-cores I could get, but this was probably just me wanting to supplement some drone parts along with my lasers/cannons.  Finally, replacing inner sub-cores with better loot later in the game is mildly annoying having to remove all the parts and then reconnect them piece by piece.Overall I find it quite enjoyable.  Now on to sandbox mode...			"

								Release date: May 17 in the afternoonPurchase date: May 17 in the eveningCurrent date: May 20thCurrent Time spent in game: 24 hoursI bought this game when I got home on the 17th. Between then and today I have been working full time, working out occasionally, eating, trying to pay some attention to my SO, and a whole lot of not sleeping. I think it is fair to say I like this game.On the Devs:I found a bug where I lost my Star Base after a defensive fight when I didn’t lose the battle. I submitted that to the forums. Within a few minutes I had a response confirming that was a bug and not an angrymaking “feature”. I submitted the bug following one of the 2!!! devs instructions. I got a near immediate email response stating that he was working to reproduce it and had a few follow-up questions. I answered those questions. 15 minutes pass and I get an email stating that it was definitely a bug and outlined what they needed to do to fix it, then he asked what I wanted to do about my save game. I suggest he load my character up with in game currency, a bounty like those given to the people who identify flaws for Google or FB get. He agreed and another 10 minutes later I had an updated save file in my inbox. “Wealthy.sav” Open up the game and my new save game has 50k scrap on it. I go on about my merry, and richer way, two hours later I download the newest patch which notes a fix for my bug.10/10 would support these devs again. Thanks for the great customer service!!On the Game:I really like this game. I played around 90 hours on SPAZ 1 and since that joyous time have been waiting with baited breath for SPAZ 2. I have been on the MinMax forums and following, with relish, the developer notes for SPAZ 2. So I had a fair idea of what I was getting into. Forewarned is forearmed so to speak. And I absolutely love the way the game feels. I was worried initially how the 3D aspect of things would work but I love the complexity it adds to the game. RAMMING SPEED, ENGAGE!There are definitely things I would like changed (or perhaps I just need to find them) in this game, for example:•	I feel like there isn’t a big enough of a drive for other factions and unaligned Captains to not pillage your resource nodes in your territory.•	I would really like to be able to call for help when/if I get jumped by a sadistic strong captain when I am weak.•	I think captains, after getting murdered, get back to near full strength really quickly. Though maybe the threat measurement is just off because of their level?•	I think that there should be some stratification of captain ship layouts, IDK if I haven’t just seen this yet, but I don’t think all captains should just use as many cores as possible. I think it would be really cool if some captains could have different battle behaviors and for example, go for few core, highly agile, highly upgraded ships as opposed to big hulking monsters.•	Economic indicators / more clear explanation on how trade lanes work ~ like how the focus of the Star Bases you build (shields, armor, etc.) impact the part that the Star Base is good at generating.I would like to note that all of the above suggestions are mostly nitpicks. I don’t have a single issue with how the game plays because this is a solid goshdarn game! I don’t even know if all my requests need to be requested. I have only gotten 24 hours in! I guess my only real gripe is that this game suffers very much from the same issue that Civilization suffers from: the notorious “just one more turn/thing”. My place of employ probably doesn’t appreciate the contribution my sleep-addled self delivers quite as much.TL:DRGet SPAZ 2. Live SPAZ 2. Love SPAZ 2. Try and get some sleep.Thanks MinMax Games!!

From different weapon/ship configurations to the different ways to politically handle the competition and make money, there are so many ways to play.  I loved the original SPAZ but I am happy with the direction this game is going (procedural universe).  To the devs:  I would love to see more configuration options for the ship/space station size and weapons.			"

								SPAZ2 is still in early access but already is a very solid, bug-free and enjoyable game.SPAZ1 was a great game about building a fleet of beastly ships and getting the galaxy rid of the zombie threat.SPAZ2 is quite different from it, though - you won't find as much fleet command or multi-ship battles here.This time around it's mostly about empire building, mothership battles and building your mothership from bits and pieces.And there's way less micromanagement too - most of the things (like resource collection) were simplified a lot.The good thing is - SPAZ2 does all of the main things it wants to do really well even at this early stage.Mothership constructor is fun and allows you to create insane ships that would fit pretty much any playstyle you might have.Mothership battles are pretty entertaining, especially when there's more than one ship per side.And empire management is well done too - who wouldn't want to conquer the galaxy while hiring and managing relations with a bunch of crazy looking captains?There are some things that definitely lag behind what SPAZ1 had to offer (perhaps only for now?).This time around there's no research tree, leveling up offers simple pick from one of three skills.UI still feels a bit clunky at places. Comparing things, for example, is nigh impossible without memorising a myriad of stats on two items.It also does feel a bit grindy from time to time, so more ways to get experience (like quests with some stories behind them) would be very welcome. Not that there's nothing to do, it's just those things start to feel a bit too familiar really quick. And it does takes some time to get to building your own empire.All in all, it's a really good game: it's different enough from SPAZ1, it offers some new cool mechanics, it's bug-free (literally encountered zero bugs during my playtime) and once you get to the empire building part - it starts to get really fun.Watch more in-depth first impressions in the video below:

Early Access Review
								Here's the short version: this game has been out for three days and I have logged 41 hours in it. Connect the dots. This game may be Early Access, but it is more complete than a lot of ""finished"" games these days. It's been in development for almost four years. It could easily be called ""done"" right now, and a larger studio would probably do exactly that. But this game is made by two guys, who are active and responsive in the discussion forums, and there have been a half-dozen hotfix updates in the last 50 hours. I grudgingly quit the game to get some sleep late this morning, and when I woke up four hours later there was a new update. They take this seriously. They care about their work, they care about the game, they care about their ART. Which is why, just like fans of an insanely popular band, everybody seems to be complaining about this game. It is not another album just like their last one. Just like Marilyn Manson released ""Holy Wood"" and it wasn't enough like ""Mechanical Animals"" which wasn't enough like ""Antichrist Superstar,"" or Cradle of Filth released ""Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder"" which wasn't enough like ""Thornography"" which wasn't enough like ""Cruelty and the Beast."" Thing is, all six of those albums changed a corner of the world forever. (Manson has PROBABLY changed a bigger corner of it than Cradle.) And so, too, does SPAZ 2. Make no mistake: the original SPAZ is a very, very different game. If you want more of that, SPAZ 2 is not where you should look for it, because literally everything is different. And it IS an Early Access game, so there are known issues with things like (at present) the pacing and difficulty and tutorials. ""The game really opens up about five hours in,"" as one of the developers noted, but there is the problem of getting through your first five hours and then there is the problem of the game being... well... outrageously difficult, sometimes. But this is already getting better - by the time you read this, it will be even better. And oh, what a game it is. You can tell from the moment you start: it is GORGEOUS. Even if your graphics card is a potato (well, not really, an actual potato doesn't have the right drivers) you'll be able to trade framerate for appearance and the game will merrily chug along at 2fps so you can look at it and say ""ooh, pretty."" Then you can go into graphics options, jack everything down to the bottom, and your framerate will kick right up to 60 so you can actually play. Most importantly, IT WILL NOT MAKE YOU RESTART. You can alter all the settings and keep right on going. Plus, in the main menu, there's a big old space battle being rendered as the attract loop, which totally responds to these settings on the fly... so you can see the results immediately, in a common situation where they matter. This is, in short, the main menu of a game done so right... it makes every other game look wrong. Which is pretty much the core theme of the whole game, but since it is so different from everything else, it will take several hours to get used to it. The jury was still out for me until I had about twelve hours of playtime. I trusted the devs. I saw the potential. But I was not getting the ""holy crap, this is AWESOME"" vibe from it yet. As you can probably guess, I have totally gotten that vibe now. You start out with a space battle, and then spend twenty minutes racing through a tutorial on basic ship operations, which you will find was incredibly important and you really should have paid attention because sweet mother of crap in a hat is this game complex. So you'll either go into the ""Tutorials"" part of the interface and review it, provided you paid enough attention to know where that is, or you'll start over and slow down. Then you'll learn that the tutorial only covers about half the interface because there is an awful lot of it and the tutorial was already way too long. (They're working on this. The community is trying to help. They're actually listening. It will get a lot better.)The core gameplay basically works like this. You are interacting with a dynamic world on a semi-static map. The regions of space are prearranged and in the same place with the same names every game, but resources are placed randomly within it. And then there are 200 other AI captains on the map. The machinations of these captains in their attempt to start and grow five political factions will make every single game entirely different. It's ALL emergent. It's all personalities and connections and networks and a far more detailed economy than any game like this has a right to have. That's the ""Space"" part. Then you get to the ""Pirates"" part, where some of the captains don't like you and will try to extort money and resources from you. There's a grace period of about five levels where everyone leaves you alone, but then all bets are off and you'll learn just what complete♥♥♥♥♥♥♥other people can be. And then you'll eventually get to the ""Zombies"" part, which I won't spoil for you because it's supposed to be surprising and make you go ""wtf."" Suffice to say the infection starts spreading, and you have to get ahead of it. This is not easy right now, and like most community-involved games it will probably end up being ""terribly difficult unless you know this secret that makes it unbelievably easy"" in the end. The key thing to remember about this game is that between ""complex emergent political systems"" and ""beautiful intricate space combat,"" the game is pretty much as simple as it can be... but no simpler. There is no ""intermediate"" stuff. You will have a hill to climb over, and the view from the top is nothing special. But on the other side of the hill, when you get to the ""advanced"" gameplay, everything is just amazeballs. Once you understand combat and the world map enough to know what you're doing, you'll probably feel like the game should be more fun than it is. But you're just getting started. Keep pushing forward. As a rough guide, right now, level 13 will be the bane of your existence. (They actually tell you this in the intro, kind of.) The first ten levels will be fine. The next couple will be okay. And then you'll start to sigh mightily about how ""grindy"" the game is. But once you hit level 20, everything will click - as long as you didn't rush there. Remember that first twenty minutes of tutorial you skipped because it was boring?  Same thing. It's not boring. You need to know this. You need to do this. And when you've finished the campaign... there's sandbox mode. The entire campaign storyline is basically a twelve-hour tutorial for sandbox mode, which is the REAL game. But if you tried to play it from the beginning, you would be so incredibly lost. Put all of this together, and it's like Minmax have been standing over my shoulder conspiring to make the exact game I personally wished someone would make. Which is more or less what they did with the original SPAZ, too. I just want a different, more complex game now. And this is it. If you just want more SPAZ, play more SPAZ. This is better. A lot better. It's like the difference between Grand Theft Auto 2 and GTA III. Quantum leap. Not the same game. Whole new systems. Whole new ideas. Changed the world.			"

 Graphics, Very vibrant and unique,The starmap has a very nice design, combat looks really good. The textures and models all AAA quality. Audio ,The synthesized voices are current place holders they do the job, but I can't wait until they are replaced with real voice acting. The sound of the ships, weapons, explosions and the random chatter that happens on the combat screen, all really good  Gameplay,The starmap is very good, It feels intuitive. The combat is also very good, easy to pickup, but I think it will be hard to master. A copious amount of content is already available... this title really feels like its top of the genre, with a well delivered script, interesting ideas and characters.  "

Early Access Review
								This game is worth its price if you enjoy naval space battles, ship customization, scavenging for survival and light diplomacy. Procedural generation and AI captains who have their own relationships with everyone else make the experience unexpected and offers a wealth of emergent gameplay.  This is not SPAZ as we knew it, but an entirely different animal. While the general framework of its predecessor is still there, nearly every aspect of the game has been refined. The basic framework is still there. You collect resources and gradually gather in strength. You choose your friends and enemies (although, at times, the enemies choose you). You explore the universe with the returning zany cast and try to be ready for when the zombies happen. The collection of resources happens at nodes. You compete for them with dozens of other captains, and later on, with other factions. Gathering from a node that belongs to another faction gradually makes them more hostile against you, and you need to balance your need for fuel, scrap metal and crew against the imminent threat of being blasted with hot laser fire. Fuel especially (to my knowledge) can't be acquired in large quantities anywhere else but the nodes, which makes your survival dependant on repeatedly stomping on people's feet. Nothing happens in a vacuum. In SPAZ 1, the warp gates created isolated systems that had no idea what happened in a neighboring system. You could loot and pillage to your heart's content with no repercussions as long as you could deal with the forces at hand. In SPAZ 2, all the systems are connected and you can freely move between them. You, and dozens of other captains. They can be allies or enemies, depending on what they see you doing. Some of them are a lot stronger than you. If you♥♥♥♥♥♥them off, they will start hunting you down and demanding painful tributes. Paying it will improve your relations by a bit, but usually not enough to make it a viable way of making them stop pestering you. You need to manage your relationships and immediate needs for resources carefully. The factions quickly fill the map with their outposts, and when border friction happens enough, they go to war. You need to assess which faction to throw your lot in based on their relative strengths - one might be weaker, but offer different options in technology. One might be stronger, but you happen to be on the kill-on-sight list of a dozen of their captains. You can also alter the odds by giving out bounties on strategic targets, but resources are at a premium. If you're enough of a jerk, expect said bounties to target you. The humor and the vibes are still there. The game has lore nodes that mainly focus on the events of SPAZ 1. Truth to be told, I skipped most of the lore sections and dialogue of the previous game. What I've seen will likely be pretty hit-or-miss for most people, but there are some downright hilarious sections of dialogue - all set against the self-awarely grim portrayal of mankind's potential bleak future. There is an interesting, overlaying thought experiment concerning how people act when dangerous, groundbreaking technologies or resources are discovered. Combat gameplay has changed to be almost unrecognizable. While SPAZ 1 brought to mind twin-stick shooters and arcadey gameplay, SPAZ 2 gives you a big customizable vessel that - at it's worst - handles like a whale. This makes the combat more about maneuvering and blasting frontsides at opportune moments. You can target your weapons quite accurately, and if you focus on an enemy hardpoint, you can blow it off. Seeing what the enemy is using and what's causing you trouble, then getting rid of it with well-aimed volleys of cannon and laser fire, is immensely gratifying. Of course, the enemy can do the same to you. It's a singular feeling to be feeling victorious right up until the moment your engine block flies off and you scramble to grab it back with a tractor beam. It can be hectic, especially with a lot of strike craft buzzing around, but it's a more measured and a slower experience that fans of the first game might be expecting. All in all, I can't say enough to recommend this game. It's relatively cheap for the amount of content it offers, even in state of early access. Oh - and they're talking about versus multiplayer. So there's that. It's not in the game right now, and the developers have asked you not to buy the game for multiplayer until the feature is fully realized. But keep an eye out.			"

Early Access Review
								When it comes to sequels, there's technical progress, and there's fixin' what ain't broke. It is my humble opinion that SPAZ 2 has done just a tad too much of the latter. I have 140 hours in the first SPAZ game, and what I was looking for here was new story, new enemies, more ship hulls, and maybe some multiplayer.But instead I just got some kind of.. weird.. glowy.. 3D thing. The magic is just all gone.Controls seem flimsy and unresponsive, like I'm flying an empty cardboard box. They changed the combat to be all broadside combat, but there really was no reason for them to change that. SPAZ 1 combat was excellent. The camera is super not great. The new ""over-the-shoulder"" camera seems pretty unpopular in the community, and completely unnecessary. When using ""classic"" camera mode (aka. top-down camera), it's impossible to see anything. I have no idea where my ship ends and the blackness of space begins. Wingmen wander away too far and don't respond quickly enough to enemies.The list goes on. But for the purposes of this review, all that really matters is that this isn't SPAZ 1. Maybe you're okay with that, and if so, go ahead and give it a shot, but I'm not. I wanted more SPAZ 1, and not only are there more differences here than similarities, but the things they've changed just feel.. hollow.I wanted to like it, but I just can't - not the way it is now, and unfortunately I think they've spent too much time going in the wrong direction to be able to salvage it, at least enough for me to get into it.Sorry devs, I really am.

Early Access Review
								Great game with a great company behind it.  You dont really need to play the first game to enjoy this one.  The gameplay is pretty different but it is a great game too.  The first game focuses on collecting tech and upgrading it.  The sequel focuses more on ship parts with most tech being available if you can find a part that has it.  I like the system in the sequel a lot more.  You can get lucky and get something crazy good early on, melting ships like butter and feeling all powerful.  It has a certain ""Diablo"" style RNG equipment feel to it. The main upgrade system focuses on Ship Cores.  The cores are squares that can be arranged in any way by connecting one to another on each of 4 sides.  Their various stats combine to enhance your whole ship.  Think of this as your core character stats.  The weapon systems can be left or right oriented, with connection points on one side hooking in to 1 to 3 cores.  3 prong connector weapons are of course more powerful.  Engines and nose cones connect on top or bottom orientation, with 1 to 3 connections also.  Each of these pieces also contribute attributes to your ship stats.ProsModular shipbuilding, with components having randomized stats that can even be swapped out or replaced during battle (dangerous and desperate, but intense and fun).The POV combat of this game is a lot of fun.   It has a turret view that allows you to aim at individual enemy ship parts.  With the right weapon you can chop off their parts and, with difficulty, install it on your own ship during combat.  Lots of NPC pilots to compete against.  Funny names.  There is a reputation system where each of them watch actions in sectors around them and respond accordingly.  If no one sees it, it didnt happen.A wreckage system, that leaves debris fields on the main map after a battle.  These areas can be looted at the cost of a map turn for a random treasure in the form of resoruces and/or ship parts.  They are automatically claimed by the winner of the battle or the owner of the zone, and looting someone elses parts leads to a reputation loss.The storyline playthrough is fun, with familiar characters and quests to advance the story.ConsThe NPCs can be kinda stupid and repetative.  Some level up strangely quickly.  They need to be fleshed out a bit more, possibly with different 'stats' or personalities.  At the end of a battle, it would be nice to be able to take a few valuable ship parts to a collection point of some kind.  Right now you can spend as long as you want after battle disassembling and reassembling your ship.   There is a seemingly random loot collection screen where you get a various number of pieces.  However, any parts left on the field are added to a loot pile that anyone can search after battle.  The ship parts are given out randomly and you may lose that secondary nice piece you left behind.  Give me X number of items I can collect and let me take my favorites to a collection point instead.  The main storyline campaign could be fleshed out a lot more.  I think they plan to do this.  I want to be able to choose a max number of ship cores for the random gen games.   You can choose several different variables for the random map, but that isnt one of them.  It would be fun to have an absurdly large number of cores on a random map.			"

								Well worth it. It's different from the original S.P.A.Z, but the longevity is still there. Some old characters reappear, and the story takes off from where it ended in the original. If you havent played it, you can collect ""lore"" which gives both resources and XP, and tells you how things turned out how they did in the first game. The default ""relative"" controls are terrible and should turned off immediately - although it's a personal preference, it's also much easier to control the ships without it.Cant wait to play the full game when it's out of early access. It's a lot of fun as it is right now though. Go, buy it.   "

								Very ambitious undertaking.I have thoroughly enjoyed early access so far. The amount of choice you have in regards to designing your ship is impressive in itself. The gameplay is fluid and feels natural; physics based destruction is always fun.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a sandbox type environment set in space. Resource collection, Blueprint collection, form alliances with NPCs, recruit AI captains to YOUR faction when the time is right.. so much to do.The developers are very active and they listen/chat with anyone with a decent idea. Now is the time to get in and make a difference :)Multiplayer is in the works and there is talk of modding support when the game is completed. "

								2 GUYS, 1 good game.spent 15 hours finishing the campaign/tutorial. could have spent less, but really enjoyed all the parts, I cant wait to give the sandbox a go!Galaxy map sure gives the feeling of taking over the galaxy bit by bit and the whole mount and blade interaction happening there works really good!Story and lore was great! Enjoyed the backstory stuff, humour and how the campaign progressed. Great job!Graphics is very good and the colors are great, even my wife stood in the backround and said the wanted to play it because she liked the colors!UI is okay.I would like a bit more highlighted stats and smaller button for the items but thats just a minor picky picky thing...The only big complaint about this is simply the stats, and i feel it is an important one, comparing this to SPAZ1 i would say all the mods and stats  on weaps,ships,lvls in this game seem very limited and i really dont feel much difference except size.Take data/exp collection for example: Finding those big chunks of data and using the tractor beam to suck it in gave a ""good"" feeling although i believe it was only based on the level of the ship you were fighting. the data/exp could then be used to invest points in some really cool stats such as rate of fire,cloaking,cargo space etc.  in the campaign mode it feels like its only more health,damage,loot, and trade price reduction. In the end it was pretty much how it ended in SPAZ1 as well, how it was progressing, visually and mechanicly was amazing. "

Dev crew is constanting working on adding features and additional content while cleaning code, fixing bugs, this is a great game with a great and dedicated dev crew behing them.			"

								This game is certainly a step up from the original. That being said, there are a couple things I missed that the first one had.Pros:Modular Ships, this was incredibly awesomeBetter Space BattlesDrastically improved visuals for battlesBuilding your own factionCons:No more specialist slots (I rather liked that)Cap on cores you can put on ship after a certain level (this dictates the size and strength of your ship)Only one ship can have the loadout altered (mothership) unlike all of them in the originalI had a lot of fun with this game and will probably play it for awhile. It seemed less of a grind than the original which could be good or bad depending on what you like.			"

								Give SPAZ2 about an hour to get its hooks into you. Once you're through the opening sequence (that, note, starts with a fake Game Over) you're into the world proper. As with Starpoing Gemini 2, Rebel Galaxy and others of its ilk, you'll manage resources, kill things, and grow your capabilities.It's the ship building that elevates this though... the ability to complete pull apart your ship and pop on new weapons or engines or whatever else there is. Flying around in a garbage pile has never been so much fun.Also the writing is hilarious! It's just that the voices are computerised at the moment but expect that to change at some point.Try it, it's fantastic :)			"

								pros+real time world is pretty good. Not super fleshed out, but it's there and interesting+graphics are interesting+trading and factions are better than in spaz 1, lots of voice acting and characterscons-the levelup perk system is much worse than spaz 1's skill treeIt's straight up less interesting and balanced, and it gives less choices.-ship modification is signficantly worseI havn't found anything like cloak, intertial engines, frames, or anything like that. You basically choose where to place guns and engines and that's it.-strike craft system is much less complex and meaningful than in spaz 1Strike craft also lost depth, you choose a frame and you can't even rebuild craft. It's basically just optional farming for a temporary distraction that's unreliable.-you can't turn with mouse because ♥♥♥♥ youNo idea why this is the case.-parts falling off in combat is annoying and randomThis might have been interesting with more depth/choice in the movement system, but that's all gone now.-less scale in battlesNo space zombies and less drones leads to many less explosions than normal.All in all, i'm dissapointed and i'm not sure what the devs worked on for 4 years. I sort of wish we just got a real time world expansion for spaz 1.			"

Early Access Review
 WARNING: THIS IS A SANBOX MODE REVIEW. I HAVE NOT PLAYED ENOUGH CAMPAIGN AND LEARNED ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM SANDBOX. This will be my first review after waiting 2 years for this game to come out. Possibly the most important thing is: DO NOT COMPARE THIS TO THE FIRST ONE. That will be a death sentence.The game takes a few pieces of the first and molds them into something completely different in this game. If you want to somewhat compare it of something, it has some similarities to Mount and Blade. Mostly due to factions and recruiting captains and such.A lot of people will give the game♥♥♥♥♥♥for its slower pace and the big change it made, but I think it's for the better, but that's just another opinion. At first, I hated this game for the first few hours because it felt so different, but then things changed bit by bit over time once I started to understand more and learn about a whole new game.I will first list what I find to be problems that should probably be fixed soon, then I will list pros. First:  I feel like the early access in this game is more than just for multiplayer purposes. There are a few things that I feel need to be changed, one of the biggest issues being the extreme lack of REZ in the later stages of the game. REZ is used to have your ship move faster. There are 3 available movement options ranging from slow to fast. Slow usually takes up 0 REZ, but later takes a little bit due to heavy amounts of goons and weight. Normal takes a low amount of REZ, while fast can consume 3x as much REZ (If not that exact amount). I only played the campaign for about 2 hours, so I can't say if it lacks as much, but it is a big problem in sandbox for the time I've played it. Your ship ends up consuming much more REZ than you can find and you'll often find yourself sitting around watching your ship slowly move to areas. Second:  Ramming in the later stages. (Didn't know about it early on so not sure if it's good there) When you build up a tanky enough ship, you can just ram the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of people. This is super fun, but absolutely annihilates hulls. It's not so effective on shields, but when you have your shield up and ram an unshielded target, you can quite literally 1 shot them depending. You can also ram starbases to destroy them quickly, which is somewhat annoying but I like the mechanic a lot. Third:  The AI are stupid. Now I don't mean when you're in a battle; they just do what they can to fight you and I don't find it to be an issue. But the AI on the starmap; they are stupid. After building up a base of my own and recruiting my own captains it showed over time that they don't exactly have the smartest mind of their own. This is mostly because they're one dimensional as they will see someone from their team being attacked, and quite literally every single one of them will rush to their aid, but when the battlefield is full, they'll go about their usual business. OR they will all rush to another target that's being attacked, and the cycle continues. This is mostly an issue when you have a somewhat bigger faction of your own. Fourth:  The choices you can tell your captains to do. These are extremely limited. You have Set Wingman, which will have them follow you around all game if you like no matter what you do, and that's it. You can't tell them to raid a starbase or attack/distract their leader, only to follow you or stop following you. You are also limited to 1 person following you at a time. Which is a good thing, because if you were running around with 2 allies at a time, you would probably win every single fight.There are a few other minor things that I don't think are really worth mentioning, so on to the positives. These will be a bit more quick than the my semi-detailed cons. Pros: -Variety of parts is great and making your ship while figuring out how you can optimize or make it interesting is fantastic.-I only played normal and it seemed well balanced for most of the game (until I just got way ahead of everyone), so I can only imagine what the harder mode is like.-Ability to start from scratch when you die for the hardcore and masochist players out there.-Very good ""takes time to do things"" system. Want to salvage things from the enemy you just killed? It will take some time and you may be attacked by someone that doesn't like you. Want to ransack a REZ deposit in a faction's territory? It will take some time and you'll probably die to the areas owner!-The zombies are fun, but can be overwhelming if you're not prepared for them.-You are meant to struggle, take risks, and hope for the best in the early game. Not taking risks will slow your progression heavily. I enjoy this concept although you CAN abuse auto save and quick save to try and get the best outcome.-Trading is great. Everything will be more expensive in places that don't like you, and things will be cheaper for people that do like you. Equipment will be much cheaper when you buy it from your own faction or the faction you create.-Also on trading: Replacing parts of the same slot requirement will replace that part automatically, as long as you sell that part with it. Example: I want a subcore system to be replaced but it's in the very freakin middle of my ship and I'll have to tear my ship apart to add the new one. Not at all! As long as you select the subcore you want to buy and the one you want to replace, it will replace it once you trade.My overall impression of this game for the hours I've played it is probably an 8/10. Definitely recommend it as an overall game, but if you're here to re-live your SPAZ 1 life, don't bother.			"

Early Access Review
								Highly recommended.First off, SPAZ 2 is nothing like SPAZ 1. Watch the video's and see if it appeals to you otherwise you may be disappointed.While it is an early access release, the single player portion is largely finished except for some placeholder voice overs. Balance refinements are also likely. The game is fully playable though, you won't get half way through and be stuck waiting for more content to be made.The game is a mix of strategy and third person battles. The strategic gameplay occurs on a map where you gather resources, engage enemies, trade, join a faction or build your own and tax traders who use your starbases. The AI consists of 200 individual captains that can do everything you do including getting annoyed and placing bounties on you that other neutral or enemy captains will try to collect.The battles occur in an arena and are semi-3d. The capital ships all move in a plane but can tilt so weapons mounted on one side can fire across the other while at the same time exposing your weak internals to enemy fire. Ships are made up of parts that can be destroyed or broken off by shooting or ramming. Damaged parts can be picked up and attached to your own ship during battle. The battles are deceptively complex. They appear simple at first but as the game progresses you need to develop new strategies to deal with more difficult threats. "

								As of writing this, I've spent 60 hours with the game over 1 campaign and 1 sandbox. The game version as of writing this is 0.3.2.If one comes to this game ready for a distinct experience in the genres it touches, albeit a little bit of a mashup, they are more likely to enjoy the game than not.202 captains, 53 starbases (territories), 7 factions total, including the player's ability to create their own faction, ship part choices to match the 5 human AI factions in dimensions, turret locations and visuals, a short list of weapons each part can sport that allow for a fairly diverse choice of combat tactics. Just some of the reasons one can enjoy the game for.All this and the game is expected to receive more content, along with balancing and other associated tweaks. As it is now, don't come expecting a full game, as it is not (seriously, this has to be mentioned).Objectively pretty good, subjectively pretty awesome, if you like modularity, diversity, spacey stuff, consider this as a potential purchase, at the very least.V0.8 update:The game has gotten even better since my first review. More weapons, cusom part order system, strike craft overhaul, bandits that are a bit more interesting, core synergy. The devs have kept their promises and are delivering a better product by the update. Community input is also taken seriously.			"

								The reason people read reviews is to determine if they should buy the game. The answer in this case is yes. If you like the sound of the idea of a space rpg where your character is a ship, get this immediately.It reminds me of a modern space version of stratosphere. Frankly I love it to pieces. (Literally ship components hehe.)Space Pirates and Zombies is likely among my top three games of all time. Spaz2 is an improvement in virtually every way in my opinion, and yet well different enough to be a stand alone.The universe even now in version 0.3 feels very much alive. The battle is nicely paced, exactly as advertised, like huge pirate ships on an ocean of stars.One time I was in a fight, and right as I was about to die the enemy had shot off one of my engine components, I had damaged him greatly, but I was doomed. In panic and frustration I grabbed that engine part with my tractor beam and flung it at the enemy as a kind of final screw-you before death, but the engine chunk flew right into an exposed area of sub-cores and destroyed the enemy ship.No game is perfect. Especially not to me. I'm hilariously picky. But this game earned being my first direct Steam purchase in years and the only near full price paid since the advent of humble bundle and steam gifts.Games are never worth the asking price imo. (I'm actually very much against the entire concept of IPL.) But if you assume the system is unavoidable, which most do for the moment, then this game is one of the few, if not the only exception, even if development stopped right now.What I love about this game is the freedom to play in such a wide variety of ways. I play peacefully more or less, and economically. Virtually every task in this game can be obviated economically. That's tremendously cool imo because it's realistic. Logical consistency is important to me. and despite the fanciful theme of the game, more dark comedy than serious Sci-Fi, it does have a spine of consistent logic and plausibility which I find indispensable.There virtually isn't anything you can't pay someone to do. When games insist on making that impossible they instantly show their unreality to me. The ""people"" in the games in this way reveal themselves to be robots. I stopped playing ARPGs (which this is one could argue) because of that. It started in diablo 2. If I can hire one mercenary why can't I hire two?This game has precious few invisible walls and the context is such that you could techno babble your way into justifying them.This game is truly brilliant. If you want a galaxy sandbox to play in, this is it, and I can only see it getting better.I prefer the story feel of games like Ringrunner, Homeworld Cataclysm, or even Infinite Space 3, but while those games are good in their ways, Spaz 2 is superior all told by a gargantuan margin. And of course this game is far from complete.It might wellone day evolve into what a modern Star Control would look like. Just need more factions and the addition of planets. Especially if they open everything up to modding as much as they can.I hope they own all the assets and have that option. I don't believe they did in Spaz1 because of the tools they used to make it. But I can't know for sure.In anycase I literally am cutting this review short for now because I want to go play.			"

Early Access Review
								I like this game, but it took me a while to really appreciate it. I was expecting more of SPAZ 1, but this is a vastly different game. It's a solid game, but there are a few things minmax really need to work on. I'll try to distill the essence of the game and give a few recommendations.This is vastly different from SPAZ 1 in that it focuses on empire-building. This game feels more like M&B Warband in space (M&B is one of my all-time favorite games). You can build your own empire, cultivate relations with every single captain in the game, capture systems, wage war, upgrade your stations, form alliances etc.How else does it differ from SPAZ 1? You only ever fly a single ship - the mothership. Gone are the unlocks and the feeling of major progression; instead we have a modular mothership. The modularity is fun, but the actual implementation of ship-modification is very tedious.Ships from SPAZ make a comeback - the gimp, right hook etc are in the game as ""strike craft"". This NEEDS to be fleshed out more, they play a role, but lack almost all tactical value. IMO choice of strikecraft should be as varied and important as choice of weapons.Upgrades are virtually gone. No more min-maxing your loadout. You get an extra strikecraft here, +20% armor there, +15% reload speed down the road etc. This also MUST be fleshed out. Speaking of leveling - late game is incredibly unbalanced. Once you can start taking out stations or major captains your level skyrockets. 2-3 fights/level.""These things all seem like complaints"". Well, yes. They made SPAZ 1 great, and they are... lackluster right now. However, SPAZ 2's empire building, diplomacy, abstracted strategy, graphics, and gameplay are nice and fun. Just don't expect more of SPAZ 1.For MinMax I have a few recommendations:1) Please flesh out the upgrade system - make player upgrades great again. Maybe add faction or meaningful station upgrades?2) Give strike craft more versatility. Different hangar sizes, modifications to loadout, obvious difference in behaviour are sorely needed.3) PLEASE revamp the mothership rebuilding interface. It's fun and novel the first 4-5 times but once youwant to try something other than a straight line and find out it didn't work as expected it's HELL to rebuild a 25+ part ship.4) Allow players to have bigger battles and more wingmen. There's only so much you can do to upgrade your threat, and if I have a faction with 20 stations I want a bodyguard who'll be able to stomp regular captains.			"

								I loved SPAZ and played well over 100 hours in it. SPAZ 2 was, in my mind, the same as SPAZ 1 just 3d environments and MP... and then it released.It's nothing close to the old school, top down shooter, build-a-badass-fleet and explore type game. Maybe that's my fault for expecting it to be. What it is now is a heavily focused 3rd person space shooter with boring ship building mechanics, story and overall gameplay.The new star map is tiny and some of the features that were touted are rather uneventful (interacting with 200 captians) and frankly, just boring. Ship augmentation is a frustrating process with no way to see overall health, armor, DPS and other statistics when you get a new item piece. If your item gets blown off in combat... might as well leave it because it's overly frustrating and hard to get it attached again. The story is rather predictable and ultimately forgettable and extremely short - I'd guess most people will beat it in about 10 hours and that's only because you have to grind to 30.I can go on and on why I dislike this title greatly and will just continue to play SPAZ instead. I support the developers and don't regret my purchase. I want them to be successful in what they do contrary to what I believe is a bad game compared to the original. However, I can't recommend others get this game and as you can see it's very polarizng. Either you love it or hate it and I am the latter.			"

								So far i have to say that I'm dissapointed in SPAZ2, there are a few reasons for this, but the game still has its up.Ups:The new graphics are nice to look at, and the weapon and ambient sounds are a nice touch, i enjoyed the work put into the look and sound of the game.The modular system was a step in the right direction for sure, i very much enjoy having some control over what my ship looks like, and getting new modules is never really hard to doThe ""online"" button, already super pumped for this!Downs:The galaxy map... to be completely hoenst here, altho it is a nice improvement over the old map, i completely dissagree with how it is used in the game, where the player spends TONS of time in the galaxy map, as this is the main screen now, and this makes the game feel boring frankly. gotta say, for the improvements in tech available to the dev team since the first game was released, i really feel like more work could have been put into the game to remove the need for the galactic as the main screen, and only use it for traveling long distances in accelerated time.The AI is another problem, that i am VERY dissapointed in, frankly the AI are sloppy, i like the idea o trying to bring ""life"" into the universe, but other than them putzing around station to station, occasionally starting fights, all they do is just float around and be useless, unless you have a bounty on you...AI and bounties, this SERIOUSLY SERIOUSLY SERIOUSLY needs to be fixed and reworked, the AI right now are absolutely BRUTAL and unforgiving, so much so, that 3 of them ganged up on me when i took some damage, then beat the crap out of me, so that i could not fight again without repairing, and then proceeded to beat the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me for FOURTY FIVE MINUTES, while all i could do was sit there and hit ""load last save"", since i didnt have the cargo to give them, and had no time at all to even try to repair myself, i have a few suggestions for this that i will put below.The modular design, altho yes i did think it was great, and is one of the ups, is also a down, its lacking, a lot, or at least it feels like it is. the variety of weapons feels very lacking compared to SPAZ, dunno if thats just me or what. but even with the amount of stuff in the game, the modular system feels very unifinished, and i am hoping that it will be more flushed out on full release.finally for me is the map, it feels too small compared to the old SPAZ, which had systems, with events in them to fly through, whereas you just have an aread on the galaxy map to fly through. the map just simply feels too small, and i hope the option to make it larger is brought back for full release!Fixing the Bounty issue:1) the player should be given a ""grace period"" after being attacked by and AI for a bounty again, something like 2 or 3 seconds for the player to be able to fully repair, and try to get some distance from the AI.2) have the AI fight each other at the same time in the instance, as having them fight over the bounty, so that the 3 v 1 scenario cant happen without giving the player a chance to win.Over all, the game isnt bad, it has some good new ideas in it, and the visuals and sound are very pleasing, but i still feel that so much is lacking from this, and feels like i have a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥product to be honest. this is early access, so i will wait to see what happens, but for now, i can't recoment this game.

								Highly recommend. Gone is the grind for resources. The game is streamlined into two modes: Strategy map, and battles. The battles feel visceral and satisfying. Tearing chunks off enemy ships to disable them, whipping asteroids at them, deploying mini fleets of strike craft - yes please. The strategy map delivers what it promises. Decide which factions to aid, which to♥♥♥♥♥♥off. Find and harvest various resources hoards with the click of a button. Eventually you can build your own faction and recruit captains that have been in the game since you first loaded it up. You will start building bases, and comboing them together to make epic ship parts, you will feel unstoppable. And then.... the zombies arrive. Heh. Good luck captain!			"

								At first, it wasn't at all like the orginal game (as described in page), and I recoiled a bit. I wondered what could have been, where the the original was. I played the game for an hour and put it down, not all that interested.Then, I started to actually play the game, and get into it. Slowly I began to warm up to the new gameplay and can now see how much potential this game has. It is already really fun to play with. It's a touch unwieldy at first go, but once you learn the controls, and hone your technique, the game becomes a lot of fun.One of my new favorites.			"

Early Access Review
								SPAZ was one of my favorite space games a few years back. When I saw that there was a sequel coming out I was extremely excited. SPAZ2 is advertised as NOT a sequel, but after playing it for a while, it still really does feel like a sequel. The story picks up where the last one left off, most of the core gameplay is the same, and even what is new feels like something beneficially added. I don't know why they say its not a sequel... ?Anyhow, so far the game is extremely fun...but oddly balanced. Right now (early access) you can level up to level 5 in about 15minutes, but will spend hours getting levels after that. A lot of basics like details on factions and so on are kind of a mystery. But the biggest thing is that dog fights (combat itself really) isn't as rewarding as the many auto-functions on the universe map screen. Why spend 30minutes mining 15 REZ in the 3d dogfight portion of the game when you can easily mine up to 400 from random places on the universe map in a few seconds?But, that said IT IS FUN. I'm realy enjoying it so far and given how the devs seem to be treating things, I can guess that by release those things I mentioned above will be fixed. SPAZ2 is a really well made sequel to SPAZ and hits all the right notes so far. If you played the original and got sucked in, you'll love this one, too.			"

								When early access started I was very sceptical as it wasn’t really anything like the first one, however I found this new take to be quite good, it just required a different mindset to get into.  In the last few months however the advances to this game have been phenomenal. It is a great game in it's own right, I have played through it probably 5-6 times now, and it still feels fresh with all the customisation options and new parts/systems being added regularly. If you are on the fence about this game do yourself a favour and grab it; It improves on the first game in nearly every aspect and it's not even finished yet.  "

								A wonderful game with a dynamic galaxy, heated ship to ship combat and captain/faction relations.However, those who expects a game similar to SPAZ1 might get dissapointed, as this SPAZ2, although it keeps some of the mechanics of SPAZ1, is very different.An excellent game nontheless, with more content to come, and Devs that actually care.

								Starts a little slowly (You need level 12 before you can even start your own faction) but very fun once you get deeper in. The dynamic galaxy is great, allegiances shifting around you with wars erupting on opposite sides of the map.  The combat system also seems more interesting than spaz1, the tractor beam adding an interesting dynamic when coupled with the powerups that spawn. The explosive barrels also seem a little more potent and are often invaluable in taking out space stations.Most importantly though, the devs seem very active. There have been 6 hotfixes in the 2~3 days the game has been out. They are actively listening to feedback and improving the game daily.			"

								SPAZ 2.... What did the Dev's say 3.5 YEARS???!!!!!!!!!!!! of development with a 2 man team? Sad result even for a still so called early access.. you better go play SPAZ 1.. or better said... if you've palyed SPAZ 1 DO NOT BUY SPAZ 2. It a totally different game.. the Universe is so small and so boring compared to the first game. When one day it'will be sold under 10,- € it might be ok but even on this Early Access 10% off its too expensive. Just not worth the money. Sorry Dev's you have hyped the game tooo much for a too long time.. and the result is sad and ridiculous for the effort you always told us you have put in. Uninstalling and falling back to SPAZ 1. Thx for nothing.			"

Early Access Review
								I've played the campaign and two sandbox games. The combat is fun, but it's very repetitive. All three games played exactly the same. It's not so much a game as a demo of a game. There are no interesting choices. Once you learn the game, every move is obvious, and it's always the same move.I enjoy the game and recommend it, but not by much. Almost the entire reason I'm recommending it is because once you get used to the combat, it is fun. But this game is very unfinished. It needs a ton of work.It's not anywhere near as good a game as SPAZ1. This is mostly because everything that made SPAZ1 fun is gone, including the intuitive and fast combat, the easy inventory system with blueprints, choosing your own skills to specialize in, and having lots of interesting missions.In SPAZ2, we have a horrible and sloppy inventory system that feels far more like work than fun. The blueprint system from SPAZ1 was perfect. This one is terrible. If you've ever found yourself hating inventory management in an RPG, you'll hate this one even more. And now we have random perks to choose from rather than the ability to customize our skills.The heaviest blow to this game though, by far, is the lack of interesting missions. Everything is combat. That's it. The combat is fun, but it gets repetitive doing the exact same thing over and over with no change, especially since we now have only one ship design, not several like we had in SPAZ1. There are no more missions about finding cargo, no more protecting other ships in escort quests, no more cloaking to sneak around a combat map for stealth quests, no more speed quests. Everything is just combat.GAME START: First of all, turn off relative controls in gameplay options for a smoother experience. In SPAZ1, you jumped right into the action from the start. In SPAZ2, the beginning is far too slow and lacks direction. Hopefully the devs will fix this. But once you get past the early stages of the game, everything speeds up and gets more fun.Do arena battels! At first, I was just exploring the map, which was boring because there are no real missions to do. Once I realized that I could go to every base and start doing arena battles for resources, it got more fun and got my ship up to par with the others. It also taught me how combat works.COMBAT: It takes a lot more time and/or firepower to take out one ship in SPAZ2 than it did in SPAZ1. Positioning and targeting are far more important now. Every piece of the ship is destroyable. If you focus on the engines, for example, you can cripple their movement abilities as well as whatever weapons they have mounted there. You can target the parts of their ship that are causing you problems.The ship building screen could be better. A static ship building screen would have been more efficient. As it is, you have to move the pieces around the screen with a gravity beam, which makes it more tedious than it needs to be. Also, you actually have to manage inventory, which is a huge step backwards from how it was done in SPAZ1 with blueprints / schematics. I found myself having to spend a ridiculous amount of time just selling or getting rid of extra parts I'd acquired.That being said, the ability to create a fully customized ship is awesome! No longer are there default chasis like there were in SPAZ1. Now you design your ship from scratch. It can have any shape, and every piece matters. Each part affects the ship's speed and movement capabilities, the weaponry, armor, shielding, and so on.Compared to SPAZ1, the map and scope of the game both feel very small. I'm hoping for a lot more content. SPAZ2 is a good game, and it'll be even better if we can get some more content.My first game on normal difficulty took around 23 hours. It was fun. I'll probably try a sandbox game next. There's a lot of potential for replayability, especially with sandbox mode and upcoming multiplayer.What this game needs more than anything else is for the devs to recognize that this game needs a lot of work and put that work into it. There's a lot of potential here, but it's really not a complete game, especially not for this price point. Right now, it's a $10 game selling for $20. If the devs leave it mostly like it is, it will always be a mediocre product. If they see all of the complaints from their fans and work to make this game more like the first one, then this could be a truly great game.			"

								So the long wait is over! Was it worth it?I would have to say yes it was! It is a new form of SPAZ that I think a lot of people may enjoy (like myself) or just not dig due to the direction they went with it.It isn’t quite the same experience as the first one and they made some big changes. It is a lot more stream lined, it has easier to understand systems and has faster paced gameplay. This may turn off some of the originals hardcore fans but for me I find the changes to be a welcomed addition.The story and writing in the original would never win a Pulitzer but it was fun and entertaining none the less. The same can be said for SPAZ 2, a bit goofy with a return of some of our favorite colorful characters (looking at you Carl).With a few hours in now I am really enjoying the game. After about 30 minutes of getting my bearings everything clicked and I am well on my way of clearing the galaxy of xeno scum.I love the direction they went with the series. If you don’t mind a bit of change to the SPAZ formula then I think you will enjoy this fun follow up. "

								I recommend this game. It's really fun. And it's not really a sequel of SPAZ, in gaming terms at least. It's a different game, with different rules and mechanics, though it does share the same universe. And zombies, they are the same too. SPAZ2 is actually a from-zero-to-hero sandbox game which is centered around your mothership, which you design on your own and suit to your gameplay style. There are lots of customization options and weapon combinations. Ramming other ships is a possibility (a very fun one:) too.You can either play a campaign or in sandbox mode. Campaign is, technically, a sandbox with tutorials, so I recommend you play it first. It's quite funny and has some interesting plot twists, not unlike the first game. "

								This game is a real gem! Feels more complete as an early access then many other finished games.Pros:- easy to learn ship building and combat system- diverse mechanics for both to offer enough tactical depth (try bandit hideout without any anti-fighter weapons and fail)- light 4x-Features like resource management, building an empire, factions & relations- RPG elements like leveling up, perks, impoving your equipment- pleasing graphics and running flawless on a medicore system without a single bug/crash so far- adjustable sandbox-mode (reminds me of ANNO in a positive way)Cons: (Features that I miss atm, but might be added during development)- no crafting / tech-development / use for your own space stations beside getting resources- weapons cannot be altered thus limiting your freedom of building your ship- endgame needs more diversity atmFor this price the game is a no-brainer even now. Let them add a few more features like a tech-tree, crafting at your own stations, some events (treasure transport passing through/bandit fleet, etc.), maybe an ANNO-like optional quest-system, seperate weapons from parts or make them reconfigureable and this game will skyrocket the steam charts!

								This game is an underappreciated gem, easily the best thing i've played in years. It's a very nice blend of strategy and action. If you've played the first game, this one may take a bit of getting used to, but stick with it through the first confusing hour or so and you will love it.For those new to the series, here's how it works: There's two main modes of gameplay, the starmap and conflicts. On the starmap, you buzz around collecting resources, making bases, finding bandits, and you can see over a hundred other AI captains on the map who can do all the same stuff you can. You want to build relationships with those captains by helping them out in fights and such, because when the zombies come, you'll need that help.When you're in a conflict, you actually pilot your ship. In the environment, all ships are locked into a 2d plane, but objects are not, it's a pretty seamless mix of 2D and 3D. The fighting feels more like naval combat than anything else, but it's very satisfying and feels large scale. Interesting note, you have to actually build your ship piece by piece, and the depth of customization is intense, you can experiment endlessly with different module and weapon layouts.I've been screwed over by early access games before, but i'm glad I rolled the dice on this one. Highly recommended			"

								This game is every bit as amazing as the first as you design your ship around the enemies weakness.  I really enjoy the feeling of ship to ship battles.  This time it is more personal as you take your flagship into battle.  There are a few unpolished features (like the voices, this review was written for Early Access) but as with the first I expect a lot of later additions.It is so satisfying to blow parts of other ships then attach them to yours and bail out friends in the last minute rush to their battle.  Influence territories and beat back the agressive expansionists.  Also show up when the zombies are attacking your worst enemy and bail THEM out by killing the zombies.  That happy face popping up is so satisfying.All made by two people.  If you like supporting independant developers, this is the place to do it.  These guys are very talented.			"

								Let me start off by saying this. I am a huge SPAZ fan and was anticipating the release of the second installment. I was more excited for this game than i was for many others. And, as a fan of the original, i unfortunately have to say that i am very dissapointed by how the game is.And yes, i am aware that the game is still in Early Access, however the quarrels i have with this game is at the very basics of gameplay. Something that is defining to what this game is about. And unfortunately if you were looking forward to a successor to SPAZ, you are wrong here. SPAZ 2 does so much different, that i would have named the game something entirely different. SPAZ 2 is now more of a rogue like space shooter that controls and plays very clunky. The whole economy is different, the playstyle is different and the way your ships work is entirely different, too.SPAZ 2 has a ""proceduarly generated world"", which just means that the placing of the objects in the world to interact with is different every playthrough. The map, however, always stays the same. It is very limited. You also build your ship from modules now. And if they get destroyed, well, you just have to buy another one then. Or use junk-parts which are just what the name suggests. JUNK. So you have to grind alot of currency (Scrap) to always have a decently equipped ship, which just sucks. Your ship looks different every time, so if you want a particular design you want to go with, you will need to spend alot of time just searching for the parts in different space stations.All in all, i am sure that some people may have fun with the game. However, if you were into SPAZ and expect SPAZ 2 to be anything like SPAZ, then you should prepare yourself to be sorely disappointed. So, I myself cannot recommend SPAZ 2.			"

Early Access Review
								I was a huge fan of the first SPAZ, this is nothing like it. If anything it reminds me of a very, very poorly done Civ2 clone. I wanted to like it, but the veritable litany of dysfunctional aspects, I think, has turned me so off to it as a product I'm remiss to give it another go when it's considered ""finished"". I genuinely don't have anything positive to say about the game other than acknowledging the budget level graphics are delivered with all the flair you could ask for to make them appealing, ie ""there are a lot of bright colors"". Everything else is terrible. Building starbases requires you to be lv12, which takes a minute, so the first 30 minutes to an hour (or well more) all you're doing is chasing down pirates and assaulting lower level captains; all of whom level faster than you. Whether it's you or the AI, someone eventually opens up a faction (it's always the AI), you can join one of the main ones if the AI beat you and start your own later, the latter I don't suggest because that makes the already dysfunctional social dynamic even worse... More on that later.Ship building is outright stupid, you level slowly, very slowly, especially compared to the AI, so this ""modular"" business is flat out bull****. if you fall behind in the level race, you'll NEVER be able to build a ship as large and imposing as the front line runners; because the number of connective modules you can use to expand your ship is controlled by your level. There's no such thing as a ""brimming to the bank corvette class gunship ship"" in this game, you spend your early levels building centipedes, and your later levels building fatter centipedes so you can incorporate fatter heads and podexes onto them. It's really very, very stupid. I can't reiterate that enough times, it's stupid. Later game, everything that is wrong really shines, you can obliterate another captain back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back and every time they come back (which is within seconds) they've gone up a level (or five) and have a MASSIVE ship with top tier parts all over it. I continued to win these battles until I was just being gang♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by threat level 90 dyads back-to-back-to-back-to-back-ad-nauseum. It didn't just get old, it got boring. And the amount of work you have to put into developing an alliance with another faction is beyond tedious; especially given that no matter what you do, even a faction you're on great terms with, will start to try to take over your territory. It's strange to have captains you've come to like, who have super positive affects with you (friend levels maxed out) start attacking you. Especially when they do it after you've given them THOUSANDS of salvage worth of materials and let them pillage your resources unmolested because ""sometimes friendship is about ignoring the other person's faults"". Right?SPAZ wasn't a 4x space game, SPAZ2 thinks it might want to be, but it isn't smart enough to get there. And it never will be. They'd have to scrap this PoS and start over to fix all the problems with it. Why they tossed a good design to make a subpar product I don't know, but I wish they hadn't done it.The thing about this game... The most irritating thing... you want to like it, and for a $20 game, it's pretty, not to mention it hails from a phenomenal predecessor, but really, it's like if Einstein had a slightly more attractive than him son who was an f'ing retard. Riding on Daddy's coattails might get him into college, Daddy's fame and Junior's good looks might get him some high quality tail in the beginning, but in then end, he's not what his dad was, he's just boring and useless.Save your $20 dollars, and don't let any of these idiots on steam steer you wrong. It's amazing to me how often a bad game gets all these bandwagon white knight types defending it, even though they don't like the damned game either. Just because the people that made this are a small entity doesn't excuse the game for being garbage, and only by letting them know ""this sucks, guys, sorry, but it really does"" are they going to realize they need to do something different. Don't let SPAZ as a franchise die from loving fanboism. Just admit this game blows goats, and possibly donkeys as well, MAYBE even a transvestite elephant on it's coke weekends... Because only through admitting it has a problem, can we start the healing process.			"

Early Access Review
								Space Pirates and Zombies came out of nowhere from MinMax Games came out of nowhere to deliver a great take on top-down shooting in a persistent universe, with zombies to boot. Since the game's release, the developers went dark to work on a sequel. Now with Space Pirates and Zombies 2, the developers are expanding on everything in the game and the early access version has a lot to like at the moment.Alone in the Void:Space Pirates and Zombies 2 (or SPAZ 2 for the rest of this post) continues the story from the last game. After stopping the zombie attack, humanity is now left fractured in the void with the precious resource REZ now in short supply. You play as the heroes from the last game that are now stuck wandering around trying to fight the infection wherever it might show up.As before, the universe remains persistent as various ships, factions and bandits are fighting for control of the area. In the last game, you had complete control over how you built your mother ship out and SPAZ 2 takes that a lot further.This time, your ship is completely modular; allowing you to remove and add pieces as you see fit. How it works is that sub cores allow you to grow out your ship; different parts can only be fitted in certain directions, for instance, engines can only be slotted from the bottom part of a sub core. As you add in more parts, the combined total of stats from everything will determine your ship's statistics and threat level, which is a measure of your abilities.Because your ship is modular, it also means that you can shoot pieces off of enemies or lose your own during combat. Later in, you'll find super-sized pieces that require more slots to fit and gives a whole new meaning to the term ""inventory tetras.""As you level up, you'll unlock the ability to equip more cores and in turn grow your ship and make it more powerful. The different modules come in different rarities and qualities that can be either found or bought at the various space stations.You can also hire strike fighters to join you in combat; switching between your ships or letting them do their own thing.In SPAZ 1, there was a sense of an emergent universe that moved without the player, and SPAZ 2 takes that even further.Making Friends and Enemies:In SPAZ 2, the void itself is made up of multiple factions and neutral captains trying to make a living. At the start of the game, you are free to explore at your leisure while the factions and other people make do. Factions and their captains will remember everything that you do and that will influence how they respond. Steal other captains' scavenge or fight factions and they will come to hate you and track you down; be good and help others and you may get backup during battles.As the game goes on, you'll be able to join a faction, start recruiting people and try to carve out your own little slice of the Void. Different factions specialize in different ship modules; giving you a chance of acquiring higher quality pieces from them. The spaceports will most likely grow, change hands or be destroyed over the course of a play; not of course mentioning when the titular zombies make an appearance.Once the zombies attack, the meta-game changes, as you try to create your faction and unite everyone else against the zombie attacks. Thanks to random places and the relationships of the captains, SPAZ 2's overall play can change with each new game.SPAZ 2 is definitely an example of a sequel going big with its design changes, and even at this point in early access there's a lot to like. With that said, there are some issues to talk about.Putting it All Together:From a design point of view, SPAZ 2 is already quite far along for an early access game; especially considering that they're expecting at least a year to stay in EA. With that said, there are some issues starting with the UI side of things. There are a lot of numbers and icons that could do with better explanations for the player. Information such as what impacts reload time, comparing two different modules, what's going on in the Void etc.I would like to see more variety in terms of designing your mother ship; perhaps sub cores that have different positions and more weapons beyond just the modifiers from the various factions. Weapons right now are set in the game, with the chance of having random bonuses to certain stats based on rarity; I really hope we see more variety as the game goes through early access.Moving modules around in a 3D space can be a bit cumbersome. They have added in a remove all option which helps, but it still can be a lengthy process to figure out how to build your ship or even what's a good design. I honestly have no idea what parts are better than others and have simply been going by the star measurement for rarity; not a good sign in a loot driven game. Your threat level is a good rating of how strong you are, but the game gives you no idea of how to improve it other than to just keep piling weapons on.As with the first game, SPAZ 2's early game can be a bit of a grind. You're going to be very weak and find that most captains can push you around. Until you can get to about threat level 20, your options are going to be quite limited. I found it was easier to simply get killed and reload the save, rather than fight a higher threat ship or pay out a bribe to keep them from attacking. Until you get yourself situated in the mid-game, the grinding for the needed resources and experience can be a bit frustrating.In the first SPAZ, I felt that the game bogged down a bit too much once the zombie infection began, and the same can be said of SPAZ 2.Once you start the actual fighting of the zombies, the grind rears its head once again. You'll need tons of scrap in order to upgrade your ports to the point where they can handle attacks and lots of experience in order to improve your ship so that it can stand toe-to-toe with the enemy.You'll find that player skill can only go so far, and there isn't much you can do against a ship who is higher than you in level by yourself.There is also further grind built into dealing with the zombie faction. Every time a zombie kills a captain, that captain joins the zombie faction; making them harder to deal with over time. The problem is that there is no way to reverse this trend; in my game, I was constantly harassed by an ever growing number of zombies and couldn't do anything about it or leave my area to do anything else. At this point, my suggestion would be to allow for more control or guidance of the AI; such as telling them to help you with attacks or team up against the zombies.Fixing Up:Space Pirates and Zombies 2 definitely shows dedication from the developers and features across the board improvements and changes from the original game. Most of the game design at this point is already fantastic; there just needs to be more polish and fine tuning to get everything firing on all cylinders. If the developers can clean up the UI and keep growing the game with more content and mechanics, this could be one very amazing game to play when it's finally done.For more on Space Pirates and Zombies 2, you can watch my playlist of it on the Game-Wisdom YouTube Channel.

								After playing a couple of hours, I'm struggling with my own opinion, I so much want to reccommend this game, but unfortunately I can't recommend a game that I don't want to play anymore or at least until it gets better.Adored the fist game, so maybe my expectations were too high for the sequel.Don't expect the same experience as in Spaz 1.+For a game made by a very small team, great and colorful graphics.+Galactic map is fun (Although more types of missions/events would be nice)+Game kept the Derpy character that made the charm of the first Spaz.+Arena fights are nice practice zones.-Combat feels odd and sluggish.-Still not sure if the move to 3d was warranted, I think it actualy slowed the pacing of the game.-Upgrade system has been changed, gives you less choices to upgrade your fleet.-Strike crafts feel either useless or overpowed. They either get destroyed quickly or they destroy the ennemy before you even get to the fight with your lumbering mothership.-Customization of ship gets tedious when you get to higher levels.-You can customize your mothership, but not your strike crafts.-Very little looting in combat zones (Hope this will get better since this is early access)I think I'm gonna reinstall Spaz 1 and come back to the sequel later in hopes it gets better with time.

								When I finally heard about Spaz 2 is about to get release, I couldn't wait for it since when the first trailer video got released probably 2 years ago or little bit less.This is pretty huge step from first Spaz game and from top 2d spacebattle game into 3D space naval battle and ship design.Even if it is on EA, most of the game is finished, like singleplayer and sandbox mode, only things that are needed in here are the little bit tuning on the game and other needed parts.So far I played this game literally over 8 hour on nonstop and until I realize how long I was playing, it was already over 5:00 AM, that's how much I enjoy this game and it is pretty addicting, since I am pretty much been trying to aim to create my perfect multipurpose mothership for anything.So far what I think of this game, it is great, I just love it and hope to see more of it when you get new ideas to it.

								Having put well over 50 hours into this game, and after having watched it develop over the last six months or so, I really feel I've gotten my money's worth from it. The developers are on the ball when it comes to updates, and the game has gotten better and better. Version 0.8 has introduced many of the ships from the original Spaz into the game as customizable sidekicks, and hunting down blueprints for upgrading has added a whole new reason for me to blow up more ships. Not that additional reasons were all that necessary, as I found even the previous versions of the game to be exceptionally well-polished for a beta release. I have high expectations for the final, finished product, though I believe that people can have a solid amount of fun with the game even in it's current not-yet-complete state. Keep up the great work, devs, your effort both noted and appreciated.			"

								Played for 19 hours and beat the main story so it has plenty of play time. If you like spaz or even games like sea battles in ships then this is your game. I came in just after they added strike craft and I couldn't imagine the game without them, they just add so much to it. Ship building is fun to play around with and the way things are level locked keeps the introduction of new things going at a fairly stable pace (leveling is pretty fast if you join battles to fight pirates and the like). I also like the faction system and how the other pilots all have thier own agenda and do thier own thing just like you. The galaxy just feels so alive. Building and managing your own faction was a cool experience with capturing a system, building a base, recruiting other captains and just evolving your faction in genera, plus having 10-40k scrap show up at your capital starbase every so often is a great help. I can't think of anything else to say cos i'm tired but in short, a good buy.TL,DR SPAZ GOOD, SPAZ 2 BETTER			"

								Let me just start by saying this game is pretty differant from the first one, and its a good thing, they have really made a great follow up to SPAZ with the second installment. Combat is very fun and rewarding, the story is entertaining and flows well and the controls and star map are really well put together. If you havent played the first game jumping right into this one is no big deal. Great game and if they support this as well as they did the first its only going to get better from here.			"

								Really like this game, just missing end game depth. Once you have the best items things get boring real quick.The main quest is poor and basicly consists of all the things you do in sandbox mode, nothing special added ....Combat is good and fun, but really lacks tactic depth. Once you figure out how things works it comes down to flying arround and boosting shields at the right moment, the autotarget does everything for you.Get this game for 15-20 hours of fun and keep your fingers crossed waiting for the multiplayer.

								I am a long time player of SPAZ and SPAZ 2 I played the former before it came to steam and have played SPAZ 2 a lot offline and online. There are a lot of differences between the games and I would say both are gems with a good dev. I know there are a lot of rage reviews at the moment and I am writing this to give balance to them. Yes I can see a lot of people understandably being disapointed about the MP but if you are looking for a unique and fun singleplayer game you could not go far wrong with this.Pros - Great game play variation, Fun quirky sense of humor, Good visuals, Fun and a lot of replayability,Cons - No MP if ur wanting it (not something I am worried about). AI comments and audio gets annoying after a hearing the same things repeated a lot. Overall get the game and have fun. I dont think you could go far wrong giving it a try. "

								Even though I had accepted that SPAZ 2 was not supposed to be a direct sequel to SPAZ 1, I was unfortunately unable to enjoy the game.I couldn't see the same kind of quirky humour and the graphical style just seemed completely different, even ignoring the fact that one is 3D and the other 2D. I'm mostly thinking of menus, icons, ship styles, etc. The large difference in the style of sounds and soundscapes and music so on, also really put me off, but I guess that comes down to personal expectation.As for the gameplay, the combat was ok, but it felt like a weird mini-game that the game almost doesn't need. If the combat was resolved on a stastistic, tactical level, it would have made no difference, especially since the main game action takes place in the ""empire"" view.The resource management stuff seemed alright, but I just couldn't get too excited about anything in particular. Again, I think this mostly comes down to styling choices and personal expectation of consistency in styling (with the previous game). I also couldn't feel that each resource felt important, on a gameplay level, even though in a more lore-oriented view each resource was made to sound very important, especially Rez with its decline in availability.The ship designing felt a bit confusing (regarding part quality and placement availability), but not difficult - perhaps it felt too simple.From what I could see, the lore was expanded from the first game in a decent way - it mostly felt like there was a natural flow to the story-related stuff.I can't recommend the game on a personal level because it just felt bland and boring - and I did try to enjoy it, as I was genuinely interested in the gameplay at first, but it just didn't keep my attention. It didn't help that I kept getting the feeling that the game was being more dramatised than it needed to be (for myself).			"

Early Access Review
								As a fan of SPAZ 1 i really had to get this game as well,for obvious reasons i was not disappointed.It is still early access and despite that it runs great for me. The game died twice within 17H Gameplay and for a early access game that is really neat, best part is that none of the data was lost and the game starts up fast even without a SSD.So this ain't bugging me.The combat is really epic, at first you start out trying to get the hang of the game and be friendly to everyone cause you are just a small time cruiser. Attacking bandits or ganging up on bandits with others to increase the chance of survival. Good part, the one you fought along with remembers you and might just aid you in your next battle. As well as everyone around you, despite what you done, either likes or dislikes you then. But weirdly enough nobody minds you killing other spaceships as long as they are in no faction.The more you carry with you, the slower you are! But i dont mind cause i run on Eco-Mode. Slow but barely and rez gets used along the way. Besides the battles come to me, and there was one time when it really paid off carrying all that parts with me. There were 3 Captains ganging up on me, and i kept losing the battle but i kept loading the autosave.  After each battle i switched some parts trying another strategy and build to ensure my victory. After 3 Loses i finally build an decent build that can take on any ship as long as i play it safe (more like beserker though XD)Once you took down their shield and you still got yours, its time to go full throttle and take him on! Keep going  to separate target from the group and drive it into some asteroids or space waste as you keep shooting it.Just when its about to go down, Brake and make a run for it as you give it the final strike cause you dont want to keep hugging the space ship when its about to explode right'?It's a epic new kind of SPAZ, its different, yes, but who says it needs to be exactly the same as spaz 1'? If you love spaz one you go play that.Its early access and the devs keep working on it and its up to you how it changes, if you have ideas, post em up. If you things you dislike share it with them. They are a really great team and while the developement might be running slow, its getting there!Ion SRM are great for taking out their shields from afar , you can then dash in and get that lethal strike on it. Explosive warheads are also very nice! The Cannons and the impact from hitting it with your ship will do the trick really.Seeing your enemy go down and explode is highly satisfying!If you still don't know if you should get it, take a look at their 50min+ gameplay or watch some lets plays if there are some. Or just dive right into it and get a taste yourself.i Personally love the game :D			"

								I started playing Space Pirates And Zombies 2 last night and did 7 hours straight. I couldn't stop even if I wanted to. For a two-man dev team and being in early access, this is a really enjoyable, polished experience. If you liked FTL, think of this as a version with gorgeous 3D graphics and sound.The space battles are where this game shines. Its a third person battlefield where you have to position your ship to utilise it's firepower. You also have support fighters that will assist you. Through battles and exploration you discover scrap and equipment to upgrade your ship.You can also design your ship, which is alot of fun. Although at the start your options are pretty limited. It's based on a lego system essentially. You have different looking blocks, which do different things and you get to decide how they're bolted together.I havent played the first game in the series, but my understanding is that this is quite a departure from it, so you might want to check those differences out before buying.A really impressive game for an Early Access title and its only at version 0.7 currently. If the theme is something you enjoy, you should definitely check this out.			"

Then you can create your own wild universe!*This is early access.  The Devs are still hard at work coding in new features, but they are taking their time to do it right, not rush it.  If you loved the original SPAZ, give this a go.  Just remember - it's a shattered universe.  It's your turn to have fun picking up the pieces and building a better one.

Early Access Review
								I enjoyed playing SPAZ2.In short: There is a lot going on in SPAZ2 with some awkward UI with a notable learning curve but that doesn't get in the way of blasting at pirates and zombies with a great deal of freedom of choice.- - - -Lots of running around and getting into trouble without having to worry so much about fixed linear mission progression or moral railroading. Be nice and help or go bad with raids and piracy. In the end, you're still going to have to face off with a terribly aggressive horde of zombies.In some sense the game feels a little bit like a puzzler where you have to toy with ship configurations to thump the common tactical problems you'd face given the limited parts you're able to gather together. Balancing out offense is tricky at first but after some practice it starts to become clear and rewarding. The higher strategy map where the various other captains compete and or cooperate is large enough to feel immense but contained and easy to comprehend.While I would have liked to see more depth in the way the other captains build relationships with you and the others and despite the somewhat predictable actions they take; it's a fun sandbox of AI agents running around with you. The zombies have a one track mind and the other captains don't organise well, given that the end is nigh! So I feel like you're kind of on the hook for saving the galaxy (again) with whatever wingmen and resources you can muster... which is kind of the point and you'll feel the squeeze as the game progresses.The UX is a little bit of a slog for handling some fact finding like looking up what other captains are up to etc... but you can easily enough ignore most of the AI v AI and faction relations and focus on your local swarm of ships. There are also some UI secret handshakes that are not terribly intuitive but this doesn't hold back the fundamental joy in wandering around in an open ended RPG/tactical game. Pew pew pew!Overall, a thumbs up.			"

Early Access Review
								I finished the main campaign and played a few sandbox games as well.  This is an early access review.  I'll update it once the game comes out or changes significantly. If you're anything like me you spent 100+ hours in the original SPAZ.  You loved the combat, the ship customization, and applying those with tactics in real battles.  It was a nice place to experiment with ships as you were constantly finding blueprints from your downed enemies.  The creators have said they didn't want to create a direct sequel in terms of gameplay.  And they haven't.   Let me give you the positives first.   + Game looks great.  They've clearly spent a lot of time on this.  + Controller support.+ New galaxy map has potential.+ You can create your own ships.  The interface for doing so is a little clunky.  It'll probably get better.+ You can create your own faction.  + Weapon attacks look really cool.+ AI captains who rememebr things.+ physics seem more polished.  You can ram ships and it sort of feels right when you knock off a piece you had a direct impact on.+ Not incredibly buggy.  Never crashed for me, never found anything broken.Negatives:- The tractor beam that you manually control.  We can only hope they come to their senses and change this back to automatic.   The sad thing is there's tons of useless things to tractor beam.   Like rocks and explosive containers.  The game doesn't have that same explosion of loot from enemies the original had in terms of data, goons, and rez.  Now it's almost all done outside of battle.   But he few things the tractor beam is used for-- my god.  Just wait until you see the annoyance of having parts of your ship knocked off and trying to tractor beam them back on during combat.   You're better off just reloading the game and figuring out a way to win without losing shields.- I hate the new loot system.  Getting random parts with random weapons.   It's one step foward and two steps back.  You're going to love creating your own ships, you're just going to be sad that no matter how much effort you put into it they always look kinda ugly unless you get incredibly lucky or want to sacrifice combat ability for looks.   They went away from the system where you can place weapons into hardened points on the ship.  I would have loved to see that here with the random parts that have random stats -- hardened points to place weapons you scavange or find.   -  Battles are more chaotic.  Feels less strategic and more dumbed down.  Hard to figure out the weapons the enemy has or where you should target to disable them.   This is partially because there's no ship designs you can recognise.  Just heaps of random weapons.-  The escort ships (many straight from SPAZ1) are underwhelming and a chore.  They explode easily, you can't really customize them, and the enemy escorts can be a major time sink and annoyance without adding much challenge.-  Arena is overpowered.  I personally don't like arena, never did.  But maybe you like arena, but it's too rewarding and one of the only things you can do without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥different factions off.  So you just end up flying from sector to sector getting free resources and xp.   You probably can get your first 20 out of 40 levels just doing this.  Maybe more.-  The focus on creating your own faction falls flat.  Really grindy, impossible to figure out what your AI allies will do.   For example, if you attack an enemy with your allies around they may help, or they may ignore you and it results in a 1v3 unwinnable fight.   There's no way to marshall them -- and it all ends up being rather pointless.  Remember mass effect 3 and gather allies throughout the game to increase your faction strength?  Yeah, about as pointless. Early access quirks: +- Voice acting isn't done yet.+- Balance on weapons is really bad.+- AI needs a lot of work.+- Economic model needs tuning.All in all, this is the product of a lot of time and love.  I have no doubt the creators will keep going and polish this up.  I'm happy to have supported them especially given the hundreds of hours of enjoyment from their first installment.   Unfortunately, due to their responses to critisism so far I have no expectation that they are going to budge on many of the controversial aspects of their changes from SPAZ1.   For that reason, I can't recommend this game at this time.  It simply for me was a bit of a chore  to play and a disappointing culmination of waiting half a decade for another installment.			"

								I was a huge fan of the original game, and loved the fleet command and collecting all the different ship types. Sadly all that is out the window now and you only control one ship, and damn does it look ugly! I appreciate that the developers wanted to try something new, but this is a radical departure from the original.The way the game plays now is more like rebel galaxy, but without the cool looking ships and broadside style combat that was so fun in that game. I think the closest comparison that springs to mind when thinking about the differences between SPAZ and SPAZ 2  is the way Fallout 1+2 were squad based rpgs, and Fallout 3 was a kind of fps single character game to go for the cod market. Sad, as I've been waiting for SPAZ 2 literally for years, so it's very disappointing to find it doesn't include the things I loved about the original...			"

								Just finished the main campaign on the default difficulty and had a great time.  I have over 100 hours in the original SPAZ and loved it.  I heartily recommend this one; despite what other reviews are saying there are a lot of similarities to the original and most of the changes are improvements.  I find combat to be MUCH more fun in this and that's where you'll be spending a majority of your time.  PROS:*Graphics are really awesome and it's fun (and difficult if you have a massive warship) to navigate around all the supernovas *Sound is great, voice acting desperately needs to be implemented soon!*More strategy involved in the dog fighting than the original due to the ability to boost shields/reload at will*Less grindy..I actually found it a little too easy on normal difficulty to get partsCONS: STILL IN EARLY ACCESS SO SUBJECT TO CHANGE*The allied fleet on the starmap (tactical view) could use some tweaks to their AI.  Fully upgraded outposts constantly getting wiped out and have trouble getting my allies to join me for big battles even when I set them to wingman mode sometimes they refuse to engage in my battlesFinal word:  I was playing this before it even launched and love it.If you enjoy upgrades and dogfighting space battles with lots of pretty explosions get this game.

								SPAZ 2 is a great sequel to SPAZ it's combat is vastly different with you flying the mothership rather than the strike craft however you still can fly the strike craft. The combat is fun, easy to learn and you can even change to a top down view like the old SPAZ game if you prefer that. Also you are able to build your own empire with the ability to assign other captains of your own faction to the stations to manage them, however in late game against zombies if your stations are upgraded your stations are literally sitting ducks. In my opinion 9/10 with my only issue being the synthesized voices being slightly creepy however you can disbable this at any times in the opitions menu.			"

								I don't care about others opions.  SPAZ(WBH) was one of my favorite games of all times.  SPAZ 2 is solid, this my favorite kind of game.  There's more to add, It can be explanded on but the nuts and bolts are sound.  Would I recommend it? Does it really matter if I do? No, i'll buy it again and force it on others.			"

Early Access Review
								as the spiritual successor to SPAZ 1, this game definitely delivers, even if it's in a mostly different style.the 3D battles are exhilirating and being able to ram ships and fling debris at each other is just awesome! there are some limitations, but the devs are looking at ways to improve on the general formula.the real-time starmap is also very engaging, and as a drastic change to the SPAZ 1 starmap, i think it is very nicely implemented. similarly, some of the less attractive elements are being looked at by the devs -- specifically the tutorials and campaign quests.overall, it was a great experience. may have taken a while to get used to how different everything is (imo, the game is only about 10-20% similar to SPAZ 1, and most of that is because the characters were carried over). but i'm glad i took a while to get into the game, and i must say i love it.if you want more of the same SPAZ 1 experience, i don't blame you. but there are already lots of mods which expanded on the SPAZ 1 experience, so imo i'm glad SPAZ 2 is so different and amazing in its own way. a gentle reminder: the game IS in early access, so i fully expect many more changes -- especially the eventual implementation of multiplayer! the devs have been exceptionally engaged in the forums, so there is a real sense of co-development going on with early adopters. if you want to give your input, i fully recommend buying in now. but if you prefer to play safe and wait for the full release, i'm sure you won't be disappointed either.10/10 will ram an infected ship again for double K.O.my hands feel like two balloons.

Early Access Review
								I finished the main campaign and played a few sandbox games as well.  This is an early access review.  I'll update it once the game comes out or changes significantly. If you're anything like me you spent 100+ hours in the original SPAZ.  You loved the combat, the ship customization, and applying those with tactics in real battles.  It was a nice place to experiment with ships as you were constantly finding blueprints from your downed enemies.  The creators have said they didn't want to create a direct sequel in terms of gameplay.  And they haven't.   Let me give you the positives first.   + Game looks great.  They've clearly spent a lot of time on this.  + Controller support.+ New galaxy map has potential.+ You can create your own ships.  The interface for doing so is a little clunky.  It'll probably get better.+ You can create your own faction.  + Weapon attacks look really cool.+ AI captains who rememebr things.+ physics seem more polished.  You can ram ships and it sort of feels right when you knock off a piece you had a direct impact on.+ Not incredibly buggy.  Never crashed for me, never found anything broken.Negatives:- The tractor beam that you manually control.  We can only hope they come to their senses and change this back to automatic.   The sad thing is there's tons of useless things to tractor beam.   Like rocks and explosive containers.  The game doesn't have that same explosion of loot from enemies the original had in terms of data, goons, and rez.  Now it's almost all done outside of battle.   But he few things the tractor beam is used for-- my god.  Just wait until you see the annoyance of having parts of your ship knocked off and trying to tractor beam them back on during combat.   You're better off just reloading the game and figuring out a way to win without losing shields.- I hate the new loot system.  Getting random parts with random weapons.   It's one step foward and two steps back.  You're going to love creating your own ships, you're just going to be sad that no matter how much effort you put into it they always look kinda ugly unless you get incredibly lucky or want to sacrifice combat ability for looks.   They went away from the system where you can place weapons into hardened points on the ship.  I would have loved to see that here with the random parts that have random stats -- hardened points to place weapons you scavange or find.   -  Battles are more chaotic.  Feels less strategic and more dumbed down.  Hard to figure out the weapons the enemy has or where you should target to disable them.   This is partially because there's no ship designs you can recognise.  Just heaps of random weapons.-  The escort ships (many straight from SPAZ1) are underwhelming and a chore.  They explode easily, you can't really customize them, and the enemy escorts can be a major time sink and annoyance without adding much challenge.-  Arena is overpowered.  I personally don't like arena, never did.  But maybe you like arena, but it's too rewarding and one of the only things you can do without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥different factions off.  So you just end up flying from sector to sector getting free resources and xp.   You probably can get your first 20 out of 40 levels just doing this.  Maybe more.-  The focus on creating your own faction falls flat.  Really grindy, impossible to figure out what your AI allies will do.   For example, if you attack an enemy with your allies around they may help, or they may ignore you and it results in a 1v3 unwinnable fight.   There's no way to marshall them -- and it all ends up being rather pointless.  Remember mass effect 3 and gather allies throughout the game to increase your faction strength?  Yeah, about as pointless. Early access quirks: +- Voice acting isn't done yet.+- Balance on weapons is really bad.+- AI needs a lot of work.+- Economic model needs tuning.All in all, this is the product of a lot of time and love.  I have no doubt the creators will keep going and polish this up.  I'm happy to have supported them especially given the hundreds of hours of enjoyment from their first installment.   Unfortunately, due to their responses to critisism so far I have no expectation that they are going to budge on many of the controversial aspects of their changes from SPAZ1.   For that reason, I can't recommend this game at this time.  It simply for me was a bit of a chore  to play and a disappointing culmination of waiting half a decade for another installment.			"

Early Access Review
								I love it!If you played SPAZ1 before, you'll learn that the game setting is the same, but the gameplay is quite a lot diferent. The emphasis is a lot more on trading and looting. The combat is a lot more automated (I really needed automatically aiming cannons in the first game) but still needs a lot of your strategy and effort. I enjoyed seeing the old characters again, however they did totally change Mackenzies character - he was 300% more awesome in the first game.If you haven't played the first game - there's no need to, the story is included in this game as collectible data. The game has a nice tutorial to get you started. The ship designing/building is a very interesting core mechanic of the game, you can basically design your own playstyle. The gameplay on the map is pretty engaging too, making you think how to better deploy your faction or how to hinder the growth of other factions. It's sad that the game doesn't have commands for your captains to tell them where to go, other than setting bounties on targets.Note that this game requires somewhat beefy computer to run well on major battles (it runs smoothly, but slowly). My laptop failed to handle even regular gameplay (if you want to play game somewhat like this on a brick, play SPAZ1).Really nice game overall, some minor flaws, but nothing too dramatic.8/10(could be 9, but I was quite disappointed about Mackenzie).

								I came into this game from the first SPAZ, expecting to get an improvement on the original, or at the very least more of the same, but I've sadly gotten neither.SPAZ 2, to me, feels like a lesser version of SPAZ 1 in pretty much every respect.Everything from the combat to the progression system to the ship customization has been neutered.If you're a fan of SPAZ 1, you will most likely be disappointed by this game.

								A good return to SPAZ, almost too good now that it needs a slightly more serious title! My only concern is that it is a little too short, I've just about completed it in under 20 hours. The ""universe"" feels 15-20 times smaller than the original, but that could just be because it's still in development. Worth buying if you're a fan of the original, worth keeping on your wishlist if not.			"

Early Access Review
								I’m normally an early access skeptic, I still am, for the most part, but this game has made me think a bit harder before completely boycotting early access games. I would go as far to say that this game might be more functional and complete than some games that are released as completed products, minus the voice acting for some of the roles. Having said that the team is communicating very well with its customers about their plans for future updates and it seems to me like the money they are receiving is going to good use.Some of the more negative comments about this game seem to dwell on the fact that the game is a far cry from the original S.P.A.Z 1 title and honestly they are not wrong, it is very different. But the way I am looking at it is that S.P.A.Z 2 is like a reboot, like Batman, there are many iterations of Batman and each one is different to the other. That’s what these games are like, they both have their merits and I would not give this game a bad review because it isn’t like the first, in fact I commend the designers for taking a huge leap as they have done here.S.P.A.Z 1 is still awesome, its still in my heart, but I am completely hooked on S.P.A.Z 2 right now!This game is a wise investment, of time and money. I will be keeping an eye out for other tittles from this company for sure.			"

Give this game 2 hours of you're time and you'l go on to at least play 20 - 30 hours no problem the depth and graphics are incredible considering the size of the game and that brings me to my last point performance, no issues what so ever even on the largest battles.

								SPAZ2 is a excellent game which satisfies the craving for the carnage that can only come from two massive vessels pounding each other into nothingness.  It's 3D combat situated on a 2D plane reminds me of the old game series Starfleet Command.  Options abound for how to build and equip your ship, as well as how you go about establishing yourself in the galaxy.Perhaps the best aspect of the game though, is its developers.  Despite being a very small ( only 2 people I believe) team, they manage to show more involvement with the community of fans than do many large AAA titles.  They also make effort to try and encorporate the fans wants into the game.			"

								The team does great work publishing updates to improve he quality of the game. While still in early access, I would say it is a good purchase. Fly your mothership in a faux 3D setting, accompanied by strike vessels, and battle space pirates as well as a zombie infection. Be a member of a faction while other captains vie for dominance. And when you are ready, create your own faction and rise to the top!Great levels of customizability through various ship parts, part sizes, and many styles of weaponry (offensive and defensive). On top of that, the parts themselves can lean towards shields, armor, or hull strength to add more variety.			"

								Playing SPAZ 2 is like watching Rambo: First Blood Part 2 after watching First Blood. It's very different from it's predecessor: watered down, mindless, just with added fluff and pretty lights. You may even want a refund on your cinema ticket, screaming: ""What the ♥♥♥♥ was that all about?""It's a very different game than the first. In it's own right, however, it's dull, repetitive and generic, anyway. Ships are made up like wads of random lego blocks stuck together by a blind man who loves to spray his ""creations"" with neon paint after he slaps them together in his drunken stupor.Gone is the reverse engineering in order to fly ships, now replaced with mindless hoarding of ""modules"" (AKA grey cubes with pretty lights stuck on them), be it from salvage or the many (almost identical) shops scattered around the flat, uneventful map. In combat, you'll fly these ships that look like the satanic coupling of lego blocks and cancerous tumours in glorious 3D this time around! ...Although it's not really 3D as you fly your freakish abomination of a ship around on a 2D plane and fire a small selection of weapons that require little more than button bashing to use effectively.... no wait I take it back: you can hold the mouse button continuously and it will achieve an even better result. Go you!I'm disappointed with this game. It's just plain crap. Play the first. If you already have played the first, play it again. Just like First Blood: Part 2, it was a mistake to make it, let alone make it this badly.			"

								I was hesitant at first glance to purchase this game, at full price none the less.  Many of the early access games have been plauged with broken updates or dev's that disapear.I was going to wait for it to go on sale but could restrain my self no more.  My curiousity was peaked.  18 hours later....  Damned zombies still trying to take my space!    NO!!! BAD,  ZOMBIES!!  BAD!!!  This is a piece of art!Brilliant story driven gameplay, i personally love the ""Voice acting"" ( Or lack there of ) lol.  It is almost fitting for the era and almost helps to delve into the scene a little more, with its cyber-roughish attitude, i feel computer generated voices are appropriate for many of the characters!Horribly awsome jokes, quirky crew, and a delicious managerie of lore that helps piece it all together.I cant say i have found a game with a good story in a while. ( Or with a story at all )The gameplay is smooth and has a nice tactical importance applied.Satisfying grinds that fell more like gaming than, oh this♥♥♥♥♥♥again. There are few things that need to be fixed , but its a stable .exe and does not crash.I think the ship construction could be a little more stream line, at least the option in the shop window to equip something.  It gets frustrating sometimes to add just one thing.Last but not least.My new favorite game!  XD Heroin is what the devs made this game with.  ( or some kind of drug...)This game is well worth 20$ plus a blow job.Good work!!!			"

								I was a huge fan of SPAZ1 - but I have to say, this game just isn't ready yet if you're hoping for a worthy sequel.The game pairs an interesting - if flawed - overworld/economics simulation with a new, and -very- clunky combat system. Building bases, trading, and persistent pilots with memories makes for an interesting rep-manipulation game, but it's too easily exploitable with mechanics like the Arena, and confusingly implemented - why is the faction leader's opinion the only one that actually matters? Many of the niggling issues with the overworld (such as suicidal neutral pilots that respawn and try to kill you hundreds of times) are sure to be fixed, but I'm not so sure what can be done about the combat system. Ship controls are slow and clunky, many mechanics (like weapon line of sight and mounting) go completely unexplained, weapon charge, range, and reload times are invisible to the player, and - most bafflingly of all - the game includes a ""battle wagon"" mode that is inarguably superior to ever manually aiming yourself, with 100% accuracy and innate knowledge of all optimal weapon ranges. I simply can't understand why this mode exists except to compensate for wildly inadequate manual-firing UI. As things are now, the game has its fun moments once you begin to work things out, but it's never better than clunky at best, and massively lacks the feeling of a -world- or satisfying combat that spaz1 had. Can this change with time? I hope so. We'll see. I'll update this review as development progresses.			"

								Remember when Sonic made the jump from 2D to 3D? SPAZ 2 is a lot like that. It's okay in its own rights which is why I'm giving it a recommendation, but if you're a fan of the original and expected it to be expanded upon, you'll be sorely disappointed.			"

								I loved Spaz 1. and i love spaz 2 though there are a lot of differences. the 3D adds a LOT to spaz 2 and it feels awesome. Spaz 2 is a LOT less grindy but it is also a lot less responsive. you make ur ship out of parts, that means there are no preset ships that you then have to tinker with. it is fun but it means it will take a while to get to a ship you want AND it is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to change ship layout. Maybe being able to save different ship layouts could fix this problem. There are other problems with the game but i suggest you look at the more lengty reviews for that. i am here to say that the game's core is amazing but it needs tweeking. And guess what? the devs are amazing and are always looking to improve. it is early access! this is where the community can make this ""good"" game into a ""great cult classic"". i will be there. will you? Buy it if you want to support this great game!			"

								This is definitely one of my top favorite games of all time. I played the first game and fell in love with it almost immediately. Then I bought this game for myself and my little brother and we decided that, should multiplayer come out, we would play together any chance we could just like we did when we were kids. I'm currently halfway accross the world right now and everytime I see this game in my library I'm reminded of the days when I was back home in my parents house playing online games with my brother.The fact that these developers take the time to actually listen to those that play it is amazing in itself and i take pride to say that this game is the first game I've ever felt the need to review.Great job Minmax, I look forward to the games you'll produce.

								I didn't even wait or bother to read reviews before picking this up as I have the original and know that the devs will work hard to make it a great game.It is well worth the price and your support.The game is different from the first SPAZ.  It still has the same feel, same characters.  The ships you flew before are now part of your strike craft (fleet) and you can build a custom mothership (which is not your base anymore, but your main attack ship) out of modules.The combat has moved to 3D..ish.  I myself like the style of the new combat.  You can go top down though I find it a bit short ranged right now.  You can go into a third person view that allowes you to move around and fight the other ships.  There is no up or down, all ships are on the same level...almost like if you were fighting on the ground.  I actually like this as most fully spherical 3D space shooters just make it difficult for me to keep track of other craft I'm shooting at.They have added a strategy element to it as well.  There are tons of NPC factions that you can befriend....or just destroy.  You can join a factoin then build your own starbase as well.  It also looks like there will be multiplayer, thought it is not in game yet.  Already very playable for an early access game.  My one dislike is that the modular ship building system is very annoying right now.  You ""tractor"" which is like magnetic your parts to your ship...and they always seem to go flying about and not stick where I want them.  I hope this system will be altered to be a bit more user friendly.  This still won't stop me from playing even if it stays this way as it is only a small part of the game.I know this game will be finished and continue to be upgraded as the devs have done a great job with the original and are already working on the items the community are talking about in the early access.

Early Access Review
								Alright, I was looking forward to this game since I found out it existed! (Sometime around September 2015 I believe)Played a BUNCH of the original, and loved every moment of it. My favorite part of the original was its spirit, the comedy that went into every mission, every interaction between characters. The whole ""The hull has been breached and the Science is leaking out!"" sums it up rather nicely IMO.This game, the second, while it plays a great deal differently, captures the same spirit. I'm very much looking forward to when voice actors are chosen and get to bring the characters truly to life.To describe the gameplay, one must look at the two aspects of the game: The Universe map and the battle maps. I've taken to comparing the Universe map to the Mount and Blade series, in how it behaves. You've got yourself roaming the map, able to side with whichever faction you please, and eventually create your own faction. Captains (Lords from Mount and Blade) roam the map as well, and can deal with the factions as they please as well.The battle map is something on its own, with two camera angles. Either you can do a third person view (I HIGHLY recommend turning the positional controls off, as you steer in relation to the camera with them on, rather than in relation to your ship with them off) Or you can go in the top/down style the original was in. Given the 3d models and the way they've set this game up, it seems built to play with the third person camera.Add to that a customizeable ship, and some strange and entertaining captain names and you'll have yourelf some great fun!

								This is not the greatest game in the world, but it is still one of the best I have played this year.But if you are looking for a sci-fi strategy shooter, with hundreds of customizable options and constantly changing overworld, then this is the game for you.If you have played the first game, some of the weapons and battle tactics will seem familier and come back naturally. But this game forces you to improvise. You don't get the luxery of picking your battles. More powerful ships will hunt you down. You have to get clever, make choices you didnt think would work.An example, spoiler free. I was faced with two higher level enemy ships. I did not have the time or resources to run away, and in my hurry to escape I accidently destroyed my only way out. I was left with two options. Reload, or fight. I chose to fight, and decided to try ramming. I have then since used this tactic and built my ships around the ability to ram. I have won many battles that left me outgunned and outnumbered, because I chose to ram the enemy into asteroids and explosives. The downside is I spend a lot in fixing my ship.I think the ability to customize your ship to suit your tactics is the best part of this game. Taking the story mode is sugguested heavily, since they don't hand hold, but they will teach you important aspects of the game as they become relevant. I am very rarely seeing an event and wondering why since everything was explained carefully.I have waited for years for this game since I loved playing the first one. I am sad to say, that I will not be playing the first game anymore. There is no aspect of the first game that I miss because this second one either exceeds what it did before or enhanced it. The game is more fun and more enjoyable with all these events to do and take care of.			"

Early Access Review
								I was a big fan of the first SPAZ, and this sequel carries over all the things I loved from the first game.Without giving away any spoiler (of which there are a few big ones, and a few I haven't encountered yet): there's third-person space combat, ship customization, exploration, resource management, diplomacy, and persistent pilots across the galaxy. It's a ton of good content for a game still in early access, and you can tell that the devs put a lot of love into their product.Some highlights:SPACE COMBATSpace combat is in a 3rd person view. You move your mouse to direct your weapons that aren't automatically firing. The automatic fire, or ""war wagon"" toggle mode, is actually pretty intelligent. At first I thought I should direct all of my ship's weapons to conserve my capacitor banks, but then I realized that the other side of my ship wasn't firing because they didn't have a solution on the thing I was shoot at. As a result, I turned on on ""war wagon"" mode. Now all those weapons without a solution are annihilating the fighters zooming around my ship.Combat kind of has a rock-paper-scissors element to it, but it goes ""take down the shields, then either destroy the enemy ship's hull or blow off the components off that ship first"". You have weapons that specialize in either destroying shields, destroying armor (which basically means you can blow components off ships), and destroying the hull of an enemy ship to make it go big boom.My only grievance is that there can only be 4 capital ships in a battlefield at once. On the main map, you'll get these instances where a bunch of ships swarm to scavenge a battlesite, and they start fighting each other in 4's. I think it would be much more enjoyable if battles could reach a fleet scale, though I understand if technical limitations exist.SHIP CUSTOMIZATIONYour ""ship"" is actually just a core component upon which you snap other components on. As you level up, you get more ""cores"", or components that make up the spine of the ship. It's on these cores that you snap nose pieces, wings, and engines. Each nose, wing, and engine piece has a weapon on it, while the cores lack weapons. Some components may take up two or three core connections, but those are reserved for more powerful weapons.Overall customization is pretty cool. Rarer ship components add bonuses to your ship stats (health, shields, speed, turning, etc.), but they don't change your weapon stats like RoF or damage. On one hand, that's nice - the weapons you find on a level 5 ship are the same weapons on a level 30 ship, but there's more of them, and as a pilot levels up then those weapons do more damage.EXPLORATIONThis aspect of the game is bare. It basically goes like this: is there a black area on your map? Go there and see if there's something for you to ""scan"". If you can, scan it. You will be rewarded with a snippet of the story (with a slick animation) and some resources.There's also some points in each sector that can give you Rez, goons, or scrap over time. Other ships will stop at these points and gather resources accordingly. Starbases in the same sector can also gather those resources.RESOURCE MANAGEMENTYou have three different resources: Rez (your ship's fuel), scrap (general currency), and goons (the red shirts on your ship). You can't have too much of the first two, but if you have too many goons then you start chewing through Rez at an accelerated rate.--- SPOILERS ---When you get to starbases, then resource management really takes off. Now you have either 1 starbase (early in the story) or many starbases (later in the story), and they all accumulate resources that you can take for yourself. This is a neat mechanic that moves the game away from you being a one-man show to leading an empire. "

SPAZ2 however is received with expectation, something which will always leave people dissapointed and sadly that group will always make the most noise.As the game progressed I started to see it is actually waay better than the first. (I remember the grind needed to finish insane difficulty...)I expected SPAZ 1.5 and had to give 2 another look, a fresh perspective and I'm very pleased with the result.			"

								edit: I made a few ""black and white"" statements that people in the comments have rightfully called me out on. I've edited the review to reflect this.edit 2: I've been told its ""completely different"" from spaz 1, I disagree. Make of it as you will.SPAZ 2 takes the idea's of SPAZ 1 and builds on them, with an improved interface and a cool over-world ""space map"". If you liked the ship building and fighting SPAZ 1, SPAZ 2 takes that and brings it to the next level with a fully modular ship-building system. Gone are the hardpoints and hull types... In is a fully custom shipbuilding. Full review:


YouTube™ Video: Space Pirates and Zombies 2 - Early Axe 

			Views: 3,615		

			Space Pirates and Zombies 2 is the direct sequel that takes the core gameplay & ideas and expands on them by developer MinMax Games Ltd.		

Text:SPAZ 2 comes into Early Access as a pretty solid core experience, though the multiplayer is still completely missing and the game has a ton of work left (especially in the sound department and voice).Where the game shines is the core ship-building and ship-combat action, and when I say the ""core"" I do mean that, there is a lot of stuff left to build on like more modules, more interaction in the combat with the environment and stuff like that, but what is there, is damn good.Where the game lacks though is explaining itself and providing a sandbox experience for the player. Tooltips and information about modules are sourly lacking and there is no way to ""Test"" ships outside of actually finding something to fight.The base question is, Did you like SPAZ? Do you want more fancy space ships and even more controll over how your ships look and fight? Then go for it. It's not the same game, but the idea's behind SPAZ are the same behind SPAZ 2.But blowing up ships Piece by piece while corny lines are shouted at you from a AI never gets old.			"

Early Access Review
								I do not very much like SPAZ 2. But I could.I miss the old hull system, but thats a bygone era and its time for something new. If I dislike anythign about the new game, its the lack of interesting parts. Why are there no ""turns"", ""t bones"" or ""4-way"" parts that reward creative building with powerful results? The ship building is less a feature and more a chore (especially with the primitive assembly mode). This game could use a tonne more ship parts, if only just shapes. There could be corner parts with 270 degree firing arcs, t-turns with 360 degree arcs, and the 4 way parts 360 too, these parts could simply reward the ship design by being worth as much ""space"" as another larger part with the same amount of connections perhaps? Such as a 3 way t-bone that would have a drone module or 2 snipers, despite only being as small as a single square.Furthermore, I miss the way Loosign a battle in SPAZ 1 was not game over. A lost battle with each of your ships gone in SPAZ 1 didnt end the game, but changed the pace. You went from crazy combat to mining for a while, scavenging other peoples scrap, untill you were right back at your old power. Loosing now takes a lot more time to recover from.I miss directional weapons, I would love to see some parts with guns facing only forward or to the sides. Allowing you to make ships that fire broadsides and stuff like that.Finally, this is already being worked on. Attaining the parts you want is just too time consuming as well as difficult due to random factors, the game really needs some way for the player to ""research"" or produce the exact parts he wants.

Early Access Review
								The creators asked to not compare SPAZ 2 to first installment, which is pretty hard when we take into account similar story background / world. I personally think SPAZ 1 was mediocre. I've started it couple times and stopped playing somewhere of the middle of the shortest campaign, due to being repetetive and pretty boring... so I've never finished it. The idea was great but game was very simplistic and frankly, quite empty.SPAZ 2 (on EARLY ACCESS) is already surpassing first installement in many areas, for example:Graphic - It's purely fantastic experience, especially when your mothership with abutance of light cannons is shredding multiple enemies into space dust. Great lighting effects and amazing battle backgrounds.Ship Management - Now you don't have to manage your fleet of small ships (which was fun I admit it), instead you have to take care of big ship which you can built from a huge amount of parts you can trade or scavenge in the universe.Battle - These are actually fun! Of course at some point I just keep turrets automatic and deal with navigation, missiles evadig, shield management or trying tu run but it still gives plenty of fun. In scope mode it was much easier to shot off particular elements of the enemy ships (or base nodes which are outside the shield field).From the minuses:Ship editor makes me swear very hardly. Requirement to hold a keyboard key and swing element when you're dealing with multiple pieces is frustrating at best. If you add to that the fact that dragged piece quite often attach to the node you don't want to, and you have to detach it... it's makes me mad and it's really hard to achieve normally.Element stats are hard to read, there is no comparison between something you want to buy and the element attached.I don't like Idea of Ship parts with gun nodes (with randomized placeement) of the particular weapon. Personally I would prefer to buy shipparts which have some kind of stats (energy output, available light/medium/heavy nodes) and weapons that you can attach to slot. Yes it would enlarde complexity of build / scavenge / trade, but it would make life easier for people who likes symmetric ships, and would allow to optimise turrets effectivity by placing them in spot we want exactly.I would also love to see some bigger battles than up to 4 mothership / spacebase with up to 4 support frigates. THe game have potential for incredible fast-pacing and intense battles!In general Early Access product was incredibly stable, bug free, with ton of fun and fantastic visuals. It has some gameplay issues I mentioned (which are most likely preference) but I believe the creators will workout it and do many many changes to the product before it goes Gold.			"

								SPAZ2 is shaping up to be a more awesomer game than it was when Early Access started!Our awesome developer overlords are taking gameplay suggestions by heart, and diligently implementing a lot of what makes sense to  their vision of the game in the gameplay. The game is not a direct sequel gameplay-wise from SPAZ in the more-of-the-same sense, and it's a good thing. Gameplay challenges are updated, the environment is 3D but gameplay is still 2D.The game has a very modular ship-building, and empire-building is a fun, repeatable endeavor in sandbox. It's worth giving a shot!			"

								I enjoy most games, that allow me to pilot/command ships both past and future. This one has me hooked, heres why1. Custom design of your ship and weapons2. Battles are different every time (due to all the weapons configs available to you and the AI)3. Beautiful detail to the galaxy and coloration of planets/stars/etc.4. Its space... With Pirates, and Zombies! what can go wrong?!Since it is still early access, there is still alot of work to be done, that being said its well worth the time and $$$. The only issue i have (which they said they plan to fix) is the voice work. Right now the voices are all digital, but hopefully soon they can replace it with actual voice acting. Wonder if they need volunteers...Strongly suggest this game!			"

								I'm not ready to do a full review, and I'm not sure how appropriate a full review would be given the game is in fact just entering early access.Personally, I'm incredibly skeptical of early access in general. My library has more than a few in it, and *most* of those have turned out disappointing. There is a huge disparity between different games when it comes to what early access means. Some games give you a half functional tech demo, some give you a highly polished experience that just needs some QA testing.This game falls into the latter category. Right now, today, this game is good. If this was the final version, I would be happy with what I bought.Some notes:This is NOT a direct sequel to SPAZ 1 with upgraded bells and whistles, there are significant design changes revolving around combat and the 'overworld'Whether a change is good or not comes down to personal preference, but for the most part the changes were well executed.The overworld is dynamic and interesting, but initially seems a bit 1 dimensional.

								A great fun game, I really enjoy playing this. Please be aware that while SPAZ2 is a great game in and of itself it is not SPAZ1 with 3d graphics. The core game is still there, the feel of the SPAZ world is still there.Combat is different (not better/worse just different).The galatic map has had a big make over and now combines the galaxy wide and solar system maps by way of zooming in and out.Resource management is handled on the Galatic Map which removes some of the grinding that the original game had.The time to learn was a bit more than SPAZ1, but I recomend playing arena missions with a rented ship early in the game to avoid damaging your own ship while you learn. Please note the Devs are actively working to address this issue with some urgency.The Support from the Dev's and the community has been outstanding. Remeber this game is still only early access but is by far the most mature early access game I have played. It's a great game now, I can only imagine how good it will be by the time EA finishes.			"

								Same concept as SPAZ 1, different gameplay.You control your mothership (concider this to be your flagship with massive firepower) or your strikecraft (fighters/frigates). There is a top-to-down-mode, a third person camera (my favorite) and a first person point of view. You can shape the mothership in any shape you want, with any weapons you want if you got the parts (thanks shopping cart update). If you want a long ship with lots of guns on the side, you can do that. If you want a big target with lots of guns on the front and massive engines on the back and ram the [insert profanity] out of a top tier starbase, that works aswel. At this point, the developers are still active and they actually listen to player-feedback, and they actually add new feature (that don't break balance).Enjoyed it so far, will keep my eyes open for any future updates. Keep up the good work.			"

								It seems small scale at first - but the build up is fantastic! I'm currently at level 15 after 8 hours of gameplay and the battles are getting extremely tense. They did some fantastic rework of the game systems from SPAZ 1 and the easiest way for me to explain the gameplay would be Mount & Blade in space. I love it!The game works in both top-down (as the previous game) but also in third person. I personally like the latter, but have used both and had fun in both.The ship building mechanics and UI could use some work, but for a newly released game made of a team of 2 (!!!) this is just great gameplay, and a great game.If you like these things:Action RPGsMount & Blade4x gamesThen you will probably like this game.

								As much as I want to love this game, it fails in many ways on what got me hooked to SPAZ1(playtime: 80h+). The problem with SPAZ1 isn't the ""grind"", it never was and those who call it grind are wrong. But the devs seem to have taken the ""no grindy game"" too seriously and more or less removed all ""grindy"" parts of the game that lots of us used to love(like farming comets<3). The devs are phonemal though and listens to feedback, but I feel they took a wrong turn here for SPAZ2 and removed too much.The real problem with SPAZ2 is the new map, it works great but the implementation makes everything dull after a while, it plays kinda lika CIV-game but it feels so out of context with no world map, in spaz1 I bonded with my ships and the world of SPAZ. In CIV games a world map makes it more familiar to connect to but here i'm just watching a marker moving across the map that I feel absolutely no connection to. It gets boring after a while.I want to be able to FLY IN SPACE, warp between sectors, set up roadblocks, run across ambient events, etc. This can't be done with the new map. Still a very solid game and I recommend it, but for the excellent space-naval ship vs ship combat and purdy purdy sci-fantasy graphics.			"

								An awesome successor to the first SPAZ with most elements completely overhauled. The small development team are committed to creating the best game possible and engaging with the discussion board. The game is currently in Early Access but even in it's current state it is worth every cent of the asking price.			"

								A great time sink, the game is both fun and challenging with only minor annoying things with it. I loved how much customization you could do with your ship and I found myself really getting into expanding my faction. I'm sure there are a ton of features and things you can do that I haven't discovered yet, but as of this review I have finished a run of the campaign. It isn't as huge a game as the first one, however that is understandable as it is in early access. I would definitly recommend picking up this title and supporting the creators.			"

								At the time of writing this review I have completed the campaign and sandbox modes each once.  I am finishing up a second sandbox playthrough.  As a huge fan of SPAZ 1 the changes made me nervous because I wasn't sure if it would be as much fun as the first game.  I decided to treat this game as separate from the first one and let go of any expectations and I am so glad I did.  I have really enjoyed the ~50 hours of gameplay so far and it is fun in its own right.  Even in this early access state the game feels relatively complete as opposed to some early access games which have less than 50% of the content available.  The developer duo are awesome and very responsive.  They already have made major fixes and updates to improve the game's experience with so much more planned.Pros:+ Mothership battles graphics are great - really enjoy the animations and the effects  (so much fun to tear apart my enemy's ship apart piece by piece)+ Starmap strategic layer is a fun addition for exploration and interacting with the other 200 NPCs+ Economics are much less of grind - no more mining for hours or collecting individual goons with your ships+ Arena battles showcase some interesting ship designs and allows great experimentation with tactics / weapons+ The mothership customization is really fun - the parts have interesting designs for different factions (mix & match)+ Still has the great SPAZ humorNeutrals:= The Mothership construction (tractor beam) is fun for a while but it can also become a chore at times= The synthesized voices are actually kind of fun - it is definitely appropriate for certain characters aka the ship computer but real voice acting would be a nice addition for the main crew members= The various factions could use some additional personality and backstory= The perk system is okay and offers some interesting choices, but the tech tree in SPAZ 1 was preferred for specializationCons:- The randomness in ship parts and perks makes specialization and deliberate design choices more difficult (the v0.2.0 shopping update did alleviate a bunch of the part randomness)- Only customize the mothership and basically control the one ship - the smaller ships in your fleet (now called strikecraft) have been significantly reduced in quality so there is no point in controlling them - most battles I can safely ignore them as little more than pests- In the current state there are not really any missions or dynamic side quests/events like in the first SPAZ - however that is a priority on the developer's listEven in its current state at v0.2.4 I would recommend it to anyone interested in space games - the game is only going to get better with time because the devs are amazing - (SPAZ 1 got a lot of love too over time - the bounter hunter expansion).

								Great game all round. I love how its a completely new game with some of the first's elements in it. The story and lore has been done very well and I've found myself laughing out loud many times. The game is quirky and fun. However it can be a bit overwhelming at first especially if you expected the same mechanics as the first. The currency is done very well and the game has a sort of mount and blade feel to it which is very nice. Goons need to be made a bit more important though. Late game they come en masse and waste precious res only to be sold to the starbase you're about to destroy. Not my precious resssss. lol. Voice acting is still missing and there are a few tiny tweaks and additions left to really complete the game. I bought the game and I hope that you will too instead of pirating it (ironically). Once I got it i played non-stop ignoring the meaningless life that lies outside of SPAZ 2. I conquered the entire galaxy with a threat level 208 ship. 9/10 on account that its still in alpha.Much greatness.Very sweetness.Wow.			"

								Let me start by saying I loved SPAZ 1.  Loved it so much that I bought this without reading anything about the game or any reviews.  I am seriously let down.  Other than the graphics being appealing (which is completely a personal preference thing), this game is worse in almost every aspect.  The combat is extremely one dimensional.  The ship building is boring.  There's no collecting ship blueprints or really any big ships or benefits to look forward to.  The game just wants me to grind grind grind.  All the upgrades are done in small increments (like adding a core module onto your ship of 12 cores), or upgrading a 3 star wing to a 4 star wing.  None of it feels consequential.  After several hours of play, I just never had that feeling of ""OH DANG, LOOK WHAT I JUST FOUND!!!""  Instead, I had lots of feeling of, ""Oh, I guess I should fly over there to sell these crappy parts that just fell off of that ship.""  There's nothing in this game that makes me want to keep playing...			"

								To start; I'm 33, I have 2 young kids, and video games are my only get-away from 9PM to 11PM.  The game better be damn good or I’m out!  That being said, SPAZ creators... Thank you for an awesome game!  You have made a game for $20 that was exactly what I was looking for and more.  I want this review to be different so that people like me can decide if they want to buy this game or not.  I am not going to critique this game like people do.  I will say however that I did NOT experience 1 crash, lag, or glitch in my entire play through!  I am writing this review after I just finished the campaign mode, and it was amazing!  I cannot wait to go back and play it on Sandbox mode!!!  Twenty bucks for an awesome story (I laughed out loud so many times), amazing space strategy, RPG, shooter… list goes on!  If you are not sure, view some YouTube – Lets Plays.  Everyone who plays this is having a BLAST with this game.  Buy it!  It is awesome!!  The developers did their homework and created a solid, fun and exciting game.  I give them major props.  Well done! "

								I'm not normally a review guide so I will keep this simple.First: I'm not far into this game. Only ~12 by in game standards.Two: This is early access. Lots of fixes are coming in but keep going if you want a whole game now.Now onto what we have with some quick pros/cons:pros:Fun combatFaction interactions are funGreat developer interactionsUsing grappling hook to smash is awesome and needs to be expanded oncons:Combat can feel a bit slow and plain until you get better parts to ship buildReplayability in sandbox may wear dry until more content is addedWish a few more options were avaible to change ship looks (again may change)Controls take some getting used to Ship building can be a painSPAZ 2 is pretty different from 1. You get a more hands on approach for the ships at the cost of the old strategic system. However the non combat interactions such as factions, starbase building, and ship managing more than make up for this change. There is a campagin mode and sandbox mode that allows you to get a handle of the game. I have not tried the multiplayer yet. It is also my understanding that this will be an offline mode only feature.In terms of current state plyability I would say this is pretty good and only going to get better. No earth sharttering glitches yet and the developers have been very responsive on hot fixes and talking with the community. Final verdict: Its an evolving game but damn good for an early release. I can't stress enough how much input is matters as the developers are doing their best to shape this game. I will update this review later on as I get farther/more content is added.  "

Early Access Review
								German Translation below / Deutsche Übersetzung untenThis Game is already quite good at the Moment (Alpha 0.2.4).  The potential what this game could become in the early access process is extremely groundbreaking fantastic. Why is that so?The Core of the Game is there: The design is already superb, no gamebreaking bugs, no crashes (as have been in other early access titles), its just fun and motivating to play.Then there are the developers of that game who are present in the Forums (clearly reading ~90% of all posts) and stating which features are in development. And then there are patches: almost every 3 or so days there is a bug fix or even a larger update. Issues that are found are posted in the Forums und fixed in days.The Community seems constructive enough so it could really happen: this could become the perfect Game in its Genre (or near so).And that seems to be the recipe for really good Early Access Titles: solid core, active developers, frequent patches and a good Community.So what are the points that should be improved? Strike Craft have to be improved to be more of a swarmy meatshield: Add different classes of strike crafts and add different ""slots"" for bringing them into battle (just like the old SPAZ1 ship classes and hangar bays) add small shields to them. and let them flee from station and ship explosion (constantly loosing strike craft when the battle is won...) Technology should be sorted into a tech tree: Damage Technology is too strong and should be projectile, laser and missile damage (perhaps increased amounts then) Some end game weapons should be locked (Sniper cannons, Mass drivers, bombs and ion beams) Fighter Hangars should be on 2 slot modules (but rebalanced to be weaker) so they are available earlier in the game. Bomb Fighters could be on 3 Slot Modules. As almost everyone else stated: Change core modules so that ONLY the amount of connections to other core modules are bringing any stats. So an ""End"" core module would have only 1 Connection and a Core Module inside the ship with 3 other Modules around it would bring tripple the stats. Then rebalance the stats. A 15 Core long line ship should be able to fire exactly 1 or 2 Salvos bevor the cap runs out. Idea: Intruduce special powerful corner modules (Those could be placed around the ship so no right or left corner) This would also intruduce more diverse ship designs. Corner modules could be inverse (require 2 slots in an inverse corner, slightly more powerful than 1 slot module) The outer corner modules should be as powerful as 3 slot modules. Improve border raids: At the moment i dont see what they do other to be a farmspot for every Pilot in proximity. Increase their strength: Add a small generic Mothership. (and improve Strike Crafts in general as seen above) Make them useful so they reduce the Station level by one when successful.  Idea: Add Patrols to Stations (perhaps in place of Border Raids so either patrol of Border Raid) The Patrols would ""guard the Resources in the Area. Any non Faction Pilot trying to steal from the resources would be attacked first. Diplomacy: Add ""Go Away or i will fight you"" option. (against ransacking pilots) Also Add ""Go Away or i will put a Bounty on your head"" option.  Scavange: When scavanging anything there should be the option to block the Pile while scavanging to other pilots if the scavange was mine. Other Pilots could attack me then (which would leave the Pile unguarded while fighting) Map: Add ""blocked"" zones into the map (there is a neutrino star there) so you could either go through them and loose Goons and damage your Ships (Strike Craft also) or go around them. Add more Capital Transports for a priceDieses Spiel ist jetzt schon (Alpha 0.2.4) recht gut. Was aus diesem Spiel in diesem ""Early Access"" Prozess werden könnte sprengt die Vorstellungskraft. Warum?Der Kern des Spiels ist schon vorhanden:  Es gibt keine Crashes, keine Bugs wie in anderen Early Access Titeln, man kann es einfach flüssig spielen und Spaß dabei haben.Die Entwickler sind in den Foren Präsent und lesen ca 90% aller Beiträge und kommentieren auch was genau sie für das Spiel planen.Updates kommen regelmäßig, Bugfixes normalerweise innerhalb von Tagen, Größere Feature Patches innerhalb von Wochen.Die Community ist anscheinend konstruktiv genug um das Spiel gemeinsam mit dem Entwicklern nach vorne bringen zu wollen.Und das scheint das Rezept für ein richtig gutes Early Access Spiel zu sein: Solider Kern, aktive Entwickler, Regelmäßige Updates und eine gute Community.Die einzelnen Vorschläge werde ich nicht übersetzen, da sie primär für die Entwickler gedacht sind.

Early Access Review
								Okay. So this is my review for honestly one of the better games I've played over the past few days, especially considering its early access. This review is being done as the latest patch (Ill call it the Catalog Patch) is coming out, but I have not tested the game with said patch. None the less, I will not include my complaints about shopping since I am pretty certain that this patch will fix all that. So lets get into it shall we?EARLY GAMEPre Joining a Faction - The gameplay before you join a faction is pretty . . . agonizing. Especially in Sandbox mode. Income is crap, exp growth is relatively crap, and the progression system for all of this is really slow. Getting your mothership going is a major pain in the rear the whole way up there.However, this isn't a terrible thing in its entirety. If you are smart, you can help a faction with battles in their territory, begin making friends, and leading into the second phase of your game a bit easier. Note: In order to progress to the next phase at any sort of decent pace, you are GOING to make enemies.Post Joining a Faction - Joining a faction isn't super hard, but the benefits of doing so honestly aren't worth it. You get some discounts at their bases and you have lots of allies who will help you, but it massively reduces your possible targets and once again slows the progress to the next phase of the game (unless you want to try and help an AI faction win, assuming Zombies aren't active). Zombies Arrival - Zombies are . . . Umm . . . I don't even know. In the campaign mode, they are overgrown pushovers. The only risk they pose is if you let too many infection pods hit you, but a good amount of point defense (which you should have anyways) can stop all that. And the final fight is pretty boring *shrugs*. Won't spoil what it is for you though. Your Own Faction - If you are playing with Zombies, you do this in order to gain strength to use against the Zombies and actually make the final battle a possible thing. If you aren't playing with Zombies, you are just doing this to play a domination style game in Sandbox. Owning your own faction is great. Its fun, but its not without its extremely annoying effects. When you are at war with someone, they can set a giant bounty on your base and then unless you baby-sit that base until the bounty is gone (or 1 attack has failed), you can kiss that sector good-bye. No matter what its strength is. Not to mention, if 3 people attack your starbase at once, you can't even help the thing to try and save it. Which almost certainly guarantees its defeat. Especially when you get into the later stages where everyone's ships are around 50 - 70 strength. Beyond that though, owning a faction is extremely fun. And if you get access to 4 sectors of each part type, you will be giving yourself access to every part in the game period. Its great.The Starbases honestly need one of two features to make them something worth thinking about when it comes to your own faction. Shoot, even enemy faction starbases deserve this. They need to either be stronger (a lot stronger, like 120 strength at max level), or need to have some sort of edge given to them during Sim battles so that they stand a chance to handle themselves at max level against 3 opponents. Owning a faction is incredibly difficult when everytime you declare war, you lose 5 sectors because the enemy just throws bounties at you (They themselves dont even have to attack you =.=). Other things to say - The gameplay overall is great. Its an extremely solid space shooter where you have a massive amount of control over the customisation of your ship. I will admit, if you just want maximum firepower, your ship is gonna look like crap, but even if you stick to Aesthetics, you'll have a good and powerful ship later on in the game. It does have a lot of room to grow, and needs some changes in order to make it a great game, but at least compared to S.P.A.Z. 1, its a GREAT sequel (and honestly a lot better). This game is in early access so I'm looking forward to seeing its future changes. In the meantime though, time to play it some more.			"

Early Access Review
tl;dr: I recommend Space Pirates and Zombies 2!  YES, this is coming to Mac and Linux after iterations of features have been added and the bugs fixed and multiplayer code introduced!  YES, SPAZ2 is dramatically different from (and yet still similar in many ways to) the game I reviewed initially!  YES, SPAZ2 is still being developed by just two (2) very talented and creative coders! Throw them some Geld and get yourself a copy of the game to play and contribute ideas toward! Do it! You'll be happy to see your direct influence in the game if you're lucky!Wanna know what's most recent?  Look here: SPAZ2 CHANGELOGSPAZ 2 is an OH-SO-DELICIOUS game! I recommend it; it's well worth its asking price! Unlike many EARLY ACCESS games, SPAZ 2 is a fully-playable diamond-in-the-rough with its CONTINUING polishing process currently well-underway. That's the best reason for Early Access after all, isn't it? To enable Steam's larger community to test a fully-working game, utilize the community's input for suggestion+implementation of features and actively take a good/great game and make it great/even better/the best thing since sliced spleens?WHAT I THOUGHT BEFORE PLAYING SPAZ 2:I loved the original Space Pirates and Zombies (and Bounty Hunters!) game, but the first couple of SPAZ 2 gameplay videos left me uneasy. I thought, Oh no! What have they done!? That looks strange and not very fun when compared to its predecessor. Fortunately, however, I was mistaken and my worries were unwarranted. The devs had made a great first game and they are in the process of delivering on their second game also! It's not the same game, however, which brings me to...WHAT I THINK NOW:SPAZ 2 retains most of the qualities that made SPAZ fun and introduces a lot of mechanics, different and yet still very humorous. What I thought might turn out to be an odd-looking mess of gameplay is actually very intuitively-controlled, easy-to-understand, and enjoyable! It begs you to come back and play again and again, without actually doing so when you try to quit like some games do. The many hours I've played SPAZ 2 have been very actively-spent. Despite that, I'm still on my first campaign/story-mode character/ship!  (Er, I was still on my first when I wrote the initial review. Many things have changed since then and many bugs have been fixed, many features introduced, and many more are on the way!)  Did I mention that with every update so far I've noticed NEW EYE CANDY, whether it's on the galactic map or on the ships and their components? Whew! It's like a new game each time!(the remainder is entirely from my first review unless noted otherwise:)I've been actively exploring the game, killing bandits for fun and profit and to garner approval from the local NPCs, bribing those disgruntled captains who have seemed to want to attack me a lot (enough to make alliances with their factions, even), finding members of my own faction who are good starbase leaders rather than abandoning their starbase and running off and trying to battle everyone else instead, allowing the ""danger rating"" of their starbase to decrease.(Yes! If I assign you, NPC-who-shall-not-be-named, to manage a starbase and you do a poor job by abandoning your base and allowing it to be overrun by others, I will assign another, less-aggressive or otherwise better-qualified NPC in your stead! Maybe your skills will be better utilized if I assign you as my wingman?)(OKAY... BIG EDIT HERE: Multiplayer is planned, but not until bugs have been sorted and features added to make it a superior game. The two developers probably want to make a blockbuster game that will tide them over until their next endeavor, right? I have no idea whether that's their plan, but I know without a doubt that they have the desire and ability to make an upper-tier game that is both entertaining and enormously fun!)BACK TO THE INITIAL REVIEW for items that still apply and NEW content where the old stuff is DEPRECATED:I've noticed some complaints that this game focuses on multiplayer (?). I didn't even know that multiplayer was an option, and I still think it's single-player only for the time being. SPAZ 2 is in early access, after all. Right now [in my initial review] I'm enjoying the features the devs are adding with each update and appreciating the fact that they waited until this game was fully playable before putting it into early access! The process reminds me a lot of SPAZ, which was great fun before the Bounty Hunters were added later, a free add-on which provided even more depth and fun! Not that the two games are the same, with this one taking place years after the events which occurred SPAZ 1 and incorporating different (but still familiar) mechanics.Sometimes I've been murdered by a relentless NPC captain who hates me for some reason, have reloaded my last save, replayed the battle, and it has unfolded completely differently. The same can be said for some of the practice levels offered at each starbase (but those involve simulated in-game ships and no actual in-game death).__A LAST THOUGHT: Steam's generous return policy makes this an easy purchase... even if you aren't sure about it yet, end up returning it, or leave it in your account until the features you desire have been added.

This game is so far from even the basic gameplay type of the first game, that I would honestly not consider it a sequel at all. It just happens to be a totally different game set in the same universe as SPAZ (which was a far superior game in every way).Any developer who wants to just give us fans what we want, which was just a better, newer version of the first game, I will gladly give you my money.Refunding this game. It's not even fun\. It's frustrating and badly designed, even when not compared to the original.			"

Early Access Review
								I loved the first SPAZ game.  I can tell that they are really trying with this one.  Its a similar concept but different, kind of like the space portion of Star Wars Empire at War, or SINS of a Solar Empire.  Alot of it is just very un intuitive.  For example, the weapon stat icon (colors and icons) system really sucks.  I spent half the game having no idea what it meant, and when I checked it, I kept having to go back and double check it.  They should just use words (Damage Vs. Shields: 100%, Damage vs. Armor: 50%, etc).  The ship design feature is bad.  There aren't really many options.  You connect hull core blocks in only one of a few viable ways (I, T or L shape basically), and then connect side weapons and a nose gun, engine part.  Thats about it.  Its super ugly too.  You can skip the design mostly if you just use the trade menu and swap parts in and out.  It wasn't really necessary to begin with.  They could have had static ships with ""gun slots"" or something like that and had guns looted diablo style.  I can't even recall what design system the first SPAZ had but I think it was way better than this one.Maybe the deep layer of strategy flew over my head, but it appears to me the game has very little strategy.  Its just start battle, blast the enemy ship until it blows up, done.  The little ships are just annoying.  Especially the raids, because its a small easy battle (just small ships, no capital ship) for a few points, but its just not fun.  They should eventually allow those to be automated.  Maybe they were and I just didn't see it.  The level up bonuses seem to outweigh any better weapons systems you can find.  The bonuses are like +25% armor, +30% health.  Those bonuses will outweigh an extra point of damage or armor on a  piece of equipment.  For any difficult battle, just bait the unit in battle near your allies.  Hopefully one or more friendly units will jump in to help.  Easy mode.  If combat was fun I could forget about all the other stuff but I don't even think I'll finish  the campaign right now because the combat has become quite boring.  Its basically 1 ship vs 1 ship and then there are the smaller more annoying ships on both sides as well.  Just not as fun as the first SPAZ.I'll check back later when its out of early access, maybe by then it will change.			"

								If you liked the original SPAZ, odds are good you'll like this one too. If you love hunting for ship parts and customization, you'll have a blast. I easily spent half my game time just trying different ship combinations to see what works best. Definitely grindy, but so was the first SPAZ.The combat is more compelling than the original as well. Controlling a single ship definitely feels better, especially since in the first game it could get very expensive to have the AI pilot bigger ships.It has problems that I don't want to gloss over, however.- The captain relations mechanics are a bit too simplistic for my tastes. People don't like you if you break or steal their stuff. People like it when you save them or give them money. If they don't like you enough, they attack on sight. It doesn't really get more complicated than that. Perhaps my biggest disappointment.- The ship building, while good overall, allows some weird behavior like allowing engines to unload their exhaust directly into another part without consequence. Weapons on the left side can shoot across to the right when you're turning, which feels too forgiving. Circle an enemy, and your broadsides on both sides can fire at it. Takes a lot of the typical strategy in broadside combat out.- Some features that were promised don't seem to be in here. The ""stealth past the zombies"" system doesn't exist at all. Infections in structures are all or nothing, so you can't cleanse a station without destroying it entirely. The captain AI, while functionable, delegates captain behavior to very simple patrols.- The story is pretty simplisitic, in fact more so than the original (far from a novel as well)When it's all said and done, I do recommend this game. A lot of bang for your buck. Great to support small studios too!			"

Early Access Review
SPAZ 2 is a $20 agar.ioIn a sentence SPAZ 2 is boring and not worth the price.For reference I really enjoyed the original SPAZ and I have tried to keep tabs on the development of SPAZ 2 as well as I was really looking forward to it.The game does play exactly like agar.io. You have a whole bunch of ships (""captains"") flying around a rather small area and you each have ""threat"" values that pretty much determine if you will win an encounter. You increase your threat mostly by killing other captains to gain experience which unlocks more modules for your ship.There is more to the game but not much.The economy works through stealing from resource nodes (which can't be locked or defended when you own them) and then trading those resources for ship modules at stations (1 station per 52 sectors devided between 7 factions). You also lose resources as you move depending on the speed at which you move and its not forgiving at higher threat levels.For combat, when a captain attacks another captain or a station a fight is initiated and for a period of time other captains can join the fight up to 4 captains. Fights never have more than 4 captains which generally makes every battle you, your wingman (who you pick from the captains in your faaction), your target and either another enemy or an ally depending on whos territory the fight is taking place in generallyThe combat itself is entertaining enough though the game is in need of ballancing. Theres a rock paper sizors system to weapon damage (effectiveness against shields, armour and health) and some other tricks and gimmiks such as ramming and flinging objects at your enemies which is fun but its a bit limited as your tractor beam is only able to move small objects at a decent speed and your weapons do not fire while you use the beam.There are plenty of weapons available though all seem to just be from SPAZ 1 which is dissapointing.The UI definitly needs work in places; for instance if you want to bribe multiple captains from faction X you will need to open the faction menu -> click through the factions untill you get to the right one -> scroll the list of captains -> click the captains name -> click the bribe button -> select what you want to bribe with -> hit the confirmation button then repeat the entire process again for another captain.One of my pet peeves is the active turn system where time only moves when you are performing an action. You cant scroll the map while you move, you cant opt. to stay still and let time continue to save fuel while you assess the map. The only time the camera is not locked on you while you move is if you are viewing a capatain in which case the half of the screen not taken up by the captain menu is zoomed in on the captain.Hopefully the game will improve through EA but alot of what I find issue with seems like core parts of the game that are unlikely to change. I hope at least enough extra features are added to offset this but I doubt it.			"

								I wanted to like this game.  I LOVED SPAZ, and was hoping SPAZ2 would be the same type of game just better, and it unfortunately is not.  It is an entirely different game set in the same universe, sort of like Dungeon Siege 3 compared to Dungeon Siege 2 and 1.  The shipbuilding is fun at first, the actual combat is mildly fun at first but quickly falls on its face in terms of entertainment.I honestly do not recommend this game to people who were fans of SPAZ1 and it's gameplay.

								Incredibly disapointing sequel. I know it's early access, but this isn't something thats likely to change.Took everything from the first game that was enjoyable and removed it. Just insanely frustrated that they couldn't make a sequal based off the first game they had to mess with the mechanics that were the reason we wanted a sequal in the first place.Completly pointless to play since nothing you do matters.  Everything that dies instantly repops with the same or better gear, leveling is pointless since everythings level is based off yours. Kill a guy near his base watch him repop fly out and attack you again before you can even loot his body.You had 1 job and you messed it up.			"

								Like some other people, I was a fan of SPAZ 1 and yet and really don't like this one. I can't help it, I tried but no : this one is completely different and I find it totally boring. The combats are slow and repetitive, even boring. Playing the all game is just boring to me. That's a big disappointement because I was so much looking for it. But they changed the recipe so much it has nothing to do with the first one. You keep flying with a useless ship doing uninteresting things in this game....I am sad. I got refunded.			"

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWThis game is a nice arcade style space shooter on a 2D Battlefield that looks like it's 3D. It has modular spaceships with component level damage (parts can fall off your ship as you fight) there is nice variety in the weapons I wish there were some better end-game lasers but maybe the developers will balance that a bit more.You can have strike craft, which are like small helper ships that you can change the weapons of and scale with your levels, and there is sort of like an in world economy that you have to help build up to get access to good parts. The relations aspect between you and captains, and somewhat your faction, is a nice touch to make the game world feel a little more alive... the AI Captains that you help will actually come and help you or try to hurt you based on the relations system.The Campaign is pretty well done at this point and is, in my opinion, like a big tutorial - however it doesn't bore you to death and instead just slowly introduces you to the concepts of the game while you play.Overall it's a nice little gem that's easy to get into but still provides some level of specialization and room for tactics to keep the hardcore players interested. I do hope either the weapon balance gets worked on a little or some new weapons are added because in the mid to late game there are a few weapons that are just better than all the others at the moment. I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in this style of shooter. Watch some ""Let's Play"" footage on youtube to see if it's your type of game. "

This is done for the soul purpose of getting rid of fighters/bombers or rockets that could kill you. In my final build, I had 2 of single slots, left and right wing placed in the middle of my ship.

This game is still in pre release and I generally shy away from pre release games (thanks cubeword, thanks starbound).

Early Access Review
								At the time of this writing, the game is still in early access and being polished. The first thing to understand is that while it shares an in game narrative with the original, it is in truth a different sort of game and is best viewed as a spiritual successor. I would describe it as a highly addictive and fun space shooter with 2D lego block like ship construction where you are grinding out resources, reputation with other pilots, and ship parts to become good enough to beat the zombie hordes at the end. It fails to become tedious as the battles are quick and the resource gathering a click of a button. The narrative dialogue is fun. This isn't a heavy or dramatic game but it can soak up a lot of your time. All the basics of play are present aside from multiplayer deathmatchs. The fine details are still being worked on such as weapon balance and challenge scale. There are many ways to earn XP such as fighting other space captains and pirates to level but you will find arenas with differing premade ships dominate your time spent toward skill progression. You can join game factions for access to better ship parts and prices or create your own faction that will grow from the ranks of other pilots you impress.It isn't the deepest strategy game but it doesn't need to be settling for fun and light making it perfect for an in between heavy games time waster that you will probably actually play more than the heavy, dramatic, games anyway. It's very much worth your dollar right now if you are willing to deal with roughness around the edges while the polish is applied. It is one of the few early access games to actually be worth it.

For me, after level 25, even on expert, I was trolololing my way through the battlefields - that said, there's a neat quality item system that lets you pack a punch even at lower levels - great development all round.That said, since the voices are all just synthesized right now, I'd love to see a bit of ego from the clockwork crew if they manage to (Spoiler Alert) Conquer the galaxy before engaging Zombie Alpha, and maybe a bit of a more difficult end-fight in such a situation. Even if not, I'm loving the game. Keep it up guys n girls! :)			"

Early Access Review
								Tee-El Dee Arr, Adun: Space Pirates and Zombies 2 stands extremely tall among fellow competitors in the $20 weight class.  It isn't even a competition.  More like an extermination, really.SPAZ 2 is several things at once, from two different perspectives.In the third-person ship view, it plays like a naval combat game on a space backdrop.  You ship turns left and right, but the Z-axis is sacrificed for the sake of those of us with typically planet-bound lifeform brains better suited to navigating flat plains.  Don't worry, though--you'll have plenty of stuff to think about.  The ships are built out of modular pieces and those pieces can be destroyed and peeled off of a ship like layes of an onion in combat, so positioning matters.  Each ""sub core"" piece lends a certain amount of hull health, armor and shields to the ship as a whole.  Cores ""synergize"" with one another, boosting those stats and also boosting any attached external pieces (including the damage of the weapons born by those pieces), by increasing amounts depending on how many of their four sides are touching another sub-core.  Because  of this, you can have an effect on the ship's strengths just by changing the layout of the ship.  Thinking of new ways to fit the various pieces together to design your own ship is a big part of the game.   In fact, in order to upgrade your ship, you are going to constantly be finding new pieces and swapping out the old ones.  In addition, as you level, you are continually able to add more sub-cores, gradually increasing the size (and power) of your ship.The game's OTHER perspective is a decidedly more tactical creature.  The game's map view is less like a map and more like a thoughtful strategy game.   This is where all of the slower, more strategic decisions come into play.  Time only advances on the map view when you move or take another action, so you can think a lot about what you're going to do and how you're going to do it.The map view is where you'll choose one of the game's five factions, which waffle back and forth between peace and war with one another.  You will also build and manage your starbase in this view, as well as interact with other captains, manage your inventory, trade and basically do all of the non-combat parts of the game.The game has two modes, Campaign and Sandbox.The Campaign mode follows an entertaining B-Movie Sci-fi Comedy Horror theme.  The main characters currently have voice synth lines which can become tedious, but you can turn this off.  However, it is not so grating that I have turned it off yet, primarily because the voice synth actually fits the ship's computer because of the comical disconnect between the very machine-like way of speaking, and the computer's warped personality.  The dialogue is well-written, lighthearted and funny.  The campaign isn't particularly difficult, allowing you to save before fights, and come back better-equipped or carrying specific gear to give you an edge against a particular challenge.  You can of course be harder on yourself, but the game in general gives you every opportunity to think a quest step through before you complete it.  The Sandbox mode is basically the same as the Campaign, but without the story element, inviting you to just explore and experiment without being directed about to do tasks by the characters.Overall, I give this game a 4.5/5.0 in its class, and that is only because it currently lacks cooperative play.  And that's only temporary.  If this review isn't updated after that happens, just consider it a solid 5.0.My hands feel like two balloons!			"

								I have not played Space Pirates and Zombies 1, but this game is absoulty enjoyable. You're not rushed, everything pauses when you're ship pauses, which allows you to read what parts of your ship does what, and helps you be able to control your faction without worrying about lost of in game time, which is valuable. Since they are coming out with a multiplayer that will be in RT, i'm going to take advantage of learning what component does what for your ship, cause it is a very customizable system.Excited to see how the multiplayer comes out. However, my game does crashes occasionally, but being in early access and that you're game automatically saves, isn't much of a lost.			"

								I recommend playing the original SPAZ game as well, as these are, for the most part, completely different. I think I like this version better, but as of the end of May 2016, it's not really for 'new' people unless you are okay figuring out the game a little on your own. There seem to be a lot of things in the UI that aren't explained very well. Hovering over different stats in the store doesn't give you helpful information and forces you to hover over a key (to get a generic key popup) and manually try to figure out what the certain stats were for, and how they would affect your gameplay. There's also a certain amount of re-balancing necessary since the developers understand their own AI and know the best way to beat it, if you don't play exactly that way, you will likely get overwhelmed by the AI and lose.

								HiAt start i would like to thanks devs for fantastic game and lot of work actually they are still doing to make that game best. When i have started with firts SPAZ new SPAZ was just about to be released so i have no big history with title but:1) game is realy fantastic - i stuck for many hours and sometimes jyst grinding for new level but still having a lot of fun.2) devs are listening to gamesr and reacting on very best way - they are doing what we want to be changed.Of course they have their own vision of the game but list of changes proves that they listened and read evry comment we did.I have hope that in near future they will release SPAZ3 or at least SPAZ2.5 :)all the best and i can recommend this game to all gamers regardless age.

								It's a fun game in it's own right , however I personally was hoping for more a SPAZ 1 experience but greater. It is not SPAZ though same universe same characters, different game.For those who was Spaz 2 this is not that game. But if you want a look at something new Min Max Games is trying and is for this point in time fleshed out give it a try.			"

Early Access Review
								let me start by saying steam needs a ""thumbs half way option"" but unlike most ill put it on the up because of spaz 1 and a very active pair of devs. Ignore my hours played shown here as i played it alot more at a friends, i have compleated the story and a skirmish, around 50 hours.ill try to keep it simple althow maybe a little long.things i liked: The fighting althow short is somthing i really like, i feel like im in the fight unlike spaz 1 where i felt like i was               watching a fight.The story, i wont say much for obvious reasons but i liked it alot very well thourt out and written, mayjor thumbs up.The new way your smaller ships are, they are useful now and can even kill other captains on there own.The UI, over all look and lack of any bugs (for me at least).Sounds are really well done, just wish the real voice acters where in there lol.What i didnt like.An easy one and almost put me off the game full stop was the unbelievabll dumb skill system!! or lack there of, althow it was some times funny how it was put to you the act of it was so bad especially since it was so right in spaz 1.Battle bad points, to short, to hard or to easy, never get the feeling your in a real war with max of 4 ships in a fight feels like the war never comes just lots of small scirmishes.Faction i had high hopes for this, it is my kinda thing but really... is it a faction when you have to do EVERYTHING, all this did for me was make me grind for hours and hours, and the end result was wtf...The zombies... in spaz1 they where hard as ****   here they just feel like pirates on steds, once you get to the point where captains arnt to much of a prob then these wont be a prob aswell. The Mehh:Mothership customizing is... well not to bad not to good. how it is put together is strange and feels lacking but i honestly carnt say why, but the real probs come with not being able to save a design.:EDIT: this has changed, and is really good now (i overlooked it when writing this review) :::finding the right item, i carnt tell you how many hours iv spent going from base to base to base, or killing ship after ship after ship just trying to find what i feel to be the right part... the amount i just turned spaz 2 off for just this reason almost makes it go into i didnt like section but i didnt mind the grind once i got the item, strange how that works lol:::What i would like to see, apart from the obvious above:crafting of ship parts, im not sure if that is even poss but after the amount of hours iv spent trying to find a part, if all that effort went into getting X items to be able to make X Part it would feel like i was getting somewhere with each kill.being able to control captains in my faction, if im in charge then i should be, well in charge of it shouldnt i?  giving orders to kill this or that, or def this or that, making caps under my control go def, aggresive, or helpful to other caps, even if i had to pay them X to stay and def a certain border, so much can be done with factions, as it is now only thing to do is grind for no real rewards.....end note.... even thow theres not as much good as bad in here i still found my self coming back to it over and over, the devs here are some of the very best iv ever come across in my years of gaming alot has changed since launch and im sure alot of change is still to come, I will be checking back every month and will change this review when i think it needs it.

								I gotta tell you I had fun with this. It's so much fun to play. Just finished the campaign at 21 hours in. Getting geared up to try the Sandbox mode. It's fun to make a ship that just looks so weird and yet destroys everyting in its path. Likes: Ships, pirates, zombies, space, guns.....lots of guns. A good dash of humor and the ability to name my crew ""Serenity"".Even without the voice acting, I made voices for everyone and it was awesome! Characters are amazing. It brings me back to when developers added their own slice of heaven right into the game, especially with the humorI liked the building, fighting becomes a breeze once you narrow down how you want to use your ship, trading system is simplistic and easy to use, not over crowded with non-essential items you always have to keep track of.Dislikes: Oh man if this had a bit of multiplayer mixed in this could be one heck of a ride. I see the option grayed out in the menu so it looks like there could be that on the way. I wish you could move a bit faster on the nav map. I was hoping for some bigger battles. I can see where that can strain many computer FPS counters but hey, most people have mad decent gaming PCs. Being a hoarder I tended to always grab everything. Come to find out you can carry too much. So I was over weight and I had gobs of loot and nobody had enough money to buy my stuff.Ideas: I think there should me a mixer mechanic / gambling where you throw in a ton of junk and then maybe get something good. Like in Borderlands you could mix guns and then get wicked cool effects and upgrades. This idea spawned from everyone not having money and couldn't buy my loot, and the fact that I wanted some upgrades.In conclusion, this game is going into my favorites category. It's reserved for games I really love and will always have a special place for in my memories. For how cheap the game is I got my money's worth and then some.			"

								At this point in time, the game is really warping towards success. For fans of the first installement, SPAZ2 is a great step up. It is essentially the same gameplay with a little more of depth and eye candy. Now, I do miss a couple of features such as fully customizing your little fleet of fighters and specializing your skills. The leveling system is straight forward and offers a lot of less flexibility. On the other hand, your mothership is now the core of the gameplay. There's surprisingly a lot to work with and finding the right balance is actually quite a challenge. A bit like the first one, this is actually quite a challenging game. I think I died like 10 times during my first 30 minutes. Even after figuring out the intricates of the battles and getting a decent setup, I still found myself dying quite often. I know that in this day and age, instant gratification and easy mode is the norm but I have to applaud the challenging aspect of the game.  "

								This game has a huge potential and I am definitely astonished on the amount of work that was poured into this game by a team composed of just two people. I highly recommend this game who is looking to have some raw humor, some space action, fresh to the table space world mechanics, and bloody zombie gore. To add to that, this game is still on early access and more great things are to come which is undeniably magnificent.To give you a rough idea on how great this game is, so far this is the only game that was able to push me to keep on playing until 4 AM. No other game had me that good so far that I even recall telling myself at least 3 times to sleep already from 2 AM until I was able to pull myself off because I had work waiting for me early in the morning.

								Absolutely in love. The first hour or two I wasn't sure, as I loved the first game, wasn't sure about the new combat style, but I'm totally hooked now. Have already beaten the campaign (played through the night), and am doing a 2nd play-through now to start really learning the nuance of the systems.Easily my fav. capital ship combat of all time. Perfect blend of arcade slug-fest, positioning + energy transfer play, and global resource management.It's still a W.I.P., but the systems in place are incredible, and the 'living' galaxy is a blast. Feels so cool to just be a fish in the sea.			"

								This game was hands down amazing. I played through all of the first SPAZ, and I loved all of the first SPAZ, and I replayed it for hours on end. The same could be said for SPAZ 2. It took me right around 30 hours to complete the story of SPAZ 2, and every second of it was worth it. The dialogue is entertaining, honest, and just straight up hilarious at some points. The character development is real, and seeing all of your fave characters again and their witty banter just raised this game to the next level of perfection.Sure, the game play mechanics might be a little different, but in a way that improves upon the first game. The entire tone of the game stays the same - it's still SPAZ. I'd still define SPAZ 2 as a strategy game, even though it's unlike any game that I have ever played, in a very, very good way. This game grows into something huge, and the entire climax can only be described as epic. If you only wanted SPAZ 2 because you seriously enjoyed SPAZ and are afraid that the different game play will make the game unenjoyable, I promise you you won't even realize the differences once the game gets going. You'll be far too invested in the story, and the story definitely expands upon the first.They have created a unique and exciting adventure that is one of a kind and a blast to play.			"

								TL;DR: Mad. Brilliant. Zombies. Quirky. Addictive. 10/10 Would Reattach My Engine During Combat Again.SPAZ 2 is... umm... hard to pinpoint. Its RTS heritage is clearly visible in the way the resources and overarching strategic map works. The remaining two cores of the gameplay - namely the 3D realtime space battles and RPG-style ship customisation - blend in seamlessly and turn this game into a unique hybrid of fast-paced, all-guns-blazing combat and slow, methodical, strategic planning and resource management.The main map is divided into sectors with varied, randomised sources, providing the player and the NPCs with the in-game currencies - Scrap (money), Rez (fuel) and Goons (expendable manpower). Several factions struggle for control over the sectors, with their mainstays being the buildable, upgradeable and fully destructible, one-per-sector star-bases. Dozens of other characters exist and basically have the same range of actions, upgrades and motions as the player. Complicated system of reputation - and reputation based actions - exists, which definitely adds to the flavour.The player controls a Mothership, a rickety spacecraft banged together - initially - from scrap. The game starts with one, non-changeable core and three fully-interchangeable and upgradeable sub-cores, which can be put together in various configurations. Later, the number of sub-cores can reach as high as fourteen, which gives the player dozens of viable ways to configure the mothership. Now, add noses, engines and wings, each with various styles, required ports-per-part, weapons, bonuses, rarity indicators and requirements... and you will begin to comprehend. Every mothership has Shields, Armour and Life, Mass, Power Capacity, Boost, Speed and Turning Speed. Every part of the ship has influence on those values. Every part can be detached (ie. shot off during combat, which reduces the combat effectiveness) and subsequently re-attached, even elsewhere on the ship. Every weapon has its advantages and disadvantages - ie. projectile weapons are useless against shields but have decent range, beams are shield-popping but power-hungry and short ranged, missiles are ever-so-powerful and universal but can be countered using CIWS-style automated gatling guns, et caetera. Now add the synergies between parts. Now add the small fleet of corvettes/fighters to the mix, each with its own weapons. Now add the hangar modules with dozens of tiny, unmanned drones. Now wrap everything in tin foil and add lots of flashing lights. Bang. There you go. You've got a SPAZ 2 mothership customization service. Every powergamer's wet dream.Beggars can't be choosers, and the resources are tight in the beginning, so for the first half of the game your ship will look straight outta scrapheap. You will pitch this contraption in sailing-ship-style naval battles against numerous opponents and sometimes even win. You will get extorted by the stronger and you will extort the weaker. You will ransack resources belonging to others and get bountied in return. You will face bandits and zombies, duel lone-wolves and get gang-jumped. You will face virtual and real enemies and - perhaps - make some friends and 'save the world', again.The game is very stable at this stage. During two playthroughs I have not encountered any game-breaking bugs and very few minor glitches.SPAZ 2 requires a lot of polish to shine, as the graphics comes out as crude sometimes, the models are simplistic and hitboxes do not always align with the parts. Voice acting is non-existent at the moment and is replaced by speech synthesizers, but in all fairness the devs know about it and offer the option to turn it off entirely. I must admit I am a huge fan of current solution as it's done very well anyway, adds a lot to the flavour and creates the impression of the constantly-failing technology of the last days of the mankind.It is a brilliantly mad piece of software, awash with fresh ideas and execution. Do not get fooled by sparkling lights and hot-pink-and-electric-blue tint on your spacejunk - SPAZ 2 is gritty and grim. Sometimes. When you're not grinning because youv'e just blown up two other motherships.Excellent title and worth every penny of the fifteen quid they charge you. Can't wait for it to get out of beta.			"

								Space! Pirates! Zombies! Numerals!While some people seem to be upset that SPaZ 2 isn't the same game as SPaZ 1, I am not one of them. I enjoyed SPaZ 1, but this new game is a lot of fun in its own right. A good shorthand to highlight the difference between the two games is that the original SPaZ played a lot like the old Star Control games, while SPaZ 2 feels much more like Mount and Blade in space.My experience with the game is almost entirely in the Sandbox mode, but that sandbox has been a lot of fun to play around in. The ship customization is surprisingly robust. At a glance it seems incredibly simplistic: just snap blocks together and build your LEGO-style spaceship. After building and rebuilding your ship a few times you will definitely start considering just how to arrange your core blocks to get just one more engine, or just one more gun.SPaZ 2 is not a hardcore space simulator. It's space is 2.5D, like Rogue Galaxy or Starship Gemini. It's colourful, doesn't take itself very seriously; and like Mount and Blade it is a game that you can play for 10 minutes to fight a single battle, or sink hours at a time into your grand campaign to unite the star captains of the galaxy against the zombie menace.I do not regret buying this in the slightest.

								I loved SPAZ 1, but I nearly didn't pick this up because they moved it to 3D. I'm super glad I did. This game is way better than the first. Combat is quick - most battles take less than 5 minutes - but it feels very tactical and drawn-out.I especially love that the loot you get from battles are modules you can use to build and upgrade your mothership. It's the most insanely rewarding feedback loop ever. You'll have to make a choice early on between building your ship for aesthetics or practicality, but by the endgame you'll be able to browse the game's catalogue for the best ship parts and have them delivered to you. I'm also a big fan of how quickly they progress you through the game. My first playthrough took about 20 hours, but the near constant upgrades and level-ups kept me feeling like I was always making progress.The game could use a lot of polish in the UI and ship-building sections, but it's still in early access so there's time for fixes. Overall it's a lot of fun once you break through the learning curve and earn enough scrap to start thinking creatively with how you build your ship.			"

It is different and familiar at the same time the way you can customize your ship is a very nice feature since in the original you could swap out some parts not build an entire ship. Though this game is in Early Access still it has alot to do and I can't wait to see how much they add to this game making it that much better.			"

								About 9 hours in, and I love this game. SPAZ was a pretty good game. New concept, executed pretty well, not horribly overpriced like other titles. Fairly priced, and enjoyable.  The big difference between that game and this one, is this one puts more emphasis on the mothership, if not all emphasis on it. Because you can control it in battle.Given how you have free reign to place your core pieces, you can develop some pretty weird looking ships, that somehow can devastate the enemy with the proper loadout. Also, learn to run/bribe when you can't win. You can't win them all. Especially once you pick a side.All that being said, the developers have said it's in alpha. Really, IMO, it should be in beta. I have yet to encouter any crashes or game killing bugs. I have missed both eating, and mowing the lawn, in favo(u)r of playing this game.So far, it's still a bit sandbox-ish, it still needs that layer of polish to make it truly satisfying. Considering the price, and the state of the game's development, you can't go wrong. I'm seeing the same patterns between these devs, and the devs of the Endless series (Space/Dungeon/Legend). In that they put forth a solid effort at the start, continue to listen to the community, and don't skip out on their goals due to timeline constraints.Buy this game. It's this old thing called.... FUN!Edit: I forgot to mention. When all else fails, just ram 'em!			"

								I am/was a huge fan of SPAZ so I am a bit biased but tl;dr.... SPAZ 2 is fun and has the potential to be great as SPAZ, but isn't quite there yet. As it is Early Access and the devs are super responsive... I easily expect it to be an epic game by finish.The combat feels more like naval combat, recognizing where important components are and destroying them is hugely important in close fights which is cool, but don't feel as fast paced as SPAZ.Controlling an empire is a cool concept.Negatives/bugs I'll be posting in the discussion instead of here since early access is to help the devs build a better game.

								Its July 13 2016 and it's early access. I have 16 hours in and I won the campaign. The best part of this game is the living economy / conflict. Everything is happening at once and you are just a part of it. At the late game you can make your own faction, own and give starbases to friends. I find the game very fun, and I am a SPAZ 1 vet. There's a lot more to do of course. My suggestion is to buy the game, it's not that expensive, and support the devs. They are active in the forums and want to make SPAZ 2 a fantastic game. It's currently worth it and it will be better week by week.			"

								This game is just great, and it's going to get better ! This is only a pre release and already I have spent countless hours on it.Passed the first surprise of the change of playstyle between the 2 and the original SPAZ, you discover a whole new game ! SPAZ was a wonderful game, great scenario, great idéeas, powerful characters and unique gameplay.SPAZ 2 has the same advantages ! A whole new story, a great gameplay and more...The devs are listening to all the ideas of the community and are planning to include the best of them in the game... What else can we ask for ?			"

								I liked quickly getting into battles and back out.Very fast load times.Strategic layer is the stuff of genius.The ship building has room to evolve. More tradeoffs.What does deploy hanger do. Why?Add a little more sticky to the tractor beam.Love throwing rocks. That was a bit of genuis.The live economy is cool.There is a dead zone around level 8 where u can't kill anyone and making money is tough. Once you are over the hump no prob.Add more guidance to captains of faction. Maybe focus attack or avoid zombies. Or stick together.Good work guys!To people wanting to buy, it is a fun experience. There is true creativity here lacking in most modern games which are derivatives of previous games.			"

								As a big fan of SPAZ1, I was very excited for the second one. Bought it minutes after it was released and was a bit surprised by the fact that it is a pretty different game. After the initial stage of trying to figure out what the hell was happening (which took me a couple hours), it is actually a very enjoyable game, much more than just a simple sequel.I completed the story after about 20 hours, and I intend to play it again. I haven't even touched the sandbox mode yet!Recommended.			"

								Different than the first one in terms of how you build ships and battle, it is none the less a good space sim. One downside is due to the way parts attach, you end up with a strange looking ship if you want to maximize it's power.			"

Some more things to do in the game and updates to things like bandits, making them far more interesting. For this price this is definitely worth a look.			"

								I own SPAZ 1 and spend over 100 hours playing it. While SPAZ 2 plays diffrent then the first one i dont really see it as a negative. I got used to battles in 3d really fast and moving over galaxy map (pretty much like mount and blade with instanced battles) is also fine by me. Overall i would say its worth money developers are asking for it and considering there is just 2 of them they really did amazing work getting it to state it is now. They also care about this game and realse hotfixes really fast and promise futher improvments. Honestly if you liked SPAZ 1 i see no reason to♥♥♥♥♥♥on developers becouse they changed gameplay in a sequel. It is still a great game on its own.			"

								Spaz 2 is named after it's predecessor for the following : Lore , Cast and Humor.Spaz 2 does not render Spaz 1 obsolete, these two game are different....But god damn these two games are awesomes !In only 3 days I clocked 21.0hrs, And I haven't finished the story, because I am having so much fun.And that's only for the Alpha version ! The combat is fun, I love carefully picking my target apart, the management is quite easy and automatics even if there is no direct control over your starbase.The only thing that's a bit frustrating right now is the infection, wich feel a bit too hard to contain and fight against at the moment.It's only because, a lot of the human AI lacks self preservation and will run headlong into the infection, grossing the rank of the zombies.But that's minor nitpick. Minmax as proven themselve to be reliable and hard worker. SPAZ 2 will continue to be updated and improved just like SPAZ 1 was.At the moment, the game is more than enjoyable, I have encountered no crash nor bug, there alot of content.SPAZ 2 is far above the  thousand of ""Early Access Game"" present on Steam.Overall : 10/10 Will cleanse the Galaxy Again.(Also, the synthesized voices are awesome and both fit the mood and universe) "

								<<<<TLDR; Game starts slow but gets really in depth and fun once you get over that initial hump. The devs have stated they are working on improving the early game pacing.>>>>So the game started off slow and I had trouble getting into it to play. Then last night I ended up playing for almost 10 hours straight. I just couldnt stop!!! Once you get past that initial hump the game opens up amazinly.  You start to understand all the different weapons and what they do, and you can actually afford to make the ship you want rather than just a hunk of random junk.You also start to learn how affect the galaxy around you. All those other captains remember everything that they have seen. So you can make friends and enemies with your actions. They all have traits that make them better or worse friends.  For example Loyal guys will stay in your faction and are harder to take away from other factions. You have cowards that retreat more often, or Selfless Captains that love to help everyone.  You can start recruiting them into your faction and building starbases.  There is a lot of info on the factions and the captains, but its hard to go through right now. Hopefully they will make the UI a little easier to navigate. "

Early Access Review
TLDR: This game is a bit of a mixed bag. There are things I like, and things I don't like. I have enjoyed my overall experience thus far, and can safely recommend this game.SPAZ. Probably my favorite top-down, space based, humorous, strategic, infuriating game. Certainly not without its problems, but this isn't a review for SPAZ. This is about SPAZ 2.If you're expecting another SPAZ, but with more content, you're going to be disappointed. SPAZ 2 is more of an evolution than a sequel. Some things they do better than the first, some not so much. The single player is feature complete as far as I'm aware, and the EA period is for bugfixing, and adding an arena-style multiplayer. So yes, the game is absolutely playable as it stands, and I've encountered minimal bugs in my play time. The devs have been very quick to patch what bugs have been reported. Pros:+Living galaxy. In SPAZ each sector was its own ecosystem, and nothing you did outside of that sector made a difference in that one. In SPAZ 2, almost every action you make will have some effect on the galaxy, big or small.+Modular ships. This part is not all sunshine and roses though, we'll touch on that later.+Choice between the 3rd person camera added to the game, or the traditional top-down SPAZ camera.+Multiple factions to play with or fight against, and player factions.Cons:-Editing your mothership. This is by far my biggest complaint about the game. To remove or replace a core block, you must remove any other block that is touching it. This means if you find an upgrade to the middle part of your ship, you have to tear half of your ship apart one part at a time, replace the part, and put it all back together. MinMax has somewhat alleviated this by automatically swapping a part you purchase with a similar part you are selling. So if you select your old core in the shop, and the new one and click buy, it will automatically equip the new one in that slot. You can not do this however on parts you find out in the open.-Slow ship movement and control. Your mothership is big. Cool. No matter how you build it though, it will always turn like a brick, and move like one.-No strategic overview. While you can use the top-down view from the first game, you do not have the same control over your strike craft. Simply ""Focus this target"", ""Go to this location"" and ""follow me"". You can not divide your ships and drones (if you have them), since they follow the same commands.Pro/cons:+-Gone are the days of mining asteroids for rez. You simply go to a resource node, and click collect now. They are not random, and regenerate at the same rate over time. I personally enjoyed mining for rez, but this is very convenient.+-Feels like Mount&Blade in space. The developers have said that M&B is one of their inspirations for the game, so if you like that, you'll probably like this game.+-Currently all the story-based voices are spoken by a TTS program. MinMax has said they will hire voice actors to voice everything, but for now that is not so. Chatter between units is currently voiced.Don't go into this game expecting SPAZ 1.5. I've had a blast playing SPAZ 2. I hope they make it easier to edit your Mothership, but that's not a dealbreaker for me.			"

								This game is extremely fun! There are many different ways to play since you can design your ship part by part. The inter-faction diplomacy could use a bit of work and there are still quite a few unfinished things, but hey, it is early acess. This game is already like 95% finished and even if all the developers decided to do was clean up the unfinished parts and release it, this would be a solid $20 game purchase. However the developers are actively listening to feedback and still working, so this game is truly worth every cent.			"

								Definitely a great game that falls in the spaz universe and lore. This is not a direct sequel so you wont be getting SPAZ 1.5. However ive played through the entire game and the flavor of playing a spaz game is still there. The characters still hit the nail on the head as well as the setting.     Some people come off with the impression that all the ships look like garbage. Yes they do, because of the state the galaxy is in lorewise. Everyone is scavenging parts they can because there is not anymore unlimited amounts of rez like in the time period of the first game. I personally also enjoy ramming ships and seeing parts get torn off when i hit them. I once sheared off 5 wing parts in one charge and i recorded it and watched it again as it felt so epic.Some also dislike the relative ship controls(they actually are relative to the camera) which make your ship turn to try to go forward in whatever direction youre holding. If you do not like it then there is an option to turn that off and use controls relative to the ship instead.(similar to spaz 1)Some people complain about getting ganked by other captains so they have to give up cargo to survive, of course youre going to get harassed if youre a low level lone wolf, its a savage galaxy and they have no qualms about harassing a little guy. I solved it by joining a faction and fighting instead of surrendering. You will most likely get a battle partner from your faction to help out.Definitely recommend this game but beware some people think the early game of the campaign is slow. They just dont know how exploit those around them appropriately, you can definitely get up and running quickly.			"

I cant tell u how much fun i've had just in the customisable sandbox game alone,tweaking the many game options if u want a more challenging or simplier game slide the bar and its done.

								So, originally I found this game kinda weird. I didn't enjoy it too much so I stepped away from it. I wrote an off the cuff review that I shouldn't have, it was a bad idea not actually seeing what the game had to offer before doing so, and not a mistake I will repeat in the future. With that being said, I've put some extra time into it, and my opinion has completely changed. I still haven't finished it, but am having a blast! I don't know what is turning people off about it specifically, but if you haven't given it the time it takes to really figure out the mechanics (which doesn't take long) I would consider reserving judgement until you put a little more into it. I think you'll come to see that this is a worthy successor to the first game.If anyone happens to be reading through reviews before purchasing, pay close attention to the time people have put into it before making a decision. I got sucked in and I think anyone who gives it a fair chance will also.			"

								So i wanted to make an Update to my old review, while the recommendation stays the same, there is a lot of more Content now, so let's go over it.Spaz 2 is a rather special Indie Game. You take over controll ofa Mothership which you can customize with different parts.A huge variety of weapons are already in the game. From massive torpedos to PewPewLazors. You even can build a massive Carrier.Depending on how you modify your ship it can be a slow fortress or a fast hunter and it really is well made. I catch myself often just thinking about a new shipbuild. There are RPG elements in this game as well. If you level up, you can choose a perk. These change from more Command points, to more health, more shieldstrength, more weapondamage. Pretty much all the stats can be improves thorugh level ups.Command points and Hangars offer you the possibility to bring along Strikcrafts. Not simply little ships that a carrier could transport. Actually really strong combat ships that you can modify as well. You can change the weaponloadouts for each. It is not as indepth as the system with your mothership but it offers enough variety to be really usefull ingame and another thing you will think about fairly often. The Galaxy is one single map split into different sectors if you reach a certain level you can start building starbases. You creat pretty much your own faction to compete with everyone else. There is the possibility of inviting NPC's to your faction and even go into an alliance with other factions.The starbase building is rather simple. Each sectore offers one slot to build a starbase, if there is already an existing one you have to destroy it which will lead to a negative rating, and probably war, with the faction that owned the previous starbase. I hope there will be a indepth basebuilding mechanic but i don't follow the roadmap so i am not sure about it. The Campaign is nice as a ""tutorial"" sorta, but that's about it. While the humor is nice and enjoyable, the story is nothing really special. But i don't feel it hurts the game. The Sandbox mode is far more enjoyable anyway. I can't wait for multiplayer, this will benefit the game greatly. The Game is currently in early access, which i really dislike. Don't get me wrong, i do dislike early access because of some developer abuse the system and steam lacks quality control.SPAZ 2 does not feel like an early access game to me. The Content is big and enjoyable. You can tell the devs do love the game and put in a lot of work and effort.If there is one thing i could call bad, it would be the missing information in the game and outside of the game.I started a sandboy a couple of hours ago and they added new weapons. I haven't even used all of the old ones yet so there was a lot to discover. But since you can use a search function to find different parts you need for your ship, you find yourself in a situation i didn't really enjoy. Do i really wanna spent 10k on that weapon without knowing how it acts? You do have a little description on them, but a optional option to watch a little video on how the weapon acts would help a lot :3As you can see i rally have to digg deep for a complaint. Overall the game is great and really enjoyable. If you are looking for a casual RTS / ARPG combination, you will love this game.			"

								ok, This game is absolutely amazing. my 31 hours is from multiple games played and PLENTY of ships built.  I did not play SPAZ 1 and this is not a comparison review.The over the top map style, then combat ""encounter"" is akin to mount and blade (which i have over 1500 hours that steam recoreded. more after)The modules can be a PAIN at times but quick ways around rebuilding a ship is to trade the part you are replacing with the new one in the same transaction. the game will swap pieces out without you having to dismantle your ship. (youll know what I mean when you play)I read reviews saying there is no diference with weapons you use. this is FALSE. I was only able to succeed in endgame by utilizing specific weapon combos. There is veriety and more is coming according to devs.There is MUCH more hours that i can put into this game, but work and real life is demanding ATM. I will log plenty more when i have time because this game is absolutely worth it.I bought SPAZ 2 at 14.99 -10% for into price. With that being said, i would easily pay 24.99 in early access. More so once more content is added ( and CPU's have SOME respect for your salvage and property)Would buy again and would but DLC if it wasnt free!!!			"

								An extremely unique experience with a well crafted story that doesn't take itself too seriously but still generates plenty of immersion in a similar fashion to mount and blade.Comparing this game to the first SPAZ is not advised because although they follow the same story arc they're two entirely different styles of play.So far I'm about halfway through the story on this one and I am absolutely blown away by the new gameplay elements.This is a completely functional game regardless of the early access label, in 20 hours I've only had one crash and it was hardly an issue because of the well placed auto-saves and very fast loading times (Running on SSD). Spore probably crashes more than this early access title.Positives:+Fun as hell+Funny as hell+Made by two guys+Simple to learn but quite challenging+Very clever mechanics+Uncomparable to other games+Solid gameplay but could use some tweaking with balance.Negatives:-Controls and UI can feel a bit wonky due to the size and lack of info in some parts.-Not really a tutorial or a good guide on how the game works at the start. (Learning is part of the fun for me though)If the divison is worth 60 bucks then this could easily be worth 40 as an indie title when finished. I expect to put at least several hundred hours into this game.			"

								This is a good game, with the potential to be a great game. It is a bit of a departure in gameplay (you really only control the mothership directly, though you can jump in the cockpit of one of your fighters and let the AI fly the metal mother) from the first game, this isn't neccessarily a bad thing unless you were really hoping for a SPAZ1 clone with more ships / bosses / etc. Personally, I enjoyed the first game, and am enjoying this one as well.

								It feels like yesterday, when I bought SPAZ 1 in a sale for a buck or two :-)Boy did I not see that 2 week bender comin ^^SPAZ 2 on the other hand, was on my mind since they announced it. I saw it change shape, and although I told myself to stay calm and not give in, I bought it 5 min after release -.-It is a whole different animal compared to SPAZ 1. And I understand that many hoped for the same thing in 2.5D.I knew it wasn´t. So I do not regret it.It is an awesome game, that allows combat on a whole different level. The best you could hope for in SPAZ 1 was kiting them into barrels to blow them up.Dude! You now can f*****g throw them at your enemies ^^So a quick feedback for everyone interested :positive- 2.5D- fluid universe, with NPC remembering what you did- so many choices in weapons, with almost all usefull- Faction interaction that makes sense- resource management (if you are into that)- nice graphics, running smooth so far- own faction with space station management- build your ship with your parts, how you want- which allows for great tactical range in combatnegative- no fleet management (kinda miss building all my ships)- flickering screen (great fx, but annoying / devs are aware and announced button)- story is restrictive (of course you can play sandbox instead)- the way it is set up, captains can be turned to zombies. Can´t kill them, can´t cure them. As far as I know.   means after a while, the air is getting thin -.-- don´t like the faction grind. My personal thing I presume, but one thing ppl are capable, is uniting against a    common foe. Instead I have to appease them with gifts and tales of valor -.-So would I recomand it? Of course! Being able to throw like whatever you find at your enemies, in addition to a sh**load of weapons?Big gunz, big evil zombie dude and big explosions. Now if they include pink unicorns shooting rainbows from their behinds, we got a hollywood script for a blockbuster :-)			"

Early Access Review
								A space based strategic action RPG, with a simulated dynamic galaxy.Let me start by saying I am loving the game so far, though I fully appreciate not everyone will feel the same way.  SPAZ 2 has so far received very mixed reviews, though if you take a look you will find the majority of those are criticisms comparing the game to SPAZ 1.I think that this is unfair as the game is not really a sequel, but rather a new vision from the developers.  If you are expecting the same style of gameplay as SPAZ 1 you may come away disappointed, however for anyone willing to try something new this is a game that I believe is considerably better.Warning - this is a lengthy review, please feel free to jump to the pros/cons and conclusion at the end!The star of the show is the dynamic galaxy, that revolves around the factions and the 200 AI captains that inhabit it.  These captains have the same abilities as the player, though all have there own personal goals and agenda.  They will join and leave factions, fight, trade, and become infected with the dreaded zombie virus.All captains have opinions of all other captains including yourself, and your interactions with them develop during the game.  You will likely join a faction yourself, and get pulled into one of the wars over territory, helping them to expand or even assisting them in establishing or upgrading star bases.  Later in the game you will have the ability to begin your own faction, allowing you to amass support in the struggle against the zombie infection.Ah yes, the zombies. Starting from one 'Zombie Alpha', their spread across the galaxy infecting captains gradually increases, until their exponential growth becomes a serious threat.  Captains that are infected will remain as zombies and re-spawn on death, so it is quite possible to get to the point where humanity is overwhelmed.  I think this threat provides a much needed fear to the zombies and a sense of urgency in the game (which I felt SPAZ 1 was lacking), though I do feel the difficulty of the game might be off-putting to new players. Of course, this is early access so there may be adjustments made here before release.A potential downfall to the game at present may be the combat system.  Unlike SPAZ 1 you typically control the mothership rather then smaller craft.  The option is there to control the small ships, but as the motherships are the focus of the fight the tendency is to control them personally.  Because a fight will only contain a maximum of four motherships, this can leave fights seeming slightly smaller then SPAZ 1 despite there technically being far more ships involved when you include the smaller craft.  The action (for me at least) tends to involve heading for the enemy and blasting all your weapons into them, however for those more strategic players there is the option to be more tactful and control weapon groups, combat styles and of course customize your mothership.The customization involves using modular components to build your ship, featuring engines, noses, and wings for speed, shields (I think?) and manoeuvrability respectively. Each component also has a weapon, which come in many varieties for different purposes ranging from shotguns to mini black-hole generators.  These are connected to core modules which form the centre of your ship, and you can increase the number of these as you level up.  This provides a lot of different ship options and numerous play-styles.All modules are obtained from star bases or from other ships, built by the different factions in the game. This means certain factions will specialise in certain items, and you may have to hunt around to find the best weapons.  The downside to the system is that ships will often end up looking blocky and messy as you piece on any modules you can find.  Additionally, the ship builder can be cumbersome to use and for example if you want to replace a core you have to remove the modules attached to it. Again this is something that will likely be improved during early access.Finally, I will just note that the visuals in SPAZ 2 are amazing, and it is truly incredible that the entire game has been put together by just two people over the span of several years.  Please note that voice acting is not currently implemented in the game and it uses synthetic voices.  This is due to be changed before full release and there is of course an option to disable them.Pros:- Highly engaging star map, with very dynamic gameplay that will vary on every play-through- The 200 captains are fun to interact with, and are where the game truly shines- Customizable ships and other strategic options makes numerous play-styles possible- Beautiful presentation, and humourful textCons:- Repetitive combat that can grow old- Despite the excellent tutorial, it is easy to miss points- Ship builder could use some improvementConclusion:SPAZ 2 is a highly ambitious game, and in particular the dynamic galaxy set-up provides large amounts of re-playability. It's system of an overworld map and battles with warring factions e.t.c. have been compared to Mount & Blade, or the excellent Space Rangers 2.  To anyone who likes those games, or is interested in trying something new, I strongly recommend giving this game a go!  At only $20, this is a no-brainer.  For anyone just looking for an improved SPAZ 1, I advise having a look at the many Lets Plays of the game and judging whether you would enjoy it based on those playthroughs.My many thanks to the developers for their hard work making this game!!

Early Access Review
Summary: SPAZ 2 is an early access 3D space combat shooter with RTS elements from MinMax games. It has a strong open-world orientation, interesting combat and customization mechanics, good narrative support from quirky and entertaining original characters, and a responsive development team. Key innovations over the original SPAZ include player factions, competitive NPC captains, more customizable ships, a better resource mechanic, and 3D graphics. As of this review, it has been out for a week and a half.PROS- Open World Environment- Solid gameplay- Strong Early Access demonstration of key concepts and core mechanics- Unique and quirky main characters- Good Graphics, with strong explosion, beam, and particle effects.- Rewards Lateral thinking (You can win by tractor-throwing rocks and debris at people)- Customizable to individual play-styles- Narratively Original Zombies- Responsive DevelopersCONS- Not the 1 to 2 Sequel die-hard fans of SPAZ were expecting.- Currently lacks multiplayer support (Planned and apparently designed)- Some issues with game balance (Progress appears to be ongoing)- Temporary Voice Acting (Computer synthesized, yet oddly hilarious).Price: $19.99 USDRecommendation: If you like space combat games with an open world bent, are a fan of the original SPAZ, or just like saving the universe from zombies, I’d recommend you buy this game. At the very least, check out the gameplay videos on the store page.Long Review: Do you like shooting things in space? Do you like fighting hordes of zombies that were previously your friends and/or enemies? Do you like open-world adventures that let you design your own solutions to a problem? If you answered yes to any two of those questions, SPAZ 2 is a game you should try.So what is it? Space Pirates and Zombies 2 is a third-person space combat shooter from Minmax games, a small, two man indie dev studio that brought us the original SPAZ.  For those of you who haven’t played it, SPAZ was a top-down 2d shooter that saw the player zipping around the galaxy, building up their mothership in order to face down a zombie threat.SPAZ 2 is a totally new game, now in 3D, and using a new modular ship system that allows players to assemble (And re-assemble on the fly) their own custom mothership from a variety of parts. The part selection for Early Access is already pretty good, and given how this studio approached the original game, we can only expect additional weapons, parts, and zany components to be added over time.The core innovative change for SPAZ 2, and what provides the most depth in its gameplay, is its faction system. The game starts with 200 Non-player captains, people who have their own fleets, interests, goals, and personality traits. They’re also after the same resources that you are – meaning they are competing with you to power up and expand their arsenals. They level up, add components, and get in fights just like you do. They will also join factions, which compete with each other to expand their empires and control more of the game map. This is where you come in. Players can create their own factions, and rally (Or bribe) captains to their cause, enabling you to square off with other factions to control even more resources and territory. You can choose to either go for an all out war by beefing up your captains, or you can focus on building alliances and playing diplomatically, by paying other people to wreck up your opponents.The open-world nature of the game is what contributes the most to its fun factor – there are a couple of different ways to solve problems, which you can adapt to your playstyle. The mothership customization mechanic is one of the best examples of this. Each ship has a number of slots for core modules, determined by your character level. You then attach parts to those modules, each of which has a different type of weapon on it. Bigger modules mount bigger, better weapons, so as you get more cores, your ship gets more dangerous and unique. Having problems with a particular faction’s preference for heavy shields? Chop off a wing or a nose and add more beam weapons, ion bombs, or shield sapping missiles. Getting hassled by people welding on too much armor? Toss some cannons on there and start cutting components off the enemy, or melt their armor off with volumetric acid clouds!You heard me right. You can steal components from your enemies. If you notice a particular captain has that one module you’ve been after for a while, fight him, focus fire on it, and make it yours! Just remember that there are only 200 other people for you to interact with, and that they all know each other, and they’ll all remember what you did. Running around wrecking people up might make you the biggest, baddest ship on the block the fastest, but it’ll make it harder to build up your faction if you’re reckless. This is just one example of something I made:


Space Pirates and Zombies 2 
A Screenshot of Space Pirates and Zombies 2
By: Insignus




I personally found this game to be pretty fun, but I do have to note the criticism that many fans of the original SPAZ have raised. In particular, you’ll note that some other reviews are often negative in this regard. It is true that SPAZ 2 is not a direct, carbon copy sequel of SPAZ.  I should note, however, that the original SPAZ, when first released, did not have many of the defining features it has now, features which many people felt made the game a truly unique and engaging experience. The Developers took the extra time to add those features, and listened to the community over a few years before SPAZ became what it is today.Finally, I also have say this is one of the most complete and least crash-prone Early Access games I’ve ever played, especially from such a small studio. The campaign mode is complete, and a majority of the promised features have been demonstrated. That said, the game did have a rocky start with some tuning and balance issues, but the Devs do appear to be responsive to concerns raised by the community.Overall, I’d give this game an 8.7/10, with a caveat that it is an Early Access game, and that there are very promising signs and clear opportunities for the game to expand and grow. I definitely recommend that you buy this game, or at least check out the demo videos on the store page.I hope you found this review helpful!			"

Early Access Review
								This is an Early Access Review, and subject to change upon release.I played the original SPAZ for even more hours than is currently logged by Steam, due to being offline for extended periods and playing across multiple platforms...which makes the actual number pretty scary. So, to me, this game has quite a bit to live up to. And did it ever. Below, please find a (mostly) unbiased view of the game:The comeback is absolutely fantastic. How I've missed my SPAZ, let me count the ways. The gameplay is very reminiscent of SPAZ of days past, while bringing several new elements to the table:+Choice of scalable 3rd person or top down views (They're both fun to use, and each has its use.)+200 different NPC captains with personal agendas.+NPCs remember your past transgressions, as well as kindnesses, and react accordingly in real time.+Fully fluid ship building. You are only limited by the available ""Cores"" in Campaign Mode.+Interactive Loot (You have to play it to understand....imagine a mace made of loot. (Or an asteroid, for that matter.)+On the fly ship repair (to a point), and destructible (and lootable/equippable on the fly) enemy ship components.While I love the game, there are a few things that bug me:-Repetitive battles sequences.-Lack of NPC depth. I don't feel attached to any of them.-Different factions don't feel different. They only have different names. They don't act differently, or have any kind of faction specific agendas.-Lack of Side Quests/Lore.-Only one real ""Boss Fight""While I enjoyed the story, I feel somehow shorted on the content of said story. Original SPAZ made us love off-color NPCs. I see the descendants of those NPCs, but I don't feel that they've been fleshed out properly, nor allowed us the personal ""quest"" interaction to make those NPCs a part of the gameplay, other than a witty one-liner here and there. I miss the story that gave us the NPCs. While this game is full of action, it does, sadly, lack in depth.Overall, I would certainly recommend this game to anyone looking for a space shooter, sarcastic humor, or someone that enjoys the game of ""Risk"".

Early Access Review
								If you were into the original, this is definitely right up your alley.PRO: - Heavy graphics overhaul for the ship-to-ship battles- Greatly improved combat system; easily designate targets for strike craft; switch between different weapons or have them fire automatically; can manually target (or ram) individual ship systems to disable engines, weapons, etc.- Modular mothership construction allows for far more weapon combinations than any ship from SPAZ- Multiple factions, can put out bounties, can construct allied starbases- Resource harvesting is way less grindy compared to SPAZCON:- Outside of battles, everything takes place on a Geometry Wars-esque overworld map- The UI could use a lot of quality-of-life tweaks (e.g. stat icons aren't super intuitive, awkward overworld navigation through ship menus, difficult to differentiate identical-appearing ship components without more obvious stat view)- Modular ship construction is a total PITA since parts have to be tractor-beamed onto ship slots one by one, rather than something reasonable like choosing them from a list with at-a-glance information- The customizable squad of ships is totally gone!!! Although your meticulously constructed mothership is piloted into battle and can be manually controlled (like all ships), the smaller ships are now ""strike craft"" that function like expendable equipment. They cannot be customized and cannot be replaced if destroyed. It's balanced out by them being ubiquitously available in shops and as loot, but losing this mechanic was the most disappointing aspect of SPAZ 2 for me.Overall, I'd hesitantly recommend this for fans of SPAZ - just make sure you understand it has a much different feel from the first game. Personally, I hope the game gets rebalanced during early access to bring some of the best elements from SPAZ 1 back to their former glory.			"

Early Access Review
								12 hours of gameplay in, only 1 restart. Still haven't gone very far in the story due to a few nagging issues. The Good - Responsive controls - Deep mechanics - Always something going on - UPDATE: Amazing turnaround. Devs are actively fixing these things. This game is NOT dead in the water just because it hit EA. The Neutral - Same SPAZ humor/tone. I personally love it, but it's not for everyone. The Bad - Minmax dropped the ball on a few design elements which I'm hoping are an early access gripe and not a real one.  - As it is currently, the Reputation system is arcane and misleading at best, and downright broken at worst. Characters that are friendly (50 personal rep, 20 faction rep) will gladly ignore the fact you just got double-teamed by a faction you both hate. At the same time, the game stresses that ""every captain remembers everything"", while not actually holding grudges or acting according to events. - Plenty of early access unpolished bits. No key prompts on the fail-gates leading to a trip to the input screen during a firefight. HORRIBLE conveyance on things like goon requirements and how progression of a starbase works. - Battlewagon mode is buggy as all hell. About 3 hours in I started ""Wagon-dancing"" by hitting the battlewagon key to have it issue orders to strike craft and missile systems, then immediately overriding it to manual-fire weapons according to their cooldowns. The reason I started doing this was primarily a sense of frustration with its targeting priorities. Lock onto a ship and the gun turrets totally ignore it in favor of a different ship that happens to be just outside of your firing angle, which is blows your cooldowns trying ineffectually to hit (I know WHY it does it: The thing I want to hit isn't quite in range, so it goes for something that WAS in range at the moment I locked on, but it's too slow to realize that the thing isn't even on that side of my ship anymore) The Ugly - Unclear choice of aesthetics. SPAZ2 is at its heart an exploration and growth game, so why does my ship look equally ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 12 hours in as it did when I was scrounging for junk? There is already a 0-5 star quality system for parts in place, use it to determine how ""closely"" a piece sticks to the ship or something. 0 star and junk parts? Float those suckers next to the ship like they are currently. 5 star? Break out a blend tool and stick that component ON the ship. It doesn't have to look amazing. It just has to look like I'm not using scrapyard material. - Certain voice assets are VERY out of place and/or disturbing. Random bandits will scream ""PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME TAKE MY MEDICINE NO PLEASE"", seemingly without provocation. Coming from games like Borderlands, disturbed bandit characters and their meatbicycles usually don't bother me in the least, but this is just...upsetting. Some of the lines here just feel raw and uncomfortable, not based on a particular headspace or characterization. Wearing my flesh as a suit? Works for me. Paint your ship with my blood? Great! Complaining that your hands look like balloons? Sure! It's like the airlock humor in SPAZ. Why add this other line that is nothing like the rest, is very emotionally voice-acted, and has no bearing whatsoever on the game or the bandits as characters?All-in-all, a beautiful and playable early access that FEELS like development was stalled to throw a ton of polish on it so it would catch people's eyes during early access. You can tell that there aren't any broken underlying systems here though...just unfinished ones. Early Access done right.			"

								As a huge fan of SPAZ1, I really could not hold back my excitement for SPAZ2. I constantly checked in, and then even still check into the Steam Page when it popped up, checked the forums, and just couldn't wait. I mean, really, I had no choice, so I waited, and much to my surprise, it is everything AND THEN MORE, that I wanted, when I saw they were making the jump to 3D. I don't have as much time in it, as I really would like to. Though I do intend to dump far more. But for now, even at this point in Early Access, I feel it is a step above a lot of Indie Games, and for Space Exploration and Combat, there is nothing like it, in my opinion, with the same feel and ease of picking up and playing.

Early Access Review
								What to expect;The campaign mode so far feels like a tutorial for the sandbox mode which is likely where most of us will be spending the majority of our hours. Compared to SPAZ 1, they've done away with the hundreds of star systems and mindless grind of unlocking all the gateways. Instead you have your overhead view of the galaxy where you fly to your destinations in real time with all the other 200 captains and raiders. You collect/steal resources from nodes from here. The best places to raid are other captains but this comes with greater risk and a history of behavior. The biggest problem with this is that some captains start with a much higher level and easily crush you if provoked.The real game play is the spacial combat. The typical shield/armor/hull composition returns with the typical laser/cannon/missile counters but feels very generic at the early levels. A neat new mechanic is that you can blow pieces off enemy ships and weaken them in real time but I find that by the time this starts to happen they're already sure to die. It looks cool too.What's particularly horrible is the random infestation chance where zombies invade your battles and become more threatening than you and your opponent could handle combined but there's plenty of hotfixes coming to deal with balance issues and bugs in the early access.You can even start your own colony and recruit other captains but it's terribly grindy and maybe even necessary later in the game. What the game is really missing are random missions popping up. The system works well to contain itself but could use some chaos to liven it up.The best and worst part of the game is the ship design. It's left entirely in your own hands to create your own mothership and equip it with the weapons you want to use. And every AI captain does this as well offering an array of unique ships to combat. The problem however lies in finding the pieces with the right weapons on them. Flying from base to base hoping they have what you want or need can be frustating when you constantly turn up nothing.The game definitely lacks some polish where many features that exist could easily have more meat on them but there's a lot of potential that shouldn't be too difficult to add later on.The worst part of this game has to be the current level-up system. It's nice that you can increase your overall ship size but you can pick one out of three randomly generated upgrades which can impare your intended play style. This is one feature I'd love to see reworked.There's also the missing mass of tiny jetisoned goons and rez to collect in battles. "

								I have played this game up to level 15 and I must say I have not enjoyed it at all and I really wanted to. The combat is basic, the controls are lacking and sometimes do not make sence when turning. The gameplay is shallow, the building of your ship is just totally unnecessary and just plain annoying.I feel the graphics are just awful and the artstyle is terrible, the speech (ok its early access and its not implemented but after 10+ hours of listening to the computer voice i want to kill myself). Even the music is terrible.I kept going for the next objective almost wanting it to break free of its core gameplay and turn into a great game but alas it did not. I even thought owning a starbase would be great and that turned into a major dissapointment.I think there is a great game somewhere among the basic idea of this but it fails on so many levels it is just a grind and boring game with no real goals and feeling of achievement.Ohh and the threat level....its a joke.

								Hmm. I'm not sure. It certainly kept the philisophy of the previous game, and the game plays ok. But I don't entirely understand what there is to do. Aside from some minor side things, there are three main things to do:1. Gather resources.2. Fight random bandits.3. Fight ranom non-bandits.It's sort of a disconnected mesh of everything.There is this mission called ""pick a side"" (or something along those lines) but the only way to get enough stature with any of the alliances is to fight bandits, or bribe the members. It sounds ""ok"" but I spent three hours fighting bandits and barely got any more rep with them.But also, with the largest possible resolution, and highest working settings, I still cannot tell what the hell is going on in the actual field of battle. Half of the battles I win just ... randomly. Not really doing anything, just flying around and suddenly either I am dead or my enemy.Overall, I'd still recommend it because it does really remind me of SPAZ 1 and it does bring an interesting gameplay setting and design, but the actual mechanics are kind of ""ok"" and the visual design is kind of messy.Also - this is an early review so everything lags like balls, but my computer pulls through once I lower some of the post-processing stuff.

								SInce nobody is going to read this anyway, I'll just make some short points.Pro's- Good and funny dialog.- Lore entries that give more detail about charachters and the world.Neutral- Wingmen less stupid than the first game, but still mostly useful as a distraction.- Use the not recommended control scheme instead of the recommended one.Con's- The 2d map implemented to reduce the grind, has resulted in an even more awful and booring grind than the first game.- All elements feel like a grind, be it getting resources or get a good enough reletionship with ""individual"" members of the faction you want to join, in order to join them.- Research has been simplified to boosting one of 6 stats.- While there are a fair amount of weapons, they all feel the same in combat. Part of this might be because they don't have much of an oomph to them. The lag of feedback and numbers in combat doesn't help.- Max 4 ships can fight eachother. This makes combat fairly unepic and if 3 captains gang up on a 4th, it is impossible for anyone to help the 4th captain.- No more missions or special events except for a few in the campaign. You either fight a few strikecraft (raid), other motherships (not as epic as it sounds like) or a starbase.- Said motherships look terrible with the way parts are stuck together.- You can focus individual parts to force the enemy mothership to eject it and then get it as loot. This sounds great, but rarely happens outside of arena (where you don't get the part), either due to the enemy running from you and because of the spawn distance you won't get much of a chance to damage them or your allies just blow them up before you can ""dismantle"" them.I can't recommend SPAZ 2 as a sequal or as a game unless you really wan't more of the story and lore. Hopefully the devs can figure out a way to make the game more appealing than apalling			"

								This game is fun in its own way, however, many people like me that have had this game on their wishlist for years are kind of dissapointed. This game focuses more on your own single ship that you build with modules that you find, buy, or scavenge off of the dead enemies (even during battle). The original ships of spaz having been turned into strike ships (basically drones) that through leveling up you can have more and more accompany you into battle. The combat is fun except for the fact that the game rewards building very long ships and punishes building wide ships. With how the modular construction works you are better off making a needle of a ship since doing so enables you to cram as many weapons into your ship as possible. Since no matter how tanky you build your craft to be the enemy will get through given enough time, it makes no sense to even try based on the balance in the game regarding offense/defense technology that you will find.They had this issue temporarily fixed when they added in a sandbox check box that was OPTIONAL for players to use but then they took it away so now it is back to the same old crap of having to just choose function over form....because nobody wants a ship that actually looks decent and can wreck face right?The other thing that I have found is that when trying to find certain parts the RNG definitely works against you as you will search for a long time and maybe end up only finding meiocre nonstar versions of a part you want that make you choose between that weapon or the entirely better stats of a five star part.To date I have found 1 and only 1 ship piece with the krule weapon on it and it was a nonstar variant that would have made me lose 30 shield, and 20 capacitor to start with.They have taken cloaking out the equation entirely from the fighting as there isn't any form of it to be found in the game so gone are the days of hit and run. They are talking about adding Starmap cloaking which is basically you just running around the map with a peace flag so nobody will attack you though so some might argue that it does have some form of it.Don't expect to use your goons all that much in this game. Goons in this game are just more of a currency than an actual resource in SPAZ 2. In SPAZ you could use goons actively in battle to actually fight off the infection, board enemy ships, and trade as a resource. In this game they are basically just treated as a resource. It costs goons to ""cleanse"" your infected parts of the ship rather than having them fight infection like in the first one where crew level actually was a thing so higher level meant better results from your crew fighting it. Here it is just a flat cost based on the percent of the infection.I have beaten a sandbox game with all the stuff set to be hard as possible. The 203 threat zombie star base was easy to beat in all but one aspect. Zombies have a rediculous damaging oort cloud that they can deploy that does a rediculous amount of damage in a short period of time. The zombies in SPAZ 1 had a good hard counter by way of the crew being able to be leveled up to resist them as well as the soft counter of increased shield.TLDR The above shpeal is my own opinion. I do not recommend the game because it has ended up turning into a bland game compared to the original. It is like the devs wanted to add in MOAR mechanics but ended up falling very short in all of them.Yes I have high hours in this game only because when they added in the Double Core mode I could actually have fun building goodlooking and efficient ships as opposed to the stale 15 core efficiency or nothing style they have reverted to.

								This game is interesting, but does not feel finished. They've simplifed combat in favor of strategy, but the strategy layer is too shallow to support multiple playthroughs. There just isn't very much to explore as a player.1) Tractor systemThe devs were clearly very excited about and proud of their tractor system, but it feels gimmicky and awkward in each case. In combat, using the tractor disables ship movement and weapons, and lets you fling objects at yourself, friendlies or enemies. It feels very odd given that no other ship can do this, and feels like an interruption of the tactical positioning/work I was doing before and after. 2) Ship management,The tractor system as ship building is just... bizarre. The screen doesn't present you any information relevant to making a decision (you must find and mouse over each floating piece of gear individually, and memorize those numbers), and involves a pool table physics system that is just frustrating and.... bizarre.3) Camera controlsAnd again, the devs were clearly very excited about and proud of the fact that spaz2 is 3d, but they amount to 'cinematic mode' and are a crippled perspective for decision making.4) Game flow.Ultimately the game boils down to 'make other captains like you to get powerful'.Any ship captains that you've ticked off will continuously drain your resources and distract you from your main goal.There is no fear/respect concept. The more you attack other captains, the more stubbornly they'll come at you again and again - there is no killing them, there is no 'defeating' them. The only way to get a captain to stop attacking you, raiding you, and putting bounties on you or your friends is to get him to join you.So while there are interesting mechanics for war/attacking/etc, they seem like game systems without a purpose. Why would I go to war with the captains? Any reputation damage I do I will have to fix later.			"

								Hmm. I'm not sure. It certainly kept the philisophy of the previous game, and the game plays ok. But I don't entirely understand what there is to do. Aside from some minor side things, there are three main things to do:1. Gather resources.2. Fight random bandits.3. Fight ranom non-bandits.It's sort of a disconnected mesh of everything.There is this mission called ""pick a side"" (or something along those lines) but the only way to get enough stature with any of the alliances is to fight bandits, or bribe the members. It sounds ""ok"" but I spent three hours fighting bandits and barely got any more rep with them.But also, with the largest possible resolution, and highest working settings, I still cannot tell what the hell is going on in the actual field of battle. Half of the battles I win just ... randomly. Not really doing anything, just flying around and suddenly either I am dead or my enemy.Overall, I'd still recommend it because it does really remind me of SPAZ 1 and it does bring an interesting gameplay setting and design, but the actual mechanics are kind of ""ok"" and the visual design is kind of messy.Also - this is an early review so everything lags like balls, but my computer pulls through once I lower some of the post-processing stuff.

								Space Pirates And Zombies 2 is pretty good. It's a combination of Mount and Blade, Rebel Galaxy, and Captain Forever.Mount and Blade: Join a faction or aspire to create your own, either way you start little more than a lone wimp in a land of extreme danger.Rebel Galaxy: Fly your mothership on a 2d plane using WASD controls.Captain Forever: Your mothership will find its strength in the rubble of your enemies.It does has some balance issues at the moment, but the developers are working hard to address them. The story mode is fairly short, but the sandbox mode allows you to control exactly how hard the galaxy will smack you around.			"

								I don't review games often. As a newbie to spaz not playing the original I'm unable to comment if it's an improvement.  The game isn't perfect, but as an early release it's pretty damn good. I'm sure I'm going to get many many more hours on this. I hope they had more features, such as have more mother ships, more 'galaxy's' so once you conquer this one you can move on. I'd also like to be able to build ships on starwars or star trek style more in the future and maybe a pop facility Anyway great game, worth the few quid. Great job guys.			"

Early Access Review
								I spent hundreds of hours on SPAZ 1, so I'm somewhat disappointed by this early access (v0.7) initially.- No level-up builds like stealth+missiles or bombs-focused etc. All high level characters will end up with the same skills- All cores are similiar with minor differences, 10% more shields or capacitors etc.- Various icons are annoying and no easy way to see your ship stats. Especially weapons, need to hover piece by piece- Can't search for crafts- Not enjoying in-battle ship building. Never done it much since weapons dont fire when the tractor beam is on.- Out-of-battle ship building is annoying. There should be an easier-way to rebuild ships outside of battle, the tractor mini-game gets very repetitive after a while- Battles not epic enough with the 4 mothership limit. Crafts seems too minor and weak to have any major impact.- No matter how I play, my crafts always ends up getting wiped out first. After clearing the enemy ships it's annoying to have to hunt down those minor crafts 1 by 1 for a win. After a while I just alt-tab out and let battle-wagon do the job.- Overall not as fun as SPAZ 1, game feels more like Captain Forever HD remake.Having said that, this game is still heavily recommended. It's a very well made game and even this early access is way more playable than all the other games out there. I probably had too much fun with SPAZ 1 and came into this with unrealistic expectations. Looking forward to full release.			"

								SPAZ 2 takes some of the themes and visual elements of the first SPAZ and combines them with an overarching style of gameplay that is reminds me of a less-deep Mount & Blade--you spend time and resources building up yourself (ie your ship) and eventually your own faction.If you're hoping for more of the first one, you won't exactly find it here.  The space combat is kind of weak but if you enjoy mostly open-ended gameplay that lets you build up yourself and your empire and want it in a space flavor, SPAZ 2 may be worth checking out.			"

								Even though SPAZ2 is still in early access, it really doesn't feel like it.  I've gone through the full story line without encountering a single bug!  The story is interesting, the caracters are ridiculous & funny and the combat instances are amazing.  SPAZ2 is more like a 4X game than the adventure type game that SPAZ1 was, but I have to admit that I enjoyed taking over territory & building my own empire.  I can't wait to see what the developpers will add in upcoming updates.  Solid 9 out of 10.  I definitly recommend it.			"

								SPAZ2 represents a evolution of the existing formula of SPAZ. The combat is greatly improved and the campaign/sandbox map have effectively adopted a mount-and-blade esque design. The game in its current state is clearly made to a high standard, but is somewhat lacking in sheer content, something that is to be expected at this stage of development.			"

								Love the game so far, enjoying the simplicity of the star map and the ability to use tactics in the battles, (only ordering your strike ships or the smaller ones) however I would like to be able to suggest actions to fellow captains during battle so they dont fly straight in and get blown up right away. Most of the time they try to retreat when its too late and end up being destroyed before they finish their retreat statement. However, it is possible to win fights even outnumbered and outgunned if you plan accordingly and build your ship well. More guns arnt always better. Still a fun game and looking forward to updates that I hope will add more to the game.			"

								Space.... Pirates.... Zombies...Nailed it in 3 words... Good game.If you're after MP. Don't bother :)When playing [0.8.4] The game is well paced and with story line i leveled and got enough scrap in order to pregress and quickly take on the zombie faction. After doing so, i continued on and took over the who map.Whilst doing this 0.8.6 came out. One of the updates was capital ships, When collecting the stash, my money almosy shot up to a million. Playing Open gameThe game has been slow to get my first starbase established, playing on hard difficulty and somehow managed to already♥♥♥♥♥♥off a lot of people. Many bounties have been placed up on me, though i have a couple of loycal boys that fly with me. Attempting to play slowly in order to level up everything as much as possible, though, from single player i already know what i am after.I think a larger map for a custom game map should be added for prolonged play (especially hoping that Multiplayer will be availabe on next version)Some people have said they find escpaing a fight hard. It isn;t it's just time consuming. Send your ships to distract the enemy and fly towards the gate. Wait there for about 10 seconds and you get out, though will be punished.I will update this with multiplayer update.			"

								The writing, design, graphics, and gameplay are wonderful. The characters you know and love from SPAZ are back and just as awesome as before. (I ♥♥♥♥ing love Carl) This game takes everything that was great about the original and improves upon it... Except for one thing... My only complaint at this point is how short the game is. I finished the main story line in about 20 hours, and I could have easily finished it in about 16. ***SPOILERS***Almost as soon as you are done with the basic missions which teach you how to play the game, you are given the task of defeating the infection. All this takes is leveling up to the point you can kill the ""Main"" zombie base. This is the end of the game.*END SPOILERS*This pales in comparison to the original game which had a longer and much more interesting storyline. SPAZ 2 is a great game, I can't stress enough how good the gameplay, customization, and graphics are...But lacks the meat to fill my gaming stomach. That being said I would still recommend this game, just know you are going to get about 20 hours of gameplay until they hopefully add more. "

Early Access Review
								I spent hundreds of hours on SPAZ 1, so I'm somewhat disappointed by this early access (v0.7) initially.- No level-up builds like stealth+missiles or bombs-focused etc. All high level characters will end up with the same skills- All cores are similiar with minor differences, 10% more shields or capacitors etc.- Various icons are annoying and no easy way to see your ship stats. Especially weapons, need to hover piece by piece- Can't search for crafts- Not enjoying in-battle ship building. Never done it much since weapons dont fire when the tractor beam is on.- Out-of-battle ship building is annoying. There should be an easier-way to rebuild ships outside of battle, the tractor mini-game gets very repetitive after a while- Battles not epic enough with the 4 mothership limit. Crafts seems too minor and weak to have any major impact.- No matter how I play, my crafts always ends up getting wiped out first. After clearing the enemy ships it's annoying to have to hunt down those minor crafts 1 by 1 for a win. After a while I just alt-tab out and let battle-wagon do the job.- Overall not as fun as SPAZ 1, game feels more like Captain Forever HD remake.Having said that, this game is still heavily recommended. It's a very well made game and even this early access is way more playable than all the other games out there. I probably had too much fun with SPAZ 1 and came into this with unrealistic expectations. Looking forward to full release.			"

								Space Pirates And Zombies 2 is pretty good. It's a combination of Mount and Blade, Rebel Galaxy, and Captain Forever.Mount and Blade: Join a faction or aspire to create your own, either way you start little more than a lone wimp in a land of extreme danger.Rebel Galaxy: Fly your mothership on a 2d plane using WASD controls.Captain Forever: Your mothership will find its strength in the rubble of your enemies.It does has some balance issues at the moment, but the developers are working hard to address them. The story mode is fairly short, but the sandbox mode allows you to control exactly how hard the galaxy will smack you around.			"

								Like what other reviews have mentioned, this reminds me a lot about Mount & Blade, but in a space theme.You have a big world with factions and non-factions, with members roaming around looking for fight.As you progress with the storyline, join them in fights to get friendly, and vice versa.Other Pros includes nice storyline, gameplay, audio, lots of customization available among other things.I can only see them getting better with more updates, and once proper voice-over this should be even better.As of now, it's very playable. 8/10.P.S.

								Really enjoyed this game, first off.  It is in early access when I write this and it definitely could use some balancing to fine tune it but I can say without a doubt that this is a keeper.  It has a different ship system than in SPAZ1, but there's a ton of customization that you can put into your ship and the faction system and allowing you to play the game like a quasi-4X game for a while was an interesting touch.  You can tell that they're not afraid to mix up action with a bit strategy which I found pretty nice.    Oddly enough one of the best things I found in the game was their quirky sense of humor.  I laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off at some of the dialogue that happens in the game, it was just flat out entertaining.  I'd give it a 7.5/10 but with a little bit of polishing and additions to the starbases and empire building this could easily turn to a 9.  Game is a steal for 20 bucks.			"

								SPAZ 2 takes some of the themes and visual elements of the first SPAZ and combines them with an overarching style of gameplay that is reminds me of a less-deep Mount & Blade--you spend time and resources building up yourself (ie your ship) and eventually your own faction.If you're hoping for more of the first one, you won't exactly find it here.  The space combat is kind of weak but if you enjoy mostly open-ended gameplay that lets you build up yourself and your empire and want it in a space flavor, SPAZ 2 may be worth checking out.			"

								Even though SPAZ2 is still in early access, it really doesn't feel like it.  I've gone through the full story line without encountering a single bug!  The story is interesting, the caracters are ridiculous & funny and the combat instances are amazing.  SPAZ2 is more like a 4X game than the adventure type game that SPAZ1 was, but I have to admit that I enjoyed taking over territory & building my own empire.  I can't wait to see what the developpers will add in upcoming updates.  Solid 9 out of 10.  I definitly recommend it.			"

								The game in its current state, for myself at least, is worth the $20 right now. I played the entire campaign over a weekend. 17 hours including me just enjoying the hell out of the gameplay loop. there was just enough content to keep me interested until the end of the campaign and there was still some weapons types I didn't even get around to testing.I never played the first SPAZ and now I kinda regret it. I loved every bit of this game, including the synth voices though some of them did get annoying like the limited dialog from the zombie alpha kept saying the same line over and over again during the end game. but the synth voices can always be turned off. Kinda hope they have an option to turn them on when they do add the real voices.The ship building mechanics are deep especially now with the synergies system and provide alot of design space for future modules and weapon types. The weapons are already varied with a wide selection of tactics and builds to sink your teeth into. Ramming the enemy ships is always fun, maybe a little too powerful though.Again I Recommend this game with high praise. I'm not saying that it doesn't need more stuff added but it already has just the right amount for me to fall in love with it on my first play through. I can't wait till they release this game so I can come back and play it on a higher diffuculty to expierience the game at it's finest. "

								A more combat orientated spaz with alot less grind!  Awesome!  If you never played spaz1, or did but didn't like it do not think this game will not be for you, this is very different game from SPAZ 1 in quite a few ways but they have kept the core concepts that made spaz great and they have removed some of the things spaz didn't do so well.The humour and the fun are still very present but they have removed a great deal of the grind that so many people do not like. Getting the resources you need is a whole lot less grindy, you can simply harvest from the map or get rewards from combat. These rewards can be pure resources or module for you ship.The main difference is your mothership is now the ship you fly. You still have the hanger bays and you can get ships to use, but they fly with you as wing men.  These are unlocked the same way as in spaz1 where you collect the blueprints from destroyed ships.  There is not as much customization of these hanger ships as in spaz1 but they are not your main focus anymore, instead upgrading your mothership is.Upgrading the mothership is only part of it really, you also get to build the mother ship using a modular system.  The posabilities are endless and as you progress you can build bigger and bigger ships.  This is a much more engaging customization experence than the spaz1 module fitting to your hanger ships was.I hate long reviews so will leave it here, there is so much more I could tell you but really the best thing to do is buy the game and find out for yourself!

Huge variety of components to play around with means there are a huge variety of different ships to build, although it may take a while to get the components for your dream build .Nice mix of strategic elements and the zombie infestation serves as a great late game challenge.The core space battle gameplay is really fun so the game never feels like a grind, even when you are churning through battle after battle to earn scrap.

								So I played SPAZ 1 and thought it was pretty good if a bit limited. I am coming to understand how much more complex SPAZ  2 is, while maintaining most of the feel of the first game. The graphics are a Major improvement and I enjoy combat from the new prospective, but I do feel the top down feel did suffer a bit from the transition. Overall and most importantly it is more fun and less grindy than the first game, and the Devs seem to be onboard with fan suggestions and have had a ton of activity on the forum. I grew to respect the team working on this game playing SPAZ  and now play SPAZ 2 I know they are on the way to a new classic in the genre.			"

								SPAZ2 is very different from SPAZ1. This review may contain spoilers, no specifics just layout of the game stuff. -Campaign is very... loose. By that I mean that there are less then 10 missions and you simply have to strengthen yourself up for then go and fight. This means that you will be spending the bulk of your time picking on a faction or hunting unaffliated captains, bandits, or zombies. I'll definitely play through it again when the main dialogues have been voice-overed just to hear it.-Game itself is 3D; however play is still 2D. In other words, everything is on the same plane but you can look up or down. Being 3D doesn't contribute to combat much at all, the only things I've seen are wrecked ships sinking up/down and missiles/pods being intercepted somewhere above or below you. Asteroids are pretty annoying to fly into.-Ship construction is modular. You basically have to hope you get a wing/engine/nose with the weapon you want. For me that meant just getting into combat constantly and praying to god I got something with drones on it. Very different from having to acquire blueprints. Your ship is, as advertised, truly a collection of parts you've found. -You basically can't play with your shield down. WHAT I MEAN: Your shield dropping is the #1 way to frustrate you on this game. When your shield is down, the parts on your ship can be broken off, and from what I can tell likely never recoverable. What this meant for me was everytime I lost an important part (my nose drones), I just reloaded the most recent Autosave so I could keep the piece. There is seriously no reason to fight without a shield, and it honestly makes things monotonous. Starbases are a pain since they seem to have 12+ lasers on them so killing them is a game of patience instead of an incredible battle. -Rez consumption is very light at first, but quickly gets out of hand. If you always fly on the slowest mode you'll easily have too much of it. I finished my game with 5000 rez; I only used it to chase down ships since I knew I could just chase until I exhausted their reserves of rez. I'm sure I could comment on more but those are the main things. I would enjoy stealth missions again; the mission on SPAZ1 where you had to be cloaked and escort some ship or some hoo hah was very thrilling and frustrating but in a good way. That being said I don't think cloaking could really be implemented with the game how it is. I'm not sure I could recommend this game in it's current shape, I hope Minmax can take all the feedback they are receiving and polish it into something great! I'll play through again in a couple of months and maybe update this if I remember!			"

								Space Pirates and Zombies 2 is a huge amount of fun.  It's a great mix of action-y space battles, blowing up other ships and looting their wrecks, and open sandbox exploration.The ship construction is one of the most unique set of mechanics I've seen, and it's a lot of fun to play around with ship layouts and loadouts - especially once you start getting your hands on bigger and better modules.The open-world portion of the game is really free-flowing, encouraging exploration and movement right away, and there's lots of stuff to discover and use as you go.The story and world-building are as interesting (and delightfully quirky) as in the first game, and finding all the Lore entries quickly becomes a rewarding task on its own merit.There's minimal grinding or travelling in loops for resource collection and progression - the story does a good job of giving guidance through the early stages of play, and just exploring drove progression.  I never felt like I needed to hang around a small starter area or avoid engaging with the larger game.All in all, if you like sandboxes and spaceships, this game is definitely worth your time!			"

The size of the galaxy is much smaller, combat is somewhat different, and instead of moving to bigger ships you have a modular ship which I wasn't sure I would like. If I think of this more as a game in the same universe and not as the second in a series of games I love then I love SPAZ 2, but it's not really SPAZ 2 in my mind.The story however is much improved, even when read by robots.

								Steering clear of the plethora of knee jerk ""THIS SEQUEL IS AMAZING"" reviews that came out the same day SPAZ 2 went EA, Id have to say whilst it is good, It feels shallow compared to it predecessor. Yes it has lots of visual bling. But the TINY starmap accompanied by the minimalist ship construction mechanics leaves me feeling like this game is a shallow representation of its forbear. The franchise has traded depth, length and complexity for graphics and polish. The first step in addressing this would be introduce weapon hard points like the original to allow for a much higher level of customization. YES, we can swap ship cores and wings etc, but I feel this doesn't allow the diverse range of combinations SPAZ offered. Its a sequel, they have added many new features, the new ship combat being my favourite. But they have not included some of the best parts of the original. You don't need to make it look like a AAA title. Just make in faithful to its predecessor. You already had a strong fan base purely on that game alone.  I really can't help but feel they took this game in entirely the wrong direction.Do I still reccomend this game? Yes I do; but only becuase it is fun to play as a stand alone, not becuase I enjoy it as a SPAZ game.			"

								***EDIT*** That big update that was released made me come back to my review. The game is now significantly more challenging. And if you think its too easy theres a whole mess of ways to modify the game to make it even harder. Im still bummed about the perk system. Its just a percentage imrpovement thing every level that really doesnt change game play much. And eventually everyone ends up in the same spot regardless of the path you took. Ill still compare it to the first SPAZ that a specialized skill system would've been better. More modules at the expense of weaker engine abilities, bigger guns but smaller ship or weaker shields. Pretty much its a grind to get the most scrap and then buy the best stuff. Not terrible but not the best. But I still have almost 70hrs in this game and about to go again....so I mean youre going to get your monies worth thats for damn sure. ***OLD***My biggest complaint is they took away the real RPG elements. And at this moment the single player campaign is actually very short. In fact I think they could have ditched the story completely and just expanded sandbox mode. Which is very fun. Bigger map, more factions, ships, tech, etc. Anyways, the rpg disapearing was frustrating. If you take 2 player both at lvl1, 5, 15, or 30 there won't be much difference in their abilities. Their ships sure but for the most part perks dont change regardless of what you have picked before. Unlike the first game that if you really wanted some strong weapons or abilities you needed to specialize mid game. Ive burned about 30 hours on this game but mostly on sandbox. Its fun to mess with the different settings but end game needs work. Once you get some decent weapons its a cake walk.			"

								The game is completely level and equipment based and not very skill based. Obviously, it helps to know what to do and what not to do, but in terms of fighting someone of higher level than you... you're going to get owned. No matter what I do, I cannot attack other captains of higher threat than me, at least not without some bait... I mean help. It's really frustrating because the Story tells me I need to be level 15 to complete a certain mission on the other side of the galaxy, I'm level 18 with a fully decked out ship, yet I cannot complete the mission since it involves attacking a mothership of equal rank as me AND attack the base of high defensive rank, both being within range of attacking me... 2 vs 1, how can they expect me to win a battle like that, especially when they flood the area with overpowered drones? I can't dodge attacks because I'm a mothership... I just soak up the damage while shooting at one of the 2 large enemies. I think I'll probably need to be level 22 before I can do that mission, even then, it'll probably be a close fight.But with that said, I still can't give the game a thumbs down. It is still in the early access stage of development and the game is kind of addictive... so it's not a waste of money. Besides, I bought it during a good sale.EDIT: I've completed the entire story (all achievements), and overall, I think the game isn't worth the full asking price. If I could give this review a middle ground rating, I would. There's a lot of balance issues with the game, and like I said, it doesn't matter how good you think you can be at this game, you'll still die just as quickly even if you were a noob. Which brings me onto multiplayer. We're expecting to see a vs mode in multiplayer soon. I can't imagine it being any good at all since the winner will simply be the one who chose the better ship design and not at all about who has more experience and skill in the game. Which means, there will be forum discussions about the best possible ship designs per play styles, and everyone will just stick with those designs. And I doubt there would be many effective designs.I think the story barely added anything interesting to the game. The last fight was probably the only part that was interesting about it.			"

								This is definitely not the same as SPAZ, but it's definitely fun in its' own way. I didn't give this a serious playthrough until after I became more comfortable with the whole modular vehicle building system. Recent updates have made this a lot less painful. Also, I find that having played TerraTech previously helped me get into the right mindset. After you get into it, it's quite enjoyable.			"

								Very fun. Wish there was more content so I could play it more.The zombie fight mechanics are interesting (parts of your ship get infected, and the infection spreads, which makes you have to choose between a steadily declining health bar and ejecting infected-but-necessary parts) but ejecting parts in the middle of a battle is too difficult to be practical and the whole thing can be pretty easily beaten with a bunch of goons, which are plentiful.Some of the parts shopping and installation interfaces need work. Overlong and frustrating that the buy and the build are seperate screens.There's no voice acting there but the synthesized dialogue has its own weird charm. Excited for the future of this game.			"

								This game constantly surprized me as to how good it was and wanted to give the developers my applause. I haven't completed the campaign yet.ProsGraphics -  explosions are beautiful, art style is brilliantStory -  i'm ususally a guy the skips the dialogue but this was funny and it made the technology and why people were doing what they were doing make senseShip configuration - out of all the space games you can configure a ship (I have played dozens) the design of the ship in SPAZ 2 has the biggest impact on game play. Also so many strategic possibilities.Campaign - Love creating empires. Really simple to control and doesn't take too much time from ship battlesConstantly surprised me as I went through the campaign/tutorial and extra features were introduced I kept on thinking to myself, thats so cool, what a great idea.ConsI wish you could have more than 4 ships big ships in a battle, although I sure that would break most computers.Although the tutorial and icon guides are great its still hard for me to follow what all the icons mean and how they improve the performance of an upgrade. I'm sure I just need more practise but I feel I am missing opportunities in making my ship peform better to my playstyleI'm excited to see how this series can evolve as its already a massive step from SPAZ. Well done! "

								It says something about SPAZ 2, that the synthesized voices used as placeholders have now been promised to be available as an option, once the ""real"" voice work has been done.  There's something about your ship's computer saying ""Kill!  Kill!  Kill!""  in a totally exuberant, yet totally robotic voice that about makes my hurt myself laughing every time I hear it.Gameplay:  Basically, ""Captain Forever Remix"" and the original ""SPAZ"" had a love child.Pros:- Nice look and graphics style, imo.- Pretty funny characters and plot that ties in well with SPAZ 1.- Pleasantly meaty combat.  Several strategies are viable, although some may not be optimal for all situations (starbases and multiplayer, specifically)!- Weapons are fun to use, and many let you literally dismember your opponents.  You can even grab those dismembered components and attach them to your ship mid-combat (or reattach them if they where yanked off of you), if they aren't destroyed!  You can even use the same tractor beam to grab rocks and debris and smash it into your enemy, which never really gets old.- Ramming is a completely workable, and in fact, rather strong tactic =D .- Cool ""Starmap"" light strategic layer in the single-player game (sandbox or campaign).- Like Captain Forever: Remix, you build your ship from ""Lego"" modules in any way you choose (if you have the parts ^^ ).- The sandbox mode has many adjustments, if you care for a (much!) harder game (or easier, for that matter).- Active, responsive devs.- Multiplayer support is otw!Cons (it's a work in progress, Bugs Happen™):- The AI is...a bit, er...challenged at times.  So far, that's my only real beef.			"

								I have to tell you, I don't write reviews often, but if you have any like of space capital ship battles with leviathans duking it out, this is going to be a must buy for you.  It isn't horribly complex but still has an element of strategy you have to incorporate into your ship designs.  The overworld strategic map reminds me ALOT of Mount and Blade, but with more depth, to where you actually start to ""hate"" certain captains.  All in all a good game and I am really curious to see what the eventual multiplayer will be like!			"

Early Access Review
								My initial review had me not recommending this. I had only played about 2 or 3 hours and I didn't really like it all all. I stopped for a few days and then I played this another 16+ hours as It eventually 'clicked' for me. My major complaint is, as most people, the combat. I miss the 2D topdown view; it was simplistic, but felt very natural to play and navigate. At this point, I got used to the 2.5D combat (you can go forward & backward, left & right, but not up & down). I still like the first better for combat, but I quickly adapted. Once I got used to it, I found it did not bother me too much at all. I have a few issues with the game so far. One is that many sections and icons are not well explained and took me a while to either figure it out, or find the answer on the forums. The learning curve is pretty steep trying. Another is that factions suck. What I mean is that faction members will raid your resources. For some rason I wouldn't have thought they would do that, or if they did, some of the resource would be siphoned back to me automatically. What is annoying is that there are consequences for you if you harvest their Rez/Scrap/Goon resources, but none for them if they raid yours. Difficulty reminds me of SPAZ 1. as in it is hard and you will likely die if you are not really careful. I am set at novice dificulty and the game still seems harder than it should be. You have to be at least 5 levels (threat, not XP) above your enemy. Threat is determined by your ship configuration; for example: more damage, bigger threat. The thing is that some configurations may show you as a high threat, but you die super quick. All missile launchers is going to suck compared to all cannons. Also, how you organize your ship cores can make a huge difference. I am finding this about as grindy as SPAZ 1, but still has a lot of charm to it only in a different way. If you give it a chance and expect a different game than the first, you may just like it.			"

								For being out as an early access game it is surprisingly well done. The combat and ship building is very intuitive. The Galaxy map takes a little getting used too, however it quickly becomes second nature in making judgements when it comes to resource gathering triage.It is currently with a few bugs and glitches. However, it is warly access. I expect it will only get better from here.			"

								It's a fresh take on the universe introduced in SPAZ 1. The writing and characters is great as expected. The game frequently had me in stiches.At first I didn't really like that as of right now dialogue is only available as text-to-speech but over time it grew on me. So much so that I wouldn't mind text-to-speech remaining as an option even after voice acting has been added.Which brings me to the Early Access. Aforementioned lack of voice acting is one of the only things that seem 'unfinished' about this. Core gameplay is absolutely solid, nothing seems amiss.The core mechanic of redesigning your ship out of partsIn conclusion, definitely worth a look if you're into the idea of a game in which you can broadside another spaceship, shoot parts of it off and then slap them onto your own ship on the fly. Or just literally throw space rocks or explosive barrels at the enemy ship (an actual recommended strategy).			"

								This was quite an enjoyable romp for me.  Towards the end of the campaign game when you finally achieve an optimal ship build and unlock the majority of perks, just about any single opponent is no match for you on normal difficulty and experience starts to roll in so fast that it's nearly meaningless.  Before that sweet spot, however, the game is rewarding and nail-biting, and simultaneously easy when played correctly and punishing when played incorrectly.The scope of the game -- literally the entire galaxy -- feels very, very small due to the degree of abstraction applied.  In all other ways, however, the game is grand, with gorgeous visuals for a small studio, decent music, and visceral and very satisfying combat.			"

								It is a 10 hour kind of game. No replay-ability at all. There is nothing to beat again - you get same perks every time, you will build same ship everytime.There is only one-layout to to win this game - only one rational way to build your ship - by using stuff that you salvaged from others or just going for 'spear' design.Most useful 'trick' - throwing space stuff with your mothercare-graviton-beam. And only one way to beat some hard battles and to keep your ship intact during hard battles. So you will have to master it. I loved story - but mostly trolling upon leveling ship - kudos for that =)But I did not found it funny when my allies/fleet didnt joined last battle - if I knew that, I could saved that couple hours.PS - I played 150+ hours to SPAZ and got all achievements there.

Early Access Review
								After about 25 hours of taking my time I finished the game.  I might have a few spoilers in this review, so read at your own risk.I understand this is early access and the SPAZ team is hard at work making an awesome game.  For that, I am truly grateful!  I really did enjoy the game and look forward to playing again after a few more updates.  It is certainly SPAZ 2.0...or maybe better to call it SPAZ, the sequel since the setting is after the first game.  As always, the dialogue is comical, easy to follow, and explains why everything is happening.  I had fun with it and can't wait for the voice acting to be finished and listen to it all again with proper voicing.PROS:  - The 3d like feel of the 2d battles is nice.  It took some getting used to for me.  My first several battles were top down just like the old SPAZ.  I eventually started using the newer battle view and really liked it at the end.  I rarely went to the top down satellite view at the end of the game.  - I felt like overall the fighting was mostly well balanced.- Felt like the old SPAZ, but upgraded.  If you liked SPAZ 1, then you will really like SPAZ 2.- Living Universe.  I really like a game that doesn't revolve around the player.  This universe exists and moves at it's own pace with our without you.  I think it's cool to see regions battle it out in war, make peace, and trade with each other.- A ton of equipment and modular ships.  I love a game that has options.  The more to play with the better.- The grinder for odds and ends and useless parts is cool.  Nice we scrap stuff out or get a bit of rez from infected parts.  Good add to the game.- The synergy idea was great.  I do wish there was a better in game explanation of how it worked.  I finally figured it out by watching someone's Youtube video right before I went into my final battle.- The universe is beautiful.  I enjoyed looking at the pretty stuff everywhere when I went into a fight.  I like the garbage laying around and general clutter.  - Having the NPCs witness actions is wonderful.  Having the relations go up and down for both the AI and player is awesome.  Goes with the living universe theme.  - The trade network is cool. See suggestions, wish there was more to the trading. CONS:  (see suggestions afterwards)- I wish the game lasted longer.  I would suggest more delays or requirements before triggering the next part of the story.- I wish there was more equipment.  Don't get me wrong, I really like that we have a lot to choose from.  I wish there was more.- It is very difficult to attach parts while in the battle screen.  There is no way I could do it during a fight, and not easy after all the fighting was done.- Zombie clouds are way too over powered.  The entire ship melts in a few seconds without warning.  Maybe the player just needs to be more aware?  Is that the point?  - Wingman while fighting zombie ships die too quick.  Most of the time they fly into a zombie cloud and just die.  I stopped having wingmen because of this.  I was better off solo.- Small universe.  I didn't know the game was ending at the final battle.  I thought it was just the end to the first chapter of the story.  I was very disappointed to find out there was nothing after that.  I was hoping it would unlock a much bigger map with a much bigger storyline.  - Bandits are a joke.  Where are the PIRATES?- I finished the game before my ship was even fully upgraded.  I didn't get a chance to play with all the modules.  The game ended before I felt like I knew what I was doing.- Mining lasers.  we need mining lasers or ships to command that excel at mining autonomously.  Maybe give the bus an autonomous mining laser so it isn't too over powered, but gets the job done.  Into the middle and later part of the game I never mined.  I think I only mined in the beginning when times are tough.- I would like to see a bigger economy that is more dependent on other resources.  - Need a richer side quest system.  I didn't find much use for the current side quests.  There didn't seem to be so many.- Not too important for me, however I found it mostly useless to try and fly the other ships.  They almost always died within the first 25% of a battle.  They are good for that initial punch, and then they are gone.  It would be nice if we could somehow select when they appear in the battle. That way we can use them when they are most needed.SUGGESTIONS:- Add more equipment.  Passive equipment that uses rez or goons to slowly repair the ship or repair shields faster.- Zombie clouds are way too powerful.  I would request it be toned down by 50% for players and even more for NPCs.  Or give the NPC AI a tune up so it avoids these clouds at all costs.  I do not run with a wingman because they kept dying right away inside the clouds.- Bigger map.  I would like to see a map that is 10x bigger or more.  Maybe allow it to be user configurable depending on the type of game they would like to play.  I would suggest having the current end fight be just the end to chapter 1 which opens up a much bigger map.  Maybe full of pirates and zombies.  The player now must battle through regions controlled by the pirates and then zombies to make their way to the end game boss.- Pirates need to be feared, not just avoided or used for target practice.  See the bigger map suggestion above.  Maybe in the beginning let them just be swarms, but later in the game give them regions.  Maybe allow the player to get on the good side of pirates in exchange for being at war with everyone else.  The advantage being the player can now raid anyone without worrying about further consequences.  The disadvantage is that now the universe is after you for the bounty.  Pirate faction bonus might be to scavenge better.- Random stuff floating around battle sites:  I would like to see a few more odds and ends stuff that shouldn't be there.  Like the stop sign floating around.  Or a billboard flashing an advertisement placed by the zombies to recruit people.  Something like that.  Get close enough and there is audio from the billboard.  This is something that would help polish the game and add to the general feel of the game.- Maybe have an NPC that raids too much or has negative rating and high level and threat turn himself into a self proclaimed pirate and take over a region?  Would add to the psychopath idea of some pilots.  - Add a few other resources such as mining iron ore, silicone, and maybe a few other elements.  This would help enrich the idea of a living universe.  Give the player something to do in down time.  Go mine ore for profit.  Have a few pirates show up during a mining encounter to ensure players aren't AFK mining?  Or who cares if they are AFK mining.  If AFK mining is a concern, create some mini-games that require user input for mining to continue.  - Ore from mining ops can now be sold at stations which in turn use it to build parts.- Ore can be used by player at their own station to upgrade parts to perform better.- Ore can be purchased from one station and transported to another for profit if the prices are right and you can beat the NPCs.  These are my thoughts for now based on about 25 hours of game play.  Overall I really did enjoy the game and I'm looking forward to playing again after a few more updates.  I'm glad to have had early access and check this out.  Good luck and I'm looking forward to even more awesome stuff in SPAZ 2.			"

Early Access Review
								UPDATE: A number of people have recently given this game a Not Recommended due to the announcement that multiplayer support will be dropped.. even some people who say only positive things about the game otherwise.  This kind of a protest vote is becoming more common in Steam Reviews, and I respect that, although I disagree with it in this case.  I respect the developers for being transparent about their reasons and decision.  They were as frustrated about it as anyone.  AND they have given refunds to a bunch of folks.  I saw at least one person who admitted they got their money back and still didn't change their recommendation.  And that to me is sad for the developers, who imo have done a fantastic job with regular high-quality updates and community interaction.  ---There's a pretty developed simulation layer in SPAZ2, with many npc ships flying around and blowing up just fine on their own without your involvement (as long as you let time move forward).  At high-level, the map looks like a mobile game, with many simple triangles moving about.  This might turn some people off, but it's a pretty elegant way to communicate a lot of information on what's happening in the universe.   You can zoom in anywhere and see who's doing what, and there are a lot of things happening at a small-scale.  For example, every time an AI captains' ship explodes, they escape in a tiny escape pod which jets away to the nearest starbase.  If you aren't super zoomed in you probably won't even notice it, but every individual critter in the universe is tracked like that (da persistance).  Anyhow, since you see the entire map, it adds a strategy-game element.   If you decide to take over the galaxy, seeing your sectors and faction ships flying around and doing battle on a large scale is pretty cool even if they are represented with icons.  And at some point you'll be looking at the map and notice that sectors have changed ownership and the balance of power is shifting while you've been focused on something else, and that's pretty cool. Managing your faction and dominating the galaxy is a fun and optional end-game goal.Ship-vs-ship combat, and building your own mothership out, is the actiony meat of the game.  Combat occurs in realtime in an instanced 2.5D arena against up to 3 enemy motherships (and many other smaller ships), and has a distinctly naval-inspired feel.  I really enjoyed the combat a lot.  Objects in the environment can be used tactically and everything blows up if you shoot it enough.  Ship customization is pretty deep and allows for many different design philosophies, just like the original SPAZ, but the system is very different.  Ship designs, particularly early on, end up looking ugly and abstract, but this is largely a consequence of the stylized cube-based modular ship design.  This design allows for quite a lot of interesting gameplay though, such as targeting specific modules on an enemy ship to cut a ship apart, or targeting a specific weapon weapon, or for hot-swapping ship modules while in combat using the tractor-beam.  And a bunch of additional ship customization options based on the size and location of different parts.  So it may not win awards for beauty, but imo it deserves awards for its rare mix of novelty, practicality, and tactical possibility.  And the combat runs nice and smooth.I bought this game the first week it came out.  The developers have been listening to and responding to the community from the beginning and are very transparent about what they are doing.  They communicate well.  They have been consistently releasing high-quality feature-packed updates.  I've reported bugs and made feature requests that made it into the game, so if there's something SPAZ2 needs or isn't doing right, I highly recommend checking out the Steam forums.  I recommend SPAZ2 both for the game it is, and for Early Access done right.			"

								One of the best indie teams on steam that truely cares about the players experience. If you enjoy Mount and Blade : Warband style of game then this is for you. great graphics, sound , and replayability. could use a bit more polish as far as tactics and strategy go, but a good open world space combat simulator all the same.

								Bought this five days ago and have logged 32 hours already... some paused while looking after our baby, but still, I'm loving this game.I really loved SPAZ, but wished i could have more control over ship configuration. The devs have addressed that in SPAZ2. While there are some areas that could use a bit more balance, the devs are very active, and I imagine my concers will be addressed. That said, even if they're not, i've already got more than my mony's worth!			"

Early Access Review
								This is an EARLY ACCESS review!Background and potential bias: I have 60 hours in the original SPAZ,  I also have about 100 hours in Mount & Blade: Warband.  ~20 hours of playtime in SPAZ were done just a week before the early access release of SPAZ2 as I got hype - I'm a huge fan of the original SPAZ.IMPORTANT: This game is NOT like SPAZ.  It isn't in the same GENRE as Spaz.  It has very few elements of the original game, but it is set in the same universe.  The majority of it plays like Mount & Blade, while the combat has some similarities to Rebel Galaxy.  While SPAZ was more about skill, aiming, and piloting, this game is almost entirely preperation, strategy, positioning and being an opportunist. You *have* to treat this game as it's own game, not in the shadow of SPAZ - yeah, we all wanted more of SPAZ, but you're only setting yourself up for disappointment. I rambled on for a long time and realized nobody's gonna read it, so I'm gonna do a PROS AND CONS LIST cause those are good right??   PROs:+ Campaign dialogue is genuinely hilariously written, made better with the placeholder text-to-speech audio+ A large map with tons of moving pieces, factors, AI captains, factions, pirates and RISK-like territories.+ Good progression that makes you feel weak in the beginning and powerful at the end, fun to level up and finding that nice piece of loot.+ Easy to use ship building that encourages you to try to build different ship shapes, just needs balancing.+ Solid combat system that lets you manually aim to pick off individual pieces of ships, disabling the engines, or their strongest weapons.  Always really satisfying to see those pieces flying off.+ Faction combat, wars, zombie infestations to mix things up+ Graphics are pretty, especially the exploding ships!+ Zombie infestation is pretty interesting, if left unchecked, the zombie population will increase exponentially, and you really don't want to be ""bitten"" by zombie ships as they infect your ship pieces.+ Overall a solid foundation that can be expanded upon to make a truly great game.  It depends on where the developers go from here since this is early access.  It's really just missing content, and the original SPAZ was updated freely with more stuff and content, so I actually will hold my breath.CONs:- Game starts out a little slow with no variety in the beginning, hang in there!- Ship design actually very shallow, instead of a variety of unique ships, you get one ship design to rule them all and just modify it a bit.  (More in the last paragraph of the review) They're also really ugly.  - Weapon variety is low, the more unique weapons are really difficult to find (shotgun, sniper, ship hangars) and no way to seek them out.- Replayability is low because there isn't a lot of different strategies to employ with how few weapons there are, especially in the beginning.  Very little specialization, no utilities like cloaking, mines, turrets.  Most choices are just missles, lasers and cannons, which correspond to 3 damage types.- AI is dumb, easily kite-able in combat, easily manipulated by bounties on the starmap.- Factions have no personality or depth, no interactions other than war and peace.- Starbases have very little depth.  You can upgrade them 12 times, (done very easily and usually all at once) and then what?- The game can feel like a grind at times, especially when you are near the top of the food chain - enemies aren't a challenge after a certain point.- I'm finding the game really, really easy with the difficulty cranked up.  Pirate strength slider doesn't seem to ever make them threatening in any way or at any point in the game, you can just ignore them.  This might be due to the way I'm building my ships (the last paragraph below.)- It's not the same style or genre of game as the original (this is obligatory, I personally don't mind.  I really wanted more SPAZ1, but I love M&B so I enjoy this type of game)Review/Ramble/Impressions:You start with a bucket of bolts ship strewn together with makeshift junkyard parts that can barely scratch the paint off of most ships in the galaxy.  You immediately find yourself in a large circular map divided up into controllable regions, like RISK, each one having a spot for a base to be built.  Exploring around, you'll find different factions, resource nodes, cities, pirate coves, and a TON of ships and captains.  Something like 100 of them all zooming around at their own discretion.  It's like watching ants scatter constantly, and time only moves when you move. This is really reminiscent (or a copy of) of Mount & Blade, seeing faction warbands going to war and fighting each other, having their own relations with one another, setting bounties and fighting with each other.  All of that is here, and the same strategies from M&B apply here, you opportunistically help whomever has the upper hand so you can get a share of the loot, progress, level up, and build your ship.  At first glance, the world feels very alive, but..Starbases, factions, etc are not very fleshed out.  There's no interactions between the other factions other than peace/war, there's no diplomacy or faction leaders, no trading or economy.  Your options for taking out an enemy base are pretty limited - place bounties on it or fight it yourself, or a combination.  Mount & Blade had a lot of different systems in place that gave a huge amount of variety.  You could starve out a keep by camping outside of it, you could use espionage, cripple trade routes, use war machines, catapults, gather war parties of your own faction (limit of one ally to follow you in spaz2) as well as a lot of side quests and activities to gain relations with lords, making a family, usurping a throne, etc.As far as side activities or quests, there doesn't seem to be anything outside of the zombie infestation, which is hindered by the fact that none of the NPCs care about the zombies.  You have to place bounties on everything if you want anyone's help, and the same seems to go for faction warfare.Ships in this game aren't bought and sold as single pieces like every other game out there, but they're made from pieces that snap together like LEGOs or Minecraft blocks on a 2d plane.  Cores, wings, noses, engines, and all have weapons attached and unique stats, randomly generated rarity and bonuses.  This means that every ship is a little bit unique, but it also means that every ship is also pretty similar.  On top of that, making an aesthetically pleasing ship is nigh-impossible, you rely on randomly generated loot for every piece of your ship, and usually you're choosing the pieces based on what weapon they have attached.  Everyone's ship just looks cobbled together, maybe the aesthetic they're going for?  I found it pretty fun to change my ship pieces around every few battles, try different strategies and shapes for the ship.The problem with ship design is that after about 19 hours of play, I'm finding it hard to do anything but build a single shape for my ship: L shape to maximize how many ship parts you can attach.  Make it fatter if you want more engines and noses, make it longer if you want more side pieces.   Connecting cores together to make a larger overall hull gives no benefit from what I can tell.  Building a box or U shape makes pieces block each other.  Line of sight is an issue for all the weapons except missles.  Once you figure this out and you hit max cores (14 at level 30?) you have a distinct advantage over every AI ship, they don't know that stacking cores gives them less parts.  This is a balance issue that will hopefully be worked on.IN CONCLUSION,I ran out of characters so now I have to stop.  There's a lot of criticism here but I do enjoy the game.  I'm going to be playing it some more, and if you think Mount & Blade in Space sounds fun, I can recommend it even as an early access title.			"

								SPAZ 2 is not SPAZ 1, and that's awesome. In world of annual sequels with minimal changes from year to year, it's nice when a developer takes some solid ideas for a good game, and expands it from there.The 3D view is a lot of fun to play. Initially I was resistant, and wanted a top down experience like SPAZ 1, but I quickly fell in love with the 3D view. More so once I really started to customize my ships.Ship building is a bit more interesting now that you can build with modular parts. I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of the faction system (I'm pretty slow). It doesn't feel like it'll be as terribly grindy as the first game.It's certainly an early access game, and there's rough edges and things to fix and improve, but right now it's still a lot of fun. There's a bit of a hump in the beginning at the moment, and I don't think I have really gotten passed that yet, but it seems from their communication that the devs will address this problem.Speaking of, the MinMax has been super open about discussing the game on the forums and trying to address the concerns of players. Really feels like they're going to draw on the community to help make the game greater.			"

								Completed the Story mode and while I enjoyed myself I don't want to burn myself out too much on one game... Especially when I have Warhammer Total War still more or less unplayed.That though shouldn't take away from this game it was fun, the ship customisation was a great feature although slightly limited I found.The Combat was fun if a little sluggish at first.The Starmap adds a pretty decent metagame, which makes you decide on upgrading your factions bases, bribing people to like you more (and thus secure the Alliance of their Faction) or been selfish and making sure you have the best gear.All in All I really enjoyed SPAZ2 (Probably a little more than the first) and will definitely come back once more content has been added.

								I love this game very addictive heres pros and con for those who want to knowPro:good visual effect.a lot of variety of weapons.build your own ship replace peice even after a battle.make faction allies and enemies.story is comical and good.mission actually has great plot (won't explain this part go find out for yourselfs).in spaz 1 you had different ship doing different things but now you can customize theses skills that theses ships had.Cons:the zooming is abit hard to understand at first.the sounds effect has the same sound as spaz 1.enemy faction territory might be gone but the faction ships seem to keep coming back (i was hoping they ended up being white colored no faction at that point but they won't leave).exploring isnt that great as you are stuck in a 2d map plain and you don't have beam collector and mining meteor even in a fight theres pretty much nothing to do to mine stuff. Abit of a let down. So for my rating 3.5 and time to completing this game depend on how you play it could be a full 8 hours or 24 hours.All in all its a good ship to ship fighting game. I recommend for thoses who likes rpg space types of games. "

The combat is composed mostly of broadsides, and ramming.For me, it is well worth the asking price.			"

								I Love Spaz 1 and have waited for this game for a long time, This game feels and plays alot diffrent then the first one but after a bit of play I got use to it and am a big fan of the changes, combat is more interactive and the really neat on the spot customization of your flag ship is awesome ( you can actually blow off a part of another flagship in battle such as a wing or engin and detatch yours and add theirs on the fly if you want ) also  the flow of the ever changing universe is also really well done. wth that being said GET this game, I pretty much always wait until a game goes on atleast %50 off before i buy it ( usually %75 off) but not for this, its starting price is MORE then fair and  i know i paid no more then $5 for the first one and its one of the few games i own that i feel like I ripped off the developers out of how much enjoyment I recived from it ( and remember they eneded up adding Bounty hunters and it was NOT a DLC... how unhead of is that) anyhow support the developers for this and hope that the content rolls on in after early access.

								I just got SPAZ2, my first impression: it's awesome! :)The switch from 2d (SPAZ1) to 3d (SPAZ2) really works. When it first was announced that SPAZ2 was going to be 3d I wasn't too sure about it. It turns out there was no reason to worry: it looks beautiful, it plays well, and it's definitely immersive.Yes, there have been gameplay changes from SPAZ1, but I like the new direction. It makes for a fresh new game, which is definitely welcome. With SPAZ2 the developers decided to provide us with something new and original, I really like that! "

								I, like many, initially came into this game thinking it would be a direct successor to the original game.The original game was great!This game's combat works NOTHING like the last one; while you can, technically control the view from top down, it doesn't work well, except when using the tractor beam.However, after adjusting to the games controls and mechanics, I still found a great game with a long, involved and immersive campaign!This game has a capacitor that reloads like a clip in a gun, more then like an actual capacitor; the original game was a good example of how capacitors work.When boarded, you no longer have a crew vs crew fight; you lose MAX HP's!Be very careful not to sit in a zombie cloud in this game, because unlike the last one, those clouds hurt shields too!On the upside you are still safe from infection, so long as shields stay up.The dialogue is funny, the characters colourful and the ships grow more powerful as you progress.In this second game, you can design your own ships from diverse parts, block by block.Edit: The devs have now added an auto fit best parts mode, so you only have to design the frame or skelleton of the ship.Swapping parts manually has been improved to be a direct right click one and right click another to swap them type of system.This continues to allow customizing the parts used, if you want to have fine control.A part search system works well together with the above improvements to allow easy purchase and customization of your ship.Want to go full sniper cannos? You can!Want to make a full Missile boat?  Go for it!If you liked the original, get this game and give it a try!Just be sure to have patience and learn how this new one's mechanics work, before deciding yes or no; otherwise, you aren't giving it a fair try.

Early Access Review
								Honestly when i went into this i wasnt expecting much, because of the clickbait name of the game which seemed silly...but after i was finished with the campaign, i found myself shocked to see that under that poor name, is an amazing game with a well thought out story and really fun gameplay.A mixture of 4x Faction-Managing gameplay with real time combat where your decisions are super important.Gameplay: 9/10 - Only thing missing i feel, is a larger galaxy or option to increase galaxy size (aka Longetivity)Sound: 8/10 - Music wasnt memorable, i actually like the synthesized voices, it gives the game its own style!Controls: 7/10 - Great Keyboard/Mouse controls overall, but ship control feels too stiff when you want to turn and there's no strafing.OVERALL SCORE:  8/10 - I enjoyed the story campaign so much, but im finding the sandbox mode is missing longetivity.---Key feedback for the developers: ---PART 1: THE NAME.I feel that in order for an awesome game like this to get more publicity and attention, it needs to take a more serious approach to how they title their games. The title ""Space Pirates and Zombies"" many would feel is a gimmicky name of an app (usually a dodgy app) they would find on their mobile phones. Spend some more effort coming up with a more badass game title, and you will grab the attention of more customers.Some random ideas: ""Universal Infection"" ""Viral Galaxy"" ""Galactic Infestation"" oo i like the sound of that last one. Obviously im not telling you to use those but i think you get my point :P one of the key things to becoming well-known is...GAME TITLE MEANS EVERYTHING about a persons first look at your game, so they can tell wether youre being serious or not.---PART 2: SANDBOX MODE LONGETIVITY.Once you destroy the zombies on sandbox mode, there is no more zombie invasion 'forever' and the ships/bases within the galaxy do not continue to advance and neither do you much, with how easy it is to make an alliance with everybody there's no real long-term available threats and the only way to be able to afford any of the rank 6 weapon platforms through any kind of normal gameplay would take impossibly long, forcing many to resort to cheat-engine and tampering with the games scrap levels, and core levels.Suggestion 1: Why not have the timer simply start over, only make the zombies more powerful each time they return?Suggestion 2: I believe weapons need a balance pass (Carriers are easymode) and furthermore as well as, it would be nice if players had access to more cores.  The AI ships have way more cores then we do, when they are less than half our current level (which should be impossible)---PART 3: GPU HOT. No FPS control causing pain.I run a powerful rig, 8core processor at 4.2ghz with liquid cooling and the ATI Radeon HD 7950 3gb with custom fan ramps thx to ATI Afterburner (i know my temperature control methods very well)Whilst the processor was fine, even while running this game at 720p and turning some graphics options down just to lower the temperatures, the temperatures were soaring constantly. Im not sure if something is just unoptimized or what, but the temperatures were very difficult to control and i could not see why, on the screen the temperatures needed to be so hot. I realised this was due to the game trying to run at over 200 frames per second...WHY!? I turned on Vsync which limited it to 60fps but even that still runs hot.SOLUTION: Do what most other games do (pretty please!) add a FPS cap option. I would be perfectly happy playing this game at 30fps but there is no such option to do so.**The game currently risks damage to peoples hardware who arent knowledgable about temperature monitoring and control**, i strongly recommend a FPS CAP option. By trying to run this game at default at INFINITE frames per second, you are causing stress on peoples hardware, when no stress need be applied when their hardware is more than sufficient.Without VSync, the game for NO REASON should ever bypass 120fps, there is quite simply no need for this to happen and it is unsafe to breach this limit.

Early Access Review
								So it is worth noting I loved Space Pirates and Zombies.Normally this kind of disclaimer would indicate I was biased for the franchise, however spaz2 has undergone significant changes which many fans of the original wont like.First off; is it good?Yes, very. It does what it does well.If you want to manage a large empire with no real micro, or engage in huge capital ship versus capital ship combat this is the game for you.While the original game was gamed around dog fights, top down combat, mining and managing a wing of strike craft, spaz2 is about managing a empire of space stations and capital ship combat.The strike craft are still there but they act as support for your capital ship, which is fully customizable and able to be modified to meet a range of play styles.It took a while to get into the groove but when I did I loved it.Concerns:So I only played campaign mode so this might be fixed in sandbox.Compared to the first game the galaxy feels small, like really small.A medium game in SPAZ has hundreds if not thousands of sectors, spaz 2 has at most a hundred, if that.You can no longer manufacture anything. In SPAZ 1 you could build anything you had a blueprint for, in spaz 2 you are dependent on space stations. This means you cant customize dog fighters and getting the right weapons for your capital ship can be an exercise in frustration.Not that was just fixed in part by the inclusion of a catalog system but I still miss manufactoring things myselfThere are content gates which make things annoying:In the campaign mode you have to wait to unlock building bases, even then it is for a guild you later get kicked out of.When you are part of the guild you only get the first base you build you lose the others you construct.This is frustratingLater you get you own guild, if you took part in any wars as part of your original faction, this can put you in a bit of a difficult situation where you either build a base in the heart of existing enemies or you attack original allies.Gripes:There is no micro, like zero. No mining, you cant drop out of hyperspace and explore, you cant trade, nothing.You cant pick up loot in tactical view, you cant get ejected goods, or dropped part or anything.It is very frustrating to set the 3 slot 5 start part you are searching for on the field of battle, be unable to get it in battle and have it not turn up in the loot.You have zero real customization of the space stations, I would olove to define what addons are built, what gear they construct, set trade routes, set mining and planet interaction. However I can't it is effectively just a resource node.Space stations in your guild have an annoying habit of being lost for no good reason. I had stations, fully upgraded in the heart of my empire, with no enemies any where near by be lost for no explicable reasonThe AI guilds members upgrade the various space stations, so why doesn't the players guild's members do the same.p.s.It's weird that steam thinks I only played it for 16 hours as I am certain I played it much more than that.

								I was just minding my own business, picking up scraps from some pirates I'd killed when sudenly I'm ambushed by some faction member captain demmanding I fork over my ill-gotten gains. Screw that, I thought, and decided to battle it out only to find at the last moment one of his buddies joined the fight as well.I may have been outgunned and outclassed, but my ship was fast and I could out manuever them. The battlefield was full of debris like explosive barrels that I could use my tractor beam to fling at them while my reactor core was reloading and weapons were offline. After a long and white knuckle battle I managed to blow up my attacker's faction buddy, but only at a cost to my own ship. Power was fluctuating in the habitat modules, two of my four engines were scorched and  barely operational and I was missing a thruster wing. While my nemesis was reloading his core and his weapons were offline, I moved in hoping to strike a decisive blow, only to realize I'd made a mistake.I'd managed to get his shields down and land a few shots on his own engines, but by that time his weapons were online and my own shields were reduced to a mere sliver from the full broadside attack that followed. There was no way I'd be able to escape, as damaged as my ship was the next volley would probably be the end of me. So I did what any good captain would do in that situation: maximum power to shields and use every last bit of juice left in the engines for RAMMING SPEED!The nose of my ship plowed through his engines in a fiery crash, sheering them away and sending parts flying in all directions. To my amazement I had survived and severely crippled my enemy, giving me the chance to follow up with a wave of attacks on his ship's now exposed and vulnerable core. He didn't last long after that, and in addition to the satisfaction of watching his ship explode, I had the pleasure of picking through the ruins for working ship modules to replace the ones I'd lost, using the tractor beam to attach them.TL;DR - This game is about as good of an early release as you can hope for. For such a small developer, the production values are impressive, and I love the idea of cobbling to gether a battle worthy ship out of random parts. Definitely a worthy sequel to its predecessor.

								This is a pretty great game so far 4 hours into it.MinMax blew me away with SPAZ 1. Part 2 is pretty darned good so far. I'll elaborate later. Must..... improve.... mothership.      (rant)It seems too many people thought this was going to be a clone of SPAZ 1. They must not have read anything about it or watched any videos for the last 4 years. This is a sequel, many sequels differ from the original through game play, but keep the lore and even transition characters through games. ""Sequels"" that do not change gameplay but add ""more guns"" ""more characters"" ""more armor"" ""improved graphics"" are in fact add-ons that masquerade as sequels (you can charge more for sequals). The quickest way to identify these ""cash grabs"" is by examining when they are released. If it's close to one game a year, that is a pretty good indication that they shorted the development time and passed those savings onto you, in the form of bad or worse story, game length, character, ect. Sadly, these are all many younger gamers know and it seems they look forward to it.			"

								Got this game a few days ago. Fell in love with it. Firstly, the lasers go pew pew in space. Secondly, the characters have such snappy and well written dialogue that I did not mind that our main cast is currently incognito borg with a self-censoring protocol to keep them from offending our spaceship flying sensibilities. Also casual references to♥♥♥♥♥♥and pillaging are fine tho. Did I mention the lasers go pew pew because they do and they come in a variety of flavors and damage. Ship building is fun and sometimes you need to build a ship while getting shot at. Nightshade can't do that. Buy the game don't ♥♥♥♥♥ about your huge ship being hard to turn.

								So the SPAZ2 i waited for years is here. But sadly its not that game i expectet. Maybe i only misread the dev-blog's, in that and the talk about the new game, i had understand it to be near the first one but improved with more features that would be fun.The sad in my view, they put in a handful of good features as in many games a few really bad features but now the really bad, they ripped old features out that the game lost its soul an appealing for me. :( I tried ~80Minutes to have fun with the game but only what i saw is the sadly void that remaind where the old good features had their places bevor they got thrown out.So the rest in short, i hope they fix it if its still possible. If not i'm happy to jump on their next titel if it's funny for me again but with SPAZ2 i have to take a refund now and hope for the future. q.q			"

								Already fun to play just a few weeks into early access. Engine is stable with no crashes so far. Content depth is a little light at the time of this review, but on one level this is understandable because the developers are still working on refining core game mechanics and ensuring that they work. Gameplay is currently a light Mount & Blade style campaign map with emergent behavior between different NPCs, combined with mothership space combat from a 3rd person chase perspective. The developers are only a 2 man team, but they are very responsive to feedback from the community and they have a history of long term support established with SPAZ 1. There is a lot of potential for what can be built onto the framework of what already exists so far. I'm recommending buy on the basis of all that.I will revise or delete/repost my review later after the game has been developed further. There are several different features I would like to see, and I am waiting to see what the developers will do about them.			"

								Just blasted through the main campaign, at first the differences from the original SPAZ was jarring.. but after getting used to the controls overall feel, I quite enjoyed diving back into the SPAZ universe.However some things: Pros: The mother ship is highly customizable, which in its self is really fun to do.3d Plane of battle similar to that of Rebel GalaxyA continuation of the original SPAZ storyline, complete with familiar faces.An active galaxy!Eh: While not spectacular, the graphics are nice! Voice acting of the main cast is not fully in yetCons:Early access~ Expect bugsRandom Difficuly spikes, the ship system in place can lead to unexpected deathsThe AI can be/is.. easily exploitable at this timeSide note: The devs did something new with their game, do not go in expecting SPAZ mechanics.. this is a newer model complete with different ideas. Some hardcore fans of the original SPAZ have issues with that.All in all, I give it a 7/10. Can't wait to see what else they add to it as it goes on!			"

								An ambitious game by a small indie studio, it's a mixed bag, yet pretty fun so far.Right from the beginning, you'll find out that the mechanisms are quite complicated. It takes a bit of time to get used to different concepts and control schemes, which can be fun if you're patient. The story did a good job in blending in the tutorials, but the story itself brought nothing ground-breaking.The main game is divided into 3 modes, ""star map"", ship building and combat. In ""star map"", you fly around harvesting resouces, chasing bandits and stirring in the pot between 5 major factions. It feels extremely like a space MMO simulator, with all npcs looking and behaving like your typical EVE online playing friend. The resouce ""scrap"" feels less useful since you can always go for REZ and exchange it to scrap.The ship building mode is innovative and a bit bizzare. All ship parts are modulized and you can make your ship in anyway you like. However this also makes the ships ugly looking like hunks of junk. Each ship part is attached to a specific direction, is fixed with a weapon, has a rarity and has very limited supply, making customization a bit difficult. Imagine if you want to try a different ship design, you'll need to harvest enough REZ, find all the parts you need from half the universe, and throwing away the existing parts since they're supposed to slow you down when inside the inventory. Wanna try something new? Start the whole process again.The game is fun in general, needs some polishing and a few system could benefit from redesigning.  "

								So, I'll write a review since I already played a lot of this game.Q1) Is it worth it?Depending on your own value you put on 20 dollars and your own time, I'd say if you enjoyed SPAZ, you may enjoy this.Q2) But it isn't the same as SPAZ.It is its own game as a sequel to SPAZ. I personally found SPAZ's progression system to break really easily as you go through different layers of map, and most of the progression being number checks and your own ability to pilot the ship.The world map and relative time helps in keeping the world both vibrant in activity and not stressing you on making quick decisions. Each activity you plan to do limits what else you can do, but that is the nature of a spacial strategy game.Now onto my own impressions of the game.ProgressionI am several qualms with the progression system, so here are my thoughts.- Too Combat Focused. To level up outside of combat, you need to explore (miniscule amount) or collect lore. This leads to situations where 3 back-to-back battles will naturally leave you far ahead compared to if you took your time not aggravating everyone.- Too reliant on perks for power ups. This leads into another issue I have; a lot of the perks are way too powerful. The +X% Damage will power up your ship a lot and the jump in statistics doesn't help in the way of strategy. You either need to pass a skill check or kite your way to victory.All in all, the flow of the game is generally the same. You can do things differently, but there is always an optimal route to things.Ships BuildingEarly on, you are scraping anything you can find and using it, which fits the theme well.Later on, you sell of most of your junk.The ship building is less than optimal, where the best ships are not the prettiest. You see straight-line monstrosities and L, Z and U shapes on the board. There is no incentive (as of this review) to box in cores instead of spacing them out for slots.The parts themselves are not particularly unique, and will likely disappoint you if you are looking for a good loot simulator.Character BuildingThe interactions, though seemingly lively, is very linear. Most of the captains act the same way, and their traits are not very indicative of their actions either. If they like you, they will help you. If they don't, they may attack you.However, you grow some attachment to some characters if they saved your♥♥♥♥♥a few times early on. This also brings up some interesting interactions across games, and if you encounter them as a zombie.Battle SystemGood, but very 2 Dimensional (AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY)A lot of the progression comes from 'take down shields', 'kill them'.'Destroy annoying strike ships', 'get away from that fail gate', 'kite til they die' and 'ohgodgetawayfromme' are also some actions you may take.It is interesting some manuevers you can do and the ramming system is also satisfying, but generally you either kite since they are stronger than you, or go straight up to them and auto-win.It would be interesting if enemies could dump armor like in SPAZ to speed up, but that is a small nitpick. I'd say it is enjoyable but repetitive, and in some cases, slow.Resource ManagementNot very interactive. Scrap is used for everything, Rez is a secondary currency that is used for moving faster (when you git gud, you will never run out), and goons can be picked up through fights. The latter two however, are generally gotten through fights. This may force players away from other activities to seek battle with their mortal enemies for the 10th time.The mark-up percentage should be displayed with the trade window; not sure why it isn't.OverallA good adventure and strategy/management game set in space. The latter part could use more work, but for an EA it is definitely playable. I'd say pick this up if you have the time, as the team will most likely fix a lot of the current problems before release later on.Story Time:I battled with an alpha after my 3rd playthrough on Default Sandbox, and he was threat 80-ish with two other zombies around level 40 and 50. I was threat 63 myself with an engine and pulsar centric-build, with ion missiles to take down shields from afar. As the battle started, I went to the weakest ship (the one without strike ships) and boosted into him. His shields went down from the ion missiles, so as I rammed it, about one third of his hull went down. I kept boosting despite no damage, as there was an asteroid behind him. As the collision happened, he took another chunk of damage, before the damage of him stopping/me still going also registered, giving me a clean kill within the first 30 seconds of the battle. It went from a long 3v1 to a shorter 2v1 with kiting. The insanely fast kill made my day.I also like doing this if another enemy ship is behind them, since they will also take ramming damage if they collide with other friendly ships. So, ramming ships into other ships works.Moral: Ramming off parts works. Ramming ships into other things also works.			"

								I really enjoyed SPAZ1, and now that I've played SPAZ2 I can say that I will be thoroughly enjoying this game for a long time.Before I bought SPAZ2 I read all the reviews, and decided to try it for myself. I have NO IDEA why some of these reviewers complain about features that are a non-issue, are they even playing the same game?One major complaint is a lack of instruction on gameplay. Let me clear this up right now. From the very start of the campaign and even a couple hours in, this game does a GREAT job of explaining all the gameplay mechanics, functions, icons, weapons, ship building features in the game. At no point was I ever confused and the storyline flows nicely and slowly introduces/unlocks new game features and ""tutorials"" as you progress.Controls and Combat are another source of complaint. The controls are fine and if you don't like it take the time to customize them how you want before complaining on the interweebs, and I love how I can switch between the classic top down view from SPAZ1 and the new close up horizontal ship combat view. It reminds me of giant broadside ship battles across the ocean of space. Combat is great, you can switch between firing modes, customize your loadout, target specific components to blow up, tractor beam objects into enemies, and even install an enemy ships component onto yours in mid-battle. Combat is surprisingly deep if you actually take the time to read the info available in game instead of pounding away mindlessly on your keyboards.I'm not even going to get into ship customization because it's so polished, fun, and complex you just need to play to understand it. It seems most of the negative reviews stem from players just loading up the game, not reading any settings or tips, and launching head first into sandbox mode. I highly recommend you do campaign first (as any clearheaded and sane person would do) because it does an excellent job teaching you how to play. The writing and characters are very well done, funny, and even enlightening at times. The galaxy map feels alive with all of the ships, bandits, and factions going about their lives and fighting one another as you explore. You can join a faction or be the scourge of space. The game is as hard as you want it to be, with an adjustable difficulty slider you can change at any time, I'm playing on slightly harder than normal and I've had no issues, the game feels balanced.So take this for what you will but I can assure you the developers have put their heart and soul into this game and it really does show.

								If you're considering buying this and haven't played the first, go buy the first SPAZ. That game is incredible. It's top-down 2D but so much more fun than this sequel. If you've already played it and looking for SPAZ 2, I'd watch the videos but highly consider skipping it.It's such a step away from the gameplay of the first, and not in a way I found fun. The first one felt seriously better to control. The ships looked great, it was super fun to unlock new ships, weapons and gear, and it was just exciting to upgrade and manage your fleet. Fighting was exhilirating.This steps away from all that. Fighting just sucks. The controls suck, the ship feels slow as hell, the ship-building system is a good idea gone wrong and they all look ugly, and it just feels like fighting was dumbed down to make way for some less fun 3D version of the first. In the first, you'd maneuver around and try to aim bombs at the enemy or use some special ability and maneuver around, really focusing on the skills of your ship. This one feels like you're driving a slow tank and all you can do is aim and shoot. You either outgun the enemy or they outgun you. In the last one, with skill you could take on bigger ships. With luck you could get away with a big kill. In this one, it's way too slow and clumsy to do anything besides come close and fire every weapon. There doesn't seem to be any real special abilities like in the first. You just fire at them. You move close and you fire. And the game feels so much smaller scale. It's a ""galaxy"" map where you just float around and try to steal resources. It feels incredibly grindy and you can spend your first few hours just clicking around, avoiding combat, and stealing resources from planets (which just means click on it, not like a fight or anything). When you inevitably do get in a fight, it's either win or lose pretty much determined the moment you step in the fight.The most fun part is building a ship, and even that isn't that fun. It's a great idea gone wrong. The first one, you found ship upgrades and chose weapons and upgrades for slots on them. Some had different capabilities, some ships had more weapons, etc. This one, you piece them together like legos. What you end up with is a super ugly ship that has a variety of missiles/lasers/guns that all fire at the enemy when you click on them. You just have to maneuver near them and have a smart ratio of weapons for energy/armor/hull damage. That's about it. Choosing which weapons to have is the most ""fun"", but it's a huge step down from the first SPAZ.In the first SPAZ, your upgrades meant something and you'd choose between a really finite set of weapons. It really made a difference in how you fought. Sacrificing a laser for another weapon really made a difference. You might cloak and do sneaky stuff! You might need a detector for other cloaked ships. It made so much of a difference what you chose. It made a difference in how you moved, how fast you were, how much damage you did, how effective you were against specific ships, and how you had to play. Each ship and layout felt unique.They tried to expand on that it seems, but went the opposite direction. Now it's just ratios of weapon types and every ship plays the same. Unfortunately, I'd skip this one and go back to playing the first.For the devs out there, sorry for flaming the game because I truly loved the first one, but I really think you guys should've stuck with the first SPAZ gameplay model instead of moving to this new 3D ship-building version. You could've gone with new abilities, new weapons, new armor types, more variety in gear, expanded story, expanded options on the map, more fleet options, etc, etc. SPAZ 2 is a different game when the first was already excellent.

Early Access Review
								Tl;DR: This game is nothing like the first one, but is a great game in its own right. Lots of loot and ship customization. Basic skill system. Nice AI faction / captain rep system. The battles feel huge and epic with lots of explosions/effects and by far my favourite part of the game. You can break parts off by shooting / ramming the other ship.Great value for the price. This is more a beta than a early access game. The game feels complete, but there is still some bugs that needs to be sorted out.10/10 - Epic capital ship style battlesFIRST IMPRESSIONSI have 105 hours of playing SPAZ 1. First off this is nothing like the first one. Sure you can switch to the classic top down view. But the feel of the game is completely different. At first I was a bit disappointed, but I trust MinMax and gave this game a chance.My trust was not misplaced as I really enjoy this challenging game. For me this game is 'n bit more difficult than the first. But I think it has to do with different play styles.SHIP HANDLING AND BATTLESFor me the first one was more top down arcade type of action like Star Control. This game's combat pace is a bit slower but in a big capital class ship battle good way. Think big ships on the ocean trying to out maneuver each other. Plus the close and personal view makes the battles look amazing.The ship battles truly feels like something out of a star wars/star trek/battlestar galactica space opera battle. Huge capital ships putting down the hurt and smaller ships trying to do some critical damage or harass.If a ship’s shields are down you can ram them to damage and even break of parts like the engines, nose or weapons. Or target them manually and shoot them off. Not only should you pay attention to your ships shields, but at your capacitor energy levels. It it is drained you need time to eject the spent one and load a new one. In this reloading window the ship is very vulnerable. You can’t shoot and your shields won’t recharge, but the same counts for the enemy.SHIP DESIGN / CUSTOMIZATION Depending on your ship design you can create a long ship with a lot of broadside weapons or a shorter ship with a wider backend for more engines and speed or a wider front end for more nose pieces for more shields or any other combination you can think of. Like an upside down L-shaped ship, which worked great for me in the campaign. It will causes less sleep and productivity because you will keep on thinking about ways to improve your ship design throughout your days and nights.RESOURCE AND LOOT GATHERING The painful grinding of mining and resource collection from the first have been replaced by nodes/POIs where you can quickly farm some on the galaxy map. There is still some grinding and I have yet to play a game without some grinding. The ship components is random generated and you have to fly around and search for the correct parts a lot! But I don’t really mind that, it's like doing a thousand rifts / bounties in Diablo 3 to get the loot you need.SKILL SYSTEMUnfortunately the skill system is dumbed down or simplified a lot from the first one. I would have liked to be able to specialize in laser weapons or drones for example. But there is a few nice skills to choose between like weapon/shield boosts, trading price inc, scavenging.DIPLOMACY AND FACTION SYSTEMI really like the diplomacy or faction system. Especially the in depth detail of the AI captains. You can see why they like/don’t like you and what you did to them. In my first sandbox game I made too many captains angry and I was swarmed with bounties to the point that I just started a new game as it was to painful to keep getting killed. So you need to think about what you are doing and to whom. You can also bribe captains to increase their opinion of you. Or just put a bounty on that one captain that stands in your way :D EARLY GAMEYou start the game very very weak and need to scavenge / exploit (help strong ship against weaker ships) / do arena battles (low risk) / destroy a small raiding party of a rival faction / pick up lore POIs. The start can be a bit hard and tricky, but it forces you to explore the map and interact with the other captains.MID GAMEIt is more about leveling up so you can use more core pieces to increase your ship size.You can either join a faction and help them get stronger or create your own faction or a bit of both. Also more collecting resources and improved ship pieces.LATE GAME / ZOMBIESDepending on where the zombies start you need to carefully plan how you are going to stop them. If they kill one of the 200 AI captains in the game they are permanently converted to their side even your own faction members.CAMPAIGN / STORYThe campaign feels more like a tutorial or preparation for the sandbox mode which is the way the game was meant to be played. So don’t expect a deep and compelling story like homeworld or KOTOR for example. There are some good bits of lore and references to the previous game.			"

								TLDR: Excellent galaxy sandbox style game. There is tons to do. Complete a full campaign/sandbox game will take you atleast 12 hours and thats if you rush. It is an evolution of the original's style of gameplay.Pro: *The ship customization is very indept and you can design your ship anyway you want unlike the original game which made you stick with predetermined designs*The galaxy map/RTS is a seperate game on it's own. You will be constanly moving around defending your territory, attacking enemy faction territory, and raiding resource nodes. The balance of power shifts between the factions as they go to war with each other and it is up to you to determine who you side with or simply create your own faction. Meanwhile the zombies are slowly gathering strength and consuming the galaxy. I have been playing for quite some time and I have not even come close to finishing the campaign.*The ship combat is pretty simple like the original. You have your main ship plus your escorts/strike craft. You can order them around or simply let the AI handle them. The modules style ship building adds a new layer of strategy as you can systematically disable an enemy ship's components one by one.*Graphics are quite nice. The galaxy map is simply the most gorgeous I have ever seen in a game. It is very simple to understand and get info out of yet so subtle in it's beauty. The ship 3D designs have nice effects and neat little moving components and gizmos. Looks like an actual scifi style ship.*Game is very stable. Played 9 hours straight not one bug, crash, for messup.Cons:*The ship combat can take some getting used to. I would recommend disabling the relative camera mode in the settings as it constanly tries to point your ship at where you are aiming which makes it hard to flee and keep firing.*Some of the ship customization is gone like picking different armor plating or the option to jetison armor, cargo, and goons to escape faster. Also the reactor/power dial from the original game has been replaced with this stupid reload mechanic. Im just sitting here trying to understand why they thought this was a good idea. The original was fine.*Goons no longer repair the ship in combat. The ship can still repair but it is extremely limited. This is quite annoying as there isnt much point in fleeing to repair anymore because you simply cant repair in combat anymore. The only health related thing that regenerates is your shields but your health pool is nearly 10x that of the shields. I have yet to discover a way to make your shields stronger than your hull like you could in the original.			"

								First up, SPAZ2 is a vastly different game from SPAZ1. The setting, some sound effects and the overall sense of humour is the same, but the gameplay is completely different but that's not necessarily a bad thing. That is unless you're looking for a direct sequel with improved features: I'd guess a few people have been negatively reviewing SPAZ2 because of this. Admittedly it maybe shouldn't have been named SPAZ2 as it plays more like a spinoff rather than a sequel but I honestly prefer SPAZ2 over SPAZ1.SPAZ2 plays like an arcadey spaceship shooter with sandbox, trading, scavenging and some exploring aspects. It's a little grindy but I personally don't mind that. The story continues on from SPAZ1, but to be honest I didn't care much for the lore. Loved the sandbox mode though but the galaxy map could be a bit bigger, otherwise an adjusting slider like in SPAZ1 could hopefully be added in a future patch, as it seems a bit claustrophobic in late-game.Decent eye candy especially considering how small the dev team is and it's very satisfying to see lasers, missiles and assorted explodey things fly through space, resulting in enemies exploding into little bits which is one of the main draws of spaceship combat for me. Some of those little bits floating through space being salvageable is also a nice touch. Being able to use (destructable) space debris tactically is even better.Ship construction can be a little bit fiddly but once you get used to it, it becomes second nature. Loot is determined mostly through RNG so it can be frustrating at times but stations with a greater threat number tend to have much larger inventories to browse from, which is mentioned but could be easily missed.Overall, I enjoyed SPAZ2 much more than SPAZ1. If you're going to try it, judge it based on its own merits even though the name suggests it should be a direct sequel.			"

								As much as I love the first SPAZ I really did not enjoy what I played of this. The gameplay felt weirdly remote, the 3D isn't as charming as the old 2D graphics (no objection in theory, but this is sorta blocky and not great looking, kinda like a PS3 digital-only game from 2009), I don't at all enjoy the way the Mothership construction and improvement works (or combat with it, either), and I feel like to an extent the game doesn't really sustain all the stuff it has going on as moving parts. But it's still Early Access, and as you can see from other reviews, plenty of folks love it. Not for me.			"

								I honestly reinstalled the original and am having more fun.CONSLoved SPAZ 1 but feel as though this game actually suffers from the 3d models. Obviously you can change the camera to overhead, but it likes to toggle back and forth anyways at the start of each skirmish, and the controls feel lethargic compared to the arcadey-but-responsive original. Plus motherships look rather bleh, and more effort could have been spent elsewhere. SPAZ 1 also gave you a little dopamine drip as you sucked up resources like a vacuum. Here in SPAZ 2, theyre just arbitrary numbers and you dont get the same satisfaction in collecting them.The inventory/store menus also feel like they could be presented much better. Its tiresome comparing stats on things that you continuously have to remind yourself on what type of component they are, and then re-look at the stats, and then re-remember the component type, and then just say ""eff it. This one has a bunch of stars and costs alot so its probably better"".As others have said, shields inherently make the most sense to bolster over anything else. You dont have to invest anything in their repair...Strike ships or w/e are necessary in the least thrilling way possible. Theyre just there to draw flak away from you, and thats generally it.PROSThe 4x half of the game is really interesting, despite some grindy resource collection. It really feels as though they could have taking SPAZ 1, and slapped the new 4X onto it, and called it a new game and basically everyone would have been tickled.The banter from pilots and the main cast is as funny as always.

								Contains story spoilers, read at your own discretion This game belittles and degrades it's own progress to the point where it renders it pointless. Early on you're pushed to join a faction via plot, building a starbase and protecting it from bandits and other pilots. In theory it's fun, however a few missions later the game strips the base from you again over plot. All the scrap and time you spent building up the base? Pointless and gone. Later the game plays the same trick on you. Spend hours upon hours building alliances and starbases only for the game to render every ally you've made pointless as their aid is blocked during the final mission. I only made it to the second stage of the final mission, perhaps they do come later, however my frustration had built to the point where I didn't care to push through. This game pushes you towards goals only to slap you in the face when you achieve them and strip it from you leaving you with a horrid sense that everything you've done matters for naught; it repeats the same pathetic joke twice. The game mechanics is decent, the ship building portions allow for a wondrous plethora of combinations. However when coupled with the above mentioned I could not recommend this game. "

								I want to like this game, but I just can't. I frigging loved SPAZ one... but as it turns out this game is totally different.I loved the first SPAZ. Hunting and collecting for all the different ships and equipment parts.Different ships were all unique, but what was better, you could arm them for so many tactics. I liked to make missile ships from my wingmen to stay safe. I liked to make cloaked mega laser ships from my main ships that could do a lot of damage, but still had engine speep to bail out of bad situation. This kinda customization is gone. Best part of the game was collecting different ship types, parts (weapon, shield and support), and experience to unlock the skills to use them.There is still collecting in the game but just for mothership parts. Now you customize your mothership, from parts you loot and shop, but all your other ships are tiny, boring cannonfodder that serve no other purpose, other than to distract the enemy.Mothership customization is kinda cool. You build your own ship from blocks, with each block having its own stats and own weapon (unless its core-part = hull). Every part have many different stats, but basicly they give little boost to the motherships stats like speed, turn speed, and armor.There are basicly 5 kinds of parts:1) Core aka The hull that gives the ship its shape.2) , 3) , 4), 5) = Nose, Tail, Right wind, and Left wing. They are all the same but connect to different side of the core part... nose goes to front... You can guess the rest.Why this sucks, is that every part is the same. Every F-ing part  is the same. Every part have the same stats, with a little difference to the numbers. Example Nose and Tail parts have 6 stats with one difference... Nose has ""shields 3"", but Tail has ""shields 2, but engine 1"". By this point you still think: ""but that sounds cool"". And it kinda is... kinda.Until you hear that every part has random weapon!!But then you think ""Whats wrong with that then?""Well... The weapons are random and you can't change anything.What that means: You play the whole game using random weapons, Using random parts, with a  lot of different stats that you can't tell the difference. Your mothership is ugly the whole time.You can use your imagination, to make your mothership, perform and look, quite many things. Actually in every starbase there is ""arena"" where you can challenge yourself, using premade motherships, and test yourself with different kinds of ships. For me it worked well to show me what kind of weapons I liked. But in the end it was all the same.But I'm now professional reviewer so let me make shorter points. This is compared to SPAZ one.Game is 1/4 size of SPAZ 1 or smaller, but it is hard to compare because this is more alive.200 hundred unique ships/captains move there constantly, But they don' respect no border. And I mean constantlyPROS:- Ramming and individual part damage.CONS:- No different, unique, interesting ships.-- Mothership is spawn of vomit that you find.-- Strikefleet. They were all tiny. Died. Made zero difference, other that cannonfodder. Totally ♥♥♥♥ed up feature. In SPAZ one, you actually desing them... They were awesome.- Every ship part is the same. Random weapon + some stats.- Every part has same stats. Minor value difference, but still every part is the same.- Regions control sucks. It is chaos out there.-- No border control. You can't tell other people to stay  out of your territory.-- If they raid you... You can't in game terms be diplomatically upset... You can only destroy their raid party and then they are mad at you. Makes sense (they are mad =yes, but that was your only choise = no)... you were friends and they robbed you.... but it was wrong to attack the robbers... and stuff.- Diplomacy is basicly enemy/friend. But it is individually between different captains (200 of em) not just factions.In short:You make ugly ship. You and it has random stats and weapons. But because you are pro those weapons make you good at everything (although, no theme, or style). Then you win... Boring. "

								TL:DR - SPAZ 2 basically plays like Starpoint Gemini's combat (but slower) with an overview map system that feels clunky.  If you want to play an upgraded version of SPAZ 1 you should absolutely not get this game.You know how you really loved SPAZ?  It was a pretty cool game.  Top down, interesting mechanics, a bit same'y combat (yet fun as hell,) interesting research projects to outfit your ships, different tech, running over people before they become your crew and hearing them splat on your hull, easy tactile control of what you wish to do, fast paced combat, ect., ect.  Remember that?Awesome.  Now replace all of that.  All of it.  Research?  Nope!Varatibility of outfitting your ship?  Actually yes, but it is combersome, and the tiles feel like badly made erector sets so I find myself staring blank eyed as I load one side of my ship with missles and the other with all the crap that will obliterate my enemy.Combat? The combat is a hell of a lot slower (or at least feels like a snales pace.)  It's not about doding bullets while at the same time blasting away at the enemy.  Nope.  This game is now about positioning.  Basically a great tactic is to slam your ship right into their rear end and proceed to use your high powered nose blasting weapons to obliterate the opposing ship.  Granted this may change, but I'm not playing a game where if I can keep putting a bunch of little asteroids (that are all over the place so I have to also time my shot.)  The battle maps feel almost all the same and there isn't enough terrain to maneuver through considering your ships move sooooooooo slow.  What bugs me most about this is that it's removed all the skill that I loved about SPAZ 1.  Have a small ship you want to pilot instead of the mother ship and a hell of a lot of skill piloting it?  You will still lose.  Period.  SPAZ you could overcome this, but in SPAZ 2 just strap yourself into the bone room and feel the penetration.Diplomacy?  Just as clunky.I get that this is early release.  But as the game is right now?  Woof.... because I really can't see it changing so dramatically to become what I loved about SPAZ 1.			"

								TL:DR. if you loved spaz1 dont expect anything of what you loved to exist here, this game is basically spaz 0.5 it has less going on and has been taken in a completely different direction,i personally cant recommend this game but if you have never played spaz1 then A. try spaz1 first B. try this but keep an eye on your playtime, thanks for the refund steam i loved spaz 1 and was really looking forward to spaz 2 from when i first heard about it many months ago, i bought it expecting more of spaz 1 but in 3d and with more depth with the 200 captains bringing some sort of story and replayability.what i got was a shallow and boring game that barely even felt like it was based in the spaz universe (the character images and small ship designs are all that carried over) ship building felt pointless as there is little to design and it is awkward to build.resouce collecting was fun in spaz1, i enjoyed mining and seeing the ship escape pods flying out of a ship as it exploded and i went over scooping them up, ejecting into space those who wouldnt join my merry band. whats this replaced with? drive to station on map and get given some resources, could that be any less interesting?the game world is now a fraction of the size of spaz 1 and you just drive around the map looking for a captain you are more powerful than. this map driving is boring as can be, i thought spaz 2 was going to be 3d? i spent 99% of the time looking at the map and that is not only 2d but not even nice to look at.the battles dont even feel interesting, i thought it might be like rebel galaxy but its not in the slightest, you can use auto aim or manual aim but manual is hard to get aimed up as you try to avoid incoming fire and the auto mode makes the battle as boring as the map part of the game.200 captains that can do everything i can do? so they drive around bored out of thier head doing nothing of any interest till they refund the cost of thier ship?many people say it gets better the more you play, i say if i go past the 2hour mark i lose my chance of refunding, a game should capture the player from the start and this didnt capture the slightest interest in the 90ish minutes i gave it before thinking i cant risk losing my money on this boreing devolution of spaz, i doubt it would have magicly converted itself into something completely different if i had given it any extra time. im really disappointed that minmax have said they are happy with the direction they have taken as i feel its gone backwards and if they are happy with it then its never going to go forwards is it.fingers crossed for a spaz 3 that makes a true sucessor to spaz 1 cos this aint it, i may look back in several months time and see if the game has evolved itself a soul but i think its direction is just not what i was hoping for :(			"

								I am enjoying this SPAZ2 so far. It is still in early access, and needs a bit of work, but it has great potiential. Most of the space battles degrade into (a bit simplistic) capital ship style dogfighting(?) which I rather enjoy (Rebel Galaxy, Starfleet Command etc).What would I like to see? More tool tips, a more intuitive ""is this weapon better than the one I have"" interface, discrete shield quadrants (or option for it, not all players would like this).Don't come in simply expecting more SPAZ1. This is more of a spiritual successor, taking the game in a different direction.Keep up the good work devs! I will be playing this through till the end.			"

								A good balance of economical strategy and space battles; although the game feels ""good"" in these aspects, it falls short from great in all of them. The space battles suggest that you can use the environment to your advantage but unfortunately the enviroment has little effect on enemys (using gravity beam to throw an EMP barrel on the enemy shields might take the shields down 5-10%.) Because of this, the enviroment is just clutter on the screen that hurts performance- a graphic setting that can not be shut off.It takes about 10 mins to explorer the entire campagin map. - however the game does captivate pretty well and it is fun but the longevity of that is limited.

								I have mixed feelings on the game as of the initial early access release.If the game is still under development, then I would say buy it. The eventual state of SPAZ 1 was awesome, and well polished. However, the current state of SPAZ 2 is neither. If the dev is only lookng for bug reports, then this is underwhelming and I would strongly encourage people to skip this title.In particular, the map UI is clearly a placeholder. The icons used for ships and the general polish over the map view is exceptionally poor given how much time you spend watching your little triangle move slowly across the map.  If the map view was not such a large piece of time, the difference in polish between map and ship view wouldn't be so glaring.Progression is also pretty bad. Eventual Zombie strength is chosen at game creation, and in no way dynamic. The climax of the game seems to work around the idea that the Zombies will win unless aliances can be forged or the humans can essentially achieve a domination victory in the non-zombie space so they can finally focus on the zombies. There isn't much wiggle room, so you have to hope the human pilots have progressed far enough that once the zombie infestation starts, it will be possible to continue growing strong enough to attack the main zombie.The universe scale is pretty sad. It seemed chosen to keep it presentable in the screen without zooming too far out. It's only a minute to zoom from one side to the other. There is no distance between factions, which is great for driving conflict but effectively turns SPAZ 2 into only the last two X in a 4X game. Just allowing a more gradual ramp-up over a larger number of sectors would go a long way to allowing multi-phased progression.			"

Early Access Review
BUY IT.The sequel to SPAZ has strip'd old combat, ship, and world mechanics. People will rage about how they threw it's best stuff out the window (fleet building). However, it's still chock full of the usual silly charm of weird people and awkward conversations. That said this doesn't make it ""Spaz 2"". It's more like Spaz feat. Captain Forever, because ship building and combat is the meat of the game.You now control only one ship, constantly upgrading it block by block in a cpt. forever style. The map is no longer nodes but a big circle sliced into sectors. Combat is a hit or miss. Viewpoint can be the good ol' top down or the new pseudo 3D. Ship Controls are still wonky AF with the AI throwing out all your bombs and missiles once in range. (It's since been patched and only starts firing if you ""left click"" while AI handles your other weapons). 200 or so Captains now inhabit the universe and are unkillable. They'll learn to love or hate your guts depending on how you treat them.The lore is better than last time, with more written, explorable items in the world. Zombies are the main plot of the game and pirates not so much. (Everybody takes stuff without asking,even friendly factions and ships, so I guess that's sort of piracy? I do beat up anyone who touches my resources in my face, but they're numerous and will be back in a spiffy.)Bandits are permanently level 6 and are screwed by everyone all over the galaxy. The player can freely milk relationship points by ""aiding"" in their destruction by showing up for a minute before they are destroyed. Battles have a maximum of 4 ships, this makes for a lot of luck factor when you try to take a stronghold. Will 2 enemies or 2 allies come? Luckily the auto save is pretty smart and does it before every fight.It is an indie game, albeit a very polished one it still has some bugs and mishaps. I did crash to desktop once or twice. Given how cheap this game is I can easily overlook these things. Overall a very enjoyable game with decent replayability. 8.5/10.			"

								This is an immensely fun game! It shares a similar tone to the original but the gameplay is very different. If you were a fan of SPAZ1 for it's arcadey top-down gameplay, you may be disappointed with SPAZ2. Personally though, this is just about everything I've wanted in a game and I'm glad to have it on early access. I can't wait until multiplayer is available.			"

								All in all i give this Game a thumbs upit IS early access and while core game elements are there, there is tweaking that needs to be done. Luckily the devs are super active with the community and with time this will be a polished gem.Biggest surprise for me was that by now i really like the 3d view. At first i was taken aback and mostly used the 2d top down view (the game lets you switch freely) but with time i got more used to it and now it's my ""cinematic mode"" where stuff looks cooler and explosions are prettier.It's not SPAZ 1 obviously. SPAZ 2 is its own game, but i think it's a worthy successor which i come to like more the more i play it and which will get even better with added developmentHope this helps some to decide. I'm not super good at reviews :D			"

								This is the first review I've ever left on Steam. Even as an early access title, SPAZ2 feels nearly feature complete. I haven't quite finished the game, but in my 13+ hours I haven't run into a single crash or game breaking bug. Easily worth the price of entry if you were a fan of the original SPAZ, or other action space games like Rebel Galaxy. Make sure to change your control scheme in the option to Relative Controls. The default settings are a bit tricky.The game is a bit challenging initially. I highly suggest making it over the first hump, you'll find it really takes off from there. The dev's have acknowledged this and are looking to streamline the difficulty curve. The developers are very active with the community, soliciting feedback and suggestions on how to improve their game. You can really tell this is a labor of love, and I can't recommend it enough. "

								The game in its current form is worth the asking price of 20$, sadly unlike many other games you won't get more out of it than that. The game was just released however, and the devs have been pushing out hotfixes like crazy. The game at the moment lacks in several areas but I am confident that the developers will add a spectacular amount of content to the game in the near future.			"

Early Access Review
								The orginal SPAZ was a great game. Great RPG elements, ""upgrade until you are an indestructable monster"" kind of thing, but now that it comes to SPAZ 2...no, just no.I feel it can have a ton of potential but really, Its way too hard to get the parts you are looking for, by the time you find ONE of them, you would have already spent the next 1-2 hour(s) trying to find the scrap and Rez. Which I say is a PAIN, because we all know that running around in circles trying to find scrap/rez kinda gets boring after a while, but ontop of THAT, once you find your rez, you have a bunch of mad space captains putting bountys on you and it pretty much becomes impossible to survive. You get shredded, FORCED to respawn (not use old save file) and lose all your hard worked materials (or you can just kill 300 bandits just to get the parts you need, which gets boring also).And then after THAT you have to spend 500 rez to get to the other side of the galaxy ASAP (Due to restocking) and by the time you go and buy it, you would have already spent 20-60 minutes of your time and ontop of that, its only one piece, thats it!or you could just rummage a nearby wreck and take the best thing in there and boy, it DOES make your ship look like it is a flying pile of scrap that fires a bunch of random projectiles, which I gotta say, ain't that worth it.second, how you are going to take out the infection if all of your faction has already been turned into a zombie! I remember spending almost over 50000 scrap just to put bountys on SOME of the infections region, but 30 seconds later, they recover all the land back.to put it short, they should add the option to build CUSTOM parts with a reasonable cost of rez, because its much easier than to spend the next hour looking for that one gun, but it looks ugly on your ship (which I mean, custom stats, looks, and weapons).I never got to finish the game yet (but I got close), but if they add this feature, I would gladly have a LOT more fun going through the game and making my ship look Badass and completely OP.WAIT, im not finished yet, theres still the ""ups"" part of ""ups and downs"".I like the 3D modeling, it makes it that there are more TACTICS to the game (lasers on side, cannons other etc.) but the movement of the ship is still 2D, kinda dissapointing but its fine.Free roaming of the map gives you the feeling of freedom and can see the galaxy's inhabitants interact with each other, giving it a more ""lively"" feeling.If the developers (MINMAX) decide to give notice to this and add the ability to modify parts or add sprays on this ship aswell as make your own Pirate logo, then I would gladly go ahead and finish this game.I am sure SPAZ2 will become quite the game one day.7.5/10 "

								WARNING: Highly addictive! In the span of a three day weekend I spent over 20 hours playing this game. I even went to an amusement park one of those days. About the game. It is early access but it is 100% playable. The voices are synthasized which is kinda cool and fun to be honest but does get old. They plan on getting voice actors before release. Some of the menues could have a smoother flow. For instance I cant give another captian tribute and then return to the main captian interface to interact with him again. Minor issue. A lot of playability, You can lay out your ship from the ground up. So you can change the style of your ship to suite your style or mood. Go accross the Galaxy finding the best core to mesh with the best wings and engines. It is just afun game for me. For my 20$ for early access purchase I got more than my monesys worth.			"

The lore's a little too ""crazy"" or ""funny for my personal taste, but even after completing the game I still come back every few days to fight some battles or manage my faction.

								I really enjoy this game.It's mostly a large sandbox where you progressively get stronger and attain more power and territories while crushing anyone who believe they have a chance to overthrow your empire.At the moment I recommend buying it but I still feel like it requires polishing and a bit more content. Even though I enjoy the game in it's current state I would like more control of ones empire and more stuff to do. Right now it's core gameplay is fighting and... well... fighting.Mercenaries, perhaps making pirates active in different ways, maybe different starts (pirate start?), designating objectives for ones faction or receiving objectives by leader.

								So, I've played SPAZ for 62 hours (felt like more) and SPAZ 2 for 16.2 (just finished the story, felt like less time though.I loved SPAZ, a simple game where the more grind you put in, the more you got out, simple (seemingly) mechanics meant for a lot of fun, collecting the different ships, weapons, techs becoming more and more powerful and so on.If you expect SPAZ 2 to be just a brand new SPAZ, don't buy it, yet. While 2 looks a lot nicer in everyway, I found it to be disappointing in comparison to the original.So why do I recommend it? Because SPAZ 2 is still enjoyable, just not as much as the original, which was a lot of fun.Pros of SPAZ 2: -Looks awesome. -Battles are more fun to take part in, more tactics involved.-Changing your ship on-the-fly, if there are bits floating around.-Story is ok. Meh. It's funny. To be honest the storyline was never a big thing for me in this or the first, it's ok though.Cons of SPAZ 2 (I havn't done sandbox mode yet, so some of these may be my lack of knowledge of the game):-Rez. Flying around eats rez, a lot of rez (may be the amount of stuff in my inventory?) which makes traveling around quite a pain, as you're reduced to slow speed most of the time.-Inventory system. While being able to change on-the-fly is good, it should be a damn sight easier and pain free when you are doing it out of combat. While your parts are sort of nicely organised, it quickly becomes a pain if you collect too many.-Simplicity. Ok, this may be a comparision to the original, but it's my feeling. In the original you could have a number of random timed events you could take part in, not so here, in the original you built up from a small ship to a massive one, not here (ok, you start off with less cores, but when you consider you started in somthing smaller than your current strike craft, the size difference is not that much.) In the original you had to plan where you spent skills, so you would buy weapons etc to become highly specialsed in your ships, here, it doesn't really matter.-Items. It becomes quite a pain later in the game trying to find the ship parts you want, my base at a threat level of 70+ and a major trade hub never got better than 2 star stuff, and rarely any good, which ment I would have to travel everywhere to find the good stuff.-Zombies. Yeah, not really dangerous once I actually started fighting them (good planning partly), but it became a pain trying to wipe them out. They would respawn quicker than kill them all, and my guys weren't all that bothered defending their stations.-Needs more than 4 mother ships in battle. Seriously, late game, big battles would be so much better. You lose a lot of tactics as you either have to kite because you are out numbered, charge in when you outnumber them, or can charge right in when even, as they aren't much of a threat =/All in all an enjoyable game, which is certainly on track to being an excellent sequel (in large part as the devs are active in the discussion), but as of yet, has some way to go. But it's early access, which gives me hope!			"

Flying around eats rez, a lot of rez (may be the amount of stuff in my inventory?) which makes traveling around quite a pain, as you're reduced to slow speed most of the time.-Inventory system. While being able to change on-the-fly is good, it should be a damn sight easier and pain free when you are doing it out of combat. While your parts are sort of nicely organised, it quickly becomes a pain if you collect too many.-Simplicity. Ok, this may be a comparision to the original, but it's my feeling. In the original you could have a number of random timed events you could take part in, not so here, in the original you built up from a small ship to a massive one, not here (ok, you start off with less cores, but when you consider you started in somthing smaller than your current strike craft, the size difference is not that much.) In the original you had to plan where you spent skills, so you would buy weapons etc to become highly specialsed in your ships, here, it doesn't really matter.-Items. It becomes quite a pain later in the game trying to find the ship parts you want, my base at a threat level of 70+ and a major trade hub never got better than 2 star stuff, and rarely any good, which ment I would have to travel everywhere to find the good stuff.-Zombies. Yeah, not really dangerous once I actually started fighting them (good planning partly), but it became a pain trying to wipe them out. They would respawn quicker than kill them all, and my guys weren't all that bothered defending their stations.-Needs more than 4 mother ships in battle. Seriously, late game, big battles would be so much better. You lose a lot of tactics as you either have to kite because you are out numbered, charge in when you outnumber them, or can charge right in when even, as they aren't much of a threat =/All in all an enjoyable game, which is certainly on track to being an excellent sequel (in large part as the devs are active in the discussion), but as of yet, has some way to go. But it's early access, which gives me hope!			"

								I have mixed feelings on the game as of the initial early access release.If the game is still under development, then I would say buy it. The eventual state of SPAZ 1 was awesome, and well polished. However, the current state of SPAZ 2 is neither. If the dev is only lookng for bug reports, then this is underwhelming and I would strongly encourage people to skip this title.In particular, the map UI is clearly a placeholder. The icons used for ships and the general polish over the map view is exceptionally poor given how much time you spend watching your little triangle move slowly across the map.  If the map view was not such a large piece of time, the difference in polish between map and ship view wouldn't be so glaring.Progression is also pretty bad. Eventual Zombie strength is chosen at game creation, and in no way dynamic. The climax of the game seems to work around the idea that the Zombies will win unless aliances can be forged or the humans can essentially achieve a domination victory in the non-zombie space so they can finally focus on the zombies. There isn't much wiggle room, so you have to hope the human pilots have progressed far enough that once the zombie infestation starts, it will be possible to continue growing strong enough to attack the main zombie.The universe scale is pretty sad. It seemed chosen to keep it presentable in the screen without zooming too far out. It's only a minute to zoom from one side to the other. There is no distance between factions, which is great for driving conflict but effectively turns SPAZ 2 into only the last two X in a 4X game. Just allowing a more gradual ramp-up over a larger number of sectors would go a long way to allowing multi-phased progression.			"

								Another great showing from the duo at minmax.More of a spiritual sequel to the original the devs wanted to switch things up and came up with another cool and unique game. It is early access so it's definitely not perfect, but very fun for what it has. At any given time there is a lot going on and the game needs more clarity in terms of function of items, composition of ships, controls, actual damage output of various things, simpler way to check ship and part health (maybe a paused tactical view like the first one?), and better control of your faction (the bounty system is good but insufficient). Having said all that, the core gameplay is here and it's fun. I wouldn't expect much more than that from Early Access. The game needs polish and the devs are very aware of this, considering how active they are and the great work they did with the original I have no doubt they are dedicated and will end up with an amazing game.I am enjoying it and wil continue to enjoy it while it goes through early access development. More power to you MinMax!			"

								would i recommend spaz 2 as it is now ?the answer is no...keep in mind that i have only play it for two hours And it is and early acces game.anyways -> why i wont recommned.why?1. everything i liked about spaz 1, has been replaced, removed.2. space battles are slow, cumbersome, dumbed down with controls that leave you scowling.your mothership is essentially your battleship, the smaller ships are now useless little flies you have little to no control over.3. ships customization has been replaced with a mothership only modular block building mode.4. resource gathering has been removed, now bases autogather for you.5. the level up system from spaz has been replaced with a simplyfied version, where you pick one of three things when you level up.now keep in mind that im not saying spaz 2 is a bad game.but if you, like me, came expecting spaz 1, you will be dissapointed.like i said, i only played for two hours, if you think some of my points a wrong, feel free to correct me.

Early Access Review
								I waited so long for this game and I want to say that this is a hell blast of a ride. The first SPAZ is reminiscent to me as the gameplay is quite the same but with more Upgrades and First-person perspective. *My Review* (Early Access)On the SPAZ, I became quite frustrated on the last mission where you need to gain faction abilities by upgrading the stations and by repelling zombies on the various sectors. It was quite a hellish ride since from that point, the game became quite monotonous. Liberate a sector, upgrade, warp out, defend... rinse and repeat until you meet the minimum requirements. This game (SPAZ 2) however starts off with that frustrating feature. But aside from the negativity, I enjoy myself playing both SPAZ and SPAZ 2. SPAZ 2 is well made and I can feel the dedication the devs put into this game, those 4 years they took really bear a great game which will be remembered for a very long time. The game has a unique feel to it to an extent that I, myself feels like being dragged by a graviton missile, disabling me from exiting the game. The environment is unbelievably amazing, it is a thousand percent improved from the original game, if only I can set the game itself to be my computer's screensaver... *sob*...The battle system is great, it is engaging and there is no time that nothing is happening. I am really glad that there are fail gates which is a better substitute from an enemy moving to the very edge of the map/area which has happened a lot at the original SPAZ which will just force you to Mass Retreat rather then wasting time chasing a tiny hulled ship, but that is aside the point. I love the First Person Mode which has been added, it gives a whole new perspective into the game. The ship customization is BADASS! MixMax games did really a very good job at this. Ohhh... I had wished that I can customize the ship by block on the first SPAZ and this game made that♥♥♥♥♥♥happen. Story-wise, just by reading the Lore, I consider this  game sold to me. It makes the game more depth and enticing. But let us not forget the story, the game itself has a well-written story. It feels like every chapter is the climax, there is no time that there is nothing happening. Oh.... By the way.  Just a friendly tip, If you are having a problem from Ships Escaping, I suggest you gaining initiative in heading out to the Fail Gate itself and block the Ship from escaping or if he/she/it (damn.. robots are ""it"" right?) is right infront of the gate. Go and RAAAAAAM!!!!! the sh*t out of it until the green (laser? wave?) thing is gone, but don't get too close to the gate or else you will lose you Strike Forces.  "

Early Access Review
								[Online hours do not and will not reflect hours also played offline](current offline hours at the time of review: 10~ hours)	If you’re expecting gameplay exactly like the first SPAZ, you’ll be a little disappointed.  So if you do get SPAZ 2, try not to *puts on sunglasses and alahu akbars into the sun* SPAZ OUT.  AWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, I’m done.So far most, if not all my hours played of SPAZ2 have been offline as I have no internet access so like a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I have to go jack someone else’s (usually friends.  True story).  At the time of this review, I should mention that I have not played the first SPAZ but had an interest in it.  Thus it seems pretty strange I have the sequel but never played the original.  Having no bias for the first game, here’s my review.[GRAPHICS]	Graphically this game is GORGEOUS.  Most of the game is traversed in a top-down, 2D format as you trek across the galaxy, or at least a small portion of space, which is huge.  Massively huge.  Infinitely huge.  But when you do get to play the game in third person (or top down like the first one, according to screenshots) the game is brilliant.  It’s like TRON, Black Ice, and the biggest star in the visible curve of space all had a threesome and out popped the graphics engine the game runs on.  The beauty is mostly in the lighting and the cool glowy things that bring you back to your days wondering what the hell all the blinky things in Star Trek were before you realized they were probably just gummy candies smushed on top of super-heated light bulbs.  The ship models are wonderful and it’s nice to see a game that has visible polygons for once.  I like my games that look like games and not some kind of life simulation with dinosaurs and mutated looking humans.  All the pilot’s pictures are all hand-drawn and remind me of old 90’s games that had a similar art style.  It feels very reminiscent of those kind of games and it brings me back.[SOUND/MUSIC]	The captain chatter gets a little old but this is an rpg we’re talking about.  However, the soundtrack gets pretty ♥♥♥♥ing awesome sometimes with all of its swells and massive musical numbers.  Despite that the soundtrack repeats, I love it.  It feels very open and like you’re traversing space, trying to survive like it’s the 1800s.  You have the pirates or freelance captains, all the fighting factions and zombies.  I suppose this game isn’t called “Space Pirates and Zombies 2” for nothing.  The engine and weapon sounds are nice enough to listen to but not necessarily bad.[GAMEPLAY]	The gameplay plays a lot like the 2004 re-make of Sid Meier’s pirates, it really does.  After getting settled into the 2D/3D views of SPAZ2, I felt quite at home with how the game played.  You essentially do the same things and can do the same things, only in space and you can customize your ship any freaking way you like. Speaking of customization – ever wanted a ship that was a giant straight line?  Do that.  Ever wanted to make a ship that looked like an S finger ♥♥♥♥ed an 8-bit video game?  Yes, you can do that.  Ever wanted a ship that had no discernable shape but was nothing but weapons?  Do that.  It’s all up to you, pal.  Or in case you’re so inclined, just make your ship look like a giant running shoe and you’ll be all set.	The actual combat in SPAZ2 is interesting but it isn’t terrible.  For me, I’m a crossbred gamer between “arcade” space games of various titles and “simulator” space games like Elite: Dangerous.  The flying around in your little battle zone like fight club is fluid.  But you can only fly sideways or rotate just slightly, kind of driving a car, only in space.  It would be nice to be able to control the pitch of your ship as well and pull off some pretty slick moves.  If it gets added later, that’s cool.  I find it’s not that big of a hit to my review of the game but it is something that I’ve gotten accustomed to in my measly 21 years of playing video games.	Trading; every faction and every captain in space can be traded with, killed, fought, etc. and each faction has a certain specialty and they’ll trade primarily in those kinds of parts.  For example: one faction might be really into engines, so you’ll find mostly engine parts; others might be super into wings.  On top of trading and parts, there is an economy (kind of) that loves to rip you off if you’re not careful with where you buy from.  It’s like the fight between Target and Walmart.  “Well, Target has a really good t-shirt I like, but Walmart’s is cheaper…”, only the miles between the Target and Walmart to one space station to the next is astronomically different.	The last little bit is faction reputation.  I know a lot of gamers have played games that involve faction reputation.  Off the top of my head, Fallout NV and Fallout 4 are two that I think of immediately.  Are there factions?  Yes.  But do all of them mesh like a world that’s constantly changing?  No.  SPAZ2 tries to emulate warring factions whose reputations with each other change damn near on a dime.  What you do with each faction can change how which factions feels about you.  If you steal or kill a pilot controlling a certain faction’s space station, some will feel good about you, others will not.  If you want to be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that kills on sight, well you’re kind of screwed – pilots can be a threat and if you challenge someone that’s tougher than you, I hope your engines are faster than theirs are.	A thing I was recently unaware of was bounties. ♥♥♥♥♥♥off enough captains, you can have a bounty set on your head and people will come after you.  You better hope you have more Rez than they do in order to outrun them otherwise you’re pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed.  Not only that, but you can set bounties to have other captains do your dirty work, or even vice versa.  I haven’t successfully completed any bounties because I currently have half the ♥♥♥♥ing galaxy after my♥♥♥♥♥… god damn Sun worshipers.Too long; didn’t read…Pros:+ Graphics are very pretty.  Lots of lights and things to look at+Hand-drawn captain portraits+ gameplay is fun if you try not to be biased from the original SPAZ gameplay+ DO WHAT YOU WANT CAUSE A PIRATE IS FREE, YOUUUU ARE A PIRATEEEEE+ ♥♥♥♥ up everyone’s day – then get ♥♥♥♥ed yourself+ Economy that changes+ If you’re nice to a faction and join them, other captains will come help you out.  Yay friendship!+ YOHO FLIBBERDYGY BEING A PIRATE IS ALRIGHT TO BECons:- Starting out can be difficult but this isn’t a huge con for me.  You gotta really work hard for your ship and your crew.  Steal♥♥♥♥♥♥from everyone if you have to.- If you don’t read the tutorials, have fun figuring♥♥♥♥♥♥out!- Firing your weapons when most of them are automatic can be a little confusing; again, not a huge loss or con10/10: Would condone piracy again.

								This is a great foundation upon which even more seems to be coming. There is nothing quite like this on the market, and there is room for even more novelty within the game.If you are having trouble in combat, as it seems almost all of the negative reviewers are, just press the '1' key. This will allow all of your weapons to engage at will on preferred targets. Then just fly around and blow stuff up.The only problem I've seen so far are the mining missions; they are the greatest source of income from the least exciting part of the game.Also, start at least one game at max level.  It's more fun designing a ship with 40 parts than one with 10, and battles can get quite impressive with hundreds of drones and missiles and strike craft.Hopefully MinMax keeps up the good work.			"

But I'm stick to one simple line.But I'm never used some types of weapons, espesially close combat types, because in many battles you should keep distance to be alive. Final battle was fanny ^_^.

								That's supposed to be a review..., dislike talking much.Well, having more hours of gameplay than most of players living so it should be important for customers right?First of all, this game is worth it, worth the time and the money (tho at start checked if there is already free cracked version) but now not regreting buying this game. Game contains many silly jokes, situations or dialogues, the most important thing to get at the end of day is just sound of ""Ding!"" from Carl when leveling up and his happy face when blowing our mind.The world is small, the game is easy after beating zombos (just be hero and stand against zombies using all money for bounties on bases and killing captains to the moment when heart can be striked down) but that's on normal mode. (when will finish expert mode then will maybe edit this part of review).But maybe world is small, maybe end-game weapons let player to shred enemies into piece, even solo starbases but to come to end game weapons, they must be found, they are extremaly rare, with 33 hours still didn't find mass driver, belive us, having mass driver is like winning the game already, but going to the point, rest of the game is excelent, battle content, shreding enemies part by part while they can do the same (only they can't ram players... sadly), building bases and faction, being hero and protecting universe from zombies even when all are against thou, the story is short but well made (just don't make first starbase in the center of map okay?). No farming here also, the only farming time is when someone want quick level-up and left leveling setting to normal not sprint, then use arenas but it ends quickly not like in previous SPAZ 1 where farming parts or Rez was so painful grind for hours when playing hardest difficulty.Eh, don't know what to say more? just buy it already? there is anyway refund option fools, it downloades in seconds and gives fun for real life time days. That's best space battle simulator ever played, it beaten SoaSE which was the greatest experience before release of SPAZ 2. Some ppl also make... ""cons"" and ""pros"" so... will try to do the same.Let's start from bad things to be clear.""Cons""- Small world (it seems to be just the core space from SPAZ 1 bcs of titan gates down but that's just a theory, missing the option of making galaxy smaller/bigger)- End-game weapons are OP, sawblades, chainsaw beam, mass driver, these weapons means victory, well, they need to be well used but mass drvier is realy victory time, have one, break shields, kill enemy. (but theya re extremaly rare)- AI's can't realy do all what player can, well, they can set bounties, bombard, attack, raid, it seems like everything, but they can't kill bandits base, they are stupid enough to fight zombies alone or strong bandits (at start of the game) and they can't ram players while player can ram them which sometimes means... fatality, raming does massive damage if aimed correctly.That's all of the bad things, realy liking this game and other than this can't find more. Let's start the good ones shall we.""Pros""- Best space battle simulator on Steam. How many games had idea of shreding enemies part by part, removing their engines, weapons, leaving this floating sub-cores that as much harmful as friendly heavy from TF2? (tho that's sad to fiinish these sub-cores, rly wish would keep them as pets)- Weapons, like in SPAZ 1 have their tasks of taking down shields, armor or hull, thereis no just stupid pure dps like most games.- Strike craft, these little things are so annoying, but they do the job, we just don't put perks into them, likes manualy attacking but they are realy powerful and behaves like in SPAZ 1 extra ships, just they don't respawn infinitely during battle (which is of course good too, it would be overpowered with respawn)- Perks, there is no skill-tree, don't know if call it good or bad... but random perks makes that every playthro will be different, thou wilt be damage dealer, tank, scavenger, trader or maybe mixed one, time will show when Carl will say Ding!- Dialogues and some extra things like Lore or in space there can be found info ring... with currency symbols, ahah... just find it in battle, but don't shoot it, just read, they have funny currency names.Forgot what else could put here..., just being impatient to go back to game and face expert mode sandbox. Sadly, we wish in sandbox mode would be more settings... dunno to what but just likes customization. Also, Blorf, please give us more cores, 20 or 25 max space for cores, can't fisnih ship, is not ideal... it hurts, not only eyes, but also can't put some parts together by it, make enemies even stronger but gives us cores. Make also masochist difficulty like before, we need to get rekt in 1 shot, we need legendary enemies, finished SPAZ 1 with 200% damage killing boss in less than 5 seconds so com'on. Also from the hot-fix, don't nerf zombos!, we ebaten them on normal without letting them spread further than 3 bases so srsly , noobs, calm down and let Blorf raise up difficulty and if have problems, just go back to novice mode.Thanks for reading, if it makest thou to buy this game or helped to decide if this is the right choice then we will be realy happy for helping devs.EDIT Section:Since this reviev is so long that we are too lazy to read it again and change, will just put here our opinion after that ""long"" time after release.So, did the game get better?, surely yes. In what way?, let's start with imagination, devs put new content into this gameevery 1-2 weeks and big updates every month. What they basicaly do is listen to players feedback, they read everyday what players say and to almost everyone answer.Bandits got buffed, building ship got 2 ways so if someone realy is butthurt then can press RMB to connect parts rather than using beam, they added synergy buffs that is in progress of making the game not only played by stick ship which was the best shape for last months. They gave us tools to buy things from far away, they changed starbases so ally with the same amount of upgrades won't have 40 threat lvl stronger base from nowwhere, they fixed tons of bugs that this game is almost flawless untill they add something new in which will be something, but for now... game is clear.For SPAZ 1 butthurts, no, this game is not like SPAZ 1, this is continuation, not SPAZ 1.5, battles are in 3D, map is different, acutaly need to watch movement, there is no insta jumps between stars or regions, just get used to it, this game is not worse, this game is different, and in our opinion this is better version that before, the only thing we miss are some weapons that does not exist here (but here are also weapons that didn't exist there so something for something).

People expected something yet they got something else, or they don't like the way it turned out, or it looked good and then it wasn't as good as it looked.  I get it, but I for one am loving this game.  Is it VERY different from the first game? Yes, yes it is, the 3D view, the Starmap mechanics are closer to Mount and Blade than they are to the original SPAZ.  If you're looking for SPAZ, then you might want to go play the original SPAZ, because you really won't find much of it here.  HOWEVER, if you're looking for a new take on the game, from the starmap to the ship building to the combat then keep reading Like I said, the Starmap mechanics are actually rather similar to Mount and Blade.  You travel around a world map and fly up to events and do them from the map.  The only time you go to the 3D view is when you get into combat, and some parts of the story that don't require combat.  The combat is actually a bit closer to the game Rebel Galaxy (also an awesome game, in my opinion) rather then the original SPAZ.  I like it a lot, but you might not if you didn't enjoy Rebel Galaxy or you like the faster paced fighter craft style combat of the first game.Ship Building! Oh the ship building in SPAZ 2 is GREAT!  You actually fly your mothership this time, and you build it module by module.   You can actually define the shape and look of your craft using different parts like structural core parts, wing parts, weapon parts and noses, each offer their own weapons and stat boosts.My one major gripe with the game has been the UI.  It feels a bit...Odd.  It's not bad persay. but it takes some getting used to.  If you have any trouble with it, ask in the forums, the devs are more than happy to help, and other players have been awfully friendly.I haven't finished the story yet, so I can't comment on how good it is just yet.  What I've played, I've enjoyed, that's all I'll say about that TL;DR sectionProsShip Building is fun and freshCombat is slowed down, but it feels powerful and exciting3D environments for combat look gorgeousStarmap is a neat way to interact with the world; Similar to Mount and BladeConsUI is a bit clunky and takes some getting used to.Problems with the UI means that the difficulty can be quite high before you get used to the game.Things I can't comment on The StorySandbox Mode			"

								Quite a differnet experience than the 1st, but just as deep.  Its rare to see a truly living universe, where each aspect is simulated to this degree.  Can be slow at times, but these things can and will improve with player coloberation with the dev team, who are active and commited to making SPAZ2 the best it can be.Graphics and sound are great, and it retains the charm and humour of the first game.

Early Access Review
								Just finished my first playthrough of the game.Things that I really liked:I like the various captains, and to me the mystery of the parts that you're going to get made for some of the fun.The ship builder was fun to play around with, and I ended up trying out three very different builds before finding one that worked for me.Things that I'd like to see some tweaks to:The following were bits that I felt distracted from the overall fun of the game, and if they could be tweaked I think would remove a layer of tedium.1.  Ship parts.  I really, really wish there were a way to just swap out a single part from the ship builder screen.  I just read that you can essentially accomplish this during the ""Trade"" funtion with bases by trading out the part you want to swap, but it would be nice if you could just swap two cores with each other during the ship building screen without having to remove all the attached parts.2.  Ship builds.  Would it be possible to add the ability to 'remember' a certain number of previous ship builds, or at least core layouts?  There were times I would have been tempted to try out a part for a fight or two, but it wasn't worth rebuilding the entire mothership to give the part a try.  If I could quickly swap between core layouts, it might mitigate that.3.  Infections.  Late in the game, those get pretty viscious.  There were quite a few fights that I just had to restart after getting hit with a zombie bomb right after shields dropped.  I was toting around 3x as many goons as I was 'supposed' to, and my crew could still barely stay ahead of the infection.  Along the same lines, it would be nice if the 'infection repair' option from the main map could work faster.  Most of the time, once my ship got infected I could not complete an 'infection repair' without getting attacked by other zombie ships while trying to clear the infection out.  It led to eventul death with no possible escape.  That or an option to clear the infection out while you're in a fight, maybe take a hit to weapon fire/shield recharge rates, or have some kind of ""infection killing"" boost you could fire off to give your goons a short advantage?4. Death penalty.  The death penalty for players is harsh.  The death penalty for computer players seems to consist of the time it takes their escape pod to reach the nearest starbase, at which point they're back out there and ready to go.  It would be nice if they could at least require some sort of real time to rebuild in game.  Towards the end, if there are enough zombie captains, they'd basically have a stream of their captain's escape pods heading to the nearest base, while another stream of recently recovered captains were heading back out to fight me again.5.  Battles:  Not sure if it would be possible, but it would be nice if the battle fields could get a bit larger, both in how many participants there are, and the actual size of the battle field.  Everyone starts closely enough together at the beginning that in a full battle, everyone is clashing within 10 seconds or less.  If things were spread a bit further apart, it might make a clear target who's left alone, or an ally that you're going to have to rush to help before they get crushed.  I also was disappointed to find that many of the battles I wanted to join were already full, with multiple ships from the other side taking out my ally, but I know if I could have joined in they'd have a chance.  Not sure if it would work, but maybe reserve a spot for the human player in battles to always join in?Overall, the game was a lot of fun.  It's a fun space strategy/shooter.  Probably the most impressive Early Release I've ever played.			"

								Lets clear something up to all the cry babys out there complaining about the multiplayer. The devs of spaz have contacted steam to increase the 2 week refund limit so as long as you were honestly in this for the multiplayer and didnt play more than 2 hours since you were obviously buying the game just to support them to get to the multiplayer functionality then you should be getting a full refund. A FULL REFUND (when steam oks this), be thankful. Its not your due its them going out of their way to make up for a mistake.I have to give big cudos to the devs for at least caring enough about their words to us that they are trying to give back since they were unable to deliver *cough* elite dangerous *cough*. Based on their notes they have spent at least 4 weeks trying to implement this and came to the decisions of spend more time and possibly run into more dead ends on something that most of the games pop dosn't care about (based on games forums) or continue on and make the game better as a whole. yes im disappointed but i'm also impressed they attempted to do what they could to right this wrong. people forget this is an early access game, and for once need to read the big *** note beside the buy button on the store page ""This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development.""So please if you rate any game rate it responsively.

Already has a full campaign and sandbox mode.Update: If you are worried about the Dev's being serious about the game, because I know some people don't trust Early Access games, you can rest assured that they are serious. They have released 6 updates in the first 3 days of launch. That is commitment folks.			"

								Great game! Get's better several times a day!While not a direct sequel to SPAZ it's got all the parts! Enjoyed my first playthrough of the story.If you're having difficulty with the story.. in whatever mode.. then don't rush the objectives! I'm methodical. I managed to make it to threat level 100 before taking on 9000. This made most encounters a bit too easy later on but.. I kind of expected that. If i want more of a challenge, i'll rush more or raise the difficulty. Working on Sandbox now and enjoying it as well!10/10 Would kill zombies in space again.			"

								Spaze 2 is.......Amazingly fun and offers diverse gameplay and customisable ships. Collect loot from destroyed ships and add it to your own. Build star bases and own your own corner of space. Gain skills as you level and add more ships to your collection. Dont like that guy over there put a bounty on his head just make sure he doesn't put one on yours. Join a faction of your choosing and go to war against opposing factions or make peace. Collect resources to sell or be a pirate and steal them from other ships. The choice is yours!Dont expect to conquer the universe any time soon. this is no 3 hour campaign type game. I am many hours into my first play through and feel like I am still discovering the game. I am already thinking about my next play through and maybe the one after that. Its one of those games that you think about playing when ever your not playing it.8/10			"

								I would highly recommend this game if you enjoyed the first in the series, but don't expect more of the same thing like most sequels do.  The game adds so many new elements that I almost forgot it was a sequel; Incredible mothership customization, competition with 199 other Space captains, and a whole dynamic global economy all combine into the best early access game I've played, not to mention the constant gorgeous sceneryAdmittedly the first 10 levels were dull since each space captain, including you, needs time to develop to a point where allies have been made, and backs have been stabbed, and at that point the game really starts to shine.Oh and you can hurl every ounce of space rock and toxic waste within the reach of your mighty tractor beam at your helpless opponents, and ram into their engines when they attempt to flee, thanks to the physics engine.

Early Access Review
								I'm gonna try and keep this review simple 'n' concise, but I'll definitely fail, 'cause as ANYONE who's read my more recent reviews knows, I don't hold back. I'm a long-winded sonuvabïtch!Let me start off by saying that this game is QUITE different from SPAZ 1, or as I prefer to call it these days, SPAZ(ABH). The gameplay, graphics, sound, hell, even weapon balances are completely altered. One of the most notable differences is the complete absence of skills. Instead, they've opted for giving you a selection of (presumably random) perks to pick from every time you level up.I both like and dislike this method, especially if it's random. If it's random, then that may make the game more interesting in the long run, especially when replaying it, but it also makes it a lot more difficult to get a balanced or specialized build going. It's a double-edged ion torpedo, really.However, the absence of skills and the use of perks instead lets you focus on the attributes of the perks, instead of being FORCED to waste, YES WASTE, skill points in a worthless tech tree, JUST to be able to equip a decent turret. YES, I'M LOOKING AT YOU, TURRET TECH TREE IN SPAZ 1. YOU WERE UTTERLY USELESS, AND A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT TO YOUR MOTHER!Anyway... back on topic. As is almost an absolute requirement for a proper sequel, the graphics have been updated, and lemme tell yas, they may have been charming and quite easy on the eyes in SPAZ 1, but HOLY FREAKIN' MOTHER OF A TURDBURGER, they look amazing in SPAZ 2! The change from 2D to full 3D (even though you still move along a 2D plane, SOMEHOW) has brought with it a slew of interesting backdrops, texture updates for ships, and a variety of excellently rendered doodads to litter the battlefield.The sound has become a LOT better as well; as anyone who used The Carrier with full missile armaments and weapons on it in SPAZ 1 knows, the sound effects were not great. Not ear-bleedingly bad, but just... meh, in lack of a better word. Now, the sound is a lot more pleasing.One of the features I was most excited about with SPAZ 2 was the new shipbuilding system, and my god, I never, absolutely NEVER, thought you could make it any simpler than the system in Pixel Pirates. But apparently, those glorious nutters at MinMax not only tried, but gracefully succeeded! It may not be as fun as I thought it'd be, but hey, it serves its purpose! And it really does give you a hard lesson in humility and the importance of balance, too. With great ship weight comes great responsibility. Or in this case, a great demand for rez!See, rez has become less of a ""be-all-end-all"" resource in SPAZ 2, as it's now used primarily as engine fuel for your ship. Sure, it's also used to synthezise food for your crew, but that's an extremely minor expenditure compared to the new ""rez drive"" that the game's larger ships use. So naturally, a ship with a greater weight/mass, i.e. one with a great deal of modules attached to it, will expend a LOT more rez when traveling around. This makes the game interesting, without making it downright unfair, unlike certain OTHER games with fuel systems... *cough* Convoy *cough*Crew has also become a much more interesting factor in SPAZ 2, as they're now absolutely CRUCIAL to your survival, rather than a mere number that determines your hull repair speed, like they were in SPAZ 1. See, if you don't maintain a large enough crew for a big ship, you'll steadily suffer damage due to poor maintenance, overworked crew members, or whatever else may apply. They no longer just repair your ship. They're literally keeping it intact, and figuratively acting as the glue for your main vessel.Last but not least, the much-boasted-of feature of having a ""dynamic universe"". I can't complain about it being dynamic, because it really actually is, with every other captain in the galaxy/sector having their own personalities, political affiliations, goals, dreams, secret racist opinions... well, maybe it's not THAT complex, but they do have their own personality traits which alters the way they act in response to various events. Some approve of do-gooders who help the weak, others find such behaviour to be a despicable waste of firepower.It also helps that they remember what happens. See, what AI in games often lacks is a cohesive MEMORY. They may react realistically to an event AS IT HAPPENS, but they'll forget all about it the moment it's over. If you attack somebody, everyone in the vicinity will witness this AND remember it. Some will like you for it, some will hate you, and some might not even care. But it makes the galaxy a lot more living.However, one thing I'm NOT totally okay with is the SIZE of the game world! See, I'm one spoiled motherfûcker when it comes to space games, having been brought up with classics such as Elite 2 and Freelancer, in which you really DID have incredibly vast amounts of space to explore. In SPAZ 2, I feel there's just a lack of space, and especially exploration, as every sub-sector only needs to be glanced at for less than a nano-second while casually speeding through it at hyperspeed, in order to map out the ENTIRE AREA.I'm not exactly thrilled about THAT. And the INCREDIBLY small scale (or at least what FEELS like a small scale) of the game world in and of itself leads to all of it feeling dreadfully same-y after just a few hours of playing. Maybe the world will somehow become ""bigger"" later in the game, or maybe the devs will release an expansion pack or even just DLC that'll make it less cramped and more spacious, but unless either of those things happen, I feel the game completely misses the absolutely most CRITICAL point of having a space-based setting: HUGE SCALE!All in all though, SPAZ 2 is absolutely great. Not perfect, not by a long shot, but I can safely say that it's extended my list of games worthy of buying in Early Access to now include FOUR titles. And in case you're ESPECIALLY dumb: YES, THAT MEANS SPAZ 2 IS WORTH BUYING FOR THE FULL PRICE WHILE IT'S IN EARLY ACCESS, YOU UNDER-EVOLVED EXCUSE FOR A PRIMATE! 8.1/10			"

								For the 18+ hours I've been playing in the campaign, this game has been a ton of fun.  The map is full of stuff to do, I'm still finding captains I've never met, and right now I'm a high enough level where I can play with some of the funnest weapons.  I wish the captains in my faction would be better about protecting my bases, but I'm sure any issues I've found so far will be fixed soon enough. For $20, its definitely worth the purchase.Also on a side note, the voice acting isn't dont yet, but the robo voices in the game right now have made for some pretty funny moments.  I'm not 100% sure why, but I laughed so hard when Dr. Memford said ""Diiiiiiiiiing"" like he was stoned out of his mind once I had leveled up.			"

REVIEW SCORE: 6.5 / 10BUY ONLY IF ON A GOOD SALEA decent game, which i STILL recommend, but it does not catch the true essence of its predecessor, tries to innovate but fails in many fields. Pros & Cons  + Pros + + Combat system is fun and involving+ Good campaign, albeit short+ Overall good territory management system+ Varied weapons and modules for many play styles+ The gameplay makes progression stimulating - Cons - - Diplomacy with other factions and Captains is far too simplistic- Limited maximum number of ships in fights prevent battles to become epic and large scale, they will always be just skirmishes- Ship building system is impractical- Some weapons are WAY overpowered- Plot is stereotyped and boring- ...No possibility of rotating ship parts, which have to be placed in specific positions only. This heavily limits the designs a player can build- Resource balance in lategame needs to be adjusted a lot- Some questionable minor gameplay choices, like: why you can bribe a captain with ship parts you magically send light years away instantly, but you cannot ask him to join your faction unless you are close to him?- Final boss fight is miserable- Game mechanics overall are far too simplistic and have made steps backward srom the original SPAZ===This game is fine for being an early access, but needs a lot of polishing and introduction of new mechanics and some depth. Currently, it's just a big sandbox with some strategy elements, some building, and some space shooting on 2 dimensions, even if the combat is 3D.My final consideration is this:This game is not as great as his predecessor. SPAZ 1 was a lot more deep in gamplay mechanics, harder, more varied, better in almost every aspect apart from the possibility of building your own ship design with hull blocks, but even this aspect which should be the best feature of this game is dwarfed by the limitations imposed by the building mechanics themselves, whwere pieces are divided in front, left, right and engine, cannot be rotated, and must be placed in forced ways, leaving the player little choice about their design.Also, there is no possibility of building on multiple heights, your ship will always be 1 in height. A multi-layered building system would be great for different designs.This long-awaited sequel is at the moment not enough to beat his ancestor, which still is better in almost every aspect except graphics.A more complex version based on the same gameplay style of SPAZ 1 would have been better, but the developers chose to totally redesign gameplay in a form that is far too simplistic, unpolished and less in-depth that the one they proposed in SPAZ 1.This game is sufficent, but will never achieve the greatness of its prequel.

								[Online hours do not and will not reflect hours also played offline](current offline hours at the time of review: 10~ hours)	If you’re expecting gameplay exactly like the first SPAZ, you’ll be a little disappointed.  So if you do get SPAZ 2, try not to *puts on sunglasses and alahu akbars into the sun* SPAZ OUT.  AWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, I’m done.So far most, if not all my hours played of SPAZ2 have been offline as I have no internet access so like a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I have to go jack someone else’s (usually friends.  True story).  At the time of this review, I should mention that I have not played the first SPAZ but had an interest in it.  Thus it seems pretty strange I have the sequel but never played the original.  Having no bias for the first game, here’s my review.[GRAPHICS]	Graphically this game is GORGEOUS.  Most of the game is traversed in a top-down, 2D format as you trek across the galaxy, or at least a small portion of space, which is huge.  Massively huge.  Infinitely huge.  But when you do get to play the game in third person (or top down like the first one, according to screenshots) the game is brilliant.  It’s like TRON, Black Ice, and the biggest star in the visible curve of space all had a threesome and out popped the graphics engine the game runs on.  The beauty is mostly in the lighting and the cool glowy things that bring you back to your days wondering what the hell all the blinky things in Star Trek were before you realized they were probably just gummy candies smushed on top of super-heated light bulbs.  The ship models are wonderful and it’s nice to see a game that has visible polygons for once.  I like my games that look like games and not some kind of life simulation with dinosaurs and mutated looking humans.  All the pilot’s pictures are all hand-drawn and remind me of old 90’s games that had a similar art style.  It feels very reminiscent of those kind of games and it brings me back.[SOUND/MUSIC]	The captain chatter gets a little old but this is an rpg we’re talking about.  However, the soundtrack gets pretty ♥♥♥♥ing awesome sometimes with all of its swells and massive musical numbers.  Despite that the soundtrack repeats, I love it.  It feels very open and like you’re traversing space, trying to survive like it’s the 1800s.  You have the pirates or freelance captains, all the fighting factions and zombies.  I suppose this game isn’t called “Space Pirates and Zombies 2” for nothing.  The engine and weapon sounds are nice enough to listen to but not necessarily bad.[GAMEPLAY]	The gameplay plays a lot like the 2004 re-make of Sid Meier’s pirates, it really does.  After getting settled into the 2D/3D views of SPAZ2, I felt quite at home with how the game played.  You essentially do the same things and can do the same things, only in space and you can customize your ship any freaking way you like. Speaking of customization – ever wanted a ship that was a giant straight line?  Do that.  Ever wanted to make a ship that looked like an S finger ♥♥♥♥ed an 8-bit video game?  Yes, you can do that.  Ever wanted a ship that had no discernable shape but was nothing but weapons?  Do that.  It’s all up to you, pal.  Or in case you’re so inclined, just make your ship look like a giant running shoe and you’ll be all set.	The actual combat in SPAZ2 is interesting but it isn’t terrible.  For me, I’m a crossbred gamer between “arcade” space games of various titles and “simulator” space games like Elite: Dangerous.  The flying around in your little battle zone like fight club is fluid.  But you can only fly sideways or rotate just slightly, kind of driving a car, only in space.  It would be nice to be able to control the pitch of your ship as well and pull off some pretty slick moves.  If it gets added later, that’s cool.  I find it’s not that big of a hit to my review of the game but it is something that I’ve gotten accustomed to in my measly 21 years of playing video games.	Trading; every faction and every captain in space can be traded with, killed, fought, etc. and each faction has a certain specialty and they’ll trade primarily in those kinds of parts.  For example: one faction might be really into engines, so you’ll find mostly engine parts; others might be super into wings.  On top of trading and parts, there is an economy (kind of) that loves to rip you off if you’re not careful with where you buy from.  It’s like the fight between Target and Walmart.  “Well, Target has a really good t-shirt I like, but Walmart’s is cheaper…”, only the miles between the Target and Walmart to one space station to the next is astronomically different.	The last little bit is faction reputation.  I know a lot of gamers have played games that involve faction reputation.  Off the top of my head, Fallout NV and Fallout 4 are two that I think of immediately.  Are there factions?  Yes.  But do all of them mesh like a world that’s constantly changing?  No.  SPAZ2 tries to emulate warring factions whose reputations with each other change damn near on a dime.  What you do with each faction can change how which factions feels about you.  If you steal or kill a pilot controlling a certain faction’s space station, some will feel good about you, others will not.  If you want to be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that kills on sight, well you’re kind of screwed – pilots can be a threat and if you challenge someone that’s tougher than you, I hope your engines are faster than theirs are.	A thing I was recently unaware of was bounties. ♥♥♥♥♥♥off enough captains, you can have a bounty set on your head and people will come after you.  You better hope you have more Rez than they do in order to outrun them otherwise you’re pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed.  Not only that, but you can set bounties to have other captains do your dirty work, or even vice versa.  I haven’t successfully completed any bounties because I currently have half the ♥♥♥♥ing galaxy after my♥♥♥♥♥… god damn Sun worshipers.Too long; didn’t read…Pros:+ Graphics are very pretty.  Lots of lights and things to look at+Hand-drawn captain portraits+ gameplay is fun if you try not to be biased from the original SPAZ gameplay+ DO WHAT YOU WANT CAUSE A PIRATE IS FREE, YOUUUU ARE A PIRATEEEEE+ ♥♥♥♥ up everyone’s day – then get ♥♥♥♥ed yourself+ Economy that changes+ If you’re nice to a faction and join them, other captains will come help you out.  Yay friendship!+ YOHO FLIBBERDYGY BEING A PIRATE IS ALRIGHT TO BECons:- Starting out can be difficult but this isn’t a huge con for me.  You gotta really work hard for your ship and your crew.

Early Access Review
								I loved SPAZ1 and sunk 61 hours into this game and was thrilled to see SPAZ2 finally come out as EA.Unfortunately I feel that this game is in no way a sequel to SPAZ1.The gameplay is very different where rather than you upgrading your fleet and so on you instead only upgrade your mothership. This would be OK if it was not incredibly tedious with actually rather few interesting options available early on. Much of the game seems to be gated behind one grind after another. This was actually also kinda the case in SPAZ1 - but it was far more fun.Fun is where this game falls apart. Combat isn't fun. In general you will either steamroll your enemies or fail miserably. Early on the vast majority of the combat is gated away from you because you start out with a junk heap and vast majority of enemies will wreck you - so you are stuck grinding for crap gear or joining in fights where 2 AI are engaged to ""help"".Ship upgrades are very minor, very very expensive and tedious to do. The ship designer is incredibly tedious to use - I have no idea what they were thinking. You need to pull parts off piece by piece to replace anything. You can use the trade window to try to upgrade parts but it's not at all intuitive.The ""world"" itself isnt' very interesting - yes there are factions, yes you can join them - but why? What makes them special? What are the differences? None of that really matters.This isn't a 'bad' game, but it doesn't stand out anymore. There are better games than this in everything it does:You want a cap ship combat game with a story? Starpoint Gemni 2 is better.You want a space ship centric 4X?  Beyond SOL is better - and has coop.You want a game where you upgrade a fleet and has great combat? Battlefleet Gothic is much better.SPAZ2 had a few things going for it, the open world, customization and originally the promise of coop.Coop is gone and the other aspects just aren't very good - so what it comes down to is this: SPAZ2 isn't a bad game but if you have a few hours to play a game, there are no real reasons to pick this one over the other offerings.

								I feel like this is a step backwards from the first SPAZ. Its definitely not a bad game, it just feels lackluster compared to its predecessor. Here are my few notes about it:-The switch to 3d failed to add any meaningful gameplay element to the game. -The 2d graphics were imho far prettier.-The interfaces are unintuitive and its hard to tell what's the difference between different pieces.-Ship impacts feel like they're made of rubber.-MP got canned.+Shipbuilding is fun-ish+Combat is similar to SPAZ and damage seems rather well done.+Starmap is quite pretty.+Base and Pirate interaction are rather well done.Overall, if you're a fan of the first SPAZ, you might like SPAZ2, I feel rather meh about it.

								SPAZ2 fails to redeliver what made their game popular in the first place, discarding most of what made SPAZ1 so well recieved and loved by its fans. MinMax decided against keeping those core gameplay and customization mechanics and building on them, instead they largely throwing them out and now focusing on ""tactical"" combat and slapped on features geared towards the Space Sim genre. Customization is limited to bulding your mothership by snapping parts to 'cores' and choosing your escort ships, which you cannot customize in anyway. The game also has a slow pace such as replacing the monotonous mining with boring node hunting and clicking. You will notice the higher production value of the game, but it feels like they spent more time on the 'cool graphics' than they did on gameplay.As it is the game betrays the feel of the first game and poorly impliments the new features. Do not expect it to change, regardless of it's Early Access status, as the developers have quoted that this is a different game from SPAZ1 and they and they're not diverging from their ""vision"" for the game. It is a shame beacuse that is not how successful sequels work.Edit: Cleaned up typos.			"

								SPAZ 1 was a great game that I loved replaying.SPAZ 2...is neither.SPAZ 2 is about your mothership; your Clockwork if you will. Basically, all you do is fight with your mothership.  All the hangar bays where you could pick out hulls and gear up the ships? Gone.  Completely.  Now additional ships are ""strike fighters"", throwaway ships that have no shields, cannot be modified in any way, and are basically meat to absorb a couple hits.That's assuming you actually find combat -- 90% of your gametime will be spent looking at a very minimal, sparse, boring overmap where you click on nodes to collect resources.  Really.I rarely ever review games, but this is a rare exception: This game is not good.  The game is absolutely nothing like SPAZ 1.  It is nearly devoid of content. The campaign could probably be completed in an hour or two.  I thoroughly wish I had not purchased this and feel cheated.			"

								The wait is over. Early Access it may be, but the ""Story"" is entirely playable and EA is just for tuning, tweaking and adding Multiplayer. It's radically different from SPAZ in most things but tone and premise. The devs are of the ultra-cool variety and this will just keep getting better.			"

great sequel to spaz1. im excited to get rid of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ microsoft sam voices but thats been the only flaw so far. a few crashes here and there but nothing that isnt to be expected. cant wait to keep playing this awesome gameEDIT: i see alot of people complaining about controls, looks, blah blah blah. this isnt spaz. its spaz 2. ships not maneuvering the way you want? learn the controls. (like hammering the brakes while boosting to hairpin turn....)as for looks, 3d is far superior to 2d. dont like 3d? then go live in 2d, see how you like that.one major problem ive had recently is running out of rez because of combat interruptions. save scumming is my answer but it shouldnt be.

								As a massive fan of the frst game it hurts to say this... But don't buy this, it's terrible. It might be worth a $10 price point but a $20 asking price is ridiculous. It really feels like it they tried to go for something that could've been fantstic but the execution has left it sadly lacking.It's completely confusing and even when you figure it out, both the progression and how to fight properly, the combat (the central gameplay mechanic) is incredibly boring... For people coming here because they loved the first game unfortulately there is literally no reason to play this.I'm sorry. I wanted to like this, but I just can't. I only hope one day it will be patched into a decent successor to SPAZ.			"

								SPAZ 1 vs. SPAZ 2The first SPAZ game is a 10 out of 10 for me.The scound one is about a 6 out of 10 as it is right now in early release.     ~ First: the ""risk reward punishment"" system dosn't really exist in this game like it does in the first one. When you died in the first one you had to go and gather resources, goons, levels, and build back up so you could try again. In this one you just fly back to your base and grab what it has gathered for you. So there is no risk when you try to progres and there are no walls to break through like the first one had.     ~ Second: Short... the game is very short. I beat the campaign on the hardest dificulty in about 4 hours... where the first one took me the whole weekend ~about 30 hours~ to beat on the hardest dificulty.     ~Third: the ship building, the customization for your mothership that you bring into battle with you was a cool idea but ultimatly I found that the only style of ships that where worth building are the ""L"" shaped or a ""C"" shape to get the most bang for your buck and it seems like they cap out on size. I would try and change this by amking guns mount on to the top and or bottom of every ship like guns that require 3 spaces in an L shape or 4 in a square... make it look like tetrece and have the guns on the side of the ship be more for frosting and the ones on the top and bottom more for the body of the cake...     ~ Fourth: everything becomes really easy to kill really fast to the pont that it becomes a dull repetive motion with no real reward for doing it. In the first one they had events that poped up all the time like the metorite ~I loved that one~ALL IN ALL: I gave this game a 6 because it's just pritty to play for a few hours then move on back to your main game to mostlikly never come back to this one again... because with steam every gamer has several hundred games in there library and over 35% of them have never been touched... But I did LVOE how the bad guy dies in the end =D that was hands down the best part of the game and made the 4 hours in the campaign worth it.			"

								EDIT: I have played a little longer and learned that the more bases ""you"" have the better. Each base gets a stock pile that you can collect later which makes this a better way to earn money than just doing arena.I have been waiting for this game for years and now that it is here I am disappointed. Please note that at the time this is written I have played around 16 hours and I am far enough in the story to start building bases.------------I would buy this game if you like to watch videos as you play a game------------------------My key points------------------Which brings me to the WORSTE part of this game, your ship. You spend all this money building a powerful ship… only to spend most of your time in arena flying a made-for-this-arena-ship. MOST OF THE COMBAT I HAVE DONE IN THIS GAME HAS BEEN IN SOMEONE ELSES SHIP! ---Which brings me to the SECOND THING I HATE THE MOST about this game. It is a grind. No, you don’t get it, every single part of this game is a massive grind. You want that new ship part? Grind arena. You want to join a faction and by want I mean have to as there is no other way to progress the story? Grind arena. You want to build a base for some random faction you were forced to join(to progress the story)? Grind arena. But I like to play grindy games! Cool, so do I, please return to my first “worst part of this game.”------------My key points------------What is good about this game?-The graphics and sounds are great-The combat is solid and fun---Although the combat can be automated you need to choose targets on a ship and shoot pieces off the ship to get the most out of combat.---Although I have not done this it seems like you could build a missile ship that stays away and hammers at enemies or a close combat ship that drives right in and rips them apart. I go for a mix.-The interface, all of them from the HUD to the star map, is perfect. The bad about this game.-This is another game that technically has “many ways to make money” but the truth is that one way is far better than any other to the point that doing anything else is a waste of time.---The Arena is the best way I have found to make money. In about 10 minutes I can blow through all the arena missions at a major base and have over 1k in “money.” But even this way of making money has its limits because once you beat a match playing it again gives around 25% of what you got the first time.------Which brings me to the WORSTE part of this game, your ship. You spend all this money building a powerful ship… only to spend most of your time in arena flying a made-for-this-arena-ship. MOST OF THE COMBAT I HAVE DONE IN THIS GAME HAS BEEN IN SOMEONE ELSES SHIP! -Money… There are three, THREE, types of money in the game. Sure they want to tell you that “REZ” is fuel for your ship and “goons” are needed to operate your ship but I sell them all the time. REZ is easy enough to come by that I don’t keep more than 50 on me. I keep just enough goons to stay above what I “need.”---Which brings me to the SECOND THING I HATE THE MOST about this game. It is a grind. No, you don’t get it, every single part of this game is a massive grind. You want that new ship part? Grind arena. You want to join a faction and by want I mean have to as there is no other way to progress the story? Grind arena. You want to build a base for some random faction you were forced to join? Grind arena. But I like to play grindy games! Cool, so do I, please return to my first “worst part of this game.”-The writing in this game is just as bad as the last game. I don’t have a problem with how the old game was written and this one is very similar it’s just… not engaging this time around. -I am only 16 hours in and I just built my first base... correction I just built the first base for the faction I was forced to join. I don’t have a base that earns me anything. I am not the leader of anything… At one point, about the time I stopped reading the story text, the “main character” points out that she saved the GALAXY from destruction and nobody knows or cares who she is.---I find it very poor writing that the team that saved the galaxy and has spent the last X number of years hunting down and killing left over bad guys is so broke their ship is made out of junk parts. It would have been much better if this game had started with the last mission to eradicate the zombie plague forever only to get our assess kicked and lose the moderately powerful ship we had.			"

								The game is ""early access"" so everyone gives it the benefit of the doubt. But having played my fair share of EA titles and seeing the 1.0 release, I can safely say that there is not much hope for this game. I don't want to imply that everything is wrong and there is nothing good. A sequel can be different and still be enjoyable. They even state that this is not a direct sequel, so I knew what I was getting into a bit. However, this game feels like an iphone ripoff game that has the look of the original, but not the feel. SPAZ 1 was a fun arcade style game that you could hop into and have a bit of fun no matter how long you played. This game has you do so much bs just to get into fights that are almost predetermined before hand. If I feel like auto-resolve is a better option than fighting, I think the game is missing what made the original fun to play. I will review it again if it goes to release, but unless they change the core game play, it will remain an interesting direction that, sadly, is just not fun to play.			"

								Don't take this in the wrong way or anything, It is a good game. Not a great game, but a good game.Buuuuuut.....Comparing it to SPAZ 1 has nothing to show. Lets compare the games shall we.REZ HARVESTINGIn the first game you had to harvest for REZ, either by going to a civilian mining station or destroying asteroids to get REZ. REZ was sent to your mothership the clockwork, as your ship got full of REZ it became slower.In SPAZ 2 you cant harvest the REZ in the same way, you scavenge it after a fight in a boring interface or buy it from spacestations. As i figured it out your ship dosen't get slower by REZ but instead get slower the more ship parts you carry with you.In SPAZ 1 if you get in a battle you had the option to dump your REZ in space to free up space and become faster, You could even do this with your armor platings to gain speed.STARMAPThe map in SPAZ 2 is... tiny compared to SPAZ 1. You can discover the whole map in under 5 minutes. In SPAZ 1 i could play a game for about 20-30 hours and still have places i haven't visited yet.LEVELSThe leveling system in SPAZ 2 is easier to understand but alot worse then SPAZ 1. You can literally complete the game as soon as you hit level 30. In SPAZ 1 you had to become stronger and in the end game your ship was about level 65+ before you fought the last boss.STORYThe first time i played SPAZ 1 the story was a joy to play thru. The plot twist later in the game was great. Sadly the reused most of the story for SPAZ 2 and it gets boring the second time around.ZOMBIESZombies in SPAZ 2 is not that treating as they were in SPAZ 1. A standard battle in SPAZ 2 goes as following. The zombies have a weapon much like a nuke that they use that releases a cloud. If you stay in the cloud your shield gets rapidly depleted. When you have no shields your ship parts get infected. Post battle when you are in the starmap you hit a button to ""clean"" your ships for the cost of some goons. It's not a very good concept compared to....SPAZ 1, when you first meet the Zombies you diden't know what to suspect. If your ship was infected they started to take over your crew, wait long enough and they take controll of your ship. You had two options, either self destruct so they could not get your hands on your ship, or open the airlocks!And let me tell you, Opening the airlocks and VENTING the whole CREW was one of the best and funniest thing you could do in SPAZ 1. Sadly SPAZ 2 comes nothing close to this.SHIPSSPAZ 1 ships return as strike craft, They can be seen as fodder, you can repair them after each battle and they come in sizes from small to medium hulls. Your mothership is the only ship that really mathers but more on that later. The bigger ships are nowhere to be found instead you get ""parts"" of the bigger ships to use as parts for your mothership.Long gone are the days where you had a fleet, and you put effort to create your fleet, every ship mathers to you and you diden't want to lose any of them. If you lost a ship it would rebuild itself for a REZ cost. If someone destroyed your fleet? Well then you had to return to an asteroid field with lower tier ships and harvest the REZ and lick your wounds until you could rebuild your fleet.SHIP BUILDINGIs boring as ♥♥♥♥, i love building stuff. Thats why i play games like Terratech and Kerbal Space Program and such. But the ship builder for your mothership is just boring. You get your cores, early on you start with like 2-3 cores, later you can have about 16-18 cores (not to sure about that number), think of it as a grid where a core takes up 1x1. Then you have your noses and engines, they come in 3 diffrent sizes needing 1 to 3 connections spots. Then you have your wings, same there 3 sizes with either 1 to 3 connection spots.In the end all ships looks almost the same, you either build your brick consisting of 3x5 blocks or 2x7 blocks of core, making your ship look like a flying brick. Or you build it like a triangle or something, you can't really go crazy with it.And as i said before the ship parts are mostly parts from SPAZ 1 larger ships, such as a wing that looks like a piece of the CRAWLER or the SUNSPOT or such.VERDICTAs i said all in all it's a good game, if you diden't compare it to SPAZ 1 then it might even be a great game. But for a SPAZ 1 fan like me, sadly no.Like many others when i heared about SPAZ 2 i was building up this dream in my mind about a game much like SPAZ 1. Then i heared it was gonna be in 3D and thought well... okay i guess they can still make it look good and work much in the same way as SPAZ 1.But as the developers said. SPAZ 2 is not a direct sequel to SPAZ 1. It's a new game with ne mechanics set in the same universe.It's a good game i and many like myself diden't ask for... all we ever wanted was more of what made SPAZ 1 great. And add multiplayer to that instead.Well we got this, and i will play this some more until i completed the whole story arch, but i won't return to it after that. I'f i want to play a great space game i'll rather play SPAZ 1 instead.			"

								I have no idea how a game can elicit such a feeling of longwinded, tedious frustration after under 20 minutes play and the accomplishment of not much.  Such a shame after SPAZ1, which was fantastic.  I really can only see this as the classic pitfall of over-developing the basic gameplay loop for way (waaaaayyyy) too long before actually getting feedback on it from players.  Seriously.  In the space of 20 minutes I think I had about 4 distinct frustrated, uncomprehending sighs at how obtuse, floaty, and wearisome a thing this is.			"

								I enjoyed the humor and modular mayhem of this game. The metagame is rich and dense packed, so there's no shortage of content to explore and exploit. For such a small team, this project feels like something far more polished and playful than I'd expect. Would definitely recommend for fans of light hearted space exploration, resourcing, and combat type games. Though there is a dash of 4X from the highest level map view, I dig how personal the player's connection is to the ship they're tuning, upgrading, and enhancing over time.			"

								I definitely enjoyed this game and recommend it anyone who enjoyed the first SPAZ, especially considering it is only twenty dollars. But of course, being early access there are some big issues that could use rectifying.PROS1) The new camera view works really well and adds to immersion.2) The sandbox mode has a lot of customization which adds to re-playability.3) Personally I find the visuals very pleasing.4) The Arena fights give a lot of hands on combat training of the various systems without text heavy tutorials (though some more information would probably be helpful for those who never played the original).5) The ship building has a ton of customization to suit your combat play-style.CONSIt isn't as much better than the original SPAZ as I had hoped.  Luckily the creators are awesome, and will hopefully fix at least some of the following issues...1) Ship BuildingA scarcity of the best ship components makes it so you can go through a whole playthrough without ever being able to make the ship you want. A return of the blueprint system in order to make at least the base version of parts (such as the mass driver) would go a long way to making ship customization more satisfactory. Also, the base building blocks of the ship  (the cores) never get a size upgrade. This limits how much you can customize the shape of your ship, with only a few basic designs being efficient enough to bother with.And finally, the mechanic by which you build your ships is cumbersome, with no ability to save multiple iterations, and no ability to easily swap parts of different size classes when they are positioned inside the ship (missile bays surrounded by core pieces).2) The 200 CaptainsEnemy captains appear to have no fear. If you build a base in a quadrant, captains who do not like you will come in and attack your transports and allies and steal your resources. This I expected. However, I did not expect that when your threat level out classes them by a large margin and you have destroyed their ship multiple times, they will keeping coming back for more. I found myself in a loop multiple times where I would destroy an enemy captains ship, then while harvesting the wreckage another captain would show up and attack. Then when I defeated and harvested that captains wreckage the first captain would show back up and attack. I would destroy him and harvest and the cycle would continue. Having the option to set an execution warrant within your own territory, making the escape pods of captains defeated within your quadrants targetable for destruction, would solve this problem in a most satisfying way. Having these captains die permanently and either never be replaced, or be replaced by new level one captains would add greatly to the gameplay, especially in sandbox mode.The captain AI has almost no fear of the zombie outbreak. I often see transport ships and low threat level captains brazenly try to cross zombie territory unescorted. Factions with territory near the outbreak don't make any attempts at securing alliances with other neighboring factions. This does not lend itself to the atmosphere of a galaxy besieged by a deadly advanced zombie plague.3) Galactic TravelIn multiple playthroughs there were several quadrants that I never explored. Not because I didn't want to, but because of the prohibitive amount of game time and rez that it takes to move your ship from one side of the galaxy to the other. A personal gate system usable only by your ship which granted say... two gates at level twenty and an additional gate at every ten levels after that, would allow some much needed ease of travel. It is hard enough finding the parts you want in neighboring factions. Far away faction's parts are often a lost cause.In the end game there does not seem to be any balance of goons and excess parts which allows for low rez high speed travel. I know the ship is much heavier by then, but still, finally building a super ship and not being able to afford flying it anywhere, is not cool.4) Wars Between FactionsWar. War, never changes. Seriously. They are all the same. A text box pops up on screen notifying a player of a faction war, some ships fight, some raids are placed, some territory is lost. Then it ends. Over and over. The wars ought to be epic in scale, with battles between an unlimited number of ships, huge amounts of rez expended, vast swaths of territory lost, and a clear victor. Or maybe two losers if they expend enough resources.There are no advanced war mechanics, which would make declaring war a worthwhile and fun activity. Such as setting up stationary or semi-stationary weapon platforms along territories and surrounding bases. The ability to select multiple faction captains to join in large scale strategic raids against these weapon platforms and bases. The ability to force surrender from quadrants in order to cheaply expand territory. The ability to subjugate or destroy captured captains of opposing factions.5) MiscellaneousLooting the wreckage of ships shouldn't take the same amount of game time as the entire space battle that created that wreckage.The player has nearly no control over the actions and policies of captains they give quadrants to.There are no missions outside the main campaign, and hardly any in the campaign. Even just some awesome pirate bounty quests would go a long way.WHAT ABOUT THE MERCENARIES?!? At least lest us hire unaligned captains for wars or something.And perhaps about +9000 on the RPG elements. That's all. Just over 9000.			"

								(english is not my primary language, so i apologize in advance)Well, this is what happens when you take innovation too far. I just finished the campaign and in comparison SPAZ I was an epic game, this one sadly is not what i expected, it did the first couple of hours, but after that, i knew it will be a ""rinse and repeat"" kinda campaign. As a game developer myself one thing that i learned, is that when try to innovate you take 1/3 of what worked in your previous games and keep it for the next ones (Spaz1 progression, ore mining, missions, etc), 1/3 of the actual ""next gen"" feel and 1/3 of your wild innovation you envisioned, and then make the game. Of course if you don't stick to the plan a lot of things go sideways. I will be sincere, i was expecting this game for 3 years, and got a monumental dissapoinment, but i will still recommend it to my friends, because i love the franchise. I hope in the coming updates there will be a reason for me to play it again. Keep the good work fellow devs =)			"

								I bought this game hoping to tide me over until the next Starsector update, didn't play much so I'll make this quick.Ship controls are glacial but it feels like this wants to be an arcade game.The whole scavenged ship aesthetic only serves to make it impossible to ""eyeball"" the relative power between ships.Two camera angles, both of which have more drawbacks than upsides. Top Down makes everything tiny to the point where combat boils down to multicolored circles dukeing it out, 3rd person just makes it impossible to do know what's going on behind you.The mechanics just aren't straightforward and the early game doesn't do much to give practice with them. There seems to be some kind of energy/power meter system in place, but it's hard to get some practice when shields drain 3 seconds into the first combat.			"

								I have never played SPAZ1, but i dont get why people are complaining about it not being like the original. Isnt a sequel supposed to be refreshing and better? Its only in early access yet it feels like an almost complete game. It needs some work like ship customization is pretty weird and annoying because if you want to change something in the middle of your ship you have to take all exterior pieces off one by one just to reach the center piece. it functions great, but just needs a good amount of polishing ot make some of the lame/annoying things better.

								I was a huge fan of the 1st SPAZ, loved it, and still do. I was super excited to see there was a 2nd coming out. Until I played the game. The fun of the 1st game was that you started out with nothing and had to build your way up to be able to fly around where ever you wanted. This new game just allows you to go where ever and does not seem to have the essance of the 1st game.  Maybe I was just expecting a more cleaned up version of the 1st game, but this just feels disapointing.  I will keep playing it, maybe i am missing something. If needed I will change my review if I can find more positives, but for now, Im sorry just going to be a negative.			"

								It's S.P.A.Z. Jim but not as we know it, not as we know it!If you're a purist you should turn around and continue to play, the still fantastic original.S.P.A.Z. 2 however is an amazing triumph, it has achieved things that big games should have but fell short of and is probably one of the few games in years worth it's asking price which is just mind boggling in itself.However it is an evolution of the original and not an upgraded clone, those that played the original a lot will recognise and appreciate a lot of the mechanics and nuances and atmosphere but it's all, different and in my opinion better. It has had some teething problems but they are trivial things, like one option being default over another and it has continuing support, updates and love from it's developers. So much so it received not 1 but 5 updates during my first several hours playtime and they were not just bugfixes or hotpatches but suggested improvements from it's community.Things that confound and infuriate you had been fixed while I was playing, probably just because while they made it, it simply hadn't been thought of but once suggested it made utmost sense and went straight into game.It looks wonderful, it has more factions, more depth, more parts and deserves to be played. A lot of people have complained of grind which I didn't experience but that is also being tweeked and worked on, probably even now, showing how committed the developers are to their game.			"

								Game came out 5 days ago and I have already sunk in 34 hours.I would consider that a pretty good game - Early Access or not.  I look forward to the further development!What I like:- Learning how to optimize your shipship using the modular building block system; want to go faster, bigger/more engines; want to be able to turn better, better wing modules. - Space combat is fun.  I like swapping out the different weapon types to see how they all work.  (The arenas that each station has allows you to test drive differently configured ships.)- Using bounties to motivate the other independant captains to do your work for you.  Want a base destroyed - bounties.  Want a base built - bounties.  You can be on the far edge of the galaxy, while having your empire expanding on the other side too.- Running a faction / space station actually provides profit, allowing you to grow yourself / your empire.- Pirate space looting! Combat with bigger targets is profitable.What I don't like (this might change as development continues):- Needs motivation to go and fight with others.  Right now it seems you are flying through space, until you mug a random space vessel for no reason.- Combat is capped at 4 motherships/space station.- End of game didn't feel like you had an amarda flying with you into an epic show down.  Instead, it was just you going into to fight another space battle.  (The battle turned out to be actually pretty neat.)- Not enough randomness in how the galaxy ticks.  Would be cool to see:- Improvement to feeling like you have a giant powerhouse behind you at the end of the story game- Quick Victory button for situations where you massively outgun the opposition- Modability- More things to do to develope your faction- Improvement to the WHY you are going around declairing war upon different factions, killing them over and over, stealing all their stuff, and destroying their entire space empire.  This is especially true when you have just finished the story campaign - you and all your allies have worked together to stop the zombie outbreak, but now what? Now, you go and kill them all to get their stuff.  Congrats on being a♥♥♥♥♥♥/ the bad guy.			"

								This game is early access.  I cannot blame anyone for being skeptical of these titles, sometimes they're finished, sometimes they're not.  This title is not finished.  There are many quality of life improvements and ways to break the eventual monotony of the game yet to be implemented.  Completion was estimated to happen between 6 and 12 months from now. That said, the original Spaz was a very enjoyable game, and development did not stop when it was released.Is this game as complete as the SPAZ and its expansion? No. Were the changes in design justifiable and/or good? Absolutely.These games are created by a small team of dedicated geniuses, and are truly labors of love.  The community engagement and work demonstrated by this team is staggering.  This was a part of my decision to buy and support.  A lot of this community has been following the dev log on this for 3 years. This is as unusual as the feedback and consideration and involvement on part of the devs that allows for it.  While this is ultimately their product, in many ways it feels like a product of the fans.I in no way regret my purchase, if you want to witness its development and be a part of the conversation, I recommend it. Is there fun to be had in its current state? Absolutely. Does the game have problems? Absolutely. If you want a complete title, give it some time, but do not take it off your wishlist.  Devs like these are the types of people who deserve great attention on part of the consumer and the industry as a whole and I'm proud to be a part of this.			"

								I will say right now that I played the first SPAZ game, though it has been a long time and my opinions on that game are a little stale. so hopefully I won't be biased in this reviewThe game presents a sizable map to you when you begin. You are just a single particle of water in the flow of an enormous lake. As the game progresses, you start to make a name for yourself, slowly gaining strength and getting better and better equipment (thanks to those bandits which you decided to farm). Soon, you start to look at... bigger prey. As a result, you start munching on the little ships. one day, you decide, unintentionally, to♥♥♥♥♥♥off the entirety of a faction which will hunt you down. Luckily, they have an enemy, so you stay by them and work under their protection. You start to build a bond with them, and eventually you become an active member in the group. Now you're cooking with gas. Left and right, you fight and win battles with allies by your side. you gain equipment, scrap, and levels like crazy. Eventually, it's time to start something new. With confidence, you say goodbye to your faction, making your own faction in a place that you meaned to occupy for a long time. immediatly, people join your cause, and you make allies from your protector and enemies with your nemesis. More things can happen than you can normally see, but you enjoy it. Suddenly, you're one of the most powerful in the galaxy. you can even win fights of two against you. You can destroy entire factions if they get in your way, and give endless scrap to anyone you care for. This all began, with a lone, junk ship, and a vigilent heart.9/10. would do that all over again.			"

My steam account was even created just to get this game when it is released.There is a bit of disappointment for now but I think just because this game has different style then previous. The rest is great. Gameplay is fun. Replayability is infinite.I would not put an x of 10 points score here because it is in early access now. I would just say that you need to get this if you liked SPAZ.For me this game now lacks only technology research ability for your faction, huge (I mean really huge, devastating, BADABUM) weapons that were on motherships in SPAZ 1... and that is all. The rest is SPAZ!I would probably keep both game and will play both SPAZ 1 and SPAZ 2 because those are so different and still are SO MUCH FUN!			"

								I am a fan of SPAZ 1 and looked forward to this game, SPAZ 2. First - I didn't like it. I know, this is early acces, but still. That is why:First game was much, much LARGER, it had systems, with tons of planets there. Now we have (in a campain mode) a rather small galaxy with stations-which-feel-like-planets-now and rather shady storyline. Needless to say - the storyline in first game was rather interesting and it was a universe of its own. Second game feels like I am ""cleaning up"" for the mess. Hardly anytthing more then this. It doesnt feel as good as it should technically be as for the second game. Characters - I dont like huge character icons on dialogs. SPAZ 1 way was alot better. No need for them to take whole screen. But that is cosmetical.What I didnt like is the ship customisation system. I liked the idea of core-modules which determine how  big you ships is. But, the way how components are presented - I didnt like. Plus,  Why engine module is merged with weapons? I may want it or not, I dont want that decided. I d like boosting modules, And technological way of progressing was much better in spaz 1. It forced to develop and it forced to choose which way you want to go - cannons, boms, drones, whatever.  This game simply has market, where you buy. And you buy some weird stuff there, wings mixed with different weapons - may sound cool but it is not. I d like normal frame items + weapons SEPARATELY. Plus there is no such thing, as mining asteroids and stuff. It was a very cool feature. It became nothing. No trade system or I didnt otice it. I want that ridiculous ship building gone.  I want either original SPAZ scheme, I choose ship - then I put stuff on it, or I go to the shop, buy and build frame and put weapons on it. Max weapons\modules - determined by tech level. Each module to have maybe CPU weight - so the ship has some limits to weapons and modules related to max CPU processing power (seen tthat somewhere). I want normal economy. Trading items, like food and water. To conclude, SPAZ2 feels like a prequel to SPAZ1. SPAZ 1 is definetely a better game overal To developers - your wish to turn game to 3D, killed what made the original game an AAA title. you are trying to make something very ""other game"" and I am not happy with this. I wished for SPAZ 1.5, not something totally else.			"

You spend very little time doing anything besides staring at the tactical map and watching the ship icons fly around while out on one of three types of arrands (all of which amount to click here on map, click harvest, move on to next node, click harvest, etc, etc).The ship to ship combat looks very pretty and is mostly fun to play at first, though it tends to be slow paced and has numerous annoying mechanics built in.  The reloading mechanic in particular is irritating to the point of frustration.  And it makes no sense at all in ship-based combat.  Even the ingame tutorial basically says ""dont question why it works this way, just roll with it.""  Having to stop in the middle of combat and spend 15s reloading the laser beam weapons on your giant capital ship?  Seriously?The ship customization aspect is interesting though your creative options are strictly limited not by available modules so much as by arbitrary level restraints to keep the player from getting to powerful too fast.There is little depth to the tech research aspect of the game.  It pretty much amounts to:  level up, spend talent point on one of 4 possible perks to modify stats/performance of your ship.  Shield recharge, engine boost, etc.As was aluded to in the first paragraph, the resource gathering aspect of the game is shallow (even more so than in the first game).  Most actions in the game award one of three resource types.  ""Mining"" consists of flying to a node on the tac-map and telling your ship to harvest everything.  Which takes about 4-5 seconds and may or may not result in you getting jumped by the lightning fast blitzkreig ambush of some NPC that was half the galaxy away when you started the harvest cycle.  It is the same with the Rez and Data point collection nodes.  Though the resources can also be collected from combat.  You can fly to special types of mining nodes and shoot them with your capital ship weapons to possibly spawns resources.  But this is hilariously inefficient and only seems to have been added as an afterthought.			"

								A well evolved sequel. Clearly early access but gameplay is solid. Obvious work needed seems to be rather minor... Voice acting, bug hunting, balancing come to mind. If you liked the original, this game gives you a new experience while remaining true to the source.edit1: changed gameply to gameplay.			"

All in all the game is fun but needs some polish prior to final release; worth playing though i thought; good fun.			"

								Lovely little game. I like games where the world does not revolve around the player,and this is one of them. The factions will still go about their business even if you are not around. If you are nice to other captains, they'll be nice to you. If you are nasty to them, they'll be nasty to you. Pretty well though out game, and tons of fun. I finished the campaign already (took me 19 hours), and I can't wait to start a sandbox game now :)Also, devs are pretty active and have been really quick to patch and fix things. But even in this state, the game plays like a dream in early access, and has plenty of features already. Can't really go wrong with this one.			"

								I wouldnt normally sink cash into an early access game unless it looked 100% promising, not only did SPAZ 2 look awsome from the trailers but it also had the backup of the first game to reinforce my belief that the dev's know what they are doing. While its safe to say I would have bought this game regardless of being early access or not I will still use my 2 highest factors to state if a game is worth the purchase.Playability - Almost perfect, no noticable bugs and only one crash in about 20 hours gameplay. It needs a little bit of fine tuning here and there but that will only serve to make it even more enjoyable. Time spent playing - this took me about 20 hours to complete (i did some considerable grinding before finishing the last mission) It didnt get boring at all and I finished it feeling like it still had some undiscovered bits to offer which I will no doubt go back to later on once its had a few significant patchs or gets to full release. Take into consideration that some AAA titles can be done in 10-14 hours at a stretch and seem like a drag towards the end then SPAZ 2 for 14 quid is worth every penny.			"

								Can't believe I just stumbled upon SPAZ for the first time and then find that number 2 is coming out soon!!! I grabbed this game up on day one of course. The game has changed in feel from the first but what I really love is the overall humour in both of the games. The second game lacks a bit in length and possibly content but the developers are hard at work in bringing new and exciting content they tell us. The developers really are some of the best I have seen in gaming. They communicate often and show that they really care about the player base. That deserves my money in and of itself. Overall this game is definitely worth buying with solid space combat that is unique to anything I've played and developers who are just aces.			"

								I did enjoy this game, but it is still very buggy.  This is probably a result of the complexity of the countless AI pilots.  The game does allow a player to choose very unconventional strategies, but if you go off the path the programers anticipated the bugs start to compound into something game breaking.  For example, an enemy faction placed a large bounty on my base.  A very strong AI pilot then attacked my base to claim the bounty.  Rather than fight him, I invited the NPC to join my faction and set him as the owner of the base he was attacking.  After the battle I got a message that I had declared war on myself.  Thus I was no longer welcome to repair and such at my own bases and my faction members were hostile to me.  The game seemed to get progressively weirder after that point.  The designers need to find a way to allow the game to not be broken by a player using perfectly valid though unanticipated solutions.			"

								At the moment its not finished, in its unfinished state I have had only one crash.  As before with SPAZ 1 the team did continue to add to the game when complete so hopefully the same happens!The gameplay is nice and easy, so you pew pew things out of the sky (Unless you cheat and use the auto shoot functions).Love the visuals.Its on a 2d like plane and I usually like playing as the smaller ships in battle.I havent actually won yet (Keep getting blown up by AI that I keep annoying).I can't get the hang of reattaching stuff to the mothership so usually end up going ARGH REATTACH and try to slap it back on (a bit like when Ren slaps Stimpy) and it won't reattach until the shield comes up (Which then goes off because something was reattached).  Saying that when managing to win a battle after having to rebuild parts of your ship and at a 1/4 health its intense (Lucky shots if I am honest).  I do wish the smaller ships could be modified.			"

								It's a good game. That being said the original spaz is better, but it's still easly access.What I would like to see:-In spaz there are missions such as protect the convoy, destroy these targets under so many minutes.there are no missions in spaz2. Would like to see something along those lines.-In spaz there were moments where you could end up fighing dozens of capital ships. In spaz2 there'sa four ship limit in each battle. They're called mother ships but they feel more like capital ships. Would like to see no ship limits. I mean the extra ships could always just warp in after a ship is destroyed.-In spaz it was satisfying to destroy a ship and collect the goons and force them to join your crew or get jettisonout the airlock. In spaz2 there is only an aftermath dialog box that asks if you want them. Disappointing.-Spaz2 has an active economy which is great, but I can never find the parts I want. All the ships I end upmaking are cobbled up piles of junk devoid of any style.-The A.I is sorry, I can kite higher level ships for days and there's nothing they can do. When a part of mine falls offI can always just snap it back on. Would like to see the A.I doing the same. I enjoy throwing the environment at them,like the smaller astriods and barrels. I thought it would be hilarious if the A.I would chuck a barrel at me in the samefashion.-The way Spaz2 is setup it seems possible to play as the alpha zombie. That would be amesome.-The level 103 zombie starting base is too weak. I often find it harder to take on a normal level 72 base.-The autosave is a cheat. There's no fear in ever losing a fight if I can just take it back after the fact. That's likeplaying monopoly and rolling a 3 and then saying, ""oh wait a I wanted a 6"" and then rolling again. I believe theplayer should be forced to respawn just like the A.I. No backsies!			"

Early Access Review
								I've been following the development of this game for several years, and now that it's in Early Access I have to say it's looking to be everything I hoped it would be.I'm about 10 hours in, and there's so much I want to do and try, I really think it's going to be highly replayable.  The scope of the game is huge, and there's so many ways to affect and interact with the universe.  In some ways I think it may be the ""living, breathing universe"" I was hoping for from Stellaris (also an excellent game, no dig intended).   It's not really similar, any more than it's similar to Space Rangers: HD, the only other game I can think of to compare it to, but it has elements that remind me of both games. Gameplay itself is rewarding and enjoyable, as well.There are some valid arguments that the early game is a bit slow and long, and the developer is already talking about plans to streamline that so you get to the big fun faster.  With so many ways to affect the universe the learning curve is a little steep, but they do a pretty good job of showing you the possibilities.  Learning how to best use all those tools is what takes time and effort.  UI is pretty decent in my opinion, and again they're already discussing ways to make it more intuitive.  I think some of that is just an artifact of the fact that there are so many things to do, which I'm highly in favor of.  I got tired of dumbed down 4 button games a long while back.Overall, for 4 years of development by a 2 man team, it's amazing.  It still needs some final polish, but I think they were in a good place to go Early Access while they still have some wiggle room to modify the UI and tweak balance, and they've been doing an amazing job of interacting with the players and discussing feedback.  The breadth and depth of the game are both just amazing.  If you enjoy having diverse macro scale options and deep tactical options, I think you'll really like this game in it's current state.  Frankly, I think they could have simply released it as is (other than certain things like placeholder voiceovers) and it would be considered an unrefined gem of it's own genre.  With what has been discussed so far in terms of plans for smoothing things out, and future support, I think it has the potential to be a true classic.			"

								Editing review as it's getting some updates, SPAZ 2 is still in EA and so, bugs and glitches are bound to happen.Still playing in sandbox mode to learn the ropes (mostly combat), will start a normal campaign game soon.The game starts some time after SPAZ 1 ends. Rez is rare to get and there are many factions (the 1st game had 2) fighting for the sparce resources.The UI is good, love the synth voices. The fps is a bit low (have 8G memory plus a 2G video card - changing PC soon)The ship controls are a bit slow in combat mode (. Have an X-Box controller and hope to make it work. Got smashed on first combats but now I started to get it right.You don't have a mothership anymore, but you can build bases (need lv 12 for that - and grinding xp is tough) and get sideships as loot/buying from other faction's bases.Ship customization is amazing - you can make it looks (more or less) like a Space: 1999 (amazing old series!) ship or a Star Wars Imperial Star Destroyer; that depends on where and how you put the cores and the outer parts (nose, engine, left and right wings)And zombies - they are back, of course.Changed my rating to 7/10 (for now) - You can buy it, the updates are coming fast and the bugs are being squashed as soon as discovered.

								The Good:You build a shipyou keep building and enhacing that ship throughout the game with new weapons and parts you either tear off of other captains or buy from a starbase.Yes, you ship CAN be ugly...its kind of expected in the beginning as you are a junker and you take whatever odd piece you can get to replace the junk thats holding on by a thread on your current ship...as you progress...you find the styles of weapons and armor pieces differ between factions and you can build a truly beautiful ship...at least that was my experience.  I myself used a ""triangle"" design vs a straight ""I"" design as i liked the way it looked and played.  Plenty of weapons, plenty of engines, good turning and good shields, couldnt ask for more.  Beat the game fairly easily once i got a good strategy down.  The BAD:Some things arent explained well.  Its early access and its to be expected.  For 2 developers to anticipate everything, well, thats a statistic improbability.  Still, once you understand what to do, its a cakewalk going forward.  Not to say there isnt a challenge, as there is and there are times the odds are heavily stacked against you in a no win scenario, but you just have to pick up the pieces and move on by either loading your last save and trying something different, or playing the hardcore style and ejecting your escape pod and continuing as a junk ship again working you way back up.  Its not spaz 1...its got that rebel galaxy feel to it, which is awesome.  Battles are a lot more fun and as your shields drop and enemies are pounding away on your battered ship, you actually worry about parts flying off, dramatically altering the flow of battle.  That goes both ways...an enemy ship giving you trouble? Maybe those saw blades are tearing up your ship?  Knock out his shields and concentrate all fire on that weapon...if you knock it off, and its still salvagable, you can keep it! ooooooOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRR if your good enough in the heat of battle...you can modify your ship and attach it to yours...finishing the enemy with his own weapon!!!  Not just that though, say an enemy knocks a weapon off you, you can use your grapple beam to reattach it, assuming again it wasnt destroyed in the process!!  That...and you can use that grapple beam to whip things at your enemies...like say a rock...or a sign...or an explosive barrel!The beginning of the game is a little slow, and they are working on that...once you get a half decent ship and some decent weapons...no power in the verse can stop you!

								I find it quite funny that people are degrading a game within the first hour or two of gameplay. Though within that time you are basically playing the entire thing. However the excuses I see for their ""No"" vote is completely stupid. Such as ""They havn't said anything about the future."" Unlike most games they actually released a good version for their release and one that I personally don't feel needs additions. Now there are also people who have 56 hours when the game has not been released within the last 24 hours, but maybe they were testers.This is a stratagy game, and there are a lot of things I still don't know about it, learning things here and there. Now the game itself is different from the initial game, by a huge margine. The game is still awesome but don't expect this to be a carbon copy of Spaz. What I would say is if you enjoyed spaz, and don't know if you want to try something different then what it was, maybe watch it on twitch... or use the steam refund if you really don't enjoy it. I found it pretty addicting.Now something people should know ahead of time is that multiplayer is not currently avaliable. I have not seen any information as to why, but the single player was what we had on Spaz, and we all loved it.So just get the game and enjoy playing it for the value it has. Not to mention that its not as expensive as a triple A title, like the garbage battlefront. This is 20 dollars for a really decent game that has the same kind of gameplay as mount and blade almost. Not as large scale, but you will see the similarities.To be honest I personally have not experianced any bug what so ever. The game has good graphics, runs smoothly, has lots of auto saves. I have only had one crash which was right after it saved, maybe because it saved it crashed. I am unsure.I really don't want to go into a lot of detail about what the game has to offer because I want people to experiance it and enjoy it without me saying anything. And honestly if you want to check it over before you buy it, then go on twitch or youtube and watch it, stop reading reviews and look to see if its something you want to play.Look forward to seeing you all in multiplayer. Try not to let the zombies bite.			"

								Wow, is this really an early access? Because it doesnt feel like one! So i was looking at what to play, interested in space game and then i look at spaz 2 and remember spaz was 2d and i dont like 2d space games but then i looked at the pictures and i saw it was 3d and also had a nice map, when i checked the review comments i saw that someone saying that it plays like Mount and Blade campaign mode and he was right!!! First you start with a small ship, the more you level the more you can expand that ship and put better weapons and better blocks with more health, armor and shields. Second thing is that there are other factions and that you can create your own, you can hire captains, assign starbase or a sector to a loyal captain and raid neighboring sectors, it does feel like in mount and blade but in space, note i thought map was randomized but its not, your starting position is and also in sandbox mode you choose how big  factions are so it changes their positions as well.The combat is so fun, you put whatever weapons you want, for an example,left side of ship vs shield, right side vs armor and front vs health or whatever combination you want, I am so glad i found this game, cannot believe it was release last week. Good job to the develops i like it a lot and i already played 2-3 days straight. The first time you start piloting your ship with w,a,s,d may feel clunky and bad because the ship doesnt turn where its nose looks but it turns where you, the camera looks at but besides that everything else is good, graphics are really nice, Although for the leveling part, in order to be able to create your own faction you have to be level 12, what i did was i went through the arenas of 10-15 starbases of other factions in order to level up to 12 instead of pirate hunting because they just dont give as that much of exp and are hard to find especially when everyone is chasing them.To mention to the readers that in the menu there is a greyed out multiplayer button meaning that devs will implement multiplayer in the future!!!If devs are reading this, good job, keep adding content and bug fixes, the main system feels good, although maybe give a possibility to choose different map sizes and have steam workshop plus randomized sector borders map!

								*Edited10/10Hulls were breached,Science was leaked out.Learning how to ""De-donkey"" anything is a win.<EDIT>Okay so, 24hs clocked, I felt an update on my review was required.Space Pirates and Zombies 2 is extremely different from the original SPAZ. As many others have said before, if you're looking for ""similar gameplay"" to SPAZ 1, you won't find it here. What you will find, however, is a sandbox version of a game that differs hugely from its predecessor. 3D glorious battles, an infinite amount of customisation, 200 living, breathing, angry AI captains that won't hesitate in destroying you because of your rides rim colours...SPAZ 2 delivers a fantastic tale of comedy, tragedy, and Moon Burgers....Okay, maybe there arn't any Moon Burgers for you specifically. Future update mayhap?Anyway. You've got ship parts aplenty, zombies running rampant and other miserable space-folk to command or conquor. You probably wouldn't be here if you haven't at least seen SPAZ 1; I am 100% certain you would regret not buying this game. The creators are a marvellous bunch of pirates (or zombies?) and they are definitely worth supporting. Don't take my word for it though. Buy this game and find out for yourself.</EDIT>			"

								A lot have been saying that this isn't SPAZ1.5. Can you remember a little game called Fallout and how Bethesda changed the view from Isometric top down to First Person? They too thought it wouldn't pay off but it did, in Spades. This is sort of like what's happened with SPAZ. Is it a change for the good? A resounding yes. Could I play SPAZ1 again after this? Maybe. I sunk 55 hours into the original game and have already clocked up 11 hours in this one.I have been having a blast with this game. The super grindy area lockdowns are gone and you have more freedom to do almost anything you want.The view is great. I don't even use the top down view any more as the 3D behind the ship view is good for me. The controls can get a little confusing at times but that's a minor nitpick. The game looks great (my ship looks like a floating piece of junk though).This game deserves more than 2 hours worth of play and it deserves your hard-earned.			"

								Right from the beginning you can tell this game has been meticulously thought out. The beginning tutorial as an arcade game was just the first brilliant little nugget this game has to offer.There is an incredible level of detail in all aspects of the game, in flight, even in story mode transitions. I cannot wait for the real voice actors though, the computer voices are getting to me a bit.The collaborative fights add a fun tactical element to the game. Too weak to fight someone alone? Wait until they're being persued by a stronger captain and join forces.You start from scrap, literally, just getting one new part makes you feel a sense of pride.I didn't know exactly what to expect but I'm glad the developers went in the direction they did, sure it takes a while to learn the new ways to fight, but thats what the initial tutorials are for. I'm loving this game and can't wait to see what other ships / parts are out there!			"

								If you are a fan off a open world Space ship fighter similair with a mix of Star Trek Starfleet Command you will enjoy this.Gameplay:Take your main ship, upgrade it, fight enemies to get parts, buy parts from starbases, make allies and join factions.Follow the main story when ready to be given the additional wrinkle of zombies and zombie force with extreme agro.Game goes into battle of attritution with a addition of zombies who will begin to take over the universe. Get ready for the battle of your life.. Save progress often... There has not been a 2d plane 3d design game of this magnitude in over a decade. Glad someone has finally captured the feel of the PC classics while adding more depth and story then games of this type in the past.Takes roughly 12-20 hours to beat depending if you hold off on starting the zombie onslaught. I found myself taking out a whole faction with an ally before venturing back to the main quest line and zombie apocalypse.For a ""Early access"", the game is pretty much complete. Sadly, no multiplayer yet and voice acting of the characters is simply synthesize type to speech. Developer does have note when first starting that full voice acting will be added. Definitely a plus since the conversations are hilarious.Worth every $ the 2 main developer minimax is asking.Now here comes the fun part... Below is a list of features I feel are needed to really make this game something people would play for several years. Radioactive Meat Please Game should have more reasons to be in your ship and less playing around in the starmap.   AI needs to actually use strength and weaknesses in battle or be handed special builds that match the captains taste. Battles tend to always end up with victorian era broadship swayfest with some missiles for extra touch. Why do we not have nimble ships capable of speed attacks or have a number count kinda low but if not careful could destroy you due to a exotic custom style builds? Also, AI seems pretty dumb to not try to avoid the Trireme ship ramming that pretty much decimates its ship in one hit.  Game should promote your faction members harvesting or paying a tax etc. This would help eliminate some of that boring map work and give a real reason to get a good faction going.   Need more ships in the battle mode with faction member ships supportinge epic battles. The 4 ship maximum really makes things boring once you get a decent ship. If the game has a limit then definitely need spawnable motherships to help the battle continue. Taking a sector of the starmap should trigger a king of the hill mode where motherships spawn in the stop your starbase from being built. Maybe your job is to defend the starbase for  X amount of time? Couple  defense with some of the items mentioned above, I feel this would definitely add some depth to timing and placement of your starbase. If the fog of war is cleared, a warning should appear informing you a AI is attempting to build a starbase where you can go try to attack his facility. Should be able to get a wingmen without a ""starbase"". This may already exist but really not sure.  The Raid function needs serious re-vamp. I personally would like a way to ""raid"" where its a wave mode with increasing diffcult warp ins. Each wave would give you a reward and you could sneak some epic mothership build parts for lasting several rounds.Also, this could be incorporated into a multiplayer function with rewards in the future. I feel the supplimental  ships you can buy do absolutely nothing outside of adding cannon fodder against enemies. Where are ships that can heal your mothership, maybe act as a small carrier for the micro fighters, or have some AI instincts to try to avoid the major enemy blasters?   Need a timer down survival mode somewhere in the game. This could promote members to build different type of ship builds for a given situation. I feel  all the ship variety of parts in game does not mean much if I have no real need to try to build special builds to take on special task. Another function that could be added to multiplayer with some rewards.  "

								I was a huge fan of the first game, and was on board for a direct sequel. Instead, the developers have taken the ideas of the first game and expanded them dramatically. This made for something of a learning curve, as the game is substantially different than I had initially expected, however it is an excellent game and highly enjoyable. Just make sure you look at gameplay to know what you're getting into.			"

								definitely recommend folks who liked SPAZ1 and Rebel Galaxy check this game out.  Even at the time i write this, which is during the early access beta stage, the game shows significant polish and is very enjoyable in both the campaign and sandbox mode.  Devs continue to add funtionality and refine things, and there is every reason to believe the game will just get better and better.Ship combat is very reminiscent of broadside battling from Rebel Galaxy (also highly recommended) and should be a quick study mechanically for most people.  The combat can be as deep and strategic as you want it to be through micromanaging and min/maxing or as simple as steer and let the AI attack for you.  NPC AI is a bit on the easy/dumb side, but hopefully that will be tweaked more as development progresses.  Visit the official forums for more specifics on mechanics and gameplay, if you have particular itches that you want a game to scratch, but I honestly think anyone who likes spaceship combat, particularly where you are at the controls, will  enjoy playing this game.  A warning for SPAZ1 players:  the game is now primarily a 3D 3rd person experience, although you can manually set the game to the top down perspective from SPAZ1.  There are gains and losses from this change.  Make sure to check twitch or youtube for gameplay videos if you think that change will be a big deal for you.  I do miss some of the charm of the top down, but in my book, the gains outweigh the losses.  If you have specific questions, please do not hesistate to ask :)			"

								I got this game hoping that it would live up to SPAZ(AB!) and i wasnt disappointed. Though some things are alittle different, the lack of the warp beacon style travle for a start, the game it's self stays true to the original from crazy ship designs to the whacky sence of humour. The fights are Epic! Who doesnt love an arsenal of ever varied weapons raining hell on everything around you. The visuals, Stunning! I was dubious aabout 3D in SPAZ but being able to get up close and personal, target modules and RAM them off... well it just makes me feel like dA OrkZ r ERE BoYZ! Only thing missing is shouts for WAAGGGHHH! heh.The Starmap is fairly intuitive and the finer points aare picked up fast enough.Only one thing that bothered me and thats when in top down view, wasd is orientated to the screen, not the direction the ship itself is facing. Makes piloting alittle cumbersom.Whether new to SPAZ or an old timer, i would recommend this game!			"

								What a start for an early access title! Especially for a 2-man dev like Minmax.While on the outside the game looks fast, flashy and colorful, there is so much more ""under the hood"". The background sim with the 200 captains, the factions, relations, economy, its all well thought out.Building your own ship is interesting and offers a lot of different play styles. From longrange missileboat, carrier or closecombat laser/cannon boats, everything is possible.The combat is tactical, can become really hard when you picked the wrong enemies. Disabling shields, punch through the armor and dismantling the enemy ship part by part is great fun.I won't spoil the campaign, the texts are hilarious/fun to read, the computer voices make me giggle, the boss fights are great (especially the final one).I'm looking forward on how SPAZ 2 evolves. I am really hoping for a coop multiplayer mode (once you figure out a mechanism for the ""time"" in map mode that works for multiple players).			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: Imagine the difference between castlevania and castlevania 64 Otherwise, here's my essay on why this game aint that great for a whole bunch of small reasons, and a few really big ones. | Pros over the original game: |+ Very VERY pretty backgrounds.+ Pretty okay story, a little better than the old one. I'm at the point where all of the mechanics have been introduced.+ It's a nice touch that the ""strike craft"" are just the standard ships from the original game.+ You can shoot bits off of other ships, then smack them in the face with the smouldering remains of what was their main engine. This gives no end of entertainment. | Things I feel neutral about: |~ You have to smack yourself in the face with powerups, if you don't feel like wasting energy mid fight. This amuses me.| Cons in relation to the original game: |- The movement system is beyond clunky, holy hell, it gets to the point where sometimes, for no reason, you just lose the ability to move forward mid combat, despite still having your engine and not sustaining serious damage- The building system for the mothership is clunky and frustrating, in no way even a pale shadow of the original's modification system. Want to remove a part from the middle of your ship? Tough. You have to bend over and remove every part attached to it, sweetie. Want to remove a part at all? Better hope the physics don't glitch out and just leave the part where it is so it snaps right back on. Want a specific part? Well, I'd like world peace, but we don't always get what we want. You get to just beg and hope that you get the part you need from the grace of RNGesus. While this does afford a certain sense of jury rigging, which fits the story, it really isn't as fun as getting what you need. - Faction relations. Want to ally with a faction so you can focus on the things that matter, such as anything other than senseless bickering and violence? Tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ cupcake, you get to feed endless thousands of credits and countless good deeds into the maw of an unfeeling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI. Some AI captains will just hate you, and this would be okay. Hell, it makes perfect sense given the story. If you could actually permanently kill a captain. There's no sense of permanence. - You can't actually kill any other captain. The only tangible effect you can have is possibly maneuver them to kill themselves with a zombie-captain, which will infect them, and now you have a totally different problem. It wouldn't even be a problem that you can't kill a captain if they had to restart from scratch, but no, they get their ship right back from warranty or some nonsense. Your options, on the other hand, for getting killed is; 1: Save Scum, or 2: Throw away literally hours of progress in the interest of not save scumming. - Ganking from mean AI captains. Some captains don't like you. Some captains will chase you down across the galaxy with ships an order of magnitude more powerful components, repeatedly attempting to fight you. This would be fine, right? Nope, the game gives other captains who don't like you the opportunity to join in on the fun. Up to three. Your only option is to savescum, which can lead you into the unfortunate situation where your only recent saves leave you mere light years from the angry captains. I got out of three such situations by running really hard and scraping them off on bandits. - Totally useless ""strike craft,"" which are differentiated from ""fighters"" by being slower, easier to hit, and only marginally better weaponry. Once your strike craft are gone, it seems that you can pull in reinforcements, but it doesn't seem very clear how many exactly. I find myself very often without a single strike craft to help out, while the AI stations that you can attack seem to have the ability to respawn them at will. - Runs really poorly when bigger battles really get going with horrendous orgies of particle effects. I've dropped down to well below 30 fps, despite the game not using more than half of the graphics card and CPU. Not sure if this has to do with Unity (the engine the game is made in) or the dev, but speaking as an amateur developer using Unity myself, this doesn't seem acceptable. I really, REALLY wanted to like this game. The dev tried their level best to innovate from the original game. But sadly, sometimes the wheel is round for a reason, and sometimes physically simulated EVERYTHING isn't done in most games for a reason. "

								This game is full featured and complete even in its early access state.  The game could use some tweaks to the tutorial and level progression, but core mechanics are fun and engaging.The underlying economy (200 independent captains and factions) is impressive and creates interesting and emergent gameplay as NPCs and the player interact and build toward the ultimate conclusion.The game would benefit from a manual, which is in work, since many of the icons and stats are poorly explained.  The implementation seems to be complete but sometimes the player is left a bit confused.The only frustrating part of this current build is how the game handles NPC captain death.  If the player dies, the game is over, but if any of the NPC captains die, they are resurrected.  This is not a problem for neutral captains or even \""normal\"" enemy captains, but this is particularly frustrating when dealing with zombie captains.  It is understandable to ensure a consistent 200 captains, however, when a zombie captain is defeated, they should be penalized in some way to reduce their threat level and potentially be placed on a timer before they can actively participate in the economy.  Without this change, I have found myself fighting the same zombies over and over again.			"

Early Access Review
								The mechanics of the game are everything I was hoping for, and as I understand it there are still great features to come. Here are my highlights.The awesome:The galaxy seems alive - It's neat to see all the other factions and captains doing their thing, although they sometimes mess up what you're trying to do.The lore - You can play the game without having played the first, but if you did you are in for plenty of cameos and easter-eggs. The meh (things that are both good and bad):Customization - You can build pretty much whatever shape and size ship you want, which is awesome! Heavily offset however by the fact that it feels like you are just throwing stuff together based on value, with no idea what it will actually do for you. The tutorial is rushed and the stats never feel intuitive.Combat - The battles manage to remain just interesting by the end to keep from being tedious. I’ve never seen the slingshot mechanics show in the videos be effective, and in later chapters you are just pulverizing the same stuff over and over and over and… The redeeming thing here is seeing what new weapons on you ship do, and eventually taking on fleets single-handed.The ugly:Holy grind Batman - I saw an update from the developers recently talking about how surprised they were that the players felt the game was a grind fest. I don’t know how that is the case… The game is fairly open as far as being “required” to do anything, but your only two real options in my opinion are to blow stuff up and get stronger, and play the storyline. Thin Skyrim, but if the developers only put in a single questline. Adding side quests or anything of meaning would help here!Storyline - *Spoilers to follow* There are a grand total of maybe 5 objectives. Learn to use your ship, blow something up that is most of the map from you, build a base somewhere, go back and blow more stuff up in the same place, then go blow your own base up because reasons (we can’t spoil everything here after all). Because the objectives are at set levels rather than adapting to your current ability, the first few are relatively easy and the last one takes several hours of grind to beat. Again without ruining everything, this made the last fight pretty since I had progressed so much to beat the base prior to the boss fight, that the last battle was a pushover. Overall I have to give the game a net positive, particularly since it is still in early access! There are some things I would love to see changed, such as having more to do and more adaptive quests/missions, but from what I’ve seen the developers are incredibly responsive and I fully expect the game to improve over time. I have yet to try the multiplayer features and will likely update my review after doing so, as that is another thing I am fairly excited for. Thanks for the experience MinMax!Edit for 0.3.0Well the Devs certainly know how to move fast and please their audience. Obtaining parts through the stores, comparing stats, and the process of building your ship have been massivly improved in only a few short weeks. I'm hopefull more will be added to the gameplay and that further achievments will be added in the near future, but I am seriously impressed with the development pace on this game.			"

								Finally a proper sequel to a game, other games wish they had a sequel this sequely.It isn't SPAZ1, and it doesn't try to be. It has all the good bits, and the bad bits got massaged quite a bit. Diplomacy actually matters now, and it is a broadside brawler moreso than a top down Escape Velocity-like. It is still possible to use the top down view, however. The story exists and, like SPAZ1, is hilarious enough to bother reading and paying attention to.Despite being early access at the moment, I definitely suggest getting it. There's very little left to be done, and the only other Early Access game that was released with this much polish and playability is Factorio.RETICULATING SPLEENS^ this is the line that made me fall in love <3			"

Early Access Review
								The mechanics of the game are everything I was hoping for, and as I understand it there are still great features to come. Here are my highlights.The awesome:The galaxy seems alive - It's neat to see all the other factions and captains doing their thing, although they sometimes mess up what you're trying to do.The lore - You can play the game without having played the first, but if you did you are in for plenty of cameos and easter-eggs. The meh (things that are both good and bad):Customization - You can build pretty much whatever shape and size ship you want, which is awesome! Heavily offset however by the fact that it feels like you are just throwing stuff together based on value, with no idea what it will actually do for you. The tutorial is rushed and the stats never feel intuitive.Combat - The battles manage to remain just interesting by the end to keep from being tedious. I’ve never seen the slingshot mechanics show in the videos be effective, and in later chapters you are just pulverizing the same stuff over and over and over and… The redeeming thing here is seeing what new weapons on you ship do, and eventually taking on fleets single-handed.The ugly:Holy grind Batman - I saw an update from the developers recently talking about how surprised they were that the players felt the game was a grind fest. I don’t know how that is the case… The game is fairly open as far as being “required” to do anything, but your only two real options in my opinion are to blow stuff up and get stronger, and play the storyline. Thin Skyrim, but if the developers only put in a single questline. Adding side quests or anything of meaning would help here!Storyline - *Spoilers to follow* There are a grand total of maybe 5 objectives. Learn to use your ship, blow something up that is most of the map from you, build a base somewhere, go back and blow more stuff up in the same place, then go blow your own base up because reasons (we can’t spoil everything here after all). Because the objectives are at set levels rather than adapting to your current ability, the first few are relatively easy and the last one takes several hours of grind to beat. Again without ruining everything, this made the last fight pretty since I had progressed so much to beat the base prior to the boss fight, that the last battle was a pushover. Overall I have to give the game a net positive, particularly since it is still in early access! There are some things I would love to see changed, such as having more to do and more adaptive quests/missions, but from what I’ve seen the developers are incredibly responsive and I fully expect the game to improve over time. I have yet to try the multiplayer features and will likely update my review after doing so, as that is another thing I am fairly excited for. Thanks for the experience MinMax!Edit for 0.3.0Well the Devs certainly know how to move fast and please their audience. Obtaining parts through the stores, comparing stats, and the process of building your ship have been massivly improved in only a few short weeks. I'm hopefull more will be added to the gameplay and that further achievments will be added in the near future, but I am seriously impressed with the development pace on this game.			"

Early Access Review
								SPAZ 2 is the good kind of sequel, it isn't just more of the same thing with a new price tag; it's an evolution of the same concept with new mechanics.Rather than managing a small squad of ships, you just fly the one big one.  This has the same kind of feel as Rebel Galaxy: it feels like sailing because everything in the 3D world moves about in the x-y plane.  If you've ever played any other space sandbox you'll know that 50% of your time was spent fling in small circles, which is mercifully absent in SPAZ 2.The other 50% of your time in other space sandboxes was probably spent in menus, trying to maximise you trading profit or just wondering where the sexy time you're meant to be going.  SPAZ 2 (also like Rebel Galaxy) almost uniquely has a plot and tells you where to go.  There are some menus to noodle about in but there's no trading for ores, food etc.  Just selling scavenged ship parts and buying new ones.  You can even directly swap components in the shop menu.  This leaves you spending most of yout time playing, rather than wrestling with the game.There's also a nice learning curve to be found.  Early in the game, while trying arena fights, I soon found out that if your shields go down, you're doomed.  I had to learn what the different weapons, both on my ship and the enemy are, and how best to exploit them.  You have to know what your ship is built for, be it rushing in, stipping shields and running away, or staying out of range of the enemy guns while you wear them down.These choises come into effect when you build your own ship.  You can choose build a long or short range ship, or you can have a mix of everything.  That said, you'll probably just fit whichever parts are of the highest quality and adapt to what you've got.  Your ship will also be L-shaped with one side which is designed to face the enemy, carrying all your big guns, the other side will carry your point defences, missiles and weapons for bringing down fighter craft.  Either through a patch or modding, I'd like to see some more variety here - components with angled connections so they have to go on corners or end pieces, with obvious bonuses to comensate for their awkwardness.  Perhaps the larger modules might require a double layer of attachments, i.e. you can't stick them onto a single row of cores, you need to double them up to be able to use the biggest, baddest guns.Speaking of components, you'll fit what's got the best stats out of what you can find.  There might the the perfect weapon for you but you'd never know without trundling around every station looking in the trade menu.  Perhapse, once you own a starbase, you might be able to go on Space-Amazon and order parts and specify the quality.  The trade off being you'll pay a premium to avoid having to go outside.  Just like in real life.  Perhapse an upgrade system might be implementable, using Rez, goons, scrap and duplicate items to upgrade the quality of your favourite componenets.After a while, once you've built your unstoppable death machine, all you need to do is angle your ship with the big guns towards the enemy and rain doom from afar.  If you've put a couple of big engines on, you'll never need to come within range of the (generally better balanced) enemy ships.  In the end-game I knew what was coming and that I can deal with it, there were no surprises left and I felt like I was just hoovering up zombies, who multiply faster than I can kill them.  Maybe with some more variaty from the enemies, this would change.  Interceptor capital ships would have given me a very hard time, as I had only a few small guns, poorly positioned for broad siding.  This would also feel more piratey and force me to compromise my ship design, leaving me to wonder what I'll come up against next, and how will I deal with it, now that me ship is no longer optimised for a specific task.I don't know if the game engine can handle it but it would be nice to have more than four capital ships per fight.  Perhaps (if it's possible) the fights might be limited to a number of cores, allowing a mob of small ships to harass you, or one super ship to stomp on you.I had fun with SPAZ 2, and I'll have more fun again when it comes out of early access.  Then more again when people start modding it.			"

Early Access Review
								In the first game, people complained about how grindy it was to harvest asteroids. Now, people complain that they removed the asteroid grind.Combat is  like a sci-fi naval battle. Ships turn and wheel ponderously, firing broadsides, chunks flying off, and when they finally explode, they sink. You then circle their corpse and pluck out any salvagable parts, adding them to your own frankenstein ship.You'll start to remember AI captains by name and form a history with them. I hated Dr Maneater after he extorted me for cargo several times, but after I saw him being ganged up on by a rival faction, I came to his rescue. Shortly afterwards, after we plucked the carcasses clean, the enemy faction came after me for revenge. None other than Dr Maneater rushed to defend me, and later in the game he became my permanent wingman. Things like this emerge from the star map organically.Drawbacks include a steep learning curve and of course, departure from the first game. Nostalgia burns hot with some of these reviewers, but I'm ready to see where this game goes			"

								Didn't have a positive impression within the first 15 minutes or so of playing, but once I discovered the non-relative controls (the new default) it was a lot better.  I personally prefer to play in the overhead POV during battles, makes it feel more like the first SPAZ.  (wish there was an option to set that as default so I didn't have to switch every battle)If you want or expect this to be just like the first SPAZ you may be disappointed, but it's honestly pretty fun if you don't let the original color your judgement.Looking forward to seeing where this goes, I believe it will continue to get better as development continues.

								First of all, this is NOTHING like the original SPAZ. So if you're looking for a 2D top down spaceship shooter, don't get this.I didn't like this one bit at first as like many, I was expecting a game similar to SPAZ. Even though the trailers were very clear about the direction of this game, I expected them to retain the original game mechanics. Apparently, except the characters / universe / attack ships, this is an entirely different game. But well, it grew on me. Even in early access, this shows promise.P.S.: In case you're looking for something similar to SPAZ, check out Reassembly.			"

Early Access Review
								Spaz 2 is a fun game and brings some cool new features to the series like modular motherships, controlling your own faction and putting more interaction in combat. Now you can power to shields to block attacks and throw debris at your enemies with your tractor beam. It also lets you put your ship back together mid fight which is pretty cool. The graphics are nice, watching your miniguns spraying tracer fire at incoming missile volleys is pretty awesome and most weapons will be easily recognisable from their fire. The level up system is kinda pointless, you get 3 options which the game cycles back through. Giving you silly choices like +25% weapon damage or 10% more salvage. Once you pass level 35 it runs out of new choices so you can get the ones you skipped anyway.  Big downgrade from being able to specialise in Spaz.There is no voice acting in early access for the campaign, they use voice synthesizers as a place holder and it's not great. If that sounds like it would bug you then wait for full release where it will be changed.While I enjoyed spaz 2 I prefered the first one which I played through a few times.I beat the story in about 14 hours, and you could easily do it in less on your first play through. In it's current state and the way the faction system works with the infection and final battle I don't want to play a second time. The faction system and base building is quite well balanced against the other factions but against the infection is pointless and predictable. With some balancing tweaks from the infection/faction interaction, making the pirates actually do something and increasing the maximum amount of captains in a battle (Especially with multiplayer) it will be even better, but is defintely worth getting if you enjoyed Spaz.Looking forward to coming back once multiplayer is out.

Early Access Review
								So, after the recent big updates I have checked out the game again to get a good grasp of all the changes. And a lot has happened in the meantime indeed, and I've been playing through the game from lvl 1 - 45+ again just because there's so much new stuff in it now.Pros:-The combat is nice. While not exactly the same as in SPAZ 1, the tractor beam and reload mechanics, as well as the ramming and breaking parts off of enemy vessels make it possible to utilize your skill and still win against objectively stronger enemies. The new, revamped strike craft are also pretty much in line with their SPAZ 1 strength, too.-The faction system and starbase ownership make for a neat little minigame and provide some emergent gameplay, too. People come to shop for resources and new parts, every faction has it's own economy and by conquering new territory you get access to better and bigger ship parts, too.-The bounty and relationship system are pretty nice, they provide a good way of controlling the AI captains and allow you to play the game strategically without having to do everything yourself. Then again not everyone might like playing just with little white triangles, numbers and dots on a starmap. Still, it allows you to put your excess money to good use.-Zombies as a whole can get rather terrifying if you have them around right from the start. As they absorb more captains and territories, they put more and more pressure on the rest of the galaxy and the player, making for a quite unique challenge compared to the first game where nothing really happened unless you progressed through the story. Of course if you turn down the difficulty, their progression stagnates at a certain point though.- Ship customization has been revamped, and while the new, global part catalogue has made it easier to get all the things that you really want, the core synergy system puts a bit more oomph into your design choices and puts an end to the first-order-optimal line or L-shaped ships.- Side events and flavor stuff are being implemented now, too. Mining operations where you can stock up on rez in relative safety and better bandits that actually provide some decent loot and XP even further into the game.- The new strike craft system is pretty close to how you handled your ships in SPAZ 1. Collect blueprints, pick a hull, customize the loadout and deploy those SRM spam freighters until your PC melts from all the missile spam.Cons:-Research/lvling is just a randomized ""Pick 30% more shields/armor or health"" thing. Most of the time you don't even get the choices that you need or want, and it can leave you crippled until you suddenly hit that magical RNG roll and get +30% weapon power that enables you to steamroll everything. Would really love some more customization and playstyle-tinkering here.-You won't get to see all the neat crazy weapons and big, beautiful ship parts until one of the factions/your faction has basically conquered half of the map. You only get the better/exotic weapons (mass drivers, fighter bays, etc.) if a starbase is connected to several others that have certain specializations. So for example one type of map sector gives you better engines. You have to capture 4 of those sectors and connect them to one another with starbases in order to get the biggest engines for your faction specialization. Good luck trying to do that with all of the other factions, the zombies and ever increasing starbase build costs. Once you're at the point where you can conquer enough sectors to unlock all the parts, you'll probably not need them anymore. <-- This has been solved by giving us custom order parts. If you have the cash, you can just make any part that you want, even if no faction would be able to sell it normally - The inverted difficulty curve might still put off people, just like with Mount&Blade. You start out as a lowly lvl 1 guy among a galaxy of established captains and factions, and have to work your way up from there. As soon as you have a strong foothold, however, you can start steamrolling everything rather easily.- Crew is now just a resource to repair your ship. No boarding, no suicide pods, no picking up escape pods from your blown apart enemies and filtering out the new crew applicants through your trusty airlock. You still get to see people venting into space when your enemies break apart, but you really have to squint your eyes to notice it.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			"

								I am very excited about this game and really enjoy sinking my time into it. I have not played the first SPAZ but have youtubed it a fair bit. I guess that would be a good game but man, this 2nd game @4k ultra is totally on roids!The battles are epic and just way too much fun, it is possible to gank much higher levels by leading enemies toward safer grounds with the hopes of higher faction members coming to your rescue. This can level you up fast in later levels, like every match.The interface is great, some extra alt hot keys would be nice (like alt keys on enter or ok etc) or to have common buttons appear near another overlay common buttons as sometimes mousing around in 4k can be annoying (ingame dynamic positioning of windows would be even better here).The game was a bit slow for me at first, but once I got the hang of it it started to roll much quicker. Ship design is super fun. I would like the ability to save ship designs at starports so I can roll a ship based on what metrics I required per battle as long as the parts were available in personal storage (or get alerted to buy missing ones if needed and in stock at the station)Overall, this is a bluddy brilliant game and I am looking forward to seeing how this ends up with multiplayer :)Can't talk, must blow sheet up!

								Dude i So need a Bio-Port update, oh the Pwnage. Seriously this game is to date the funnest space combat game EVER MADE! It doesnt force you to sit around and tweak your colonies or worry about where thier♥♥♥♥♥♥is being flushed to(pollution). Nope, lets get guns, blow some♥♥♥♥♥♥up, save the universe, and have some fun doing it! Visually the game is kinda just fun to play, the script in the story line is great(hilarious). Not sure if they are gonna get real voices at some point because the comp voices are funny to hear but again the game was well enouph written to where I'm confident real voices could deliver this even better! To those who havn't tried this game yet you probly should. To those who actually don't like this game, ya know what,♥♥♥♥♥♥off, cause you dont know what a good game is ya dirty no good zambie!			"

								It's not SPAZ... not in the least.  The first person perspective and emphasis on flying your base around does not capture the original fun and speed that I really enjoyed with Spaz.  It's no longer about tempting fate and flying and ship close to an unfriendly base just to get some of the minerals its mining or flying around your fast little ship and avoiding detection.  To be honest, after starting it up I was hopeful, the humor seemed there and despite the lack of voice acting (which I understand is coming later) the gameplay itself just does the original no justice.  I have never before asked for a steam refund, until today			"

								TL;DR:  Very different from SPAZ 1, awful controls, good potential.Overall, while I cannot recommend this game in it's current state, I would probably still recommend this game if I was pressed, but just barely and with some caveats.  I have to say No for the time being, but I will not be seeking a refund and will give Minmax the benefit of the doubt.  Is Early Access just to fix bugs or will they listen to the community as they have in the past and try to improve upon what they have created?SPAZ 2 brings some fresh new ideas to the game and sounds familiar, but that is about where it ends.  This is not the same game as SPAZ and just because you loved that game like I did does not mean you will like this game.  So before you rush to give Minmax your money, keep that in mind.  My major complaint, which seems to be in line with other negative reviews, is the controls.  I found them unresponsive at best.  SPAZ gave you great control of your ship and I loved strafing around vessls while blowing them to bits.  In SPAZ 2, I found myself jamming the WSAD keys and nothing happening.  I would frustratingly sit still or be turning to the right when I was turning to the left, which makes combat, the best part of SPAZ 1, incredibly annoying in SPAZ 2.This all said, this is in Early Access.  Maybe this is one of the ""bugs"" they are going to fix before releasing the game.  I don't know, but I love the idea of supporting a two man team that made one of my favourite games of recent memory.I do like the new Universe Map and how the have stream lined the collection of resources so that I am not flying around a lonely area shooting asteroids and collecting goons.  There are plenty of games where I can do that if I want.  However, my second largest complaint is tied into this and that is the dumbing down of the game.  The first SPAZ was RPGish and you had a good idea what the new parts and weapons you added did.  In SPAZ 2, when you level up you get a choice of 3 perks and the only numbers you see are the DPS for each weapon and the rock, papers, scissors for each, also known as Shields, Armour and Health.  So naturally you line up the pieces with the highest dps on your left or right side and you go into broadside mode like Rebel Galaxy.  Other then that, you kind of just have to guess how effective a weapon will actually be.Collecting Lore instead of Ship designs is less good, but I have not found many yet, so who knows.  Maybe that will become more interesting?The story is entertaining, sort of.  And I am sure it will be better when they add the actual voices.  The first thing I did when I fired up the game was turn off the awful synth voices.  However I found the first SPAZ more amusing and this one almost seems more serious... some how.  Hard to do with Zombies in space, I know.If/when they fix the controls and assuming they continue to support the game and add content like they did with SPAZ, which I have no reason to believe they will not, I will likely change my review at that time.

Early Access Review
								This has been one of the most frustrating experiences I have ever had.Let me explain: This game is difficult, extremely difficult, many times more than SPAZ 1. However it gets to a point where the game becomes unplayable, even on lowest difficulty setting.There comes a point in the story where you have to form your own faction, then the game turns into space diplomacy the game, something I was not expecting to happen. So what happens then? You have to start building bases all over this huge galaxy map, however if you are not very good at macro managing an entire faction of dudes then you will be completely S.O.L at this pointYou can dump resources into a star base, it takes a TON of resources, a LOT of grinding to get enough to not only build it, but to then fund the star base’s strength to maximum, however at the point in the game I am at that doesn’t matter because you will just lose said star base the moment you move away from it. My maximum, threat level 70 star base dies within seconds of building it. It has gotten to the point where the game is no longer fun, as it just becomes “Run around the galaxy trying to get scrap so you can build bases.” Some factions if you step on their toes for SIMPLY EXCISTING will non-stop harass the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your bases to the point you get pushed back to your capital, and then lose that.Now if you are how I am, and were dumping all you had to growing your strength to fight THE ZOMBIES then you are now in this situation that I am in:1) My own ship is now too weak to fight any other ship in the game.2) You have no resources to make yourself stronger to kill a base somewhere to make a capital base.3) Everyone else in the galaxy hates you to the point that you cannot ally with anyone, everyone hates each other, and now the zombies are taking over the map.The devs themselves have said there is no ultimate “failure state” but you know what? That is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The state I am is unrecoverable, and that some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T.The worst part about all this, the game springs this extra difficulty maco management crap many hours into the game so I have no ability to refund. I would have never bought this game if I knew this was going to happen.Heree is a copy-paste from a thread I started about this game, it says a lot more than this review:After 19 hours, becoming over level 100, and skipping an over 100 hour grind via salty, salty means I have beaten the game.I will not spoil it. This isn't about the ending, that I hated, it is about something much more.This was the most hellish 19 hours of grinding and struggling in my entire video game life, doing the same thing over and over, getting crapped on continously in an uphill never ending battle only to give up and turn to the dark side myself because I realized 80 more hours of the same would have broken me.If I can take anything from this experience you have given me dev it is this; for just under 18 dollars as of writing this, you have made me feel true dispair, anguish, and true defeat. I have never felt so defeated by a game in all my life, not even games so hard I simply cannot beat them. I held on and beat this game though, because I really like SPAZ 1, and I think you guys are a great dev team. I am not sure if your goal was to make people feel true disguest and such terrible, terrible negative feelings. Ya know what though? Because you made me feel these things, these horrible things, I have now come to enjoy life a little more. A tiny amount of pain caused to me by this game has given a tiny bit more pleasure in my life. One truly cannot know what pleasure is, without pain right?I am sorry for all the grief I have caused you in these forms, I made a lot of posts that were filled with the grand distress you've made me feel over the corse of these rocky 19 hours. I even tried to refund the game when I found out it turns into resource management the game! Value told me no, so I pressed on. I'm super glad I got nothing but 5 star rated parts and over level 100 or that boss rush ending would have made me make another salty post in these very forms!Some feedback:In case your goal was NOT to do the things I said above, perhaps these could be some changes:Not everyone playing your game will get it. I never got what weapons to use, what combos were good, I never understood any of it. You need to put better tutorials in, or something. Hell maybe have one of those pop ups you can click on to the left of the screen explain ""HEY YOUR SHIP WEAPON CHOICES ARE KINDA GARBAGE"" This is a running theme. Many, many things could have been explained better.Please put in a table that lists what upgrades you get, and at what levels, as well as a table showing what upgrades I picked. If this is already in the game, soz I never found it as it was never told to me. I had to just remember what I picked to evenly level my ship out, which I did, I think. Then past level 45 all I was 3-5% upgrades..? Kinda lame. I think you guys said you were working on this. Also more cores, but you're working on that too.The zombies are too much, they really, really are even after all these patches. Again, lots of players are GARBAGE at your game either because we're crap at games or your game doesn't teach enough. Again, cap the zombies at a much lower number, by the end of my game almost everyone was a zombie, that is too much to deal with, without cheating.Cap how many system can be taken by the zombies. I should have screen shoot the map when it was 70% zombie.100 hours of grind to beat the game. No. I am serious about this, my projections kicked back about a 100 hours to get what I needed to beat the game based off my exp, money, and follower gain per hour. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ no. 20 hours is honestly too much.If you change ONE THING change thisYou need a FASTER way to give people money and stuff, a give all members X amount button, or in the very least not have to click through menus again. I had to click on every single caption and bribe them up with cash over and over and over. Think about this, if I have 1 million bux, and I need to bribe EVERY PERSON IN EVERY FACTION, I have to, for one person mind you; click on faction button - > click on the scroll button X number of times for whever - > Click on the person - > then click tribute - > how much I wanna give - > then OKAY! Based off how many people were in each tribe I had to click over 5,625 times when you could have given players who grind ♥♥♥♥ out and cheat the ability to GIVE ALL. I wasted over an hour on this alone.Anyway, thank you for you time reading this if you do read it post a ""Sorry Snuggly"" in the comments below. Or not, see if I care you 18ish dollar swindlers! I'll see you in hell as we play SPAZ 143 The Computer is the TRUE VIRUS ALL ALONG where you have to grind for 141 BILLION YEARS to beat the first act of the game!			"

								Is SPAZ 2 better then the first? Not quite IMHO. Is it a damn fine game worth the asking price? Hells yeah!The only things that let the game down a bit are not really big things, just slightly frustrating little things.Pro's-Decent sized galaxy map-Lots of lore to uncover as you open up new areas, good for new players.-Apart from a few small things (Part icon legend so you know whats what) the UI is well done.-Looks good-Can see alot of the style as first game just alot more 3D-Controls are intuitive, I prefered the control setting that made it play more like Rebel Galaxy personally but it feels good either way.-Decent story, will be alot better when the proper voice acting is in but very playable as is.Con's-Not easy to tell if a peice is an upgrade and to replace a bit deep inside your built ship you have to pull alot of it apart to get it in there, really need a part replace option and better ways to show stats on the ship peices.-If you upgrade one of your starbases to its max it still falls very easily to other captains, I seem to lose them quite oftem after building them to random ship captains-Miss the Blueprint/tech system from the original, while the new system (salvaged random parts) isnt really a con it just doesnt feel as fun as the original. Also to a lesser extent not having pre designed ships and now having to build them from random parts that dont really look all that good.-Too much neon in the ships imo, but thats just a personal taste thing, some people like it.After all that though I highly recommend SPAZ 2, while I still like the first one more, the second game is far from crap, its just diffrent.

Early Access Review
								This EA game is what early access games should feel like. Currently (a few days after launch into EA) it is the bones of a masterpiece. It already has so many things that I would be enthused by in a finished game, and the love and attention the developers have poured into crafting the systems and the engine are very apparent.  This game really feels like a SPAZ4, not a SPAZ2 if we're being real, its that large of a difference (and improvement so far).A lot of reviews you'll read will be comparing this to SPAZ, and knocking off points for discrepencies. It is very much worth mentioning that the vast majority of these complaints are comparing elements of SPAZ that are simply not implemented in SPAZ2 yet (voices, more robust campaign, procedural quests etc). Really the only thing thats fair to compare between the two games is the engine, and the systems driving gameplay, since those seems to be here in a largely complete way.That being said, this game isn't complete, and If you're looking for a narrative game I would wait until they put the 'Fin' stamp on the campaign.What this game is right now is a ♥♥♥♥in' awesome space sandbox, with interesting events, and compelling gameplay. I'm loathe to imply that this game is derrivative, but if I had to compare it to other titles I would say its the happy, space-baby of Mount&Blade: Warband and Sid Meier's Pirate's (which is to say two of the best games ever made).Good job guys. You ♥♥♥♥in' killed it. 10/10 "

								** This is an Alpha review **I spent a lot of time in SPAZ 1, and I can say that this game has potential to be better.  For the moment, there are features that are great, and some that aren\'t, as with any game in development.  The game feels incomplete, but it is a great start nonetheless.  Highly recommended to SPAZ 1 lovers.Pros:-Free movement through the galaxy, more open than SPAZ 1.-Ultimate ship customization; you choose all the parts; no restrictive tech reqs like SPAZ 1.-Sandbox mode to customize the game structure in detail.-True to SPAZ 1\'s silly humor and wonderful♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off spacefarrers.-Alpha status means there will be many features still to come!Cons:-Incomplete (It\'s Alpha, don\'t play yet if you don\'t like seeing lots of changes happening)-Campaign feels unpolished, needs more depth / variety.-Space ship battles and missions have little variety (so far!).-With 100\'s of AI captains roaming around, be prepared to get bullied a lot early game.

Early Access Review
								Campaign is slow at the start as you figure out how to get resources and build a ship, but once you do start to have the littlest bit of competency this game gets SO FUN. It's been out 2 days, and 2 days in a row I have completely accidentally stayed up til 5 in the morning just because I didn't notice the passing of time.As others have said, if you like Mount & Blade, then you should like this game; it's M&B in space. It has almost the exact same overarching idea, and similarly captures that feeling of starting as an absolutely powerless nobody and rising through the ranks to become king of everything.You start the game literally flying pieces of garbage around the galaxy, scavenging from battles between bigger armies and doing arena fights to cobble together a modest fighter of your own (just like M&B). From there, there's a paradigm shift to working within a faction, defending a single outpost, and touching on relationship building (just like M&B). Then there's ANOTHER paradigm shift as you start your own faction and focus on managing multiple outposts and spreading your own influence, commanding other dudes to do what you were doing mid-game. JUST LIKE M&B. I mean all of this as an absolute compliment, as it is pulled off very well already in early access, and I look forward to any improvements they have in store here to polish the experience. It is already very streamlined, though.When it comes to the actual battles, again, in the very beginning you're just flying around with no clue what to do. As you build up your strength - not just by getting new gear and xp, but by actually building the skills necessary to construct a worthy ship and actually use it well (and then, mid-game, playing the meta-game of interstellar politics) - battles become incredibly fun. That moment when you take your ugly POS ship and totally refashion it into something sleek and powerful (use more than one nose and engine!) and can start stomping all over people is such a great feeling. Not only that, but it's when the fights get really fun and interesting. At first, it's admittedly kinda boring because you don't have any kind of strategy if you're just hoping to brute-force your way through every fight. Once you figure out what you're doing though, there are a ton of possible strategies, e.g., snipe from a distance, focus on shield strength so you can kite, hit and run with strong engines, constant missle barrage, etc etc. The arenas are great to showcase a lot of the different build types you can come up with. For real, the company is called Minmax, and you can (and should) minmax the F out of this game.Anyway, once you get to about level 10 or threat level 30ish, battles get awesome. It's a fun mix of flying in with your buddies to just stomp all over some poor sucker that thought it'd be a good idea to steal your Rez, a protracted drawn-out 2v2 45-minute long desperate fight to the finish, a panicked flight to the fail gate, sieges on starbases, and so on. My favorite fight so far was probably a 2v2 where the weaker enemy and my weak ally both got killed, and then I kept fighting the stronger enemy for I don't even know how long, engaging, disengaging, focusing lasers to get his shields down, focusing canon fire to blast his engine off followed by the nose to keep the shields down, dodging behind asteroid fields to reload and let my own shields recharge, reattaching my own dislodged parts mid-battle, and finally ramming into the dude to finish it off. Whew, my adrenaline is pumping just remembering it.All that said, it's of course still in early access, but the devs have been working tirelessly to incorporate feedback from the users. They released 5 hotfixes just in the first 24 hours and are working on plans for bigger adjustments.And there are things that need adjusting. Building/changing your your mothership is real wonky, Choosing your perk at level up isn't clearly incorporated into the big picture, weapon selection mid-battle (and actually most of the user interface) needs a lot of polish, things like that. The core of the game is fantastic, and I really look forward to the finished game once the devs work out the kinks that have got some folks panties' in such a bunch. This doesn't feel like it was made by just 2 people, but it was, so I think it'll take some time for them to get it from awesome-if-you-can-get-past-the-barriers-to-entry to just plain awesome.Absolute day one purchase for me. I recommend you buy it if you like M&B's style of three level strategy and want to see attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion and watch C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. If you do buy it, please play for more than 1-2 hours, really try to get into it and give it a chance. Get past that stage of making your ship just a straight line of wing parts, get into the min-maxing. The problems with this game are surface-level over a very solid, fun core, and the devs have vision, passion, and talent and are listening to the fans on what needs to be done. I personally look forward to playing until sunup many more times.			"

								Definitely Happy with this game.As you can see I have over 140 hours into the original game and I know i'll put just as many if not more into its sequel.I'll be honest here, This isn't the SPAZ 1 that you know. But you know what? That's alright, because this is a good sequal that expands on the ideas of the first and goes in a new direction.The first and most obvious change is the perspective. You are fighting in full 3D where you control the ship from a 3rd person view, (you can change it to the classic top down view with the press of a button).The next big change is the Map. You now have free choice to move about the map instead of jumping from sector to sector. Time only goes by when you are moving or doing an action A-La Mount & Blade. The map is filled with sectors where a starbase can be built and captains flying around doing their own thing. Each of the 200 captains will have their own agenda and opinions of all the other captains.Another new change is the ship building. You now control your mothership only which you can design by picking or buying peices, nose (front), core (center), wings (left and right), and Engines (the back). You build your ship using these parts which will have varying quality and will give different bonus' and weapons.Along with new shipbuilding, you can also create your own faction and build your own starbases to gather resources for you along with getting captains to join your side in the firght against the zombies.Overall I would reccomend this game as a good followup to its predecessor.

								Fun space-fighting/building game.Different from SPAZ 1 in the same way the Fallout 3 was different form earlier fallouts.Different game, same universe.Good game, though it has the classic problem of getting too big, and with too much to do, and no tools to handle it all.			"

Seriously though, If you obsessively loved SPAZ 1 then you probably won't like this as much, because it's an evolution not a sequel but if you didn't like SPAZ 1 for every single component and just liked it as a general thing, or if you have never heard of SPAZ before, then it will be a much better game for you.P.P.S.

								Ship construcxtion is boring and pointless as there iis only one or two ways to build an effective ship and thus offers no constructionb freedom. Pre built ships or much more effort into the ship construction mechanic is seriously needed. Game is a huge grind which wouldnt be so bad if the difficulty level wasnt so high that you end up dying over and over and struggling to gather the resources required to advance. As the develepors point out its a different game to SPAZ 1 which is a pity because SPAZ 1 is much better and actually fun to play.			"

								After completing the main game I really enjoyed the game, I've been watching the early access progress and it looks impressive so far. I'm holding off replaying until the game leaves early access, though the last update makes it pretty tempting to jump back in now.Fun FactorSo far the gameplay is rock solid, very fun. I havent hit a annoying aspect yet. This is the most importent aspect of any game for me, I have limited time to play games and dont want to be screaming at the computer because the game is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. I play for fun, SPAZ 2 is fun.SPAZynessWhile it's quite different to SPAZ 1 at a superficial level, once you start playing it still feels like SPAZ. It's hard to explain because the 3D graphics look so different, but this game is still SPAZ at it's heart. It's diffenitly passed the SPAZ feeling test.Space MapThis is a fantastic improvement and seems to be the natural progression from SPAZ 1ControlsThe default controls did feel a little weird, but as suggested turning off relative controls made it feel much more natural and very easy to control the shipsCombatThis has been the bigest difference so far, and appears to be much harder, but this could be due to be just not beign very good yet.Ship BuildingInteresting so far, while handled quite differently to SPAZ 1 its still ok. I've read a lot of people saying the trackor beam thing is weird, but once you figure out you press the control key instead of the mouse click it dead easy. I'm going to reserve final judgement on this one until later in the game when I've got the cash to upgrade for real.			"

								Playing during Early Access. The start of the campaign is a little slow. Slowly improving your ship and leveling. Lots of nutty dialog you can skip. Many tutorials.After you pay for your first base, then things pick up quite a bit. Bounties on you. Neutrals raiding your resources. Size 2 parts.During the campaign, after the zombies appear. Things get even busier. Battles are much more fun and drawn out. Level 3 parts with sometimes, new interesting weapons. Taking out 2 lower level zombie captains with your 1 ship is quite satisfying. Often after a battles I'll level twice.			"

								This is a first time player review, 7 hours of an initial sitting.From what I can see of my small time and little research into this game, I have to say it's a little bit confusing at first but quickly becomes absolutely amazing. (Even at this early access stage)Instead of writing a long review, I'm going to list the pros and cons of my first sitting experience.Pros:-The visuals are amazing, weapons, engines, background, textures and colors are stunning for a simple game like this.-Combat feels like a simulation, without all the fiddly bits that go with it.-The strategy or travel part of the gameIs simple and takes the ""grinding"" out of things, while letting you progress.-Customization is astonishing. Not only do you choose how your ship looks, it also affects your movement, shields, armor, hull, how your weapons fire and the strategy you employ.-The amount of choices you can make to progress is vast.Cons: -All the panels and icons can be confusing and overwhelming at the start, but easy to get used to.-Combat strategy is briefly mentioned but all the possibilities to take another ship down has to be gradually learned.-Information on all the weapons can tend to get a bit over whelming.Apart from this I HIGLY recommend this game. Even in early access it has many hours of extremely enjoyable gameplay.			"

								Dont be afraid by negetaiv reviews! most of them wanted the old spaz back in a better costume. they are frustrated with the result! a result, that is so much better then the first game! BTW: the first game is a must for everyone! i LOVE IT! the dev`s do have the courage to try something new and they can be damn proud of what they did!a lot of ppl with just 1-5 hours in havent even scratched the surface and write a bad review. the(short) campaign(8-25 hoursdepending on you) is just to understand everything that goes on in this game! the real strenght comes with the sandbox mode! you can nearly change every aspect of the galaxy you want to play with! play with zombies from the start, no problemo! dont like zombies, no problemo. want to fight against very unfair odds? no problemo!pro`s- devs are very near to the community. they listen to you and will answere your questions and demands. they have gained a lot of respect for that.-within the 3 days, there were 3 hotfixes! more to be planned!- awesome visuals-very few bugs, very polished for an EA- 18 hours in 2 days! not many games can drag me in that much!con`s- no coop at the moment. they are working on how to do that-to many ppl complaining they did not got what they wanted! you need to adapt a little bit. once you see the greater picture, its awesome!but hey, dont read all those comments, try it by yourself! git good!Edit: After nearly 100 hours in, im still having lots of fun. each now and then i discover something new.personally, i encounted only one single crash, which is good for an ea.the dev team constantly dish out updates, bug fixes and new content. some if this content is event like ""nodes"" like in the first game, which a lot of ppl  missed in spaz2. they plan and tell the community what they are doing, so we now whats up.the game got a lot better over its time! cant press this more! great game!

								for what it stands for, this game feels solid to me and its got its strong points, SPAZ2 is not SPAZ 1.5 as many hopped it to be, but it is a continuation of the first game story with its own game style.if you played mount and blade, the overworld map (or over galaxy) feels pretty much to it, you have captains that have their own little fleets, you can build relationships with them, you cna make enemies with some, you can have a faction declare war on you while some members in it actually love you and avoid attacking you. YOU CAN RAM ENEMY SHIPS AND TEAR THEM APART what more else you can ask for?the game sure has its flaws, the ai tends to run instantly if it gets outunumbered, though i do the same so i guess we are even, and the ai dogpiling when a battle is started for 3v1 is often a problem when you get caught in a tight spot: but considering it was made by two guys, the game stands on its own and feels rewarding, from dodging most foes to tehn begin to search for them to get new/better pieces.its been an enjoyable experience nad look forward to finish the campaign and play the sandbox			"

								SPAZ really deserves attention and love from the average user. It's early-access, but that doesn't mean it isn't quality. The campaign is over 15 hours long and the gameplay is quality. The reason for it being early-access is because there's some features missing, such as voice acting and multiplayer. But it will come later. The main thing about SPAZ is the campaign, and that is completed. "

Early Access Review
								This game has missed the mark, so far. Positives:The strategic map is interesting, and looks great. Combat is fun if pretty shallow.Voices and character portraits are great.Negatives:There's no loot game - the loot has ""stars"" and you generally want one with more stars. There's no special effects, There's no rare prefixes or suffixes.  There's no deep ship builds. Opportunity lost there. There's a DPS number on the weapons, but they're totally inaccurate. There's no way to compare parts. The parts often have 6 stats (and buffs to those stats) but you pretty much just have to trust that the higher the stars, with the weapon you want, the better. There's a ""fuel"" mechanic which is super annoying. The End GameThe end game involves the zombies taking over stations and captains, which in theory is really cool. In practice though, it's a giant grindy slog. You can stomp 3 zombies at a time, and they'll just escape and rebuild within a couple days. You don't seem to ever be able to knock them out or even effect their strength that much. I know if I am blown up and escape in a pod, I don't come back in exactly the same strength of ship.  The zombies do though!If a NPC captain gets killed by a zombie, it comes back a zombie. I'm not certain that happens if they're in the combat with you when they die, but I suspect it does. I've had several combats where a too weak ally jumps in to ""help"" and I have to try my damndest to keep him away from the zombie captain that will near-instantly kill him and convert him.If you attack and destroy a zombie station, you have to build a new station on it immediately, upgrade the hell out of it and then sit around and babysit it while the Zombie Alpha immediately comes over to reclaim it. If you're not big enough to take the zombie alpha, or if you don't get enough allies in the fight to help - too bad! Starbase and all money invested lost.TL;DR: So close, yet so far. Needs some design rethinking or it's a fail.			"

								SPAZ 2 would be good but seeing as most of the game is half-broken, I'm not recommending the game. Yes, it's in Early Access but the game needs lots of fixing. It says to defeat the capital zombie base at a level of around 30. I'm level 42 with 93 threat and I can't manage to even get past the shields.The original SPAZ was one of my favourite games and I easily had over 80 hours into it, the aspects of the game were satisfying. You could beat a large ship with a small ship with the only cost being loads of time. Instead, this game focused on the Mothership. Comparingit to the old game, SPAZ 2 puts you into the pilot seat of the Mothership and your fleet are like drones around you and barely do any damage while in SPAZ 1 you control your fleet and the Mothership be the massive and overpowered ship that can teleport your fleet anywhere.The developers experimented with the game a little too much and the experiment exploded in their faces. The lego-style building of the Mothership isn't fun as you only either get good stats or a good weapons, rarely both. It moves very slowly and you can never tell if the weapons you've added do any difference to the one you had previous.			"

								Simply echoing most of the comments here: don't think you are getting anything like SPAZ1. Combat is slow, salvage is thin and disapointing, threat level means nothing as everyone somehow missiles the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you from infinity distance and then lazers you to death while you flounder with lef-right wings sometimes firing, sometimes not and always waiting on stupid battery recharge.

								This is an amazing game that, as far as i can tell, is only going to get better. As it stands, it's more then worth the early acess pricetag, and if you liked the original, you'll likely enjoy this. That's not to say this is more of SPAZ1, however. it's not. There's a wierd limbo where old and new meet, and this is sat firmly in it. It is well worth playing, but it's also worth treating as a new game in the same setting as the previous one.In other news, devs are extreemely responcive! I got a reply email in about four hours after I sent in my inital thoughts on the game to them. Props mates!~Aura			"

								Being a huge fan of the original SPAZ, I can say without a doubt, that this game has the potential to be amazing. The thing to remember is this is still EARLY ACCESS...I have personally had so much fun playing, and watching my starter junk ship become something more personal, and far superior. You really get a good sense of progress as your ship is upgraded over and over again. Having the rouge AI running around the startmap is a great new concept, and I am really looking forward to what this game has in store.			"

								This game is awesome! Ok a bit raw because it's an Early Access but brings a lot of dun already.Beautifull story mode, with a lot of laughs and rage :Pi didn't play Spaz 1 but i think i will take it as soon as possible just to get a bit better the lore, for what i saw the gameplay is completely different from the one and some rewies complain about it, but dont worry this game is truly enjoyable!(Don't let the haters scare you!)I loved my first campaign, i loved how my way to play the game changed throught it.I loved see my efforts be rewarded and my stupid action being punished (like try to fight in enemy territory xD)I appreciated the choice to let you choose if reload from an automatic quick save or accept the defeat with honor and restart from your starbase.I suggest you to check a couple of videos to understand what are you going to play instead blindbuy this game, because can be frustrating.

								SPAZ 2 is a nice game when judged on its own merits, so don't take 0-3 hour reviewers complaints to heart as they are most definitely skewed by both bias towards SPAZ 1 and ignorance (of game mechanics and options), The game isn't as clunky, streamlined, or uninteresting as they would make it seem.SPAZ 2 plays like a Mount and Blade Lite. You've got your factions, your towns, your lords, your kings, your bandits, and all the interactions between them. Cut out army management, nuanced character development, companions, interactions beyond fighting & trading & alliances / wars, faction variety, and finally put a 4 ship limit on and lower the skill cap on battles and you have SPAZ 2. If you're looking for M&B or SPAZ 1, SPAZ 2 will dissapoint you. SPAZ 2 is definitely less game than M&B, but what's in there is still quite enjoyable. The writing is amazing and the campaign was a breeze, however IMO the game lacks replayability. It's an easy 10-20 hours of enjoyable content depending on how long it takes you to complete the campaign, and for 20$ that seems just about right. I'd give it a solid 7/10.			"

								The amount of d**k sucking I've seen in the positive reviews is astounding. Total disregard for the games shortcomings, even when their own Pro/Con lists present more Cons than pros. I've finished the game. It took me a mere 8 hours to complete the story, after that I had little to no incentive to continue playing. There's no sign of any kind of ""Build"" or ""Playstyle"" you just make sure you can dish out as much damage as possible while keeping an eye on your shields and running away when you need to reload likea pantsy. The skill based combat from SPAZ 1 is gone. It's degenerated into damage trading, unless you can stay out of range, in which case, you've won, because you'll just wittle him down and there's nothing he can do about it.Why don't I recommend this game?Quite frankly, even without taking the title into consideration, it's because I expected more from the developers.I expected a great game. Not necessarily a new SPAZ, but this abortion of an excuse for a ""sequel"" has really soured my milk.The ship customization can only barely be called ""customization"" since you just slap on the best stuff you can find, there's really no need to care about what it is, if it does better damage, or gives more hull/shields, tape that thing to the side of your ship and swim in victories.I sound super salty in this review, and I'm not. I still have SPAZ 1 to play. I'm just sad that the devs spent so much effort, money and time on this. I can see the effort, the love, but it feels so half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ even though it clearly isn't.I probably won't change my review bar some miracle in the future.You want a space game with customizable ships and a world that feels alive? Alive as in ""not-an-anthill-full-of-mental-patients"" alive? Buy SPAZ 1.			"

								Did you love SPAZ 1 like me? If so, go back to that game. This is a glitchy mess, with a completely stupid camera (that even if you try to change it never approaches the level of spaz 1. The controls for your ship, are also stupid. They do not work like spaz 1 and it was disorienting to keep having to change the button to make me head toward the enemy (not a good design decision), changing equipment on your ship is also annoying, you have to go to a seperate screen (where your ship leaves tactical view/inventory tab) and you have to use the gimmicky tractor beam to physically remove the pieces you no longer want and attach the ones you do (after you scroll over the random pieces to tell you which is the one you want). The  game doesn't properly explain what threat level means (threat level 20? is that super bad? Why? what level enemies should you be able to fight? The combat is also too far removed from SPAZ 1..it just doesn't feel right. For instance, only one of my  sub ships spawned..but couldnt' figure out how to get second one to spawn, it's hard to see the enemies because of the stupid camera angles, and the zoom feature is just dumb..you have to zoom in to shoot the enemies effectively, which gives you tunnel vision and you are getting shot from other directions and can't maneoevre. Anyways, in short. until they fix this mess, i am going to just play spaz 1 again. This game has a long way to go to reach that level...and frankly after 3 years, i expected a much better offering. shame on you min max, shame on you.  "

								Do NOT, under any circumstances, give these people your money. The best word to describe this game is ""tedious"". I've had more fun at dental appointments. Every aspect of this product is a chore. There are some truly awful design choices in this game. You know how in some FPS games you end running backwards and shooting as your primary means of interacting with enemies because you can't jump, roll, or anything else? It's just run backwards shooting because it's your only choice? The SPAZ 2 version of this is turning, constantly turning, because no matter how many wings you put on your ship it is exactly as nimble as a rotting corpse. No matter how ""powerful"" you think you've become, no matter how much time and effort you put into scouring the galaxy for RNG-generated parts with ""good"" stats, the enemies always scale directly alongside you (unless they're specifically flagged not to be). There's a ""parts catalog"" you can order stuff from (paying a premium to have it brought to you) but there aren't any real choices because, once again, it's more RNG. Why is there so much ♥♥♥♥ing RNG in a single player game? If you've decided on a mechanic where I ""build"" star bases why do I not have the option to build the parts that I want? Why am I chained to whatever loot table you made? There just isn't a way to actually get ahead in SPAZ 2. You will always be right on the cusp of getting your teeth kicked in by even random, unnamed bandits because they've got dozens of additional ""strike vehicles"" in their hangars whereas you cannot build your own and when they're destroyed - yep! MORE RNG! And oh, look! Nobody else has strike vehicles and there's none in the catalog to buy! How's it feel to be crippled?Which brings me to the point I said the hell with it and decided to write this review: the big battle with the zombie alpha. The whole point of SPAZ 2 is finding upgrades to get stronger. So if you foolishly invested time and effort loading yourself out with the best you can get before you engage in the ""plot"" (LOL) missions, you're in for a treat: you get to fight multiple zombie clones of your own ship! Without ever having the opportunity to repair or replace your drones! Doesn't that sound AWESOME?♥♥♥♥♥♥like this always makes me wonder what game developers are thinking when they implement such bad choices. How do they imagine this is perceived as fun? ""Oh, but it's a challenge,"" you may say. Fair enough. If that falls under the rubric of ""challenge"" then why not just disable my monitor? If I can't see anything doesn't that make it more challenging? Why not ♥♥♥♥ up the controls so I have to figure out a whole new layout in the middle of a tough fight? Doesn't that make it more challenging? Well, if those choices would be perceived as bad because they cripple your ability to actually play the damn game, how is literally crippling my ability to engage with enemies significantly different? This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t marathon combat comes after you spend time and effort ""building up"" the galaxy in the form of star bases and newly recruited captains to your faction. They don't factor into the battle at all, which the devs know is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing thing to do which is why they hang a lampshade on it in the NPC text, and then you're in the thick of it perpetually turning, and turning, and turning, because if any of the ""zombie torpedos"" bursts too close to your ship they eat through your shields in seconds, infest your crew, and permanently lower your total health. There are no health pickups in the fight. Pieces of your ship break off and are no longer available to be used or calculated in your stats (shields, health, speed, damage). Nothing. You're better off slamming a crescent wrench into your forehead. All of that having been said there's potential here - assuming whoever writes the dialogue wakes up to the fact they aren't nearly as funny or clever as they think they are, the dev team as a whole re-evaluates their conceptions of ""fun"" and ""challenge"", and they implement some things I would have assumed would be a given in a game that's all about customized ships you build yourself. Let me build parts to my specifications. Let me dump cash and ""rez"" into a line of research, wait for some time to pass, and have the parts I want. I mean, FFS, I have to choose between stats and cosmetics in a single player game that's all about a customized spaceship? Really? Jesus. Wait till it's five bucks. And maybe not even then.			"

								I loved the predecessor, bought it twice (outside of steam before), played it through several times, including with a big galaxy in hardest mode. So I totally looked forward to  SPAZ 2. There were so exciting announcements, all involving added depth but in the end the new game has absolutely nothing in common with the first game, except maybe the annoying long dialogs between the NPCs and here it is even worse. Even the start is annoying, I have to confess that I even failed the get what the game expected from me (and this although I'm used to play far more complex games like KSP). After tons of NPC chat you get dropped somewhere with a space ship and your task is to rebuild it for some strange reason instead of just working with it and upgrading it gradually as usually. I normally LOVE creative aspects and ship building but this is done so unintuitve and complicated and even pointless, there is no fun at all. The game concept also has completely been changed to some strange grinding, the combat was fun before but now it's somewhat 3D'ish and nothing like it was before. I put the game down for long time in hope I may be able to get into it but I just can't. If you don't know SPAZ yet, please try the first one, it's so much better and they should have been build on it instead of trying to reinvent everything. It's even worse than MOO3 compared to MOO2 but similiar in messing a good game up with completely new and different mechanics.			"

								Biggest waste of 20 bucks in a long time.First of all the basic concepts of modular mothership was kind of cool at first but...This game is a boring grind that sucks all around. I spent 5 hours on this game grinding while all the other ships around me far out leveled me in no time at all. So all there is to do is raid various resources of your enemies once your part of a faction, and fight pirates. Because while I am threat level 16 with crap weapons the nearest non faction ships to fight are threat levels 24 and up which take you out in no time. Bandits are always threat level 6 so once you beat them its just a grind. Money, rez, and goons are a grind to get. The map is tiny compared to SPAZ1. Combat is clunky and unintuitive. The mothership pieces all look very generic, they are all the same between factions minus the difference in color.This game is in early access but it also needs a lot of its core mechanics overhauled badly! I mean I could put more time into it but I already feel ive felt everything it has to offer minus grinding for 10 more hours to start fighting some other factions ships.On a plus the story is interesting, so are the research tidbits. But unfortunately the fun just isnt there.			"

Top down 2d'ish arcady style battle reminded me of the best parts of Star Craft and MOO. Then we got into the plot, not to mention the forever modding that seemed to make a great game immortal. Like all good things eventuly I moved on untill.... SPAZ 2?Hmms... How to top a classic?How to make it its own game with a plot of its own and the abiltiy to play it again for even fun?Enter Spaz 2.(✓)  Kept the humor from Spaz 1.(✓) Spaceship battles that look pretty.(✓) Spaceship battles that are tactical.(✓) Build your own ship and include the old ones for fun.(✓) Game ramps up from a solo -> 'mini fleet' -> 4x.(✓) Lore from the orginal.(-) No modding planned.(-) Took years to make.EDIT: (✓) The story is compelling and will last exactly how long you want to play it. Blaze through or Luxuriate in the living world of SPAZ 2.(✓/-) We went from a top down arcade shooter to a battleship in space sim. The ships now have mass and act like.... Ships!(✓) The sandbox mode is amazing and allows for many replays of many sorts.EDIT2:(✓-) Multiplayer - no more(✓) More cores!(✓+) The sandbox just got far more sandy with tons more options!

								Nothing like SPAZ was. I bought this with pretty low expectations, and even those were dashed.There is nothing to do in the game except for some extremely bland content and reading lore about the universe. Sure you can upgrade your ship with some cookie cutter componenets, but that isn't exciting. There isn't much unique about the ship customization, it's bland.At present the game consists of a basic overworld map that you fly around as a tiny trinagle while looking for boring battles.  The other reviews that called this similar to Mount & Blade are straight up ficticious and should be investigated for shilling. Gameplay is literally, have map open entire time while using it to travel from point A to point B. No open world. Then fight with some incredibly boring space fights where you have your boring ""customized"" ship vs another ship.  Every space fight is instanced and focused solely on the combat, whether you're fighting ships or shooting an asteroid with the same weapons trying to ""mine"" it for rez.The combat consists of flying close to the other ship and hitting them with your weapons, sometimes you can use your tractor beam to throw objects like small asteroids or explosives at them. But regardless its the most repetitive combat I've ever seen.The faction system is somewhat well done and the AI are running around seemingly doing their own thing similar to what the player does, but it doesn't matter. The core of the game is so repetitive that by the time you play a few space fights you'll have seen it all. I know this i s Early Access but based on what I've seen here I just don't believe they can really improve the platform without starting over from scratch.  Using the Starmap the entire time to move around is frustrating and boring. And then the combat, which is the only thing that game really has to offer, is just as boring and repetitive after the first 2 fights you've see it all.			"

								Hi everyone, just want to give my perspective on SPAZ 2 after playing for about 6 hours (not finished the story yet - I'm at the part about a bandit base, won't give any more details because of spoilers if anyone hasn't reached that point yet). I have played both SPAZ 2 and SPAZ 1 and have been following the development of SPAZ 2 for around 2 years, so I already knew it was going to be different to the first one. I guess there's four major ways in which I can review this game:Story:Personally I think the story is even funnier in SPAZ 2 than in SPAZ 1, I have laughed out loud at the storyline multiple times so far. The lore objects provide interesting background information and you get a reward as well. Great work from the developers with the story, and the computer voices actually make it even funnier.Graphics and Sound:Unfortunately given the fact that I have a terrible computer (barely meeting the minimum system requirements) I can't really do this game justice graphically. Nonetheless, I was surprised by how good the graphics look even on low settings, unlike some games where low settings make your game look like Runescape (not that that's necessarily a bad thing, I used to be a Runescape player but for this sort of game it looks terrible). Obviously there are a few weird graphical effects but that's mostly due to me having to turn down the settings, when I started on the default settings the game lagged so I had no choice.Gameplay:There are two different aspects to this: the starmap and combat. The new starmap interface is great and although to a certain extent I miss mining rez asteroids and taking on comets and picking up escape pods from blown up ships in SPAZ 1, beyond a certain point particularly on the harder difficulties it got very grindy so I on balance prefer the new system. I would like the power ups that already appear in battles to also have the possibility of containing Goons, Rez, Scrap or perhaps ship parts to perhaps encourage some map exploration in the combat. The 200 AI captains really do make it feel like a living galaxy, at the moment I have a bounty on me and it really feels like the AI is out to kill me, whenever I go into hostile territory or harvest a resource I have to look out for people who might be hunting me. In addition, it is good that the other factions interact with each other, with the captains remembering everything that is done to them it feels like you have to consider major actions carefully and decide who you can afford to upset in order to appease someone else. I also like the ability to build your own starbases for a particular faction and use them to harvest resources. The parts system is quite good, though I miss the customisation of every ship from SPAZ 1, I think that your strike craft should be a certain size with maybe 1-3 cores but you can add your own parts to them. That would be my single biggest recommendation for this game if there are any future updates. The tractor beam system for changing parts is also a little annoying sometimes but to be honest it's not a major problem and several people have already posted guides to avoid/minimise the need to use it.Onto the actual combat, I think that the new 3d view looks great, and people who want the old style from SPAZ 1 have that option too. The combat itself I have mixed opinions on. The options for commanding the strike craft could do to be expanded upon (at the moment they are little more than go here, attack that, defend that ship over there). The idea of being able to aim at certain parts of enemies and watching their parts fly off is good, and there seems to be a greater variety of weapon types than in the first SPAZ. The new reload and boost system adds opportunities in combat to attack when your opponent has to reload, and makes you think carefully about which targets to prioritise. However, I have to say that the in-battle HUD is distinctly lacking. The distance to your target is in arbitrary units, and your shields and hull are just two bars along the bottom of the screen, with no indication of armour. There is also no in-combat indication of which of your weapons are in range, or the armour status of components on your opponent's ship, other than the visuals. As a bit of a statistics nerd, I would prefer to see a lot more in the way of hard numbers like the first game. I would also like to see the return of shield quadrants, as that used to be one of the main reasons to have a fast ship. Whilst in SPAZ 2 a fast ship is still useful for dodging and hit and run attacks, I don't understand why shield quadrants were removed as that made the game much more strategic.Progression:Obviously this is subject to balancing changes and I can't comment across the full game as I haven't finished the campaign yet. I think that the game's difficulty and complexity is about right. I have not yet reached a situation where either my ship is so strong that combat becomes too easy or I have way too many resources, nor have I ever reached a point where I am grinding for hours and hours on end just to make some small progression through the game. I have never had to spend more than 2-3 hours to gather the resources and upgrades to progress, whereas SPAZ 1 sometimes required hours upon hours of exploration and searching for blueprints, which whilst fun at first quickly became boring. I have heard about a few complaints regarding the zombies in late-game, but as of the time of this review the developers are aware of the issues and I think there have been 4-5 balancing fixes so far just 3 days into early access.TL;DR:If you are a fan of space games: buy this now.If you are a fan of SPAZ 1 who wants to see something quite significantly different but still based loosely on SPAZ 1: buy this now.If you are a fan of SPAZ 1 who is expecting the sequel to be a new, improved version keeping most of the original ideas: watch some videos, read reviews and maybe wait a few months for a few changes before deciding whether to buy or not.TL;DR the TL;DR: if you have been following this game and like the direction of it buy now, if not wait, read and decide later.

								I loved the first game, this one is a far cry from being anywhere near as good. I get that they wanted to try new mechanics - and that's fantastic, I welcome that - but not changing the mechanics of the entire game. That's taking it a little far.SPAZ2 plays absolutely nothing like the original, has a much more difficult to understand UI - and you have to take your mothership (which is made up of lego-like segments) into every single battle, and grind like crazy to improve the parts. The smaller ships that accompany you act like drones, vaguely following your orders and not being very useful aside from giving the enemy a target other than your mothership to hit. I really enjoyed there being other AI captains in the game, and an area takeover mechanic, I though that was a nice tough, however I really disliked the system of moving an arrow around on-screen and the way you have to collect goons/scrap/rez. Only flying your actual ship whilst in battle was really disappointing, I liked being able to explore empty regions of space, with the risk of bounty hunters ambushing me at a moments notice, or zombies hatching and attacking me. Or even just going to a mining area and spending my time farming rez. The biggest let down in this game for me is the control system - flying your ship from a third person perspective and being able to push a button to ""auto-attack"" the enemy is a huge no no. Firstly, it's incredibly slow and difficult to maneuver at the lower levels (I imagine it gets better the later you get, but the game was so terrible I requested a refund and didn't want to wait to find out). The biggest thing that lost me was the third person perspective, I've already mentioned this, and you CAN pilot your ship from a top-down perspective like in SPAZ, but it doesn't feel the same, and it feels like this was an afterthought as you can't really play effectively in this perspective.My recommendation for anybody that was a fan of SPAZ1 would be; watch the game and wait, hopefully the developers improve some of these frankly terrible mechanics and make the game better, it is still in early access after all. However.. I'm not holding up hope, In the meanwhile I'll continue to play SPAZ1 over and over, so that I can enjoy all the fantastic things missing from SPAZ2. If you're a newcomer to the series, I still don't think I could recommend this to you, I mean, without having played the first game, SPAZ2 might seem fun at first - but it's still incredibly grindy and difficult to play.

								I thought the new direction this game was going looked fun, but I had to force myself to play to even get to 6 hours played.Instead of the clever top down shooter with lots of customization, SPAZ 2 is any random 4X game without actually flying around, with some of the most generic combat I've ever played. That really sucks, coming from SPAZ 1 where combat was always interesting and fun. Every battle you warp in, the enemy is directly in front of you far away, they fly at you, you at them... the only difference is what fighters you have, how your ship is setup.The gimmick is the mothership construction, which you do through snap on parts. While kind of interesting, it just doesn't hold a candle to SPAZ 1's hangar bay and customizing all your ships by each hardpoint. Instead of switching around booster modules and weapons, you scroll through lists of snap on parts and study their stats... not fun.Heres to hoping a SPAZ 1.5 will be made; a true succesor to SPAZ 1.

								Get it now, extremely well polished.It seems the negative reviews are due to the game being different to SPAZ1. In my opinion a game should be judged on it's own merits not on a previous game. I think people are annoyed by feel of SPAZ2 rather than any actual bad gameplay, it's a great game.Although it feels different it is actually pretty similar, you have the starmap, you do things like improve your ship, trade and talk to captains. Time only passes when you move on the starmap (or in spaz1 it was measured by ""Jumps"") Then you pick a fight and you fight. There is a lot more to do in SPAZ2 than SPAZ1. I loved SPAZ1, it's one of my favourite games and I can see this game becoming one of my faves too, but I am not going to compare them in the way it seems quite a few people have done, that is not a review that is a comparison.

								If you expect SPAZ1 then do not buy SPAZ2. I have expected SPAZ2 because I loved SPAZ1, but SPAZ2 is not like SPAZ1. First, SPAZ1 is top view game. I still can choose top view mode on SPAZ2. But I can not play with top view mode. Because of the sight limitation of top view. I have to switch first person view aiming mode to aim. The enemy's shooting range overwhelms me. Second, I manipulate the arrow all the time except during combat. In SPAZ1, I teleport betweed the galaxy(or the planets). In SPAZ2, I manipulate the arrow icon with W,A,S,D keys. The arrow icon is my ship. This is so weired. Impressive thing is that constructing the ship is like Captain America. It is so customizeable.			"

								I've tried to like this game. I really did and I know how much efford went into it. But seriously, the combat system is absolutely not enjoyable. It's just not working. Even for a beta version this is rubbish (and you are saying it's basically finished...). Maybe I'm missing an important point, the key how to succeed in combat, but so far it was that I've been destroyed in every single combat situation I've been to. If there is a trick, how to do this, you should consider sharing or showing it to the player before they end up totally frustrated. God I loved SPAZ and was soo excited about SPAZ2, but this is a huge dissapointment for me.			"

								I puchased this game in Early Access, and then returned it.  I enjoy the first SPAZ game, and I understand that this one is different.  However, it felt like a shell of a game.  In the first mission, I could control the ship fine in the standard view, but when in overhead view (when you press ""C"" to zoom out and see your ship from above) the controls seemed random.  Also, I was not sure what to do... I just flew around... and flew around... and flew around... but never encountered anything than a few barrels.  At another point in the game when it allows you to add modules to your ship and such between levels, I could not easily figure out how to pickup and drop the modules onto my ship (not intuative... I just clicked and dragged and click left and right and such until something happened).  When I realized that I was getting frustrated with the game, I decided to  return it and purchase it again later when/if it becomes more polished (and, when multiplayer works -- a key reason I wanted the game).  I can see a lot of potential in this game.			"

If you then don't like SPAZ2, get a refund and then get SPAZ, cos SPAZ rocks.I've played lots of early access games and, whilst this is polished enough, it felt wrong, instantly. It's like being handed a shiny, happy, love-filled unicorn only to find it has had its delicious, rainbow-flavored icecream violently slurped from its butt by a mean-faced zombie pirate named Gary, who also left drool all over its tail.I willingly admit this review might be entirely due to my bitterness following my prolonged excitement of SPAZ2. I only bothered to catch up on the games progress this week and then I read the negative reviews this morning. I tried to stay positive, but it's the Phantom Menace all over again. I reserve the right to reverse my review after final release and many patches that turn it back into SPAZ.			"

								From second 1 this game has no desire to tell you how to play - and even less interest in actually allowing you to do so. After some four hours of play I still have yet to be able to stake even a small amount of the small sector of the universe I explored as my own - or even join another faction. Playing on the easiest difficulty setting will get you randomly killed by encounters two-to-four ""points"" above your own, despite the fact that the scaling system seems to easily go into the triple digits. Maybe this game gets way more fun later on, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥the first several hours are just an obnoxious, aimless grindfest that seem to expect you to want to play the game on its own merits, rather than to advance or progress or anything meaningful.

								Current (early access) implementation of game, and especially ship construction minigame exceptionally dull, boring and frustrating.It's fun to assemble your own ship and make it unique, BUT:1) It's fun only ONE time, after that one time you will be forced to waste your time instead of actually playing game.2) Dont ever think about playing hardcore, ever with unlimited resources, you will be forced to reassembly your ship BLOCK BY BLOCK every time you die.no blueprintsno automatic assembly3) Assembly... ever if you are faction leader and own entire galaxy, you will be forced to visit ""shops"" on every station by yourself and there is no guarantee that you will actually find ""Block X with Weapon Y"".There is no way to manufacture blocks you need self, ever if you own station.There is no way to change weapon on block.4) God damned ""radiant AI"" welcome to obvilion 2, as soon as you hit level 40 every idiot will wear ""daedric"" and you can't do anything about it.Galaxy level with you and you will never become actually powerful no matter how hard you try.5) Instant respawn of enemy captains, with all blocks and weapons, no matter is station have such weapons or not.You may waste two hours in order to get chainsaw beam weapon, but, every god damned captain will have one after level X.6) Arbitrary forced limits ever in sandbox mode.You are not ever allowed to trade on level 0 and MUST grind your first level before you can ever trade with stations!Making your own station require level 12, for no reason.Same for ship size.7) Some AI captains are criminals and will attack you, CONSTANTLY with INSTANT respawn and you can't do anything.There is no way to execute captain or put him to jail.Probably developers will fix issues related to assembly minigame and respawns, but, ""everything levels with you"" cannot be fixed and will not be fixed.There are no strong captains, there are no weak captains, everyone always exactly your own level, no exceptions.(you will notice this after level 20, or 20 minutes of gameplay, intially levels are 1-20 but as soon as you hit level 20 everything will follow you)There are many games that implement autoleveling of everything to keep player busy at all time, but in reality there are no reason of levels and grinding at all if it will not make you any stronger.level 1 - your damage 10, enemy hp 100level 10 your damage 50, enemy hp 500just neh...

								I loved the first Spaz, but I am having a very very hard time enjoying this one. Its gun to roam around freely and do what you want still, but I don't like the way they went about the new mother ship idea. I wish that you started the game with a new clockwork. The ship that made the game what it really is. Launching strike craft and support ships. But now you just have the little drones and such and its with your new lego style ship that can get parts blown off. It takes literally forever to save up for these modules and in one encounter before you can run, you lose half of your guns in the scrable to escape. Sadly I will not recomend this game in the state it is in now. I don't have much hope for it to feel more like Spaz 1 either. So sad :c			"

								A game with very little to do with its name sake.  SPAZ1 was a great action/arcade game, and had a wonderful sense of humor to boot.  This ""sequel"" is kinda a whole other beast.  Its been stripped of the promised multiplayer.  Leaving a rather dull single player game that revolves around creating your star ship out of random modules.  Its not very intriguing at all, and fans of the original should apporach this game as a whole new franchise.  The developers have updated the description since launch to warn people of such.  So its simply a too bad and ♥♥♥♥ you scenario for people that put their money up early due to how much they loved SPAZ1.			"

Early Access Review
								Imagine if the new Halo that came out was instead a top down resource management game.This ""Space Pirates and Zombies 2"" is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT game, and frankly, it sucks. So not only is it a bad game, the developers had tossed out all the things that made Space Pirates and Zombies a good game. At this point I would claim false advertising, but the Devs never promised anything. Looking at all the glowing reviews, I'm wondering what people are smoking.  So I'll list off the problems I'm having so far:1) Fake 3D battles. They're patting themselves on the back for not having top down view anymore, but all combat is done on a 2D plane in a 3D space. Result, it's much harder to get an idea of the battle, and it's much easier to miss your opponent.2) Pointless universe. The old game had exploration. This game is set up like a board game with sectors. You can easily explore the entire universe in your first few levels. 3) Pointless lore. Running around gathering ""Lore"", worthless pages of info about the universe that were rejected by Wikipedia. They give you nothing. They try to be funny, but are not. 4) The battles are terrible. It's extremely difficult to tell if someone is in range of your weapons. It's hard to tell if you're actually damaging them. No feedback for killing them either. At some point someone gets the last hit, and they slowly explode.5) Piracy. I keep on getting jumped by random AIs demanding my cargo. Too powerful to fight off. You can get into battle and then flee at best.6) Pointless ship design. What are these weapons I'm attaching to my ship? Are they good? I can't tell! I'll take them into combat and....I STILL CAN'T TELL. What the hell? Where did my very expensive weapon pod go? It was permanently destroyed? Who thought that was a good idea?!7) Resource gathering. There's metal, fuel, and people. You gather these from points in space that generate infinite amounts of these things. No real skill. 8) My crew is annoying. And unattractive. And can't be replaced.9) Side ships. Are they fighters? No. They're side ships! They can get blown up, and you can have extra, but those extras will never appear in battles for you. 10) Mining Missions. You versus several groups of miners, consisting of about 10 ships each. It's possible there's infinite waves. Who knows. Kills me every time for picking up small amounts of fuel.11) Bases that control a sector, but not really. Mostly they just sit there as trading posts.To sum, this is an incredibly weak indie game that's wearing the cloak of a far more enjoyable game. "

Early Access Review
								This game has a resource management layer that must be navigated in order to maintain your ship and get to the ship customization and combat layers that I find compelling. I wouldn't mind this if the resource management was  strategic, but it appears to be randomized on a large galaxy map and players are asked to fly around it picking up resources and finding engagements suitable to their threat level while upgrading their ship to increase their threat level. That seems like it should be fun, but there are a **ton** of other ships that are either AI or other players that are also nibbling up resources as soon as they are available and I found myself feeling rude for taking them - which I could get over, but I found it very difficult to find threat-appropriate challenges. Given how many positive reviews this is getting, I'm guessing there is a trick to it if you look up a tutorial or something, but I'm not that interested, and, again, I really don't like competing against other players in the resource-management layer. . .  it felt like Hungry Hungry Space Pirates and I was bored. YMMV.On top of all this, the narrative is poorly written with no introduction of the rather silly and funny crew for new players, way too much exposition at the front of the game that has no impact on the game's immediate story which again seems to be about Hungry Hungry Space Pirates. On the bright side, the quirky characters and narrative were a big part of the appeal of the previous game and they are back but they came off as just weird until I looked up the original game on Youtube to introduce myself to them again.

It is slow, clunky and eager to punish you with nothing to give you as a reward, UI is bad, controls are bad, ship design system is bad, combat is bad.

Not going to waste my time on this game if such basic control functionality is broken. Couldn't find any references or instructions.  Looks like it's set up for people with xbox controllers, but nobody else is worth supporting.EDIT: Several months later, decided to see if they've upgraded the controller functionality.  Still only supports xbox controllers.			"

								I'm going to clarify my review because a lot of people were not understanding.  No, I don't support this game I'm sorry.  The devs are nice people and they listen to the community.  They've listened to what everyone wanted from Space and Zombies 1 and added to SZ2.  Great group of people always willing to help.  Unfortunately, I don't like the game.  The concept is kinda broken.  It's Rebel Galaxy meats the RTS world.  The campaign drags and the story is boring.  You can't build your own starbase and conquer the unniverse until you're level 12. By that time, the grid is full and you have to attack stations to grab a piece of the grid for yourself.  (There's a part in the campaign that tells you to join a faction and build a base.  I can confirm that you need to be level 12 in single player but in campaign it's part of the missions before level 12).  Regardless, you can't build under your name, must be the faction you are with.I don't like how the ships are being built.  I feel like I'm limited to what I can do with my ship.  Like the devs said themselves, it's a weird game and unique of it's kind.   I'm sorry, I don't like the game and I don't think it's fun for me.  Is it worth a shot to try it?  Sure it is, a lot of you will like it.  For me, it's not balance at all in single player.ProsSmooth gameCan't seem to find bugsColorful nice graphicsConsnot balanced wellPoor UI systempoor ship customizationSome of the things I can think of.  Please don't grill me or be mad at me.  My opinion and how I feel about this game.  Way too early to buy.			"

								How should I sum this up? Other than the fact that this game isn't 3D in any meaningful way. It only has 3D graphics.THEY LIED ABOUT SHIP CUSTOMIZATION!Well, not really, but to say this game has ship customization is like saying you have character customization in a traditional RPG game. Yes you can swap out different pieces of armor, I mean hulls, but that's all there is to it. What do I mean by that? get this:-Weapons can only fire at the direction they are pointing, but you can only point them to the left or right anyway so there's no difference. The most you can do with this mechanic is point all your best weapons to the right and face your enemes with your right side. You can't rotate your weapons in any way, you can't even place them at different locations. It doesn't matter how you build your ship, you only get these three (or more when you level up) slots on both sides where you attach the weapons.-You can't choose to have bigger more powerful weapons or smaller lighter weapons. Because all weapons are the same size.-You can't choose to have less weapons but faster. Yes you can go faster by not mounting any weapons, but there is zero advantage in doing that. You always have to fill your slots with weapons, and I think they all weigh the same as well.-You can't choose to have stronger shields at different locations. Your shield strength is simply a stat you can improve with better parts.-Parts don't have special effects other than stat numbers. Like this one has got +5 energy capacity, and that one has +7. That's it.-You can't choose to sacrifice mobility by not placing maneuver thrusters. because there are no maneuver thrusters. You only get to attach your engine blocks, which, you guessed it, have stats that determin the movent of your ship. You also can't choose to have more or less thrusters because there are slots you can only populate with thrusters. So unless you want to be slower for no additional benifits. You have no other choice.-Your ship has one single health bar, part placement makes no difference to the durability of your ship. There are no armor parts either. Guess what, it's also just a stat each part can give you. -Your weapons are either lazers or misiles, they never miss. Unless you choose to shoot manually, and then miss. So speed is actually meaningless unless you just want to run away or chase people. You can't dodge anything.-To make money, there are fixed spots on the star map that just regenerates gold. You simply go there and collect the gold to buy parts. Exciting right? Of course you can also fight pirates and loot their gold. But you don't get nearly as much as the gold spawn points.This is probably the worst game on STEAM that has a positive rating. I don't understand how it managed to brainwash all these fans.This game also has horrible art direction. I mean yea it's an indi game, it's not the worst for indi games. Still prertty bad. You can't ever tell what the ship pieces to either, without reading the text description.			"

								Game was stated to be multiplayer when in first stages of development so I purchase a copy, Turns out they cant implement it but they did give me a refund,so the developers are pretty dedicated to customer service.But I cant give a possative review on that basis the game doesnt have what It was supposed to so I have to keep a neg review on single player side the game is great as was the first. My only hope is that if they make a third they make the full game multiplayer to cater for the people who was looking forward to that..			"

								A very short review based on a few hours playtime:It's the perfect sequal. It is similar enough to SPAZ1 that it feels like a successor, yet different enough that it's not merely a re-skinning of the original. It feel familiar, yet also new. And you don't have to have played through SPAZ1 to be able to enjoy the game. Having played through the original gives you added flavor and a sense of continuity, but you won't be at a disadvantage in gameplay if you haven't played the original, plus the Lore bonuses fill in the notable backstory details of SPAZ1.

								Update:So there have been a number of hotfixes which have added some control options and squashed the majority of CTDs, enough that I would now say its a worthwile purchase!Still looking forward to a bit more content, but if the original SPAZ is any indicator that will be forthcoming.Review after my first 6 Hours play:Awful controls, really unintuitive somehow, even after 6 hours I'm wrestling with them all the time, would be nice if they added more options.Lots of crashes to desktop, thankfully it auto saves though wish it did this slightly more offten whilst there are still so many CTD's.Joining a battle seems a litle bit pontless currently (this could change later in the game), whenever I join a fight with another NPC against a bandit, the bandit always dies before I get even halfway to weapons range.Prefer the old style tech tree and equipment, somehow just replacing parts, seems more limited.All that said I can already see it has a lot of potential, and Whilst I would hold off buying for the moment I think it will be a great game once its had a bit more bug squishing and polish.

								I really want to love this game. However, Some of the simple things are terribly overlooked. Like which button to hit to tractor your ship apart and add modules. Seriously, I tried every button on my keyboard. I tried multiple combinations.Well, found out from an online thread, then I saw the developers comment. I loved SPAZ 1, so I'm going to give this another go, I'll update this in the future when I've made my final determination.Update: Well, the devs do read the reviews, and change things accordingly. I understand the game is still currently in beta. I'm having some major problems with the game freezing my pc. I'm hoping this gets worked out as they start working out the kinks. All in all, solid privateer type game.			"

								Really fun little game. Maintains the best features from the franchise with dynamic and fun combat, customization, and good humour. Also keeps a lot of the elements from the previous game while adding plenty of new ones that make it feel unique and different. Looks very promising and is more than enjoyable in its current state of Early Access. Definitely reccomend to try if you enjoyed the first, and even if you haven't you can still have a lot of fun with this one.			"

Early Access Review
								I brought this game expecting a improved SZAP 1... What I got was a totally different game.As you can see from my hours, I thought that it would get better once I've sunk my teeth into the game somewhat.Sadly, that isn't what happened. By the time I reached around level 40, I was out of perks to pick. The perks in this game on each level up wasn't even 1/4 of how many there's in SPAZ.There's less weapons too.I am surpised that SPAZ2 is looking to be a flop. A flop that was five year in making. I feel bad for the devs. I can see how much effort they put into the game, the AI programming... But... The game just isn't fun.The game is in early access, yes, but the devs have made it clear that the single player side of the game is finished. Once the muiltplayer side of the game is also finished, the game will be out of early access. I'll add more to this review once I've beaten the game.Edit One:Well. I beat the game. If I had focused on just the quests, I would had probably beat the game less than ten hours in. My feelings about the game haven't changed, aside from me starting to think that the storyline is kinda of forced.It turns out that beyond level 40, you get perks affecting your armor, HP, shielding and weapon damage, starting at five percent bonus for each perks, and after you've gotten some of those perks, they drop down to 3 percent bonus each.Edit Two:Now that I've slept a bit on the game, I would give this game a thumb down if this game was supposed to be Space Pirates and Zombies 1.5, but it's not. It's a different game. From that view point, the game is a good game... Not a great game as Space Pirates and Zombies 1 is. It is fun enough, through, that the price is fair. As you can see from my total playtime, I've gotten a good bang of fun for my bucks. I was interested enough to keep on playing, even after bashing the game. I changed my rating from a thumb down to a thumb up. The game could be better, but.... Even so, it is still a good game.			"

								Amazing game overall. Well worth the price. Quite addictive, fun and refreshing.Can't wait for multiplayer!I would just like to add some feedback - A button to deploy all your fighter crafts instantly instead of pressing tab and clicking each one would be nice - Collecting stockpile from your starbases becomes a pain later in the game. Maybe just have an option to send a courier bring it to you? (which can be robbed) - Reduce the extra cost of custom made parts. It's just too expensive - Make the maximum amount of subcores an even number. Easier for ship design. 14 or 16 is fine, although i'd like 20 - Although it is possible to control the fighter crafts directly, it's never worth doing. Fix this somehow?			"

								This game is nearly there. However some real sad things are present that make me say maybe you'll like it. ( edit: after playing the new sandbox mode I am changing to recommended )Graphics, sound, battles are very good except for the fact that enemy ships seem to have small ship manufacturing plants on board their main ships. It seems an endless onslaught of missiles as you attempt to speed away from the enemy main ship(s). Your fingers are becoming numb by the time you finally kill all ( or mostly all ) of the intercepters, etc.This is not my idea of fun, or tactiful space combat. We should all fight on a level playing field, but we can only carry under 10 ( approx. - it has been awhile since I was that far into a game ). Beat me with your ability to program, and prove it with the AI you build into the enemy. Not some BS let them have more stuff to try to counter human intelligence.The only other snag is once you get your own base and begin to roll, the enemy just become battering ram targets, with your ship as a ram. There's very little actual 'dog fighting' involved.I think it will be great fun when the devs get where they want to go, but it has been slow. Still, with over 150 hours in the game I have gotten my investment out of it plus dividends.			"

								Space Pirates And Zombies was one of the 1st games I bough and played for many hours. I recently got Space Pirates And Zombies 2 which I think is fantastic game play from the 1st one. The Battles make the game worth playing and being able to add parts and change ship layout is very cool designed. On the other hand I find some of the newer guns but under powered and would be even better if you could ""upgrade"" your weapons and sub cores self rather than buying and just replaing a lot but i do get that the way it been meant for trading mostly. Keep up the good work and I hope to see lots more developments coming out soon.Fan.			"

Early Access Review
								As an avid fan of the first SPAZ game, I had extremely high hopes for SPAZ 2. I was not disappointed. Much has changed from the original SPAZ, and many of the changes are great: Fantastic graphics, great sound effects and soundtrack, decent AI. I only have a few gripes with it.1) The Level Up SystemIn the first SPAZ, whenever you leveled up, you were given some research points and you could allocate them into different categories such as Engines, Missile, Shields, etc. In addition to making that system or weapon type better, certain items, like advanced shields or high tech weaponry, could not be installed onto your ships until you reached a specific milestone in the tech tree. For example, a high-damage cannon could not be used unless you had Cannons researched up to level 8. In SPAZ 2, they got rid of this level up system and exchanged it with a more streamlined, albeit less RPG-y system. In SPAZ 2, when you level up, you are given 3 choices (and sometimes a free perk is thrown in) that can be anywhere from getting 10% better prices in shops to increased weapon damage. Because of this, weapon types are no longer hidden behind a level wall (although one could argue that since some ship parts have level requirements there is still a sense of a level wall). In SPAZ 1 you could focus your points into only a few categories, or allocating a few points into many categories. Which could lead to a fleet of extremely fast ships with high powered lasers (if you focused on Engines and Lasers) or a fleet that is mixed, or jack-of-all-trades. There is less of a push for specialization in SPAZ 2, which leads into my second gripe: Weapons.2) WeaponsIn short, I don't feel as though there is enough difference between the weapon types. Lasers, cannons, and missiles all seem to do just about the same damage when compared to one another (and I have damage numbers enabled so I see how much damage I'm causing the enemy ships). In addition, I find it irritating that ship parts come with pre-installed weapons. I would like to see the modular parts such as the wings, noses, and engines be able to switch out the weapons that come with them.Aside from those, I do believe this is a phenomenal game. The gameplay is fun and fast paced, and the story is just as intriguing (and has just as much funny dialogue) as SPAZ 1. I do hope that, as this game evolves and continues to be worked on, that things such as side quests will be added. But for being built by 2 guys, this game is amazing. Rating: 8.7/10			"

								This is honestly not a successor to SPAZ...but honestly it opens up a world that far surpasses it.  No more do I fell like a simple space pirate robbing and stealing forever.  But rather I have the option to do that forever...in reality.  You go from space pirate trying to get rich.  To an honest to god warlord.  You can legit conquer the sector if you wanted.  And I love that.  This may not feel as wide spread as SPAZ.  But honestly?  I enjoy it.  It may not be perfect.  But it doesn't mean it's not really good right now.  That and it's in early access.  And already am I having a lot of fun with it.  All we need is more depth and maybe more maps and the ability to mod this.  Then we can have a game that'll last many many years with the community SPAZ has already acrude.			"

								Its fun for a few hours then becomes a repetative bore. For a game that was made to be replayed, it failed. You beat it once and you would have done almost everything. The first spaz had a lot more replayability. It has a lot of potential that seems wasted. No multiplayer, which was advertised at the beginning...After lots of updates this game is a lot more playable, now they are trying to implement multiplayer which sold me on this game in the first place, the devs have been doing an increadible job. If they keep this up I can see this game being game of the year material. Adding multiplayer will bump this game up a few more points. Although only 4 captains per encounter is still rather low. It runs a lot better as well.			"

								Everything that made me quit playing SPAZ 1 is gone.For early access this game feels whole already.   It's extremely fun, enjoyable and I feel in the action with the 3rd Person flight feel.  I wish the world was larger.  I wish you could maneuver 3 deimensionally during battle.  I can't wait for more content.  It's extremely fun, once I bought it I couldn't stop until I beat it.  Thanks Devs, you are making an awesome game.			"

								Its fun for a few hours then becomes a repetative bore. For a game that was made to be replayed, it failed. You beat it once and you would have done almost everything. The first spaz had a lot more replayability. It has a lot of potential that seems wasted. No multiplayer, which was advertised at the beginning...After lots of updates this game is a lot more playable, now they are trying to implement multiplayer which sold me on this game in the first place, the devs have been doing an increadible job. If they keep this up I can see this game being game of the year material. Adding multiplayer will bump this game up a few more points. Although only 4 captains per encounter is still rather low. It runs a lot better as well.			"

								Space Pirates And Zombies was one of the 1st games I bough and played for many hours. I recently got Space Pirates And Zombies 2 which I think is fantastic game play from the 1st one. The Battles make the game worth playing and being able to add parts and change ship layout is very cool designed. On the other hand I find some of the newer guns but under powered and would be even better if you could ""upgrade"" your weapons and sub cores self rather than buying and just replaing a lot but i do get that the way it been meant for trading mostly. Keep up the good work and I hope to see lots more developments coming out soon.Fan.			"

								Awesome follow up to the first game. Takes some getting used to but it makes it a new game with a similar premise. A good refreshing of what worked with a lot of new game play.			"

								Fun game.Its a lightweight strategy/space combat game. Not super deep strategy wise but fun enough and the game has personality. Graphics are good. I certainly think the game is worth the price.			"

Early Access Review
								Quite different than the original SPAZ, but in a good way. Still has the charm from the original but with expanded gameplay and less outright ""build you ship this way or get wrecked 3/4 of the way in"". With the recently added fighter changes, I have very few criticisms for this game especially if you enjoyed the original. I still miss the 2D top-down perspective a little, though.			"

Early Access Review
								8.5 / 10I have played 36 hours now, which includes a playthrough of the story and a different game mode. The game plays as a real-time strategy with a ton of creative strategies for the player to try out. This 'sequel' takes a ton of sucessful elements from the first game and adds on a more player interactive battle style, and a very cute overworld system. The trading system of interacting with starbases and trying to appease their owners, and haggle the best prices is very entertaining and gives many difficult decisions when choosing whether to anger them for immediate benefits or befriend them for long-term benefits.One large criticism I have that prevents me from being fully positive about this game is the leveling system. You fight and gain exp and level up gaining perks. The perks are the main difference between a lvl 1 and a lvl 40, with nearly triple of every stat from perks alone. After level 40, levels mean nothing and actually hurt you more than help you. This is because the AI gains levels according to YOUR level. They get free level ups if you advance too quickly, so if you play well and hit level 60 in 1 hour, you still wont be the top dog on the map. It feels silly to play for 20hours in a campaign and still have someone in front of you.That being said, the game is very replayable, tons of variables that you can change in the game setup to vary your gameplay. Tons of different and inventive weapons to try out. Plus little secret strats to find out for the returning veterans.			"

								I played SPAZ 1 and enjoyed it greatly, I really had my hopes up for its sequel and while there are a great many improvements overall, I am left with the feeling that MINMAX has made it unduly complicated.  SPAZ was a great top down shooter, and had a very amusing storyling and SPAZ 2 still has the possibility to become better, but I can't say that I can recommend SPAZ 2 as it stands.5/10Above you will find my first review, as you can tell, I was not overly impressed.  However as I have continued to play it and get use to how the new game works, I find it very fun and engaging.  As long as they keep updating it and keeping up the good work, I see this game gaining groung on the popularity of SPaZ and possibly surpassing it.8/10			"

								This is honestly not a successor to SPAZ...but honestly it opens up a world that far surpasses it.  No more do I fell like a simple space pirate robbing and stealing forever.  But rather I have the option to do that forever...in reality.  You go from space pirate trying to get rich.  To an honest to god warlord.  You can legit conquer the sector if you wanted.  And I love that.  This may not feel as wide spread as SPAZ.  But honestly?  I enjoy it.  It may not be perfect.  But it doesn't mean it's not really good right now.  That and it's in early access.  And already am I having a lot of fun with it.  All we need is more depth and maybe more maps and the ability to mod this.  Then we can have a game that'll last many many years with the community SPAZ has already acrude.			"

								Space Pirates and Zombies 2 is a game that needs some polish, and has some disappointing flaws, but is a blast to play when you get down to it.  My biggest complaint with the game is that I never felt like a pirate.  In a world where every other character is a pirate too, you lose some of that swashbuckling fun.			"

								I would consider this a wonderful game. Probably the biggest, even only, issue, is that the developers had to give up on multiplayer. However, this does not reflect the game's quality. This game looks amazing on quality pc's and involves a great spectrum of different gameplay. If you love pure action, enjoy some ship battles. If you want to take the entire universe over, you can. There really are a lot of different things you can do. I would most certainly recommend this game to anyone looking for a great single player experience.			"
